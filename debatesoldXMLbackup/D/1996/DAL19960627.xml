      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 7 &mdash; Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I wish to make the following announcement.  The situation concerning the murder, on the order of people involved in organised crime, of a journalist is a grave threat to our democracy and to the standard of life which this State has upheld for more than 75 years.  It raises the spectre of organised crime dominating our society in the appalling way that it had come to dominate some other societies in Europe until action was taken.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of yesterday's horrific murder I want to make the following points.  The full resources of the State are being applied to finding and bringing to justice those who committed this murder and those who inspired or directed it.  Nobody is untouchable and the Government is absolutely determined that whoever ordered this murder will sooner or later &mdash; and I hope sooner &mdash; face charges in our courts.  Let me repeat, nobody is untouchable, nobody who orders a crime in a democratic society can be allowed to be untouchable and nobody will be allowed to be untouchable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> The Government is intensifying its efforts to change administrative and legal procedures in our State so that we can deal more effectively than we have been able to deal to date with organised crime.  Organised crime is a different phenomenon qualitatively from the type of crime we have had to deal with in the past.  It needs a qualitative change in the way we do our business.  I do not pretend that the Government or any party or group in this House has, in the immediate aftermath of this truly appalling event, the knowledge of all the appropriate answers in terms of the administrative changes that can work and the legal changes that are necessary. I am determined that together all of us in this House will find those answers.  To ensure the maximum national focus on finding those answers in a deliberate, careful but also urgent way, I wish to announce that it is the Government's proposal that the Dáil shall be recalled for a full day's sitting on Thursday, 25 July to debate the issue of organised crime.  The Government will have its proposals to make on that matter on that occasion and we will be seeking proposals from all interests in society, including all parties in this House. There is a series of proposals currently in preparation which I expect will be ready for that debate.  I have no sense that the proposals we will bring forward will represent the final or last word on the matters society needs to bring to bear on this issue.  It is important, therefore, that there should be a full debate when all parties and Members who wish to do so will have an opportunity to put forward their proposals, all of which will be considered carefully and seriously in addition to the proposals that will be brought forward by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Ahern wishes to raise an issue and that he should obviously speak before me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to raise the matter to which the Taoiseach referred and was not aware he intended to make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the urgency of the matter.  The decision was taken comparatively recently and there was no time to communicate with anybody. I believed the Deputy would be raising the matter and wanted to be able to respond to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with that and I am glad the Taoiseach raised the matter.  When I spoke to him yesterday evening after a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench I stated that if there were any measures he felt were desirable or necessary &mdash; there are many such measures &mdash; we would co-operate fully.  I have no argument, therefore, with anything he said.  We will co-operate in the debate.</P>
      <P>This was one of the worst murders ever committed in the history of the State, certainly in my lifetime.  It involved the taking out by criminal elements of a leading journalist who was trying to practise the right of freedom of speech.  It was a most appalling act.  I extend my sympathy to my good friends, the Guerin family, and all journalists, not only in Independent Newspapers but throughout the country who are trying to do a similar job and report on day to day life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach will recall, a number of Ministers spoke to me on 29 May when I referred in the House, following another murder, to the appalling crimes committed in recent years.  I referred in <Col N="1740" /> particular to the contract killings in this city and other parts of the country of drug barons and those involved in organised crime of which there have been too many.  Veronica Guerin set about trying to give the people an insight into who was behind them.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we need one month to consider what we should do about this.  Not to make too strong a political point, the anti-crime record is a shambles.  I have been highlighting this issue for a long time and others have been doing likewise.  People were threatened that if they refused to get out of their houses they would be burned out.  Others were told that if they did not get out of the country members of their families would be affected.  Those who did not play ball with these barons and criminals were taken out.  It took a journalist, a person we all knew, to shock us and make us see what we were up against.</P>
    <P>There was an easy feeling throughout the country that the people who were taken out while sitting on bar stools might have been involved in crime and perhaps deserved it, but I have never held that view.  I raised the issue following each of the last four murders.  It continues unabated.  There has been a genuine sense of fear for a very long time, greater or lesser depending on one's address.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to consult over the weekend &mdash; I accept he cannot do so today &mdash; the Attorney General's Office, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Department of Justice which I am sure has many Bills at various stages of preparation and consideration.  We need to act quickly.  We owe Veronica Guerin, her family and colleagues no less.  We should stop getting caught up in the niceties of the law.</P>
    <P>For a number of years we have been asking whether we are prepared to continue to tolerate the unhindered existence in society of people who have accumulated vast and unexplained wealth through criminal activity and have called on the Revenue Commissioners to stop them.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1741" /> like many others in the House, I have had to deal with these people in my political life.  I admire those who have spoken against them but the criminals are clearly winning the battle.</P>
    <P>In co-operating I ask the Taoiseach to consider bringing legislation forward on this one issue.  It will not solve everything but it will show to ordinary people who watch those with no jobs buy houses on Howth Head worth £350,000 that we are serious.  Others have bought derelict sites on which to build apartments. We know most of them and some of the people associated or connected with them.  The Garda Síochána tells the Minister for Justice every day about their activities.  I am sure she knows their faces from the photographs taken and videos made over several years recording their activities.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach consider bringing legislation forward?  The Fianna Fáil Party has been working long and hard on the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996, which we tried to complete overnight and will complete as soon as our legal people report back to our spokesperson, Deputy John O'Donoghue, later today. I ask the Taoiseach to take either that Bill or his own Bill next week.  In memory of Veronica Guerin we should not wait until the debate on 25 July.  We should pass a meaningful and tough Bill next week to freeze the assets of drug barons.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act deals with the confiscation of assets in transit.  I supported that legislation at the time because I believed it would be of some use but it is not when it comes to houses, property and sites.  We need a strong Bill.  I ask the Taoiseach, therefore, to support our Bill.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach also consider setting up, with the support of the Opposition, a special Garda task force to deal with organised crime in this city?  Many groups were broken up in the past.  The ordinary garda cannot deal with this type of crime, the threats and intimidation. I respectfully suggest that we do not need one month in which to do this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> This is not the first time I raised this issue.  I tried to raise it before.  I have spoken to a number of Ministers whom I appreciate care as I do, because they see what is happening.  We either start today in the memory of Veronica Guerin to win it back for the ordinary people or we are a meaningless institution. We must stand up and do something despite the fears that everybody has.  If we do not, we are wasting our time.  I ask Taoiseach to co-operate with us in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for what he said.  The matters he raised the disposal of assets and the ability of people to accumulate essentially untouchable assets from crime, are very serious.  I had a discussion with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners last night about this matter. Two weeks ago the Government, independent of this event, commissioned a joint report from a task force to be available on 18 July on the question of the extra powers needed to pursue assets being accumulated by people involved in organised crime.</P>
      <P>It is important that any legislation we enact in regard to this matter works. Legislation must work in the courts subsequently. The Government is determined to have legislation on that matter that will work.  It is on precisely the issue raised by Deputy Ahern that the Government commissioned the report to be ready on 18 July.  This was decided before yesterday's events.  We expect to be able to report to the Dáil on 25 July. If legislation is necessary and can be prepared in the time available it will be taken on 25 July.  This will not be a mere debate.  Concrete proposals will be available from Government on that day to be considered by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special task force will not just involve the Garda but will involve all the organs of State which have information about the accumulation by individuals of money which might be derived from crime.  A task force has already been established for that purpose and will present its first report to <Col N="1743" /> the Government on 18 July which report will be brought before this House on 25 July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I confirm that any measures the Government brings forward to deal with the escalating crime in our society will be supported.  I hope from now on we will not be accused of hyping the crime issue, as has happened so often in recent times.  The Taoiseach might forgive me if I am somewhat cynical this morning.  We have had debates, task forces and reports in this area and, as in many other areas, we are suffering from paralysis from analysis.</P>
      <P>I will tell the Taoiseach what needs to be done.  Drug trafficking legislation is to go to Report Stage in this House next week.  Earlier this week my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, moved an amendment to that Bill to restrict the right of silence.  The right to silence shields the godfathers of crime.  The House could change that law next week, just as it could have changed it two days ago. This is the third time in the life of this Dáil that this matter has come before the House.</P>
      <P>The bail laws could be changed.  The Taoiseach told me at the beginning of February that the Government would finalise its view on this issue in six weeks.  That six weeks was over on 11 March, yet almost four months later we still have no Government proposals.  We have legislation before the House dealing with defamation.  Veronica Guerin was on her way to meet defamation lawyers yesterday.  Defamation laws restrict a free press in our society and they too shield the godfathers of crime.  These are among the things we can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ordinary people find it impossible to understand when they see the godfathers of crime being described as country squires in the newspapers this morning.  We all know who they are, with their holiday homes, their fast cars and their yachts.  We have all had enough of this and it is time they were put down.  I appeal to the media in this <Col N="1744" /> respect.  Convicted criminals should not be made to look like victims and should not be portrayed to the public in the way a convicted person was portrayed this morning as some kind of victim and hero.  We have to be consistent and we have all a part to play.  The media as well as the Government and the Opposition have a part to play.  Tough measures are required during the current crisis and we require the support of the media to ensure that our democracy is protected because that is as much in their interests as it is in ours.</P>
    <P>I hope proposals are brought forward on 25 July but we could also bring some forward next week on the Report Stage of the drug trafficking legislation.  That Bill could be greatly improved, particularly in regard to the right to silence. If we saw a changed attitude from the Government next week we might begin to see that the life taken so needlessly yesterday may not have been in vain. Whether criminals are of the provo variety or of the drug baron variety, we have to be consistent, they must all be put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand Deputy Harney's feelings on this matter and her frustration.  We need tough legislation, but that legislation must work.  There is no point passing legislation which sounds tough but which does not work in the courts because sufficient time has not been taken to draft it.  I appreciate the Deputy's proposals and the thought behind them and I assure her that we will seek to put in place proposals that work.  We will take only as much time as is necessary in the matter to ensure that whatever proposals we bring forward are effective.  It is no disrespect to any Member of this House to say that the Government needs some time to consider the matter so as to ensure that any measures taken work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate what the Deputy said about the fact that there has been politically inspired crime in this country over the past 27 years.  To some extent those involved in organised crime have taken <Col N="1745" /> their example from politically motivated crime.  The methodology of the crime carried out on Veronica Guerin was developed by politically inspired organisations. The method of motor bike killing was one used frequently by subversive organistions in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we remove any glorification of violence in our society whether for political or other reasons.  It is not possible to say that certain types of violent activity are in one category of badness if they are politically motivated and in different and worse category of badness if they are motivated by simple considerations of greed.  They are equally bad regardless of their motivation.  The guns used in such crimes, whether they are controlled by politically inspired organisations or by organisations inspired solely by greed, need to be taken out of society.  That is a central political issue.</P>

      <P>I had no intimation whatsoever that this matter was being raised in this fashion this morning. We have had an announcement from the Taoiseach and in such circumstances such an announcement ought not to give rise to debate.  It has given rise to debate, however, and the Chair hesitated to intervene in any way in respect of the important issues involved. However, we must deal with this matter in a structured fashion.  I want an indication from the leaders of the various parties in the House, the Whips and the Taoiseach, that this matter will be discussed in a formal way at a fixed time which may well involve legislation.  I cannot permit a debate to ensue this morning in the unstructured way.  I ask Deputy Ahern not to persist in the matter now.  If we are to have this debate to which the Taoiseach has referred, let it be done in the normal way through the Taoiseach's office and the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said to Deputy Ahern that I regret time did not allow me to communicate with him about the matter.  when I said so I should have extended a similar regret in your regard.  I appreciate, Sir, that this puts you in a difficult situation and I accept full responsibility for what has transpired here this morning.  The contributions from the other side of the House on this matter at this time are useful not only for their content but for the sense of urgency in the House which they convey to the public.  While I appreciate this places you in a difficult position, the debate so far has been useful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to bring the debate back into order.  The Taoiseach has proposed a debate for 25 July that might include very little legislation.  That would mean any legislation we would discuss at that stage could not be enacted until October at the earliest and that is too far away.  Next week we will debate the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill and some regulations dealing with international co-operation unrelated to the domestic situation.  In the course of that debate will the Taoiseach consider examining the legislation I will present to him later today, which was intended for the next session?  This legislation was not prepared overnight, but over a long period and is now complete. Will the Taoiseach look at it at the weekend and perhaps we could suspend some of the issues next week, until 25 July, if necessary, to deal with all Stages of that legislation?  The goodwill of the Opposition would enable that otherwise we cannot pass a Bill until the autumn.  The signal from this House that we will have a talking shop in a month's time is the wrong one.  We have to show we have a coherent anti-crime strategy and we in Opposition are endeavouring to assist the Government to do that.  To wait for a month is not the answer.  I beg <Col N="1747" /> the Taoiseach to listen, to examine our legislation and to enact it next week with whatever amendments the State Solicitor, the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice or other advisers at the Taoiseach's disposal may suggest. Our Bill was drafted by voluntary workers but it is a well thought out one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that very carefully.  The only reservation I have is that we want legislation that is not only well intended but also that actually works.  Some time may be required to ensure that is the case and that it will work practically within the terms of our Constitution.  That is the only reservation I would enter as to the time availability, but I fully take on board all the other points the Deputy has made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have announced the Government's intention which will take the form of a motion on the Adjournment of the Dáil for a debate on 25 July. I will announce the intention in the appropriate form for a recall of the Dáil on that day for that purpose.  Obviously next week's business will now be considered by the Whips and we will look at the proposals made by the Opposition in the context of the business being considered for next week. Obviously at this juncture we have an Order of Business before us which concerns item No. 7.  It is necessary to take note that what is being proposed is the way in which we intend to proceed.  I was simply announcing this morning an intention to recall the Dáil.  That might, in the normal course of events, have been announced on Friday of next <Col N="1748" /> week.  In view of the concerns expressed in this House I felt it was necessary to make this announcement earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have intimated to the House that I am not prepared to permit of any further debate on this matter now.

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 28 on the Order Paper is before the House and is a Bill relevant to the difficulties being discussed here.  Given that reasonable amendments tabled to this Bill were voted down by the Government, will the Taoiseach given an undertaking that they will be reconsidered by the Government before Report Stage on Wednesday next?  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill is directly relevant to the issue under discussion.  Will the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach consider acceptance of those amendments &mdash; relating to the right to silence and the refusal of temporary release to convicted drug traffickers &mdash; which were rejected out of hand earlier this week and last week by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney has already raised that point.  I have already indicated my only concern in this area is to ensure that the legislation we enact is not only right but will work within the Constitution which confers rights on those who are accused and on people generally.  We have to ensure we do not pass legislation that simply does not work because of conflict in that area unless we have indentified and removed the conflict.  Subject only to those necessary considerations, the amendments the Deputy has put forward will be considered over the weekend to see what can be done in that regard subject to the constraints.  In any event, any matter not dealt with in the next week can be brought forward for discussion in the <Col N="1749" /> special debate on this issue when that occurs at the end of the month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We will present our Bill later today and I ask the Taoiseach to examine it.  The Taoiseach will recall that about ten years ago in relation to what was suspected as IRA money, a Bill was introduced overnight dealing with the confiscation of assets in a certain bank account.  The legislation we have drafted or legislation which the Department of Justice would draft could be debated.  Next week, during the additional time, as the hours will be long in any event.  Members will stay late, as they have been staying, to put that Bill through &mdash; either the Fianna Fáil Bill or a Government Bill.  It is totally unnecessary to wait until the end of July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in Government at the time that legislation was introduced. While it was introduced overnight I assure the House it was not prepared overnight.  That legislation was considered by the Government over a considerable period and was, with the co-operation of the then Opposition, introduced and put through overnight. The drafting was careful and had taken considerable time and as a result of its being adequately prepared it worked. While I have no wish to reflect on any proposals from the Opposition that I have not yet seen &mdash; obviously I would prefer to see them and have them examined before entering into any commitments in the matter as in this we have a common objective &mdash; we want legislation that not only is right but is sufficiently carefully drafted so that it works and has the effect of putting the criminals behind bars and their assets out of their control.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, deals specifically with drug traffickers.  Next week the House will have the opportunity to discuss a motion pursuant to section 46 (6) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, whereby regulations on international co-operation regarding confiscation of assets will be discussed.  In that context will the Taoiseach consider taking in tandem with that, the Bill referred to by the leader of Fianna Fáil which would provide for the freezing of assets in the course of a criminal investigation where they are the suspected proceeds of organised crime, because that is what is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We already have powers in place to deal with the confiscation of assets accumulated from drug dealings and I understand successful court proceedings have taken place under this legislation in the past two or three days. I discussed this matter with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners last night who informed me that a successful court action had taken place in the past 24 to 48 hours and that the existing powers were seen to work more effectively than was previously thought possible. We propose to introduce legislation next week that will enable transboundary co-operation on this matter.  A particularly ominous aspect of yesterday's crime is the suggestion that the assassins came from another jurisdiction, which emphasises the need to be able to co-operate on an international basis in the battle against crime.  Unfortunately, the criminals are well able to co-operate on an international basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I informed Deputy Ahern, we will examine the suggestions made by the Deputy's party when we receive them and I appreciate that there is no delay on his part in making them available to us.  At this stage I cannot give an undertaking as to when they might be taken, but I assure the House that a major debate on this matter will take place on 25 July.  I invite those inside and outside the House to focus their attention on <Col N="1751" /> the proposals that can best be put into effect in the meantime so that we can work together to defend our democracy against the threat of organised crime.  A similar threat exists in all major democracies in Europe, but unfortunately the assassination of a journalist yesterday makes this country almost unique in a terrible way.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to take this legislation sooner.  In the light of public outrage a time lapse of a month is unacceptable.  I understand that the legislation must work and that it is important not to rush it, but it is also important not to allow two laws develop here.  A month is a long time to wait in the circumstances.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to deal with the legislation sooner.  If this democracy worked properly, Veronica Guerin would be alive and local authorities would be holding elections today, five years after the last elections were held.  Legislation on crime must be dealt with much sooner than 25 July.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to consider taking it at an earlier date.</P>

      <P>The suggestion was implicit in the Taoiseach's remarks to Deputies Harney and O'Donnell that some of the proposals we have made three times during the lifetime of this Dáil have not been thought out or tried. They were based on a 1973 report of the Criminal Law Review Committee in Britain and have been practised and operated in Northern Ireland with effect.  They are workable, tried and well thought out proposals and it is about time the Government applied its mind to deciding whether to operate them here.  The right to silence is a shield for those who ignore and tramp down our law and that matter must be addressed now.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that there are greater restrictions on the right to silence in Northern Ireland than here.  Within this island <Col N="1752" /> there is a model of a more restricted right to silence which can be examined. In the time available to me I was unable to examine the amendments to which the Deputy referred, but I have assured his party leader and spokesperson on justice that we will carefully consider the proposals his party have put forward. Nothing I have said should be construed as a reflection on the professionalism of the Deputy or any member of his party who prepared those amendments.</P>

      <P>This debate reflects the revulsion felt throughout the country at the cold blooded murder of Veronica Guerin yesterday.  I would be reluctant to use the word &ldquo;assassins&rdquo; because it glorifies them.  They are cold blooded murderers.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to accept the proposals put forward by our party leader and spokesperson.</P>
      <P>Ordinary people are afraid in their homes.  It is ironic that on Tuesday night four thugs broke into the home of David Lanigan in Cloghran, the townland where Veronica Guerin lived, beat him up and stole £300 and a mobile telephone. People want to feel safe and secure in their homes.  In the package the Government proposes to bring forward, will it consider the safety of ordinary citizens in their homes as well as organised crime and the attack on our democracy which was reflected in the murder of Veronica Guerin?  This is a broad issue.  It is ironic that a man should have been attacked in his home in the townland where Veronica Guerin lived on the night before she was murdered.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke is correct. Attacks on people in their homes, which, in the normal course of events might not be seen as part of organised crime, directly flow from the activities of organised crime.  In many cases attacks on people in their homes are carried out to feed a drug habit which, in turn, was created through the activities of organised crime.  There is a direct continuous connection between what appears as minor and major crime.  They are part of the one phenomenon with which we must deal.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for your forbearance in dealing with this matter this morning.  Outrageous crimes have taken place in the past couple of weeks. I recognise the Taoiseach's concern to ensure the law enacted works.  To guarantee that, will he ensure that a reference confirming its constitutional validity is put to the Supreme Court immediately following its enactment? Individuals' rights will be infringed as a result of the enactment of tougher legislation in the interests of society.  Will the Taoiseach ensure the legislation is not open to constitutional challenge so that those who have the powers to implement the law can do so with confidence.</P>

The Government proposals should be prepared and put before the House tomorrow week and the Dáil should be recalled to put through the legislation which emanates from that debate.  The people have had enough prevarication,delay, debates, reports, committees and <Col N="1754" /> discussions.  They want action.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to consider this request in the spirit in which it is made.  We will be amenable to a recall of the Dáil during the summer recess to put through any necessary legislative proposals which emanate from a debate on Friday week.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the House, approximately two weeks ago the Cabinet asked all the relevant organs of the State which have information about those involved in organised crime and drug trafficking to meet, with a deadline of 18 July, to prepare proposals for changes in legislation and improvements in administrative procedures. Various organisations of the State are working to that deadline at present.  It is reasonable to see if it can be shortened and I will do so.  It is important that a deadline has been set for a number of organisations which need to co-operate, including the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, to name but a few.  Nothing I have said excludes acceptance of the Deputy's proposal.  If his proposal can be accepted, it will be. At this point I am not able to do so because I am not certain if the legislation or the proposals will be in a form which we are sure will work but if they are, we will proceed as the Deputy suggested.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's debate is the last stretch of a long road which began in January 1993. On a day such as today, it is right to record that this Bill will remedy a deficiency in our law, and to some extent in our recognition of social reality, that has been persistent and visible for many years.  Many previous Governments, for whatever reason, did <Col N="1755" /> not address this issue.  No previous Government was able to see the issue through.  I point out this fact not to criticise others but simply to underline how gratified I am that it fell to this Government, and to me as the responsible Minister, to bring this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>It is not our business today to refight the referendum campaign.  However, I want to recall one point of principle which, as I said Second Stage of the Constitutional Amendment Bill last year, goes to the very heart of this debate.  This Bill is about the welfare of tens of thousands of citizens whose lives are blighted by marriage breakdown and who remain married in the insistent eye of the law.  It will enable them to put their lives in order at last and to remarry if they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have recently described this Bill as a sort of last hurrah for a so-called liberal agenda, which today's debate is supposed to bring to a close.  I regard this as superficial.  As far as I am concerned there is no liberal agenda.  Rather, there is a complex and changing set of social problems, each of which has to be addressed on its own merits.  The Government put forward the referendum proposal, and now puts forward this Bill, as a way of dealing with a significant issue which has an important impact on the lives of many people.</P>
    <P>The process which the Government embarked on in January 1993 was at times fraught and difficult, and I am very grateful to colleagues on all sides of the House who were supportive in this task, as were all those outside the House who played their part, and to my officials for their dedicated and professional assistance.</P>
    <P>To those who took the other view, I would say that their reassurance is that there will be no easy or quick divorce. There will be no divorce for marriages in difficulty.  There will be divorce only for marriages that are irretrievably at an end.  The reassurance is written in the Constitution and it is reflected in this <Col N="1756" /> Bill.  The Government will continue its strong support for the family.  We bring this Bill before the House, not in isolation, but in the context of very major improvements in family laws and services in recent years.</P>
    <P>I do not expect, and I believe that the public would not accept, any suggestion that this debate should become a competition to see which side of the House is more pro-family than the next.  It would be appropriate for every member of the House to recall that a draft of this Bill, formally prepared by the parliamentary draftsman, was published and available to the people in advance of the referendum, in the Government paper, <i>The Right to Remarry</i>.  That draft Bill was one of the basic supporting documents on which the Government sought a yes vote.  It is that Bill, with merely some minor and technical amendments, which is before the House today.</P>
    <P>The absolute prohibition on divorce which has stood for almost 60 years is no more.  It was harsh, unbending and uncaring towards many persons who have experienced irreconcilable differences in marriage.  It brought the law into disrepute because it was unable to address properly the position of those tens of thousands of persons whose marriage had ended, many of whom had entered second relationships and wished to remarry.  There are some who would prefer to see the prohibition retained and would wish that enactment of the Bill was not possible.  I appreciate their concerns but I hope that in time many people will come to terms with the fact that our law on divorce and the right to remarry gives legal options which must be available to members of society, as is the case in other jurisdictions throughout the world, many of which have a strong family ethos and cultural traditions not unlike our own.</P>
    <P>Because divorce is an end result of marriage breakdown I understand that some people may feel uncomfortable with its reality but I understand more that everyone feels uncomfortable with marriage breakdown.  It is marriage breakdown that causes the hurt not only <Col N="1757" /> for the spouses, but those related to them, those who know them and those who know of them.  The truth is that society does not salute divorce but it must, through its laws, address the problem of marriage breakdown comprehensively.</P>
    <P>The wealth of reform in our family laws in the past decade has been of staggering proportions compared to previous decades since the foundation of the State.  In the past decade 18 Bills on the subject of family law have passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas under various Governments.  No one can say that the record of this House does not demonstrate that family law has not been a priority.  The various measures have been of very great significance in their own right, but if we were to single out measures which laid foundations for divorce legislation it was the 1989 judicial separation legislation, the 1992 White Paper on Marital Breakdown and the Family Law Act, 1995.  The support of both Houses for and the dignified way they debated the Government's proposal for the referendum contained in the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1995, was a significant turning point. The various reforms in the family law area have meant that all fundamental issues arising on marriage breakdown are now addressed or being addressed in one form or another through legislation and administrative arrangements.</P>
    <P>The House will be familiar with other recent associated measures, apart from the Family Law Act, 1995, which I promoted in the run up to the referendum such as the Maintenance Act, 1994 the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 and the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.  In addition, there has been the major expansion in resources for civil legal aid, family mediation and counselling services. Other Ministers have been responsible for other important measures in the social welfare and child care area as well as the courts service.  Apart from life itself, there is nothing more fundamental than the family and its protection <Col N="1758" /> and support.  Our laws and support services demonstrate that and will continue to be reviewed and updated as necessary by this Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill is, in many respects, the culmination of a decade of work in the family law area.  Its publication, made possible by the result of the referendum, addresses the major jurisdictional and legal issues which will arise in our courts concerning the status of marriage and the duties and responsibilities of the spouses, as between themselves and their children.  The Government is proud to be associated with this legislation which is modern in its approach and is intended to give our courts allnecessary power to settle disputes, with due regard for the administration of justice, in complex social and legal matters concerning the family.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding to deal with the more important aspects of the Bill I should like to take this opportunity to mention the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the Hanafin case.  I, of course, welcome that judgment which has had the effect of clearing the way for publication of the Bill.  A few points in the judgment which I should like to mention are the following.  A number of the judges made clear that, having regard to two previous judgments of the High Court, the Government was justified in considering that the use of public funds on the advertising campaign was within its constitutional rights. it was noted also by some of the judges that the Government had without hesitation or prevarication dropped its advertising campaign immediately following the McKenna case.  The court emphasised that there was no suggestion in the case that the advertising material placed before the people by the Government was untrue.  These are important points in so far as the approach of the Government was concerned during the referendum campaign and I think it reasonable to make brief mention of them in the opening stages of debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>In line with what the people voted for, the main features of the Bill are contained in Part II which sets out the <Col N="1759" /> grounds on which a court may grant a decree of divorce.  These are as prescribed in the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, the relevant amendment of the Constitution contained therein being approved by the people in the referendum.  This Part of the Bill also contains safeguards to ensure that both parties are aware of alternatives to divorce proceedings and to assist reconciliation.  Part III enables the court to make various orders in support of spouses and dependent children following the granting of a decree of divorce.  The orders may relate to maintenance, lump sums, property, occupational pensions and to a spouse's interest in the other spouse's estate. Part IV contains amendments to the tax code relating to income tax and capital taxes &mdash; i.e. stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and probate tax &mdash; which will ensure that couples who are divorced will not be disadvantaged in terms of our tax code.  Part V includes various miscellaneous provisions relating to, for example, the courts' jurisdiction in divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the specific provisions of the Bill.  Sections 4 to 8 are key provisions regarding the obtaining of a decree of divorce.  Subsection (1) of section 4 details the circumstances in which a court may, in exercising the jurisdiction conferred by new Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution, grant decrees of divorce.  The section, as it must, replicates the terms of the constitutional amendment which was approved by the people in the 1995 referendum. In exercising its jurisdiction in relation to divorce, the court must be satisfied that each of three specific conditions has been fulfilled, namely, that at the date of the institution of the proceedings, the spouses have lived apart from one another for a period of, or periods amounting to, at lease four years during the previous five years; there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses, and such provision as the court considers proper <Col N="1760" /> having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the spouses and any dependent members of the family. These conditions have already been the subject of long and detailed debate in the House on the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  They have been voted on by the people.  They are enshrined as Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution and cannot, of course, be the subject of change other than on the basis of an amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 4 is of importance in relation to children.  It allows the court, upon granting a decree of divorce, to give directions regarding the welfare, custody of, or right of access to a child under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as if an application had been made under that Act.  The purpose of the subsection is to streamline court procedures in relation to children which can be invoked under the 1964 Act in divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 contain safeguards designed to ensure that parties to divorce proceedings are fully aware of the alternatives to such proceedings, including the availability of mediation to effect a separation or a divorce on a basis agreed between both parties.  The safeguards are also designed to assist attempts at reconciliation.  The solicitors for both parties will have an obligation in law to ensure that the provisions of these sections are complied with and will have to provide a certificate to the court to this effect at the time divorce proceedings are instituted.  It may be that even by the time the parties get to court they may be in a position to settle some of their differences.  In this context section 7 empowers the court to adjourn proceedings either to assist reconciliation or in order to facilitate both spouses in reaching agreement on some or all of the terms of a divorce settlement. The provisions in sections 5 and 6 are similar to those which apply in separation proceedings.  The purpose is to inform and encourage parties about options to settling disputes in court over <Col N="1761" /> matters that perhaps could be settled for the most part out of court with less cost, acrimony, resentment and bitterness and for the good of the parties concerned and their children.</P>
    <P>The effect of granting a decree of divorce by the court by virtue of section 8 of the Bill will be the dissolution of the marriage and each of the parties to a marriage that is so dissolved will thereby be in a position, if they so wish, to marry again.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, which runs from sections 9 to 26, assigns to the court extensive powers in divorce proceedings to make financial, property adjustment, pension adjustment and other ancillary orders in a way that is designed to do justice to both parties and to any dependent members of the family.  The provisions in section 9 deal with preliminary type orders that may be dealt with by the court.  They allow the court, before deciding on an application for a decree of divorce, to make various orders provided for under the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, namely, a safety order, a barring order, an interim barring order or a protection order and to make custody and access orders and orders for the protection of the family home and contents.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 are, in one form or another, concerned with the question of the maintenance of a spouse and dependent children.  Section 10 allows the court to make interim-type maintenance or lump sums payments pending the determination of an application for a decree of divorce.  Provision for interim lump sum payments is intended to cover cases where there may be hardship or where immediate bills have to be paid by a spouse.  Section 11 provides for the making of orders for periodical payments, secured periodical payments and lump sums for the support of a spouse or dependent children.  The lump sums may be ordered to be paid by instalments and to be secured.</P>
    <P>Subsection 6 of section 11 gives important powers to the courts to order attachment of earnings at the same time as maintenance is ordered to be paid. <Col N="1762" /> Before deciding to make such an attachment of earnings order the spouse who is to make the payments must be given an opportunity to make representations in relation to the matter.  The previous failure of the spouse to maintain the other spouse and any children would be an obvious consideration for the court to take into account.  The propose of the subsection is to reduce, where possible, the need for a dependent spouse to engage in subsequent court proceedings for enforcement of maintenance.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 are the provisions which allow the courts in divorce proceedings to redistribute property between spouses for the benefit of a spouse and any dependent children.  The word &ldquo;property&rdquo; in the Bill, as in the case of judicial separation legislation, is not confined to the family home.  It includes any form of property, the family home, a business, shares in a company and money in bank, post office or building society accounts.  Section 12 provides that the court may make the order for the transfer of property from one spouse to the other or to any dependent family member, an order for the settlement of property, an order to vary for the benefit of the other spouse or a dependent family member or both any ante-nuptial or post-nuptial settlement made on the spouses, or an order extinguishing or reducing the interest of either of the spouses under a settlement of property.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 it will be possible for the court to give one spouse the right to occupy the family home to the exclusion of the other spouse.  The right may be limited in duration.  It may, for example, apply for the duration of the occupant spouse's lifetime.  Alternatively, the court may direct the sale of the family home subject to such conditions as the court may think proper and provide for the apportionment of the sale proceeds between the spouses concerned.  In either case, the court will be required to take into consideration the need to provide proper and secure accommodation both for a spouse and for dependent family members.  Section <Col N="1763" /> 13 also allows the court in divorce proceedings to make certain orders under existing statutes including the Family Law Act, 1995, the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>To further ensure that adequate and reasonable provision can be made for a spouse and dependent children, section 14 enables the court to make an order for the assignment, in whole or in part, of a spouse's interest in a life insurance policy in favour of the other spouse or dependent family member or an order requiring a spouse to take out a life assurance policy in favour of the other spouse or dependent family member. These orders are designed to supplement or substitute for, where necessary, other orders in support of a dependent spouse and children.</P>
    <P>In the Family Law Act, 1995, I made provision for what should happen to occupational pensions in the context of judicial separation and where a foreign divorce is recognised in the State. Section 15 of the Bill makes similar provision where domestic divorce is concerned.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) allows the court, following the grant of a decree of divorce and on application to it by either of the spouses concerned, to make a pension adjustment order designating or &ldquo;ear-marking&rdquo; the whole or part of the retirement benefit of a spouse who is a member of a pension scheme for payment, <i>inter alia</i>, to a dependent spouse or to a person for the benefit of a dependent member of the family.  Such an order would, for example, have the effect of preserving for a dependent spouse an interest in the member spouse's pension benefit and the proportion of the pension benefit which would be paid to the dependent spouse and other family member will be determined by the court.  Subsection (3) has a similar effect to subsection (2) in so far as a contingent benefit under a scheme is concerned.  A contingent benefit is a benefit payable under a pension scheme to a member spouse's <Col N="1764" /> dependants where the member dies before retirement.</P>
    <P>Subsections (4) and (5) provide that, where a court makes a pension adjustment order under subsection (2), the spouse in whose favour the order is made may apply to the trustees of the pension scheme concerned to have the designated or &ldquo;earmarked&rdquo; portion of the benefit &ldquo;split&rdquo; from the main retirement benefit to provide a separate and independent benefit for that spouse.</P>
    <P>The remaining subsections of section 15 deal with special circumstances where, for example, after a pension adjustment order is made by a court, a member spouse leaves a scheme or where a dependent spouse dies before pension benefits come into payment.  It also deals with the provision of notification to various parties to proceedings and with various technical arrangements relating to the calculation and payment of pensions benefits.</P>
    <P>The valuation and calculation of benefits and the manner in which benefits ordered by the court are to be applied and paid will be in accordance with guidelines to be made under the Pensions Act, 1990.  On Committee Stage I propose to table an amendment to allow the guidelines to be promulgated by means of regulations.  That is the approach being provided for in relation to corresponding guidelines for the purposes of the Family Law Act, 1995.  The House agreed that approach recently on the basis of an amendment to the Pensions Act, 1990, provided for in the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995.  The guidelines in each case will help to standardise practise in relation to pension adjustment orders.  I take this opportunity to thank the Pensions Board and certain key figures in the pensions industry without whose expertise and advice it would not have been possible to bring forward the provisions in the 1995 Act and in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of what should happen to rights of succession following the grant of a decree of divorce is addressed in section 16 of the Bill.  In the context <Col N="1765" /> of judicial separation, it is already possible for the court to make an order extinguishing rights that spouses have <i>vis-á-vis</i> each other.  Where a couple divorce, the parties being no longer spouses will no longer have rights of succession.  In compensation for that loss the court will be able to make provision for a spouse by using the various financial and property adjustment provisions in sections 11 to 15 of the Bill. Where at the time of granting the decree of divorce it is not possible to make adequate provision for a spouse, and that spouse has not married in the meantime, section 16 provides that the court may order that financial provision be made for him or her out of the deceased spouse's estate.  In considering whether to make an order under this section the court must have regard to any lump sum payments or property or pension adjustment orders made in favour of the applicant, or any devise or bequest made by the deceased spouse to the applicant spouse.  The provision which the court can make under this section, with any lump sum payments or property or pension adjustment orders already made, must not exceed in total the share, if any, of the applicant in the estate of the deceased spouse under the Succession Act, 1965, to which the applicant was entitled or would have been entitled if the marriage was not dissolved.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that where a court makes a secured periodical payments order, a lump sum order or a property adjustment order it may, additionally, at any time thereafter make a further order for the sale of any property in which either spouse has a beneficial interest.  The order for sale may include provisions in relation to the manner and time of sale and disposal of the proceeds of sale.  The power to order the sale of property may not be exercised to interfere with a right to occupy the family home conferred by virtue of Part III of the Bill.  Neither will the power apply in relation to the family home where either of the former <Col N="1766" /> spouses, following remarriage, lives with his or her current spouse.</P>
    <P>Important criteria are contained in section 18 for the making of court orders under Part III in support of spouses and dependent children.  The courts will have flexibility, on the basis of the circumstances of each case before it, to determine an equitable division of income and property.  Subsection (1) sets down a general criterion that provision must be made for the spouse and any dependent member of the family as is proper having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  Subsection (2) contains more specific criteria in relation to such matters as a spouse's income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources, likely future financial needs and obligations, age and conduct of the spouses and accommodation needs.  The court must take into account any contribution made by either spouse to the financial and other resources of the other spouses and any contribution made by either of them by looking after the home or caring for the family.  Subsection (4) sets out specific criteria to which regard shall be had by a court in deciding whether to make an order in relation to children which take into account financial and accommodation needs and other matters.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 22 for the situation where a couple seeking a divorce have already obtained a judicial separation.  It is provided in the section that orders in relation to the separation will be continue in force unless the court orders otherwise, notwithstanding the grant of a decree of divorce.  The remaining section of importance in Part III is section 20 which lists the orders under Part III which, on the application of either spouse, can be varied, discharged or suspended by the court taking into account any change in circumstances. Variation orders are also subject to the criteria for the making of orders which are set out in section 18.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, which runs from sections 27 to 32, deals with amendments to the tax code in respect of both income and capital taxes &mdash; namely, <Col N="1767" /> capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax, probate tax and stamp duty &mdash; which will apply to divorced couples in this State.  Section 27 is a standard provision in family law legislation and provides that payments of money made pursuant to an order under the provisions of the Bill shall be made without deduction of income tax.  A pensions adjustment order does not come within the ambit of this section.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that, in certain circumstances, couples who obtain a decree of divorce may, similar to separated couples, opt for joint assessment for income tax purposes.  To avail of the provision, both of the parties to the dissolved marriage must be resident in the State for the relevant year of assessment and neither spouse must have remarried. The net effect of the section is that, through opting for joint assessment, where one party to a dissolved marriage is paying enforceable maintenance for the benefit of the other party, the party making the maintenance payment, and not the recipient, will bear any tax referable to the maintenance payments.  If the recipient has no other income, the paying party will be granted the personal allowances and tax bands appropriate to a married person.  If the recipient has other income, the tax assessed on the parties will be apportioned between them but the tax referable to the maintenance payments will still be borne by the payer.</P>
    <P>Sections 29, 30, 31 and 32 of the Bill exempt property transfers between former spouses on foot of a court order governing a divorce settlement from capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, probate tax and stamp duty.  In effect, any property transfers related to the divorce will be exempted from all capital taxes, provided that they are covered by a court order.  However, in relation to any subsequent property transfers not consequent on the divorce, the divorced couple will be treated as strangers for capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, probate tax and stamp duty purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> Part V of the Bill deals with court jurisdictions and the power of the courts to seek social reports under arrangements with health boards and the probation and welfare service on issues affecting the welfare of parties to divorce proceedings including children.  As in the case of judicial separation, the Circuit Court will be the main court to deal with applications for divorce. Sections 39 and 40 of the Bill contain minor amendments to the Maintenance Act, 1994 and the Family Law Act, 1995 some of which are of a drafting nature and others still are consequential on the introduction of divorce.</P>
    <P>I have made clear to the House on a number of occasions that the position of children under our laws as they stand is of special importance and that constitutional and statutory provisions and administrative policies reflect that. Recent legislation reflects that policy. Each of the 18 Bills passed since 1986, which I referred to earlier, relate to children in one way or another.  I do not imply that nothing more needs to be done.  This Bill has strong protective and support measures in the interests of children based on experience of operation of existing laws.  The extensive provisions which already exist in relation to children are continually being reviewed and will be updated as necessary under the Government's programme of renewal.  As I mentioned earlier, as part of the legislative programme in hand in my Department, progress is being made on new measures to update the law on guardianship and in relation to the evidence of children.  I propose to introduce those measures as quickly as possible and to continue the pace of social reform as may be necessary in the family law area.</P>
    <P>The introduction of divorce will place extra demands on our courts, on legal aid and on counselling and mediation services.  Health boards will be affected because of the requirement on them to provide social reports if called upon to do so by the courts in divorce proceedings. The probation and welfare service will be similarly affected.  The <Col N="1769" /> House will be aware of the strategic plans being developed in recent years in each of these areas to meet the demands of the growing area of family law cases. Significant resources have and are being provided in all of the areas concerned. The Estimates of the Departments concerned are testimony to that.  In so far as my own Department is concerned the record in relation to funding of legal aid, mediation and counselling should not leave any Member of the House in doubt about my commitment and that of the Government to those services. That commitment will extend to dealing, as necessary, with the demands of a divorce jurisdiction.  Other Ministers with other responsibilities in the relevant Departments of Justice, Health and Social Welfare will continue to have the same commitment in relation to the various social services in support of families.</P>
    <P>I look forward to debate on the Bill. I hope I have helped the House to put the Bill in context and to elucidate and inform on the more important provisions. The provisions are not, for the most part, unfamiliar because they in substance correspond with provisions in the Family Law Act of 1995, which we discussed several months ago.  However, this Bill provides for the first time in the history of the State for the exercise by our courts of jurisdiction to grant decrees of divorce.  On its enactment, it will give effect to that which the people themselves have enshrined in the Constitution, the right of persons in certain irreconcilable circumstances to have their marriage dissolved by our courts and to remarry, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The people have spoken on one of the most difficult and important issues we have faced as a society.  They gave their decision in the recent referendum and the Supreme Court upheld and confirmed the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Fianna Fáil's request and in line with the proposals in the White Paper published in 1992, a draft Family Law <Col N="1770" /> (Divorce) Bill was published immediately before the referendum so that the legislation which was likely to follow would be on the table in advance of the decision.  We have carefully examined the Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996 and we are satisfied that it is faithful to the draft Bill published in advance of the divorce referendum and that the protections and safeguards demanded by Fianna Fáil have been included.  On this basis we will not oppose Second Stage of the Bill.  The Government has included in section 39 minor amendments to the Family Law Act, 1995, updated section 15 to reflect the text of section 12 of the Family Law Act, 1995 regarding pension adjustment orders and a new provision, section 4, to allow for the recovery of maintenance due to a party to an Irish divorce who is living abroad.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the concerns of the substantial minority of the people who voted against the referendum and we reiterate our commitment to the family and to supporting all families in Ireland socially, economically, financially and legally.  In the spirit of our constructive approach to this important issue, we will put down amendments on Committee Stage.  We will seek to improve the provision for counselling, mediation and professional support services for families in breakdown situations.  We will also seek provision for a modern family court system and for the recognition of the key part which voluntary and community-based organisations can play.</P>
    <P>In the context of the proposals to change the Constitution, we were given assurances by the Government that the proposals contained in our five-year strategic action plan would be implemented.  These were designed to support families and especially to protect children from the downside effects of marriage breakdown or divorce.  We will insist that these measures to support families are put in place in parallel with the passage of this Bill through Dáil Éireann.  These essential supports are urgently needed and must not be left on <Col N="1771" /> the long finger by the Government. There is an obligation on all parties in the House to be faithful in word and in deed to the promises made before the referendum.  The issues at stake are far too important to our society to be neglected in the aftermath of the referendum decision.  We will insist on the Government meeting the commitments it made in the course of the referendum debate.  The measures needed must be included in some instances in the legislation and in others in parallel with its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The tradition of the family in Ireland has always been one of our strongest national characteristics and has focused on support for parents and their children. We see daily the effects of the increasing pressures on family life and the supports needed to ensure families are adequately maintained and a secure environment is provided for growing children.  We have never been exclusive in the way we describe the family.  Irish communities have always recognised families as all-embracing.  Generations of children have grown up in extended families with grandparents and elderly relatives living in a caring environment. While families are smaller today, that caring tradition continues with families increasingly taking an active part in the development of their local communities.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution is clear on the subject of the family.  Article 41.1.1º describes the family &ldquo;as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society&rdquo;.  The Constitution also pledges to guard with special care the institution of marriage in which the family is founded and to protect it against attack. For the vast majority of people the concept of family is based on a husband, a wife and children.  Approximately 500,000 families receive child benefit, the vast majority of whom fit that concept while some 17 per cent of current births are outside marriage, but there are thousands of families who for one <Col N="1772" /> reason or another have been left without the support of a partner.  Increasingly there are older families consisting of carers and the charges and families whose members have special needs.</P>
    <P>Today's understanding of families emcompasses a wide set of relationships. Notwithstanding the commitment to the family based on marriage the State has never been exclusive in the way it caters for families.  In our society generations of children have grown up in extended families and while families are smaller today that caring tradition continues.  Our understanding of the concept accepts families as all-embracing and all-inclusive which covers a wide range of structures and functions and recognises, supports and empowers families in their many diverse forms.</P>
    <P>In today's society the increasing pressures on family life are all too apparent.  Our traditional view of families is facing challenge.  Providing the necessary supports, ensuring that families are adequately maintained and that a secure environment is provided for growing children are all challenges faced daily by the State and by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>How do we best support the basic unit of society?  In the course of the divorce debate the Taoiseach and the Minister gave assurances that the Government would implement the provisions of our five year strategic action plan designed to support the development of strong families who can rise to any challenge and who cherish their independence. They want to make their decisions and to provide for their development.  In truth families are the smallest democracies in the world.  We must make sure that for every difficult situation facing families there is a supportive response.  I will give the Minister the quotes later as his officials do not appear to have them.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare services embrace the wide-ranging definition of the family adopted by the United Nations.  We have left no one out.  We are improving and simplifying our social welfare system. The complexity and variety of <Col N="1773" /> people's lives demand a wide range of supports covering a variety of family situations.</P>
    <P>Regarding families and the incidence of marriage breakdown, the issue of divorce and remarriage was a difficult one for our society.  Nevertheless we decided in favour of the introduction of civil divorce. We have a strong family tradition on which we place great value.  More than 95 per cent of marriages here are still recorded as intact.  That compares favourably with more than 80 per cent in the UK and more than 70 per cent in the USA, but the rate of breakdown and separation has accelerated here.  The breakdown of new marriages in 1994 reached the alarming rate of one in six. The problem has been growing at an accelerating pace in recent years.  In the 1986 census it was revealed that the marriages of 38,600 had broken down. By 1993 that figure had grown to 75,000. Allowing for the fact that breakdowns appear to be occurring at the rate of about 2,700 per annum, there are by now some 45,000 broken marriages here.  Of those it is fair to assume that at least 30,000 have been broken down for four years or more.</P>
    <P>Many of those who would be entitled to apply for a divorce once the Bill is law will not wish to apply.  However, it is only realistic to project that some 10,000 to 15,000 of those will wish to obtain a divorce as soon as that possibility exists.  This will mean that the courts will be faced with up to 15,000 applications for divorce in the near future.  These will not be quick <i>pro forma</i> applications.  The requirement in the constitutional amendment, to which the Minister referred, that the court must be satisfied that, &ldquo;[c] such provision as the Court considers proper having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the spouses or any dependent members of the family&rdquo;, means that the court will have to inquire into the circumstances of the spouses to be satisfied that adequate provision has been made for dependents.  Even though the courts may have granted judicial separations, all the cases will <Col N="1774" /> have to be re-examined in the light of present circumstances so that the court can be satisfied that adequate provision has been made in compliance with the Constitution.  For those who obtained separation before the enactment of the Judicial Separation Act, 1989 this will be of great importance because the range of reliefs available then was considerabley inferior to the reliefs that became available under the Judicial Separation Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>At present the courts deal with about 2,000 applications for judicial separation per annum.  Because there will be a four year period from separation until a divorce can be granted, it will be necessary for spouses whose marriages have broken down to continue to apply to the courts for reliefs, under the Judicial Separation Act, 1989, such as maintenance, custody of and access to children, barring orders, property adjustment orders and exclusive occupation of the family home orders.  It is likely that the number of applications under the Judicial Separation Act will continue at least at the present level.</P>
    <P>We now have a significant number of people who want to remarry.  The key issue for society was how to respond to a growing number of our citizens who demanded the right to remarry.  There was also a demand from others for divorce so that they could bring to an end an unhappy and acrimonious marriage and totally end a broken relationship.</P>
    <P>We recognised that in providing a right to remarry additional problems could arise by virtue of remarriage over and above those which arise at present from marital breakdown.  We were already dealing with the disharmony and damage which results from the breakdown and separation.  We must now address in a calm, considerate, careful and practical way the extra difficulties which can occur as a result of remarriage.  Most of the problems existed in the context of legal separation and second relationships.  The extra challenge will focus our minds and actions on the supportive work in which we should already have been engaged in <Col N="1775" /> tackling the problem of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>In supporting the recent referendum, we pressed the Government to put in place a five year strategic action plan to provide solutions for the downside aspects of marriage breakdown and divorce. This plan included the enhancement of the status of marriage.  We need to address the declining status of marriage, particularly in young people's perceptions. The number of marriages in Ireland in 1986 was 18,573 whereas by the year 1994 that figure had declined to 16,297.  In practical terms, lack of a job, inability to get a house and or sustain a mortgage has a devastating effect on those wishing to marry and puts marriages under extreme pressure in the early years.</P>
    <P>We also face important changes in the workplace.  Increasingly both parents are now likely to continue working.  The arrangements in the workplace and in regard to child care need to keep pace with these developments if the status of the family is to be maintained.  Ireland still has the lowest rate &mdash; 35 per cent &mdash; within the membership of the OECD of women working outside the home which contrasts with 74 per cent in Denmark and 64 per cent in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The system of taxation should enhance and support families with children, especially those with lower incomes.  As part of the current programme Fianna Fáil requested the Minister for Finance to establish a review committee to advance proposals for the development of our tax system to that end.  The Joint Committee on the Family was established to promote this work.  The Commission on the Family is preparing comprehensive proposals and recommendations and increasing awareness of the family and its potential.  The European-wide observatory to monitor developments on family policy is another valuable resource for EU member states.</P>
    <P>The system of taxation should enhance the family and support those <Col N="1776" /> with children, especially those on lower incomes.  Discrimination against the family arises in a number of ways.  For example, taxation can bear more heavily on families, with the effect of discouraging their establishment.  Throughout the European Union there is great concern at the decline in fertility rates and family size.  Families with children are heavy consumers and indirect taxes like VAT can bear more heavily on them as a composite family unit.  A combination of tax, social welfare and secondary benefits can further discourage maintenance of the family unit.</P>
    <P>For the recent report of the Joint Committee on the Family it is clear there is no evidence of State bias within our taxation system in favour of families with children.  For example, couples with one or three children were found to be net losers compared with single people or couples, even when benefits were taken into account.  Increases in child benefit and or income tax concessions in favour of children could help offset this disadvantage for families by providing positive, tangible evidence of State support for the family.</P>
    <P>While our income tax system favours married couples who, through joint assessment, benefit from the transfer of unused allowances and tax bands, widows and other lone parents do not benefit to the same extent despite the fact that the economic demands of supporting a family are similar.  There is a short-term bereavement allowance which is helpful but lasts for three years only.  Yet our constitution recognises the family of a widow or widower as a family based on marriage and entitled to special recognition and support.  Similarly, there are not any allowances or reliefs available for child care whether that care is provided by the parent in the home or my employing child minders. Consideration could be given to the provision of a targeted voucher scheme to support child care and strengthen the position of the family.</P>
    <P>These are some of the issues which must be addressed to help families under economic stress.  The State must <Col N="1777" /> do its best to protect and nurture the core family values that underpin our society, to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>It is essential to have a skilled professional counselling service throughout the country adequate to meet the demand.  The need for counselling is met at present by the voluntary organisations which, despite very limited resources, have built up a happy professional service.  These organisations should receive funding at a level commensurate with providing a service to all in need of it.</P>
    <P>It is essential that counselling services be availed of by all those whose marriages are in difficulty.  In the course of the debate in this House on the referendum Bill we sought and received an assurance from the Government that a skilled, professional counselling service would be made available nationwide.  In the short and medium term the only practical way to ensure counselling is made available to all those experiencing marriage difficulties is to support the development of this service through the voluntary organisations.  The Government will have to make much greater funding available to them so that they can continue to develop their service.  It was with some dismay I learned recently that the funding previously provided by the Minister for Social Welfare for the counselling service provided by the Irish Countrywomen's Association was withheld this year.  It should be immediately reinstated by the Government.  On returning to Government, Fianna Fáil will ensure adequate resources are made available for these essential services following discussions with the voluntary organisations.  We must always remember that good professional marriage counselling is invaluable in preserving marriages that might otherwise break-up.  The track record of these services is clearly acknowledged as is the fact that the State can rely on them as a sure means of saving a great number of marriages.</P>
    <P>It is essential to ensure that the counselling service is used by all those <Col N="1778" /> experiencing problems in their marriages. It would be a great tragedy if the opportunity to resolve marital disharmony and preserve families intact was neglected or ignored because one or both of the spouses focused solely on separation or divorce.  The Bill should contain a provision placing an obligation on the spouses initiating a separation or divorce process to participate in counselling, proof of which could take the form of a certificate from the counselling service, or other similar document.</P>
    <P>The consitutional amendment obliges a court to be satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses.  We recognise that obligatory counselling may not be appropriate for couples after long-term separation or in the case of a spouse who has been abandoned.  Exceptions to obligatory counselling would need to be specified.  However, we must seek to develop supportive counselling structures to ensure every possible opportunity is provided to avert marriage breakdown and divorce.</P>
    <P>There must be a positive programme of financial support for less well-off families experiencing marital disharmony. The State supports for families under stress, including household budgeting, money advice centres and personal development courses, are valuable in tackling the root causes of tension. The problem of inadequate housing, in particular, should be examined within the context of its being a contributory factor to marital difficulty.  In addition, abuse of drugs and alcohol are significant causes of marital disharmony and crime.  Programmes must be devised and implemented to tackle these persistent social problems.  Unemployment is clearly identified as a source of acute marital difficulty.  This should motivate the Government to introduce programmes to help long-term unemployed parents get back to work.</P>
    <P>As a corollary to raising the age of marriage to 18 and the requirement for three months advance notice it is most <Col N="1779" /> important that young people be educated and prepared for marriage as a lifelong relationship.  Perhaps it could be included in the schools' curricula.  Children and young people generally should learn about the importance of marriage as a source of well-being for most adults, and of its importance for the stability and general welfare of society; they should be educated to perceive lifelong marriage as a very desirable status for life.  We need better support and &ldquo;time out&rdquo; for parents, who care for children and people with disabilities in the home.  A start has been made in the social welfare area, but this should be followed by a system of social welfare credits which recognise the value to society of such work in the home.</P>
    <P>To help families, particularly families where husband and wife are working, to deal with marital difficulty, legislation should be introduced to provide for &ldquo;time out&rdquo; or leave, in situations where one or both parents need to devote time to preserving the marriage.  Periods of leave of this kind might be very appropriate while the couple are engaged in counselling.</P>
    <P>Where all efforts to save a marriage fail and separation and-or divorce is taking place, it is essential that there is available throughout the country a skilled professional mediation service, to minimise the harmful emotional and psychological effects on children, and to minimise the emotional trauma suffered by the parents.</P>
    <P>Such a service should be attached to the courts.  A skilled, professional mediation service would enable spouses in marital disputes to reach agreement concerning children, access to children and maintanence and distribution of family property.  This would reduce or even eliminate bitterness and disharmony between the spouses, thereby reducing the ill effects of the breakdown on the children.  It would also greatly reduce the amount of court time taken up by individual cases.</P>
    <P>For this to work it is essential that all spouses in marital dispute who have <Col N="1780" /> gone past the possibility of reconciliation, should be obliged to engage in mediation before they could apply to the court for divorce.  It would be necessary to amend the Bill to make provision for this and we will put down appropriate amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government must set up and fund a mediation service throughout the country.  Little has been done to establish the service on a countrywide basis. So far mediation has been available only in Dublin and recently in Limerick.  The funding to date of £300,000 per annum, is wholly inadequate to meet this important need.</P>
    <P>In making the decision to support the referendum we recognised and accepted that marital breakdown and divorce could have detrimental effects on children. Research has shown that children can suffer significant emotional and phychological harm in the short-term during marital conflict through separation and-or divorce and remarriage. Some children also suffer serious long-term social disadvantage and financial hardship.</P>
    <P>We supported the referendum on the basis that these downside effects are recognised and addressed.  The first step in that direction should be that real protection for the interests of children will be built into this Bill and the welfare of children in this context must be given due status and consideration.</P>
    <P>In the referendum debate, Fianna Fáil conducted an exhaustive study of the effects of marital breakdown and divorce on children.  It was apparent from that study, as shown in numerous other investigations, that marital breakdown and divorce have adverse effects on children.</P>
    <P>To ensure adequate protection for children, there must be a statutory officer whose job is to ensure that the interests of children are vindicated by the courts in disputes between parents. Thus we proposed that a commissioner for children would be attached to the courts who would be responsible for <Col N="1781" /> highlighting to parents the needs of children in marriage breakdown and divorce and for pressing the needs of children in court where necessary.  It would also be helpful if parents had to go through an information session on the short and long-term effects on their children of marital breakdown and divorce, and to advise them on the legal implications of guardianship, custody and access for themselves and their children and of the potential financial cost of separation and divorce.</P>
    <P>Legal aid must be readily available through the Legal Aid Board for those who are less well off.  The recent increase in funding the Legal Aid Board to £6.5 million was to spread the service throughout the country and fund several new law centres.  These centres and their legal staff are already stretched to capacity coping with existing litigation. The introduction of divorce will undoubtedly put a huge additional demand on the free legal aid system, for which the Minister has made no provision, and this will have to be remedied in the Estimates later this year.  Otherwise divorce will be the exclusive preserve of the rich.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important to prepare for the introduction of divorce so that when legislation is passed it is backed up by an administrative and legal system that can cope with the changes involved.  At present our legal system is creaking under the strain of the volume of family law cases in the courts.  Despite the best efforts of the judges, lawyers and court officials who work in family law, our system is under-researched and underresourced with two few judges available to hear all the existing cases and too few court officials to handle the vast amount of paperwork.  Consequently we have waiting lists averaging a year to 18 months, and when a couple get to court they are faced with facilities that vary from merely overcrowded to positively inadequate.</P>
    <P>Courthouses rarely have enough private consultation rooms or comfortable waiting rooms; often during winter there is no heat.  Imagine what it must <Col N="1782" /> feel like trying to talk to one's lawyer about the custody of children in an open hall with dozens of other people milling around and one's estranged spouse watching from across the room.  People must be treated with dignity and respect by the legal system.  We cannot tolerate chronic delays and poor facilities.</P>
    <P>The introduction of divorce will add to these problems.  It is estimated that some 10,000 or 15,000 couples may apply for a divorce.  This will immediately swamp the family law system.  In the medium-term we should bear in mind that even though a couple will only become eligible for a divorce after four years' separation, they may well need access to the courts during that time to sort out immediate issues of custody, access and maintenance that cannot wait.  Legally, marital breakdown will become a two-stage process which will represent a significant increase in the existing volume of work.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court will deal with divorce cases and there is little doubt that it will not be able to cope with the level of applications that will arise.  The Minister for Justice announced the appointment of seven new Circuit Court judges to deal with the increase in the number of all types of cases that the Circuit Court is required to hear.  It must be borne in mind that the jurisdictional limit of the Circuit Court in civil litigation was doubled in 1991 from £15,000 to £30,000, resulting in a huge increase in the amount of civil litigation going through it.  It is to meet that need and the increases in cases under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, that additional circuit judges are urgently required.  In reality no provision has yet been made or is even planned to deal with the huge number of applications for divorce that will come to the Circuit Court in the next few years.</P>
    <P>During the referendum campaign, Fianna Fáil drew attention to these issues.  As part of our five year strategic action plan, we called on the Government to introduce in conjunction with divorce three new Circuit Court judges <Col N="1783" /> to deal exclusively with family law; upgrade the courthouses to provide private consultation rooms and at least two waiting rooms in each; and a separate family law court in country areas as currently exists in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Since then the House passed the legislation needed to appoint more Circuit Court judges, but despite this the Government has not yet made the appointments.  Why?  There are family law cases ready to be heard but no judge to hear them.</P>
      <P>More recently, the Report of the Law Reform Commission on Family Courts made many constructive proposals for the improvement of the family law system. Some of these proposals echo Fianna Fáil's concern with the accessibility and quality of the family law system. The Law Reform Commission points out that all administrative supports must be properly researched. Their proposals include an information centre attached to the Family Court to provide objective information on alternatives to litigation and the implications of separation and a pre-trial case management procedure to review cases before they come to court.  These measures will narrow down the issues in dispute and, it is hoped, encourage settlement and a professional mediation service.  All these support services will be essential if the court system is to cope with the introduction of divorce. These supports must be put in place now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent Law Reform Commission Report on Family Courts examined the processes and procedures whereby family law disputes are resolved and remedies obtained.  It is also considered the best type of judicial court structure to deal with the different matters which <Col N="1784" /> fall under the general heading of family law.  It sets out the ideals and objectives of a good family court system, including access and speed; avoiding conflict and hostility; supporting family ties; promoting agreement and co-operation; respecting dignity and fundamental rights and protecting children; addressing inequality; links with other family support services and cost effectiveness. These reforms are urgently needed and have the support of all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this Bill provides the protections and safeguards which Fianna Fáil insisted on in the event of the people deciding to introduce divorce in the referendum.  It is faithful to the draft Bill published before the referendum at our request.  Accordingly, we are not opposing Second Stage.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the concerns of a substantial minority of the people who voted against the introduction of divorce. We have stressed our commitment to the family and to supporting all families socially, economically, financially and legally.  In the short time available we have set out our views on some of the main issues.  We will put down amendments on Committee Stage in a constructive attempt to improve the provisions where possible.  In particular, we will seek to improve the provisions for counselling, mediation and professional support services.  We also want to see a modern family court system &mdash; we believe that this is the time to get it &mdash; and clear recognition of the key role which the voluntary and community-based organisations can have.</P>
    <P>The introduction of divorce will provide a major challenge for all the services involved.  We were given assurances by the Government that the proposals in our five-year strategic action plan would be implemented.  We will be insisting that these measures to protect children and support families should be put in place in parallel with the passage of the Bill.  This will require extra resources but these are essential at <Col N="1785" /> this critical time.  If the Government does not honour the commitments made, I assure the House that on its return to office Fianna Fáil will implement these proposals.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill means that we are almost at the end of the long and sometimes tortuous road which will lead to the possibility of remarriage for those people who have been trapped in marriages in name only and whose relationships have broken down.  This concerns many thousands of people.  The Minister referred to the fact that some commentators have recently described this Bill as a last hurrah for a so-called liberal agenda which this debate will bring to a close.  I agree with the Minister's analysis that this is a superficial reaction to all we have gone through over the past few years.  This Bill is trying to establish the right, which the Progressive Democrats have always described as a civil right, to remarry. The introduction of the divorce Bill recognises that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent referendum was, in football jargon, a very close result &mdash; it was as close as last night's football match.  A degree of caution is urged on us because of that.  However, I do not accept the view of certain commentators that in some way Irish society is polarised on the liberal agenda or the right to remarry and that the result of the referendum showed this.  In the referendum campaign the people thought long and hard about the implications of the introduction of divorce.  Some people argued, in defence of the many thousands trapped in marriages from which they wanted to escape, that they should be given the right to remarry.  It was significant that those people outside the political arena who called for a yes vote on the referendum described it as the right to remarry campaign.  The Minister has often cited the 18 pieces of legislation which have led to this debate and he is, of course, correct in saying that the <i>corpus</i> of legislation is more or less in <Col N="1786" /> place, apart from this divorce Bill which grants the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>I am glad the refrendum turned out as it did.  Political parties should not have to compete between themselves to find out which is more concerned about family values or is more family oriented. Regardless of divorce, we should always have been concerned about marital breakdown, the needs and rights of children and the support that families deserve.  This is even more true in our more complex society today.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his Department for introducing the Bill which addresses almost all aspects of the divorce issue.  It is a source of great regret that I can only say we are almost at the end of the road and that this Bill addresses almost everything, but that is the true position.</P>
    <P>When the Bill has been passed and when people consult their legal advisers about their entitlement to apply for a divorce, it will come as a shock to many to be told that this is still by no means clear.  For people whose marriages have broken down and who have not been living in separate premises from their spouses for the requisite period, there is still a major doubt as to whether they have been living apart and are thus entitled to a divorce.  That will lead to further delay.</P>
    <P>In his speech on 27 September 1995 on the Second Stage of the Bill to amend the Constitution, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; is used in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and it is also a familiar term in many other jurisdictions where it has been held that this phrase will clearly cover where the spouses have physically separated and are living in different places.  The case law also states that where domestic life is not shared, it is possible for there to be two households under the one roof.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said, &ldquo;The term &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; has a clear and settled meaning in law and I am satisifed that <Col N="1787" /> the courts will follow this meaning in a divorce context&rdquo;.  While the courts may ultimately interpret &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; in the way the Minister contends &mdash; I sincerely hope they do &mdash; I cannot accept his contention that phrase has a clear and settled meaning in law.  It was a little disingenuous of the Minister to refer to the Judicial Separation Act to support his contention because section 2 (3) (a) of that Act specifically defined what &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; meant.</P>
    <P>We had some debate on that at the time but it is still unclear.  We would ordinarily clarify this issue by amending this Bill and including a similar definition of &ldquo;living apart&rdquo;, but that is not an option here because the entitlement of this House to legislate for divorce for couples who have lived apart derives from the constitutional amendment and the function of interpreting the Constitution belongs to the Judiciary, not to this House.</P>
    <P>When the Bill to amend the Constitution was introduced in this House, the Progressive Democrats argued that the House was abdicating its responsibilities by leaving it to the courts to say what &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; meant and we warned that the smooth operation of divorce procedures could be further delayed pending the interpretation of that phrase by the High Court and then the Supreme Court.  If the courts accept the Minister's interpretation, the delay will be at least a year and if they do not &mdash; it is not certain they will &mdash; we could be facing another constitutional amendment, from which God save us.  There is nothing the Minister or the House can do about that now but, of course, there are a number of other things we can do to ensure a system of divorce and family law generally operates smoothly and with the minimum of distress to those involved.</P>
    <P>For the sake of the many thousands of people who have been waiting anxiously for the decision of the Supreme Court following the referendum, I would like to be able to say I am completely satisfied with what is <Col N="1788" /> about to happen.  I regret I have to sound a somewhat negative note.  In its recent report on the family law courts, the Law Reform Commission referred to what it described as the negative ethos of the court system as it currently operates in the area of family law.  This was described as follows: instead of concentrating on the empowerment of individuals to resolve their own family disputes by encouraging negotiation and agreement, the emphasis of our systems with its concentration of adjudication is on solutions which take control away from the participants.  They say a humane system of family law is one which encourages the responsible resolution and management of disputes, wherever possible, by members of the family themselves.</P>
    <P>Judicial intervention is, of course, necessary to prevent exploitation or abuse between family members.  The ideal of empowerment should not blind us to problems of inequality which may arise in a system of private ordering. This apart, it is perhaps time to consider how reforms in our legal process may help in the process of family empowerment.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the Law Reform Commission was the establishment of a system of regional family courts based in 15 centres around the country, operating as a separate division of the Circuit Court and presided over by judges nominated to serve for a period of at least one year and assigned on the basis of their suitability to deal with family law matters.  The Government has made some efforts to increase the number of judges, but it is not sufficient, as we have heard and to establish the principle of judicial training, but nothing has happened yet.  If it did happen it would be a welcome start.  A huge amount remains to be done and it is disappointing that this Bill does not take on board the reforms suggested by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>Under the family law legislation brought to this House in February 1994, the Circuit Court was to be called the circuit family court but at the time <Col N="1789" /> everybody regarded that as a joke. There is still a severe shortage of judges, particularly those with a background in family law.  Due to the lack of facilities in courts, we have the bizarre situation of consultations and negotiations on the side of the street to avoid being heard by the other side.  This takes its toll on family litigants already experiencing intolerable physical and emotional pain as a result of delays.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission consultation paper on family courts recommended securing that certain requirements of substance are met as follows: (a) that the accommodation and setting of the court is appropriate &mdash; we know in so many instances that it is not; (b) that adequate time is made available for family cases &mdash; we know that in some areas a day is set aside for family law cases but there are literally dozens of cases waiting and there is not sufficient time to hear them all and (c) that judges who deal with family law cases are nominated to do so on the basis of their aptitude for such cases.</P>
    <P>I recently asked the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to advise the Minister for Justice of the view that judges who are appointed should have a background in family law matters.  I do not know if he has given further thought to my request.  It is very important that judges should have some degree of expertise and knowledge of this area. The Minister, at the time, of course replied that any judge who is appointed is very well experienced in many matters.</P>
    <P>It is important that the judge dealing with family cases should have some knowledge of family law because it is so sensitive and particular.  The Law Reform Commission paper recommends that costs be kept to the necessary minimum.  Deputy Woods has said that divorce will be the prerogative of the rich and this, unfortunately, may come to pass.  The recommendations of the consultation paper, unfortunately, are not being met.</P>
    <P>In a more technical sense, it is important that rules of court be drawn <Col N="1790" /> up in advance of the commencement date of the provisions of the Bill so that the same procedure will apply throughout the country.  In the case of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which came into force in October 1989, the rules of court for the Circuit Court did not come into operation until August 1991.  In the absence of such rules each Circuit Court had to devise its own rules of procedure. That type of inconsistency is very undesirable.</P>
    <P>Another interesting recommendation of the Law Reform Commission was that each of the regional family courts should have attached to it a family court information centre with responsibility for providing impartial, objectively presented information relating to the possible alternatives to litigation, the implications of separation, the process of the courts and the availability of support services.  It is an excellent idea. While the Bill, like the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, obliges the solicitor to inform clients of the availability of mediation services, there must be a danger that in many cases this will be only a ritual to be gone through.  While mediation as a concept has much to recommend it, I know we do not have a sufficiently comprehensive service to meet the level of demand which can be envisaged.  We need to establish a regulatory regime involving accreditation and recognition of training qualifications if we are sincere about shifting family disputes from the courts to mediators.</P>
    <P>We must again restate the aims of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, encouraging marriage counselling and mediation for separating couples.  In any reform of the family law system, there must be an adequately resourced family law division in which psychologists and lawyers could work together with the children's welfare as their main priority.  Another approach entirely &mdash; this seems to have been overlooked in the debate &mdash; is the antenuptial agreement.  Before committing themselves to marriage, the parties <Col N="1791" /> agree the principles on which property would be divided in the event of a judicial separation or divorce.  The great advantage of such agreements is that they would have been concluded in a much more reasonable atmosphere than that which attends most post-break-down negotiations and might help to reduce the feeling common to both spouses on the breakdown of marriage, that the other spouse is trying to cheat them out of their proper entitlements.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explore the possibility of encouraging such agreements but also of establishing a regime which might exclude certain matters from those type of agreements.  For example, you would not like to see an agreement which precluded one spouse absolutely from claiming anything from the other spouse.</P>
    <P>If the new regime to deal with marriage breakdown as established by this Bill and the Acts of 1989 and 1995 is to work properly, we will have to establish a realistic level of funding for legal aid. Experience shows us that in the absence of a proper legal aid system many family disputes have been resolved through the rather blunt instrument of the barring order.  That is a particularly unsatisfactory way of trying to resolve disputes especially when children are involved.</P>
    <P>Another area that could be looked at is the enforcement of maintenance orders made under this Bill and other legislation such as the Family Law Act, 1995.  There is a particular weakness in enforcing orders against people who are self-employed or otherwise not in regular salaried employment as attachment of earnings orders will not be made in these cases.  I wonder if it is possible to bring in a system whereby those whose earnings ar not amenable to an attachment of earnings order would be obliged to pay their maintenance obligations by direct debit.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there are many other Deputies who have gone through the hoops in trying to have maintenance orders enforced and I am aware of heartbreaking stories of women who are <Col N="1792" /> pauperised, but over the limit for entitlement to legal aid, having constantly to pursue their spouse through the courts.  The courts recognise that they have a case, orders are made, the orders are reneged upon and the vicious circle starts all over again.  We must address the area of enforcement of maintenance obligations and take a much more proactive approach to it.  I have written to the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to see if women in particular can be accommodated. Those deemed to be over the limit in terms of entitlement to free legal aid are living on their wits, just about surviving and in many cases just trying to keep up appearances.  They are often psychologically damaged.  In relation to marriage breakdown this is a hidden cost.  The issue badly needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Another aspect to be considered is whether there is need for separate representation, although not necessarily legal, of the interests of the child in family law proceedings.  This could be supplied for instance, by social workers. The compiler of social reports might usefully be able to contribute to the proceedings in other ways.</P>
    <P>Some sections my require amendment. Under section 12 (1) (c) which deals with property adjustment orders a court will be empowered to vary any pre or post-nuptial settlement, including a will.  There may be a situation where, for example, a parent or grandparent leaves a lump sum or income from a lump sum or property to the spouses but provides in the will that if the spouses separate or divorce a particular spouse is to retain the benefit.  Does the Minister envisage that a court will be able to vary the terms of such a will and, if so, is he satisfied this will not represent an unconstitutional interference with the property rights of the testator?</P>
    <P>Section 13 (1) (a) which deals with the family home provides that a court may confer on one spouse the right to occupy the family home or make an order directing the sale of the family home.  This subsection seems to be open <Col N="1793" /> to the interpretation, because of the use of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;, that a court will be able to make one or other of these orders but not both.  In other words, it will not be able to order the sale of the family home and confer the right on one spouse to occupy it until such time as it has been sold.  That is only one interpretation. We should take the opportunity while we have the Bill before us to iron out any problems.</P>
    <P>Section 18 sets out a wide range of considerations which should be taken into account by a court in deciding whether to make ancillary orders such as property adjustment orders, lump sum orders and periodical payment orders when granting a decree of divorce. The 1995 Act contains a similar section in the context of a decree of judicial separation.  There is, however, a significant difference between the two.</P>
    <P>When granting a decree of judicial separation a court may not make an order for the support of a spouse who deserts the other unless it would be unjust not to do so.  In other words, there is a special onus on a deserting spouse to justify the making of an order for his or her support.  In the case of divorce there does not seem to be any provision which will allow a court in deciding whether to make support orders to take desertion by the spouse seeking the order into account.</P>
    <P>While there is a provision which allows a court in both judicial separation and divorce proceedings to take the conduct of a spouse into account this does not seem to remedy the matter. Will the Minister explain why it is necessary and desirable to treat desertion differently in judicial separation and divorce proceedings?  The effect of this distinction is that a deserting spouse will be treated more favourably in divorce proceedings.  There has been much talk about counselling etc. Section 18 might usefully be amended by the incorporation of a specific reference to counselling for spouses and dependent children as a result of the trauma of divorce. The break-up of a marriage is stressful <Col N="1794" /> for all involved.  We are fooling ourselves if we think this can be overcome by providing mediation services.  The hurt, anger, and trauma of marriage breakdown can continue long after a decree of judicial separation or divorce has been granted and is likely to be exacerbated in the context of an application by one spouse to vary the terms of maintenance or other ancillary orders.</P>
    <P>Counselling may provide a means of alleviating this but the reality is that where a spouse has to live on a defined share of the other spouse's earnings the payment of counselling fees will lose priority.  If the court, however, could order that counselling fees payable in respect of one spouse or dependent children were specifically the responsibility of the other spouse it is more likely that counselling which is so necessary will be availed of.</P>
    <P>The Minister thanked everybody involved in the pensions area for their input.  When we were briefed on the Family Law Act we were mesmerised by its provisions dealing with pensions.  The pension provisions in this Bill are reasonably straightforward.  A court will make the appropriate order and the actuaries will calculate the value of the pension fund.  The spouse concerned, the wife in most cases, will not have the right to leave the moneys apportioned to her in the existing pension fund.  This will rest with the trustees.  The point has been made that they may decide to move the moneys, at considerable expense, by way of what is known as a buy-out bond.  Apparently, only 20 per cent of the population have their own pension funds.  It is most likely, therefore, that the person concerned will have to purchase an insurance contract or a buy-out bond.  This is quite expensive. I ask the Minister to reflect on this point before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission highlighted the need to properly research marriage breakdown.  We need to know, for example, the extent to which maintenance orders are being complied with <Col N="1795" /> and how effective are existing enforcement measures.  In some cases they are ineffective.  In the absence of research we are reduced to making policy and allocating resources in a vacuum.  A notable feature of the divorce debate was that, while both sides made free use of statistics compiled in the USA, Britain and the rest of Europe, there was a dearth of reliable information about what was happening here.</P>
    <P>While we have come a long way in recent years in addressing our social problems, we should not make the mistake of thinking this work is complete. The House must keep the operation of the new family law regime under observation. It would be a great help if we could rely on factual rather than anecdotal evidence in so doing.</P>
    <P>Focusing on the needs of families and especially children in cases involving marriage breakdown or divorce is a primary concern of those who support the introduction of divorce.  It is also a primary concern of those who do not favour its introduction.  There is a need to avoid marriage breakdown by developing comprehensive programmes dealing with relationships and family life.  This cannot be legislated for and will involve a huge educational process. We must challenge the idea that we have always been a pro-family and prochildren society.  There was no idyllic Ireland.  We are living in a complex society where the pressures are intense. That is what we have to cope with.  The introduction of divorce and the right to remarry for many thousands of people is a humane and necessary reaction to reality within society.  For that reason and many others I support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Minister, Deputy Taylor, and Deputies Woods and Keogh reflected the relatively measured and mature tone of the debate in the passage of the referendum legislation and of the campaign waged before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> Those of us involved in the 1986 campaign found this campaign a far more rewarding experience as people, whichever side of the fence they were on, by and large took a measured and mature approach to it.  The extremists were less extreme or there were fewer than in 1986.  People were more honest about identifying problems and trying to identify solutions to them.  We may have differed on the solutions but the campaign was conducted in a far more measured tone.  That is very good for the country.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have been particularly aware of the need to promote tolerance, understanding, acceptance of diversity and dialogue between people in Northern Ireland, between the two parts of this island and between this and our neighbouring island.  The fact that we were able to conduct our debate in a relatively civilised way shows that we are growing up and beginning to put into practice in our own jurisdiction what we have been preaching to those in another jurisdiction for many years.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this historic occasion is taking place in the shadow of yesterday's dreadful events.  I do not wish in any way to minimise that happening or the response of this House to those events but I am pleased that this day has come.  This is the first time a measure has been introduced by an Irish Government to allow Irish courts to grant divorces.</P>
    <P>A relatively liberal dispensation of divorce was allowed in Ireland under the Brehon laws.  That provision was uprooted on the imposition of English law.  Until the 19th century in England the only provision for divorce was by the introduction of a private Act of Parliament. The English law changed in the 19th century but that provision for divorce by private Act of Parliament continued in this State up to 1937.  A number of private Bills were introduced although I do not think any of them passed.  Attempts were made on a number of occasions to change Standing Orders to make even the introduction of these Bills more difficult.  It would be unsatisfactory in this day and age to <Col N="1797" /> have to bring individual cases of marriage breakdown before Parliament for adjudication.</P>
    <P>Today is the first time since 1937 we have had any provision for divorce and it is the first time that Irish courts will be given jurisdiction in divorce matters. I compliment the Minister on this, and all those in previous Governments and those outside this House who have worked over the last number of years to address the increasing and unfortunate incidence of marriage breakdown.  We can analyse why the level of breakdown was not greater in the past.  We know there are many contributory factors. People had in some cases less sense of their own individual identity and the options available to people for economic independence were far more limited. However, the situation exists today, we have to address it, and we are doing so.</P>
    <P>I have been reminded somewhat ironically, particularly in my own constituency during the campaign, that as the most recently married Member it might appear inappropriate that I speak about divorce, but we all recognise that many people, including members of our families, our friends and neighbours find their marriage has, unfortunately, broken down without any prospect of reconciliation.  The people, if narrowly, decided that provision should be made to put a civilised, decent and legal end to long dead relationships and to allow people, if they wish, the right to a second chance.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Keogh's comments, the members of her party in my constituency were extremely active in support of the campaign for the introduction of divorce for which those of us leading the campaign were very thankful. At the same time, some of her criticisms here today were a little petty and I am sorry she is not here to say this to her face.  Some of her comments reminded me of the hurler on the ditch.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in their programme for Government between 1989 and 1992 did the Progressive Democrats set out in a comprehensive fashion what measures <Col N="1798" /> of family law would be enacted as this Government and the last did.  Nowhere did they commit themselves to enacting legislation on divorce as part of the programme for Government.  The Deputy criticised the lack of services in the courts, the inadequacies of the mediation and counselling services, without recognising that the Minister has made huge strides in improving these services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh has not told the people that, whatever the present shortcomings of those services, they would have no hope of improvement if her party get the opportunity to implement the spending cuts of £2 billion it promised the electorate.  She should be honest with the electorate on this issue. Both this Government and the last &mdash; the Labour Party was party to both &mdash; enacted a comprehensive programme in the lead-up to the referendum.  We learned the lessons of 1986 when it was attempted to introduce the measure in isolation.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of various measures such as the White Paper on marital breakdown and legislation dealing with judicial separation, family law, maintenance of dependants, civil legal aid and domestic violence, the Government put a proposal before the people and that was the correct way to do it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Taylor, on his handling of this issue.  He was criticised by people inside and outside this House for being too cautious. About 18 months ago Deputy Michael McDowell, in an article in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> said that the Minister and the Labour Party would be incapable of bringing in legislation on divorce.  The Minister has shown that his measured approach has worked.  It has reflected the genuine concerns of people about the need to protect and support the family, as well as the need to support those marriages in difficulty which can be saved and to help people when their marriages break down through reconciliation if possible, through mediation and a legal settlement, if that is the option, and if necessary by allowing <Col N="1799" /> those people involved to make a fresh start.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken action in legislation to raise the minimum age of marriage from 16 to 18 years.  He increased expenditure in this area, including the large increase in grants for marriage counselling and the availability of the mediation service.  In my constituency CMAC, now Accord, is in receipt of substantial Government funding.  Our part of the country suffered from an almost total absence of such services until the Minister came in and the Department of Equality and Law Reform was established.  People in my constituency had to go to Athlone, Carlow or Waterford for services.  Legal aid services are now available through the law centre in Portlaoise and in the autumn will be available in County Offaly on a full-time basis through a new centre in Tullamore.  I compliment the staff in those centres whose main area, though not the sole area, of operation is family law.  It is one of the main areas where I have seen them help people on the ground.  While the Minister, Deputy Taylor, is reserved in a number of ways&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i>&mdash;&mdash;this list of accomplishments will stand as a great testimony not only to his efforts to ensure that those who need divorce can avail of it but also to ensure that a wide range of legal services and supports is available for families throughout the State.  His judgment in putting a constitutional amendment before the people was justified.  Some Members criticised that, saying it should be a matter for legislation.  The people are cautious in this area and it was important to reassure them that if they allowed limited provision for divorce the basic conditions would be set out in the Constitution and that any proposed variation in those conditions would have to come back to them for further adjudication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> I pay a further compliment to the Minister on the manner in which he conducted himself during the divorce campaign and particularly on the time he spent in the constituencies throughout the country.  The 1986 campaign was very much city based, with efforts being made in rural constituencies to support a yes vote.  The Minister showed by the amount of time he spent launching local campaigns, visiting local areas, participating in local radio discussions that he was able to meet the people at their level, discuss their concerns and explain to them in a measured fashion why this was necessary.  His efforts during the campaign played no small part in ensuring that the vital extra votes were won.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of points in relation to the Bill.  The basic rules as set out in the Constitution are restated. The people decided to allow a right of divorce but on very limited grounds. Efforts are being made in other jurisdictions, which had more liberal divorce regimes from the 1960s and earlier, to backtrack on some of their divorce provisions. They now realise that their divorce legislation also created many problems. We have seen the recent controversy in England concerning changes in their divorce law.  It is important to compliment the people on adopting this measured, reasonable and limited approach.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive legislation covers many of the issues raised during the 1986 campaign, many of the issues that have arisen since and many of the issues that arose in the 1995 campaign.  It has codified and simplified matters in the sense that it is open to judges to make orders under this legislation in respect of many of the other areas of family and child law.  A law is only as good as the people who implement it.  We are talking about the judges who will administer it in the courts, the lawyers who will be consulted by people who are thinking of embarking on divorce proceedings and most importantly the spouses.  I would agree with Deputy Keogh that we should try to encourage people to take as much responsibility for this process <Col N="1801" /> as possible.  The Minister has gone as far as he can in legislation.  I welcome the provisions whereby couples must be made aware of the possibilities for reconciliation and mediation and of the necessity for lawyers who are presenting cases in court to certify to the court that they have made their clients aware of these options.  It is important that all involved realise it is not just a formula. I would encourage any couples who will be taking proceedings under this legislation to avail of the existing services.</P>
    <P>Following enactment of the Bill the courts will have wide powers to decide on almost all issues relating to divorce. Those powers can be better used if the couple involved present an agreed case to the court for adjudication or settlement. We have seen this already in the case of judicial separation.  Given his legal background Deputy O'Dea would be more familiar with this.  As an ordinary Deputy dealing with constituency matters I have come across cases where people have succeeded either on their own or with the assistance of a lawyer or another person in agreeing all or almost all of the terms of their separation. I hope this type of responsible and mature approach will be encouraged by all concerned in this process and that people take control of this for themselves.  This is not always possible, especially where relationships have broken down, where people are not on speaking terms, where one party has mistreated the other etc.  We should be vigilant to ensure these provisions do not become a legal empty formula.</P>
    <P>If this law is to be implemented improvements will be needed in our courts, in the Judiciary and in our facilities. I intend to take this matter further with the Minister for Justice.  We all realise that overhauls in this area are badly needed.  That is not the responsibility of this Minister but the equality of the operation of this legislation will be affected and influenced by the quality of the facilities available to the people who present themselves to the court for divorce.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is comprehensive and allows for various types of orders to be made &mdash; orders in regard to property <Col N="1802" /> adjustment, pensions, insurance etc.  All reasonable attempts must be made to make financial and other provisions for the dependent spouse and children. Section 18 is an indication that the Minister has taken account of many of the concerns raised during the debate.  The third basic condition for the granting of a divorce enshrined in the Constitution is as follows:</P>
    <P>such provision as the Court considers proper having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the spouses, any children of either or both of them and any other person prescribed by law ...</P>
    <P>That is a general statement which is open to wide interpretation.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has set out in section 18 (2) a number of other specific criteria that must be taken into account by the court in deciding on orders under the previous sections.  The specific criteria in section 2 relate to matters such as the spouses' income, earning capacity, property and other resources, likely future financial needs and obligations, age and conduct of the spouses and accommodation needs.  The court must also take into account any contribution made by either spouse to the financial and other resources of the other spouse and any contribution made by either of them to looking after the home or caring for the family.</P>
    <P>We are not introducing a fault based system but a system of divorce which is based on the fact that the marriage has been over, and irreconcilably so, for several years.  Many people were concerned that some aspects of the behaviour of either spouse should be taken into account by the court in deciding on matters before it, in particular in relation to settlements.  I am happy that those criteria have been spelt out by the Minister. It is important that the contribution of women who stayed at home to raise their families will be taken into account in any decision.</P>
    <P>While the conduct of spouses is implicitly taken into account by courts in judicial separation cases, it is important that the legislation is explicit in this regard.  The Minister recognised <Col N="1803" /> that people wanted this provision included in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had an opportunity to contribute to this debate. While I accept Members have a right to table amendments on Committee Stage, I hope it will not be necessary to amend the Bill because we published a draft of it when the referendum was put to the people.  As far as possible, we should adhere to the measures presented to the people at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because I enthusiastically support the principle that parties to a marriage that has irretrievably broken down should be entitled to remarry, provided proper safeguards are in place.  While I am pleased our views are reflected in the legislation, it does not represent the totality of the Fianna Fáil position.  We have put forward detailed proposals which the Government has undertaken to implement and we will observe it closely for the duration of its term to ensure it does.  If not, Fianna Fáil is committed to implementing its five year plan if and when we return to office.</P>
      <P>I wish to depart from the restrained tone in which Deputy Gallagher spoke about this matter.  Members who support the principle of divorce are extremely fortunate to be here today discussing the Bill because the Government resolutely, for reasons best known to itself, closed its ears to all arguments and entreaties made at the beginning of the referendum campaign about the inherent lack of fairness in spending taxpayers' money to finance one side of the debate.  That approach was fraught with danger and, in effect, the Government played Russian roulette with the referendum. Certain aspects of the Supreme Court judgment in the Hanafin case are less than compelling.  If I understand it correctly, it implies it is impossible to say whether advertising has any effect on those to whom it is addressed.</P>

      <P>That proposition will come as a major surprise to the multibillion pound advertising industry.  If the referendum had been defeated we would have been plunged back into the millstream of another referendum which would have been infinitely more devisive, may have been lost and those whose marriages have broken down would continue to be assigned to a legal limbo.  However, the matter has been decided and we are now discussing the relevant legislation.  The people have made their decision and the courts have decided the referendum was properly and legally held and we should now debate the details of the legislation.</P>
      <P>How does the Bill measure up to the stated objective of all parties?  It is our constitutional obligation to protect and preserve the family unit in so far as practicable.  How does the Bill serve the children, the silent victims, of marriage breakdown?  How does it meet the Government's stated objective of allowing a couple who can no longer live together to have their marriage dissolved and their affairs settled by the court in the most reasonable, logical and dignified manner possible?  As the principle has been accepted, those are the matters we should discuss at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already received representations on the question of variation, particularly regarding property, financial compensation orders and so on. People who have already gone through the judicial separation process or agreed a deed of separation to settle their affairs can go back to the court for a variation.  In the case of a deed of separation, if one spouse cannot get the other to agree to vary the deed or draw up a new one, a judicial separation can be sought.  People who have got a judicial separation can go back to the courts and request a variation of the terms of the property settlement and so on.  I accept that, in practice, this rarely happens. People do not want to go through the <Col N="1805" /> long delays and incur the additional expenses which characterises family law cases.  They simply cannot be bothered going back to the court to get an extra share of property or additional financial compensation.  However, people regularly go back to the courts in respect of maintenance payments.</P>
    <P>A couple judicially separated and seeking a divorce can ask the court to vary the property settlement of the judical separation.  Grave concerns have been expressed in this regard.  While people generally do not go back to the courts to seek a variation, judicially separated people seeking a divorce will go to courts in any case and their solicitor would be obliged to advise them that they have the right to ask the court to vary any property settlement already made as a result of a judicial separation application.  Solicitors may tell their clients that even though they have secured a certain amount of property, they have the right to look for another bite at the cherry when they go to court seeking a divorce.  While I am not opposed to the principle of variation, the legislation should state that applications for variation will be considered only in the most exceptional circumstances, where there is compelling new evidence.</P>
    <P>Section 20 gives the right to parties to a divorce whose affairs have already been settled to go back to the court to seek a variation as often as they like.  In so far as property is concerned, the legislation should state explicitly that people can seek a variation only in exceptional circumstances.  While this may have been the draftsman's intention, the legislation should be more explicit in that regard.  It states that a person who has already secured a property settlement can get a variation from the court if the court considers it proper having regard to any change in the circumstances of the case and to any new evidence.  That is weak.  As far as new evidence is concerned, it should be evidence which could not be produced at the time of the original application for a divorce at the very least.  The court can <Col N="1806" /> also grant a variation at the behest of either of the spouses or the spouse who has remarried, which is fair.  It can also vary a property settlement, a financial compensation order or whatever at the behest of anybody who has, in the opinion of the court, a sufficient interest.  What does that mean?  It is too wide and it should be confined to dependants or tied down more narrowly, but I will discuss this in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 16 allows a divorced spouse who has already got a property settlement, a property adjustment order, financial compensation, a lump sum payment or whatever to go back in the event of the death of the spouse against whom they got that order.  I say sincerely to the Minister, in view of representations made to me and my consideration of the matter, that this should only apply in the most exceptional circumstances. I accept the legislation is drafted to take into account the rights of the spouse of the person who dies and children of that relationship, etc.  It is extraordinary that section 16 states that this right will only be granted &ldquo;if it was not possible to make proper provision for the applicant during the lifetime of the deceased spouse.&rdquo;  If it was not possible to do so, why was the divorce granted in the first place?  Surely, section 4 (1) (c) makes it clear that a divorce cannot be granted unless the court is satisfied that proper provision is being made.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise a query in relation to section 16 (6) which puts a further obligation on the personal representative of the deceased spouse in such a situation to make a reasonable attempt to bring the death to the notice of the divorced spouse.  This onus should not be put on the personal representative. We live in a small country and the onus should be on the person involved.  What sanction will apply if it is established that the personal representative did not make a reasonable attempt to contact the spouse of somebody who has died with a view to their coming back to look for another share <Col N="1807" /> of the property?  If there is no sanction, why place an obligation on somebody? The sanction, I presume, is a civil one in that they can be sued.  How will it operate in practice?</P>
    <P>If the personal representative does not bring this to the notice of the spouse of somebody who has died, the time limit may elapse and the spouse who could have brought a case may suddenly discover that they could have done so had they been informed.  What will be the sanction of the personal representative who made no effort to bring this to their notice?  Can they sue the personal representative?  What would the measure of damages be?  Will the court have to calculate what the spouse would have got from the estate if they had been informed and had brought a case in time?  Would that be the measure of damages against the personal representative?</P>
    <P>This represents a further onus and, therefore, a further disincentive for people to take on the job of being a personal representative.  The Minister will be aware that at present a personal representative can be secondarily accountable for capital acquisition tax, which is not a fanciful thing.  I know of cases where personal representatives have been forced to pay capital acquisitions tax.  A recent change in social welfare legislation has made a personal representative liable if the estate is distributed and it is found that money is owed to the Department of Social Welfare. This is a further onus on the personal representative and a disincentive to act as such.  If people refuse to act as personal representatives, everyone will have to resort to the banks and to what are known as trust corporations which will be to the detriment of the estate and its beneficiaries because their charges are very onerous.</P>
    <P>Section 34 (6) provides that in the event of divorce proceedings each spouse must give such particulars of his or her property as may be reasonably required.  That will have to be changed. In the event of divorce proceedings <Col N="1808" /> either party to the divorce should be obliged by law to give details of all the property in his or her possession or ownership.  I found in practice that it is sometimes extremely difficult to get people to give a proper account of what they have when marital breakdown proceedings are taking place.  Yet the Legislature is giving these people a loophole. I see no logic in such a provision.  I cannot imagine what property owned by a spouse being sued for divorce would not come into the reckoning.  It is appalling that such a person should be given the right to decide what may be reasonably required.  In such circumstances, each party should be obliged by law to give details of all the property in their possession, ownership or, at least, in their beneficial ownership.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) (a) puts an obligation on the parties to be living apart which is also written into the Constitution, so I cannot say too much about it.  Will the Minister state what proofs will be required that this condition has been met?  Section 5 (2) obliges a solicitor to discuss mediation, reconciliation or counselling.  Deputy Gallagher was much taken with that and he said it was a most revoluntionary provision and it helped to enhance and preserve families, etc.  What he does not know is that it is a repeat of a similar provision in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  In practice, it has proved to be the most harmless piece of cosmetics imaginable.  I know some solicitors who have encouraged parties to litigate, while at the same time submitting the ritual certificate saying that they advised them about counselling and mediation.  There is no sanction against a lawyer who does that; it is one person's word against another.  I know of solicitors who actively encouraged people to proceed to litigation and who submitted a certificate to say they told them about mediation and advised them about reconciliation.</P>
    <P>It would be more logical to have something like a compulsory cooling off period after such advice is given to ensure they had applied their minds to <Col N="1809" /> the question of reconciliation, mediation and counselling.  Deputy Woods made a good suggestion, that a provision should be included in the Bill. We will table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage, that is, that there should be some type of compulsory mediation in advance of divorce proceedings or the court making the final decision.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (6) (a) deals with the question of attachment.  Apparently, it is confined to people who have earnings as defined by the 1976 Act and, as far as I know, that is confined to PAYE workers.  I do not see why it should be the case.  It should be extended not only to people with earnings but to the self-employed who receive income which can be attached.  In many cases, self-employed people are in receipt of income, wholly or partly, which can easily be attached.  For example, the Revenue Commissioners applied attachment orders to creamery cheques payable to farmers in relation to tax owed.  It worked very powerfully and the Minister should consider this in relation to the self-employed.  Attachment should be automatic or, at the very least, where there is a record of non payment; there should be no loopholes in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (7) provides that a property adjustment order will not affect the family home in which either of the spouses who has remarried is residing, which is a good idea.  However, a similar provision is not included in the judicial separation Acts.  I envisage circumstances in which the presence of this in the divorce legislation and its absence in judicial separation legislation might encourage parties who might have been satisfied with judicial separation to look for a divorce because in most cases, as anyone who has dealt with separated people, particularly women, will know, the question of ownership and occupation of the family home is often the thing who looms largest in their minds.</P>
    <P>I differ radically from Deputy Keogh in relation to prenuptial agreements. The Minister has refused to say if they <Col N="1810" /> are effective, but he can make them effective or ineffective by including a provision in the Bill.  I am totally opposed to prenuptial agreements. People who do not draw up prenuptial agreements, those who are not wealthy and who do not have property to justify such an agreement, are subject to the jurisdiction of the court.  Is it possible to avoid all the panoply of maintenance orders, financial compensation orders and so on by the simple device of drawing up a prenuptial agreement?  In the case of the ordinary person who does not draw up a prenuptial agreement or does not have the property to justify such consideration, a settlement may be varied as often as the other spouse wishes.  Even death is not a release because the other spouse may make a claim on the estate.</P>
    <P>If prenuptial agreements are effective the rich, who as Scott Fitzgerald said are different, will be even more different because they will be allowed to write their own ticket, which cannot be varied.  There is no logic in the provision where a decision of the court on property disposition can be varied in future if circumstances change.  I ask the Minister not only to clarify the position relating to prenuptial agreements but to write a provision into the legislation stating that prenuptial agreements are null and void.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to raise a number of other technical matters, particularly relating to pensions and tax, but unfortunately time does not permit me to do so and I recognise the right of other Members to contribute.  I ask the Minister to take on board the technical matters I raised, which can be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Taylor, Minister for Equality and Law Reform, on the professional manner in which he conducted the successful referendum campaign and ensured this legislation has come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Labour Party entered <Col N="1811" /> Government with Fianna Fáil in 1993 we ensured that the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> included proposals for a major programme of family law reform, which would include a referendum on divorce.  As well as appointing a Minister for Equality and Law Reform we said we would pursue a broad programme of institutional, administrative and legislative reform aimed at enhancing the rights of women.  With the formation of the Government of Renewal, that overall philosophy has been maintained.</P>
    <P>In its programme the new Government promised that a referendum to remove the constitutional ban on divorce and remarriage on the basis of irretrievable breakdown would be held in 1995.  It stated that the Government and the parties would recommend a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum and that in advance of the referendum a comprehensive paper would be published indicating the text of the amendment proposed by Government and addressing issues such as the protection of children, taxation, social welfare, inheritance laws and pension entitlements.  We said we would complete the steps necessary to ensure that all dependent spouses and children would be fully protected, that the family mediation service would be strengthened and expanded and that family courts would be strengthened.</P>
    <P>That overall programme for the protection of the family and the divorce referendum had all-party support.  All political parties recognise that marriage breakdown has become an unfortunate reality of life and that the rights of children and dependent spouses must be considered.  The Government and every political party represented in this Parliament recognise the family as a fundamental part of society and we are committed to legislation designed to help families.  We recognise that despite everyone's best efforts relationships can and do break down and that the absence of divorce has not prevented marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> More than 70,000 people are in marriages that have broken down and many would like the opportunity to remarry. Up to now, however, our Constitution and laws have failed to give legal recognition to the irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  In reality, we had legal remedies equivalent to divorce in every respect except one, the right to remarry. In view of the widespread evidence of marital breakdown and the suffering of those who endured it without means of re-establishing themselves in society, it is timely that this legislation has come before the House.  The Government recognises the family as a fundamental part of society and is committed to legislation designed to help families.  It set up a Commission on the Family to advise on family issues in the context of a changing economic and social environment. Notwithstanding increased Government support, however, marriage breakdown is still prevalent and increasing.</P>
    <P>Those of us in favour of divorce have based our case on a number of factors, particularly the existence and evidence of marriage breakdown in all social classes and in all parts of the country, urban and rural; the need to remove the sense of isolation and insecurity felt by those whose marriages have failed, the importance of ensuring the dignity and freedom of the person whose marriage has failed to giving them the choice of remarriage if they wish, the desirability of giving full recognition to the growing number of relationships already entered into by persons whose first marriages have failed, the need to correct the injustice and double standards of our laws which permit Church annulments while not recognising remarriage and the importance of having family laws which correctly reflect social realities so that they command the respect of people in the community.</P>
    <P>The anti-divorce lobby argued that the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce would seriously damage children, but that is nonsense.  There is no evidence that children of divorced parents fare better or worse than children <Col N="1813" /> of parents who are separated.  Research has shown that marriage breakdown can damage some children, and in that context it would be honest to say that it is the process of marriage breakdown rather than subsequent divorce which might damage children.  It must be remembered that marriage breakdown does not happen in the court room, it happens in the home and in the heart. The availability of divorce does not cause marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>Marriage breakdown is always devastating for those concerned.  When a marriage breakdown cannot be retrieved many see divorce as the beginning of a healing process, a legal statement whereby people can get on with their lives in a forthright and mature manner. There is strong evidence that marital breakdown can be made less stressful for children if it is handled in an open and responsible way and if it involves sensible arrangements about custody and access.  In an effort to address this issue and protect children in marriage breakdown, substantially increased funding has been provided for counselling and mediation services. Obviously our overall objective is to help parents to resolve their differences or, if they cannot, to help them manage their conflict in a way that is least damaging to children.</P>
    <P>Central to the Government's position on divorce is the need to protect the family and the institution of marriage while at the same time providing remedies for the increasing number of cases of irretrievable breakdown.  Divorce in other countries is available after only short waiting periods, but this legislation provides for a substantial separation period.  Spouses must have lived apart for a period or periods amounting to four out of the previous five years before applying for divorce.  That can hardly be suggested as the introduction of a divorce culture.  It must be remembered there cannot be any change in such conditions unless and until the people decide to make a change in another referendum.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years successive <Col N="1814" /> Governments introduced many changes in the structures relating to family law. It is clear that throughout that time the process of reform in family law could not be complete without addressing the issue of remarriage.  The only remaining issue, following all the legislative and administrative changes of the past ten years, was whether people whose existing marriages had irretrievably broken down should have the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>I and the majority of people on this island are convinced that to continue to deny such a right would represent a grave injustice to many thousands of individuals.  On 24 November last the people exercised their democratic right to amend the Constitution to allow for the introduction of this civil right.</P>
    <P>In its preparation for this legislation, the Government sought to take into account its duty in relation to the institution of marriage and the family, and particularly the rights of children.  In essence, the Government has balanced, to the best of its ability, the needs of a society in which the family has always been central and the needs of many thousands of people trapped in the pain of failed marriages.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives legislative effect to the amendment of the Constitution approved by the people in the referendum of 24 November last and it clearly sets out, in line with the constitutional provisions, the criteria for obtaining a divorce.  It also contains safeguards to ensure that both parties are aware of alternatives to divorce proceedings and to assist attempts at reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The nature of family life in Ireland has changed dramatically over the past 30 years.  The immense social, cultural and economic changes since the 1960s have altered family structures.  Today, the reality is similar to that of our European partners.  That includes a falling marriage rate, an increase in the number of children born outside traditional structures and in the incidence of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>Many people wish to ignore these changes and bury their heads in the <Col N="1815" /> sand.  However, a society concerned about the well-being of its children and its family structures has a duty to respond to these changes which obviously necessitate ongoing reform of our legal system and social services to accommodate the evolving nature of family life.  The only just and mature response to marriage breakdown is to provide legislation for divorce so that separated people have an opportunity to begin again.</P>
    <P>Divorce is a civil right and it is incredible in a modern society that people were forced to be legally tied to a marriage that had long ceased to exist as a loving and supporting relationship.  Divorce provides people with the opportunity to start a new life and bestows on them their full rights as individuals.</P>
    <P>We already have judicial separation and the only difference between judicial separation and divorce is the right to remarry.  There is no lack of compassion and humanity in Irish people and I believe the public will welcome this legislation.  Obviously a sizeable number of people are against divorce because the Catholic Church is against it, but Ireland is a changing society and more people are recognising that many citizens practice other religions or do not have any religion.</P>
    <P>Allowing everyone the right to divorce and remarry, if they wish, is a step towards the real Republic of Connolly and Pearse, a pluralist Republic that will unite Catholic, Protestant and dissenter. This legislation will help to create a progressive, honest, tolerant and more open society for all of us, one which will protect human rights and put an end to the mentality that social problems can be ignored rather than addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody needs to be reminded that this legislation has been a cause of much debate, controversy and deep upset in recent times.  On reflection it is perhaps not surprising since the problem of marital discord and breakdown is one of the most painful issues in modern society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> When I spoke on the matter in the House prior to the divorce referendum campaign, I expressed the sincere wish that the debate should take place in a reasoned and informed manner with both sides putting their case with clarity and tolerance.  Many contributors to the debate participated in such a manner but, unfortunately, the overall impression gained from following the campaign in detail was negative.</P>
    <P>Any neutral observer would have been unlikely to gain significant insight into the likely net impact of introducing divorce.  It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that the electorate is split almost 50-50 on the issue of divorce. While the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; lobby might justifiably feel happy with the eventual outcome on the basis that a win is a win, it would be both undemocratic and damaging to society if the full concerns of almost 50 per cent of the country's voters were conveniently put to one side.  Now that the electorate's slim verdict has been confirmed by the High Court and the Supreme Court it is vital that every effort be made to ensure family life is protected to the maximum degree possible.</P>
    <P>Before addressing areas of particular concern to me in the overall divorce issue, I wish to comment briefly on marital breakdown.  As legislators we must first and foremost recognise that the development of serious problems in any marriage is a personal tragedy for those involved.  Consequently, any steps taken by the State must be motivated by serving their best interests to the fullest possible degree.</P>
    <P>The main parties usually consist of the married couple and any dependent children.  At the best of times it is an extremely difficult task to attempt to serve the best interests of all sides in a conflict.  In the case of marital breakdown a wide variety of scenarios may present themselves.  First, genuine and irreconcilable differences may develop between a married couple; evidence of incompatibility may have been present in the marriage at the outset.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> Such circumstances may provide a certain degree of justification to those who have taken a lead role in securing the introduction of divorce, but what about the rights of the children in the marriage?  They may complain, with a degree of justification, that their parents brought them into the world and gave them a precious family identity which they may see as being threatened by the prospect of divorce.  Any legislative steps we take must incorporate provisions which protect the best interests of children in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The presence of either physical or mental abuse in the family is another reason given to justify the introduction of divorce.  I believe many people who supported the divorce referendum did so because of this seemingly growing problem in our society.  While it would be morally wrong to suggest an abused spouse and children should remain in the family unit in such circumstances, the legal termination of the marriage allows the abuser to participate in another marital contract which may result in more lives being damaged.</P>
    <P>Even in circumstances which seem to justify the concept of legally dissolving a marriage, there is a definite down side to the introduction of divorce.  Other domestic situations are affected by the availability of divorce.  There is the extremely difficult case where one partner is anxious to dissolve the marriage while his or her spouse is equally hopeful of retaining the marital link.  The human dilemma in this case is particularly acute since, in the absence of reconciliation, the outcome is likely to lead to heartbreak on the part of one partner.  To make matters worse the differences in approach between the two partners to the marital difficulties is likely to provoke a further deterioration in their relationship and may force children to take sides with one or other parent. The Bill before us will frequently if not always lead to the eventual dissolution of marriage in such cases, regardless of the opposition of one spouse. This is surely not in accordance with <Col N="1818" /> either the letter or spirit of our Constitution which guarantees to treat the rights of each citizen equally.</P>
    <P>Probably the most worrying question raised by the introduction of divorce is its effect on the nature of the marital contract.  From being a lifelong commitment on the part of both spouses, the legislation before us clearly alters marriage to being a conditional social arrangement which may be unilaterally terminated without major difficulty by either party.  While it must be accepted that a number of well meaning measures have been built into the legislation to prevent the reckless use of divorce, the sad reality is that such provisions are more likely to look comforting on the Statute Book than bestow real protection on the reluctant respondent in divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the implications of introducing divorce for a couple who are experiencing some difficulty in their marriage.  They may make every effort to struggle through their problem towards an eventual resolution, and I do not doubt that many such couples will continue to work at their marraige irrespective of statutory changes in our family law.  However, does anybody realistically suggest that a significant number of such couples will not be tempted to throw in the towel, in the knowledge that they may dissolve their marriage without too many legal difficulties? There is no doubt that many basically sound marriages will be needlessly lost with the introduction of divorce.  In such cases the likely losers will be parents, children and the extended family.</P>
    <P>A major loss in status for the institution of marriage will inevitably follow the introduction of divorce.  Take as an example a young couple who have developed a good relationship and are considering marriage.  Up to now the temptation to get married at an early stage has been tempered by the knowledge that marriage is a lifelong commitment. Consequently, at least one partner is likely to approach the matter prudently and insist on a longer period of preparation before marriage.  Can <Col N="1819" /> anybody suggest that the same level of caution is likely to be exercised when both partners are aware that the marital contract can, if required, be of a temporary rather than permanent nature?</P>
    <P>No matter what way one examines this legislation, there is undoubtedly much reason for grave concern at the likely intermediate and long-term impact of introducing divorce.  Almost every scenario suggests that many people will be hurt by this fateful step. In framing the legislation, therefore, it is vital that every possible prudent safeguard against abuse should be built into its details.</P>
    <P>What is contained in this Bill?  Section 4, Part II, clearly specifies the grounds on which marriage may be dissolved by the courts.  The three core requirements are that a couple must be living apart for at least four years prior to the commencement of proceedings, there must be no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation and, finally, such provisions as a court considers proper, having regard to the circumstances, will be made for the spouse and any dependent members of the family.  I will briefly consider each of these requirements.</P>
    <P>At first glance the requirement for a minimum of four years' separation prior to commencement of divorce proceedings appears to offer some degree of protection.  On closer examination, however, it becomes increasingly likely that the provision is open to abuse.  A couple who have been married for four years and have lived together for most or all of that period can be divorced irrespective of the rights of the children of the marriage.  What mechanism can stop them colluding to overcome the living apart law with the minimum of effort?  The situation in this regard is also by no means clear-cut in the case of a contested divorce.  Disagreement under oath on the matter of living apart is often likely to come down to forcing the court to make a decision to accept one person's word against that of another.  The first requirement is almost certain to be a cause of both difficulty <Col N="1820" /> and conflict in the legal processing of divorce cases.  At the very least, it requires further clarification.</P>
    <P>The second requirement regarding the need to show that there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation seems equally vague and unsatisfactory. While clearly well intentioned, in practical terms can we expect this requirement to be of any value when one partner is determined to follow the divorce proceedings through to a conclusion for whatever motive?  No matter how the respondent may show a desire and willingness to enter wholeheartedly into the process of reconciliation, such a positive attitude will have little if any currency in the face of a cynical application for divorce.  To state otherwise would be flying in the face of reality.</P>
    <P>A close examination of the third requirement can only lead to a mixed interpretation.  It must be acknowledged that the provision comprehensively addresses the issue of marital well being in cases where the applicant has significant financial resources.  However, it is likely that many applicants for divorce will be from middle, lower-middle or lower socio-economic backgrounds. Many are likely to be dependent on the State for their weekly incomes.  In such instances, the family resources, if any, are likely to be exhausted by the legal costs associated with the case.  While the various financial provisions of the Bill seem eminently fair and reasonable, in many instances they are likely to have little or no relevance for the majority of divorce cases which will be processed though the courts.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the weak nature of these clauses is likely to be that a determined partner will be able to force divorce proceedings through the court irrespective of the wishes of his or her spouse.  As a result it is certain that an increasing number of individuals, frequently women, will be divorced against their wishes.  In such cases it is almost inevitable that other family members, especially children, will suffer from the bitter after effects of a contested divorce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> What is the likely overall impact on Irish society of implementing this Bill? It is clear from my contribution that I voted against the referendum.  I believed that the case for divorce was not proven by its advocates during the debate.  In addition to the reasons I have just outlined, I was fearful of the impact of divorce on the extended family.  Consider the pain and upset that is certain to be caused to grandparents.  They will not only lose all meaningful contact with a son or daughter-in-law whom they have grown to accept as a member of their family, but access to much loved grand-children may either drastically diminish or, in extreme circumstances, virtually disappear.  Similar observations may be appropriate for aunts and uncles, especially those who do not have their own children.</P>
    <P>In attempting to see some light in the midst of the clouds of divorce, one might reasonably look at the experience of countries with a similar culture to our own.  It must be admitted that some positive findings have been reported, with many people picking up their lives after divorce and going on to form fulfilling and stable relationships with a minimum of hurt to all involved in the original family unit.  I have no doubt that such outcome will be repeated on many occasions.  However, the introduction of substantial change in our legal system must afford priority to the common good.  In this respect a variety of research findings from other countries are anything but encouraging; clearly the opposite is the case.  The general pattern appears to be that the introduction of divorce leads ultimately to between one-quarter and a half of all marriages ending in dissolution.  An even higher failure rate is evidenced in the case of second and subsequent marriages. In particular women and children are seen to suffer grievously in the aftermath of divorce.  Despite legal directives, the sad reality is that relatively few divorce applicants provide adequate material support for their former families to allow them maintain or <Col N="1822" /> enhance their previous standard of living. Much serious emotional and psychological damage is widely reported.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair to suggest that many of the negative consequences of marriage breakdown are not already suffered by those concerned irrespective of the legal availability of divorce.  To so assert would be to fly in the face of reality.  What must we do now?  No matter how many of us are unhappy with the outcome of the divorce referendum, it is a primary requirement of any democrat to accept the will of the people. Without ruling out the possibility of the matter being put to the people again, it is vital that we ensure that ever step is taken, in the precise wording of the Bill before the House and in the provision of additional resources, to protect the central role of the family in Irish life.</P>
    <P>Much greater emphasis should be placed on the provision of conflict resolution skills within the curriculum of our formal education system and in the context of family support counselling services. It is crucial that the Government should move rapidly and effectively to ensure that the needs of the family are placed fairly and squarely at the top of its agenda.  Not to do so would be a gross and insensitive insult to the expressed wishes of the electorate.  No stone must be left unturned in ensuring that all possible steps are taken to provide real and effective support to couples experiencing the unfortunate trauma of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced to give effect to the result of the referendum on divorce held in November last.  I voted against divorce, although I was in the losing side by a small majority.  Our role today is to pass this Bill, giving real effect to the result of that referendum whether we like it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not agree with many aspects of the debate on the subject.  It was sad to observe how some people, particularly highly respected people like churchmen, bishops and priests, were shouted down <Col N="1823" /> by many, including Government Ministers, in a most illiberal and intolerant manner.  The argument was won by highlighting and pushing individual sad cases rather than the common good of society.</P>
    <P>While some people will benefit from the provisions of this Bill, I foresee many marriages being destabilised through their implementation.  They may help the 4 or 5 per cent whose marriages have broken down but I contend the 95 per cent of present stable marriages will be put in some jeopardy.</P>
    <P>This cult of individualism has gone too far.  We need to engage in a reappraisal of where we are, where we are going, begin to talk about rights and wrongs, entitlements and responsibilities, the good of the individual versus the common good of society.  I fear the introduction of divorce will undermine many stable marriages and inevitably have negative social consequences, as has been the case in many other countries.</P>
    <P>While, of course, aware that some marriages do break down, I am against throwing in the towel merely because 4 or 5 per cent fail to adhere to the rules. On the international scene, it appears that the trend, at least in some countries, is against quickie divorce, against divorce overall making it all the more extraordinary that we should introduce rather liberal divorce.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his honesty in calling this Bill what it is &mdash; Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996 &mdash; having dropped the &ldquo;right to remarriage&rdquo; reference which abounded in the course of the referendum campaign.  The entire campaign was run most unfairly by the Government.  Had the gods been with the anti-divorce people and the weather been better in the west but not so kind in the east, there might well have been a different result.</P>
    <P>Even the Supreme Court concluded that the admitted purpose of the <Col N="1824" /> Government campaign and its unconstitutional funding represented an interference in the conduct of the referendum. In all common sense it was a most unfair campaign run by the Government but the people have spoken and their word is final.  That was more or less admitted in the court's judgment in the case taken by Mr. Des Hanafin when the judge more or less said that the remedy being sought by Mr. Hanafin was not against the Government which had committed the constitutional breach but rather to override and reverse the sovereign will of the electorate, as expressed.  It would have been better had a means been found to rebuke the Government for the disgraceful, one-sided manner in which it campaigned, without ignoring the will of the people.  The Government cannot be proud of the way it conducted the campaign, which was in breach of its constitutional obligations.  Its action was deliberate, conscious, in the sense that it knew exactly what it was doing.  Its campaign was designed to influence the electorate to vote in favour of divorce.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to record my thanks to all those within the main groups and in the many other smaller groups nationwide who fought against the introduction of divorce, being of the deeply-held view that it was against their beliefs.  Nonetheless, the decision has been taken.  When one looks back over the succession of church annulments and foreign divorces, one realises that pattern could not have continued indefinitely.  With the benefit of hindsight we probably should have done something earlier to resolve the problem legally before it came to the matter of divorce.</P>
    <P>Last year, when speaking on the original Bill, I suggested some form of registration or notification of second relationships, giving some legal standing to and recognition of second relationships without threatening existing marriages. Others have suggested that, when presenting oneself for marriage, one might be given two different options &mdash; marriage with the possibility <Col N="1825" /> of divorce or marriage without that proviso. I admit these are all thoughts on what might have been.  The decision has been taken.</P>
    <P>Mr. Des Hanafin's court case over recent months has been interesting.  We owe him a debt of gratitude for having initiated it.  It was extraordinary that the Supreme Court found him to be two-thirds correct but did not grant him victory. I always thought that if one had two-thirds of something in one's pocket, one was a winner but the court has its own form of logic and, in many ways, never ceases to surprise us.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that the expenditure of £500,000 on publicity during the referendum campaign could not have persuaded such a small number of people to change their voting intentions.  I wonder whether the advertising industry remains shell-shocked that £500,000 was spent without yielding a different result.  It has to be admitted that we public representatives often spend some money at election time endeavouring to influence people, but one questions the expenditure of such a large amount in the case of the referendum campaign since we cannot prove it had the desired result.  Is it not a shameful fact that the Government, the body elected by the people to guard and protect the Constitution, in this case has been found to have acted in a totally unconstitutional manner?  Does that not add to the public's general distrust of politicians?  I will not attempt to answer that question.</P>
    <P>I am aware that under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, almost 4,000 couples have separated.  In many respects in recent years the State has been involved in almost encouraging people to break up their marriages.  I would like an analysis of all those separated people or those who described their status as &ldquo;separated&rdquo; on the census form.  Many of my constituents pretend to be separated for financial reasons because the State in its wisdom has been favourable to them.  It often pays people to pretend they are separated and that trend appears to be <Col N="1826" /> continuing.  I can see another wave of such pretence with the introduction next year of the one parent family allowance. Such schemes are genuine, but they are being milked and abused by the wrong people because of the opportunity to do so.  Now that the demand for divorce has been satisfied and it will be introduced, we should adopt a balanced view of family life and instead of encouraging people to break up their marriages, walk away from their responsibilities and pretend they are separated, we should encourage and reward those who keep their marriages and families intact.</P>
    <P>The family is the basic unit of society and one consisting of two parents based on marriage is the ideal.  The Government should not introduce any action or scheme that tries to water down that concept of the family or encourages people to walk away from what most of us would agree is the ideal family unit. We need a new appraisal of various Government social welfare, taxation and housing schemes that will acknowledge, encourage and reward the family that stays together rather than schemes which do the opposite as happened in recent times.</P>
    <P>When this legislation is passed the country will not fall apart overnight.  It will take five, ten or 15 years before we realise the mess we have foisted upon ourselves.  What policy would the Government have adopted if the divorce referendum had been defeated?  I am sure a campaign would have commenced the day after the referendum to hold another one in five to ten years. Irrespective of whether we are talking about social change, divorce or bail, if in ten years opinion polls show a significant number of people want another referendum on divorce or another issue, they should be given that opportunity.  I hope that those who carried out opinion polls on divorce in the past will do so again in five to ten years when we will have had time to reflect on the impact of a divorce culture here.  Such an opinion poll would ascertain people's views on divorce and if there was a large demand for another referendum, one <Col N="1827" /> should be held.  I hold that view not only on divorce but on a wide range of issues because a referendum is the ultimate way people can exercise power in a democracy.  During the divorce campaign there was much talk of giving people a second chance, but I hope that if the people want another divorce referendum, that will be possible.</P>
    <P>This legislation will introduce divorce. What will happen then?  Those with vested interests are already out looking for their pound of flesh.  The legal profession and their runners are demanding an additional £10 million funding for legal aid and the appointment of additional judges.  I wonder if divorce is being introduced to give genuine people a second chance or to create another bonanza for the vultures who fly around society willing to pick on the bones of other people's misery.</P>
    <P>We have heard of the upset that will be caused by some people having to wait 12 months for divorce, for their relationship to be given another label of respectability.  I am not an advocate of encouraging people to queue for anything, but there are many queues in society and a balanced approach should be adopted to them.  While it would be Christian to give people a speedy divorce to allow them to pick up the threads of their lives and move on, I have many constituents who are on the waiting list for major heart surgery, one has been on the list for four years.  If I were asked whether a person waiting four years for a heart bypass who is barely hanging to the threads of life or a person waiting 12 months for a divorce is more deserving of Government funding, my answer would be clear-cut. While a quick divorce would help a person to get on with his or her life, funding targeted at reducing the waiting list for heart surgery would help save people's life.  If extra Government resources are available, there are many demands for them under different ministries.  The needs of the legal profession and of those who wish to avail of divorce are not necessarily a priority and all other <Col N="1828" /> demands should not be pushed aside so that their demands can be fully satisfied. I am concerned that some of the legal profession appear to view the introduction of divorce as another beef tribunal bonanza.</P>
    <P>If the Supreme Court judgment had rejected the will of the people it would have opened a can of worms, but it has sent out an unfortunate signal.  It ruled that a win is a win and that the ballot box is everything.  It is saying that the only rule that applies in an election is the rule of the jungle, the rule that dictates that the fittest will survive.  It condoned any and all methods and gave recognition to the fact that a win is all that is important at the end of an election. We will be involved in another election next year and while many parties have agents and directors of elections who try to restrain members and urge them to play by the rules under fear of threat of sanction, the Supreme Court decided that in any future elections there are no rules other than the rule to win and the means are irrelevant. It is an unfortunate by-product of this issue and it may come back to haunt us in many other respects.</P>
    <P>I accept the result of the referendum as I do not see how I can do otherwise. I suppose I should congratulate those who pressed for divorce.  I admit I did not support it on this occasion or in the past.  In any campaign there is only one winner and the loser must be gracious. The Minister said that the draft Bill was issued before the referendum and that significant amendments will not be accepted.  My party spokesperson wishes to table a large number of amendments and I hope the Minister will be open to accepting some of them.  I realise that the decision on the fundamental question put to the people in the constitutional referendum cannot be changed. If the matter is as simple as the Minister said and he cannot back down, the basic wording put to the people in the referendum should not be watered down.  I have some news on the anti-divorce campaign which did not only begin now. It started before the referendum to <Col N="1829" /> define &ldquo;living apart&rdquo;.  If the Minister cannot accept any major amendments because he must accept the will of the people, neither should he adopt a tough approach by giving an integration which was not clear and not put to the people at that time.  It may be possible, if one is living in a £1 million house on Ailesbury Road, for the husband to live in one wing and the wife to live in another.  For most normal people it is not possible to love apart under the same roof.  My interpretation of living apart is living under a separate roof.  I am amazed and surprised that some people are campaigning for a different interpretation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 32, 42, 54 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>When the Minister announced the first stage of the temporary leasing scheme in April, he indicated he would review the situation for the second and third stages based on the outcome of the first stage.  At his request, that review has now been urgently undertaken and completed by the Milk Quota Review Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the first stage of the temporary leasing scheme should be clarified.  There has been much comment attributing the dissatisfaction with the level of allocations under the first stage to changes made in the operating rules.  The changed rules for the allocation of the temporary leased quota was not a significant factor <Col N="1831" /> in the reduction in the quantities allocated to individual small-scale producers. The primary factor was that the demand for temporary leasing greatly exceeded the supply; the quantity available for allocation amounted to 42 million gallons &mdash; the demand exceeded 130 million gallons.  At the same time the number of smaller producers requesting quota from the scheme has greatly increased &mdash; by some 250 per cent in the past two years.</P>
    <P>Following the recommendations of the review group, it has now been decided to draw up operating rules which will give priority to producers under 35,000 gallons in the second and third stages of this year's temporary leasing scheme.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, within this category, priority will be given to those producers who were allocated quota under the first priority category of the 1994-95 and 1995-96 schemes i.e. producers whose available quotas in those years was less than 30,000 gallons.  Their entitlement to quota will be based on the average of their allocations in those two years, subject to sufficient quota being available. Where these producers have been given their allocations, the remaining quota will be allocated to all other producers in the under 35,000 gallon category.</P>
    <P>Any quota remaining available after the needs of all the applicants in this category have been met will then be allocated to producers in the next priority category, i.e. quotas between 35,000 to 55,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>It is hoped this decision will ease the situation of those smaller scale producers whose needs are greatest.  The final allocation over the two stages will depend on the amount of quota available, and the imbalance between demand and supply under the scheme has to be clearly understood.  The overriding consideration is to give the maximum benefit to the category of small-scale producers with a traditional dependence on temporary leasing.  The Minister has asked the Milk Quota Review Group to consider the outcome <Col N="1832" /> of the second stage after the 31 August 1996 closing date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>What remedy is being advised by the Department for the many small dairy producers who, having built up their cow numbers, face the prospect of having to sell them shortly or face a prohibitive super-levy bill next April?  How is a small-scale producer to stay in business if he is offered only 2,000 or 3,000 gallons where he had 10,000 or 15,000 gallons under previous schemes?  The Minister's reply sets out the technical position, but does the Department have any practical advice for the thousands of small producers who now find themselves in an impossible position and being squeezed out of milk production altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Small-scale producers are facing a major challenge.  That has come about for a number of reasons. Because of the BSE crisis cull cows are now being kept because there is no market for them, and they are producing milk.  I would also emphasise that all our schemes are geared towards the smaller producer.  The milk restructuring scheme is for producers of under 21,800 gallons; the temporary leasing scheme is very much geared towards the smaller producer as is the flexi-milk scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I are mindful that small producers are under continuous pressure.  Coming from a rural constituency that depends to a great extent on milk production, I have been mindful of that since milk quotas were introduced in 1984.  This problem did not arise today or yesterday; it was always there. Under stage one small-scale milk producers got more quota than ever before &mdash; 71 per cent of the 42 million gallons available to them.  It is hoped the quota that will be available will be targeted at small-scale producers who benefited for the past two years and who came to depend on the quota available to survive and make a reasonable income.  We are aware of the challenge facing small-scale producers and all our schemes are geared towards the small farmer.  We <Col N="1833" /> have adapted this scheme, on the recommendation of the Milk Quota Review Group, to suit small farmers.  It is hoped that the arrangements now in place will to some extent meet the points raised by the Deputy today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that part of the problem relates to the rules on land leasing?  Are there any proposals to change the land leasing rules as they militate against small producers getting access to quota? This is a problem that did not arise today or yesterday, but the Minister has confirmed that the demand for temporary quota has risen by 250 per cent. How many farmers does a 250 per cent increase represent, given that we have 40,000 dairy farmers and more than half of them have less than the 30,000 gallons which is regarded as a viable quota?  Does the Minister not recognise that a fairly radical overhaul of the quota leasing system is required if the stagnation in the industry is not to be exacerbated.  Without that, fewer small farmers will stay in milk production and larger producers will take up the slack. That is not in our interests, nor is it the policy of the Department.  What I am asking is the number of farmers represented by that 250 per cent increase and if there will be a radical overhaul of the land leasing arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme's original specifications required a participant farmer to have, by the end of the first year of the REPS plan, at least seven cubic metres of storage capacity per 100 tonnes of silage.  In the revised specifications the period for meeting this requirement was extended to the end of the third year of the plan.  Unfortunately, in the printing of the revised specifications the direct reference to the storage of silage effluent was omitted. An addendum has now been issued to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>In any event it is possible for a farmer making silage to comply with the requirements of the rural environment protection scheme without having a silage effluent tank at the time of application. There is a requirement under the scheme that this can only take place where the approved professional planner considers that the statutory requirements to avoid pollution can be complied with through careful use and good management of existing facilities.  Such facilities must be specified in the REPS plan.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate there is no requirement to have any effluent tank for baled silage produced from wilted grass as such silage does not normally produce effluent.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned, given the review of REPS as a result of ministerial and departmental suspicion that plans may not have been complied with, and REPS planners had submitted plans where the work had not been done?  How does the Minister square the Department's concern with the change in the regulations which now leaves the responsibility solely with the planner to ensure the integrity of this scheme is maintained?  Why has the Department sought to deregulate this scheme?  Is the Minister concerned that its integrity could be put at risk if pollution arose from non-compliance by the planners?</P>

      <P>We are now inspecting plans on foot of which a REPS grant has been paid. A polluter will be punished; there is no place in REPS for any polluter.

Neither of the two farmers involved were in REPS and both had adequate pollution control facilities in place.</P>

    <P>We are trying to encourage sensible management of waste storage and muck spreading and to get farmers to spread half their waste before 1 July and the remainder by September.  We are also trying to encourage them to spread waste during the winter if the land and weather are suitable.  Previous specifications stated that farmers could not spread any waste from November to January.  We have removed that specification as certain parts of the country has land suitable for spreading waste during the winter, weather permitting.  The <Col N="1836" /> REP scheme encourages people to be responsible.</P>

I expect to receive final proposals from the secretary of the Department regarding this reorganisation, which will involve the creation of a number of executive units within the Department, within the next month.</P>

For how much of the Department's budget will the existing accounting officer be responsible, given that more than £1.5 billion will be accounted for by a new accounting officer?

      <P>The present Taoiseach also supports it.  He launched the strategic management initiative document some months ago.  Following that, a special reorganisation committee was set up in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  That will report to the management committee in the Department tomorrow and will make certain recommendations to set up various sections within the Department. In March the Government decided &mdash; it was referred to in a previous question to Deputy Cowen in May &mdash; that an accounting officer would be appointed to manage FEOGA funds. Both agree that restructuring must take place in the Department.  This was agreed in consultation with officials and the Secretary of the Department.</P>
      <P>While I understand the Deputy's point, the matter is now being addressed.  Accounting officers will be appointed and somebody will be in charge of FEOGA funding.  I welcome that development as I am sure the Deputy does.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that a new accounting officer will be responsible for all FEOGA funding, which is very extensive, does the Government propose to designate a new competent authority under article 4 of Regulation 729/70 which deals with the appointment of a <Col N="1838" /> competent authority for this purpose since the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will no longer be the competent authority?

If he has some public engagement today he should have done what other Ministers do from time to time, change the date on which he would answer questions so that he could ensure he could be here.</P>
      <P>Was the Government decision of 12 March 1996 to appoint a new accounting officer for all the FEOGA funds of the Department part and parcel of the negotiations that were then ongoing seeking a reduction in the fine imposed on Ireland, which was subsequently obtained, and a substantial reduction of £15 million to £20 million in the fine was made?  Was this achieved as a result of an assurance by the Irish Government that FEOGA funds would be dealt with efficiently by a new authority and a new accounting officer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish submission to the Commission on the extension of the disadvantaged areas was made in November 1993.  The submission included all the areas which had been recommended by the appeals panel. Following examination of the Irish submission, the Commission indicated that some 37 per cent of the area proposed was not considered eligible for disadvantaged status, as defined by the relevant regulation.  The main reasons given by the Commission related to areas which exceeded the stocking density criteria of 0.99 livestock units per forage hectare, and areas which were not homogeneous areas, e.g. so-called &ldquo;island&rdquo; sites which were not contiguous to existing disadvantaged areas.  On 23 May 1996, the Commission accepted the proposal made by the Commission services that some 128,000 hectares be classified as disadvantaged.  I am glad to confirm that the Council of Agriculture Ministers and the European Parliament will soon complete the formal decision making process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not envisage that any further review of areas for the purpose of designation as disadvantaged will take place. With the completion of the fifth review, some 75 per cent of Ireland is classified as disadvantaged, less favoured area status.  The Minister has already given an assurance that farmers who were unsuccessful in their efforts to achieve disadvantaged area status for their land would be given detailed information on the reasons for EU rejection of their appeal.  The Department has been <Col N="1841" /> engaged in this exercise since I announced the extension of the areas on 23 May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for confirming the first part of my question that 39 per cent of the application collated by the appeals panel was rejected by the Commission.  The Minister did not answer the other part of the question, whether an omission of this magnitude had been made on previous occasions.  The Minister replied to my second question asking whether farmers would have the opportunity to have their case reopened when he said there will be no further review.</P>
      <P>The Minister will realise that this is a central issue for many farmers because higher premium payments are paid to those in disadvantaged areas.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the large measure of discontent and bafflement that many farmers are experiencing as to how this matter was handled. Does he agree it is quite extraordinary that the appeals panel under the chairmanship of Professor Sheehy which included the president of the IFA, Mr. John Donnelly, looked at all these areas which had been excluded up to now and submitted to the Minister the areas that should be included as a result of this review?</P>
      <P>Will he explain why, although the Department felt that the stocking density criteria were met and submitted the application to Brussels, 40 per cent of it has been thrown out?  Many farmers are trying to find out how an application under an independent appeals panel who are acquainted with the criteria of the scheme was vetted and agreed to by the Department, submitted to Brussels and rejected.  Is the Minister suggesting that only 60 per cent of the application was sent to Brussels?</P>

      <P>I am being honest. When one takes the Commission's initial response into consideration we did well to achieve a figure of 127,800 hectares, for which I compliment the Minister and the Department.  Many areas were rejected because of the stocking density.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on having the figure increased to 128,000 hectares.  The fact remains, however, that a total of 40 per cent was rejected.  This means there are thousands of farmers whose lands have not been included, despite the fact that the appeals panel thought otherwise.  I presume there was a difference of opinion between the appeals panel and the Commission on the interpretation of stocking density &mdash; less than one livestock unit per forage hectare.  Will the Minister of State clarify the difference and indicate if in any previous application 40 per cent of areas submitted were rejected?  That simple question has not been answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> Rather than telling farmers in the townlands which have been excluded that they did not meet the stocking density criteria, will the Department make available the detailed data on which the decisions of the appeals panel were based?  Farmers are baffled as to how the appeals panel felt they were eligible for inclusion whereas the Commission did not.  Has the definition of the stocking density been changed?</P>

      <P>The Commission interpreted the directive strictly and suggested that if the proposal was not accepted the decisions made in 1991 might be reopened.  This may have resulted in the removal of some areas from the scheme.  The appeals panel submitted areas with a stocking density close to the specified figure in the hope they would be accepted.  It also tried to have some non-homogeneous areas accepted.  It submitted these in good faith in the hope the Commission would be flexible.  When the matter was pressed the Commission suggested the decisions made in 1991 might be reopened.</P>

      <P>It appears the Commission suggested that if the proposal was not accepted, areas already included in the scheme might be excluded.  Based on this admission, will the Minister of State agree that the reason a total of 40 per cent was rejected was that there was a more narrow interpretation on this occasion of the stocking density criteria?  Will he <Col N="1845" /> recognise that this represented a political failure on the part of the Minister who allowed the Commission to come up with a new interpretation?  Will he agree that had the Commission kept to the interpretation used previously perhaps 10 per cent would have been rejected?

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 22, 23, 24, 34, 47 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that following difficult and protracted negotiations over the past three months, we have succeeded in agreeing a substantial compensation package for Irish producers at the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg this week.  The package, which also includes a continuation of the deseasonalisation premium in the <Col N="1847" /> context of the 1996-97 prices agreement, is worth more than £86 million to Irish beef producers.  These measures will go a long way towards stabilising the industry by making up for losses arising from the BSE crisis and by ensuring that the more orderly slaughtering patterns brought about by the slaughter premium are maintained.  Arising from the loss of confidence in beef, prices to producers have fallen though there has been some recovery in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The package is a significant improvement on the original proposal which was presented at the last Council of Ministers meeting.  At that meeting the Commission proposed a financial package of 650 MECU for all EU producers of which 534 MECU would go towards the topping up of the suckler cow and special beef premia and 116 MECU to special national envelopes to be used for targeting those producers who would not be compensated through the increased premia.  Under that package Irish producers would have received £58 million.  While this was a substantial package it was inadequate to meet the losses being encountered by beef producers. Accordingly, the Government's efforts in getting additional compensation were rewarded at the Florence Summit when the Taoiseach along with Heads of other member states succeeded in getting the Commission to agree to a further increase in the ceiling of the order of 200 MECU.  This brought the total value of the package to 850 MECU, or £700 million, and in the Commission's view this was the maximum available in the 1996 EU budget.</P>
    <P>As a result of this increase the suckler cow premium top-up will now be £22.40 per cow and the special beef premium top-up for both the ten month and 22 month will be £19.08, while the special national discretionary envelope is increased to £13.3 million bringing the total to more than £70 million.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in securing this level of funding can be appreciated when cognisance is taken of the fact that it <Col N="1848" /> represents approximately 10 per cent of the total package while Irish beef production is less than 7 per cent of the EU total.  This represents the very best that could be achieved for Irish producers considering that producers in all member states have suffered major price reductions since the beginning of the crisis.  In some cases the price reductions are greater than those experienced in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The special envelope of £13.3 million comes with the in built flexibility to target those producers, particularly winter finishers, including vulnerable heifer producers, who have experienced the worst effects of this crisis.  My Department will put a process in place to ensure that these payments are made speedily and in the case of the special envelope as equitably as possible.  Effective market support measures have also been put in place at EU level to help the industry.  The opening up of intervention with the lifting or easing of the weight restrictions along with the inclusion of 04 grades has been very helpful in clearing the backlog of cattle which had built up as a result of the crisis.  The fact that there is no intervention tender this week from Ireland for adjudication at tomorrow's beef management committee would seem to indicate that the steer backlog has now been removed and cattle supplies are following the normal disposal pattern for this time of year.</P>
    <P>The increase in export refunds by 12 per cent since 1 May has boosted third country trade.  The major offensive at diplomatic and political level and through An Bord Bia have reassured the authorities in those markets of the safety and quality of Irish beef.  Ministerial visits have been made over the past few months to our major markets in Europe including Russia, which is presently the biggest market for Irish beef.  While most of our markets are now accepting Irish beef two very important ones remain closed.  In the case of Libya, efforts are ongoing to finalise a ministerial visit and to arrange appointments with the appropriate <Col N="1849" /> Ministers there.  In the case of Iran a veterinary delegation is expected in Ireland within the next week or so.  I see this visit as the logical and essential next step to reopening that market.  Good progress has also been made recently as regards freeing product in store which was produced for Iran prior to the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>Because of the fall in consumption in the EU it is recognised that the opening of vital third country markets will be a very important factor in underpinning cattle prices in the autumn.  I will also be insisting on adequate market support measures being available to remove the beef surplus from the market.  The continuation of the deseasonalisation premium will also be critical in encouraging an orderly disposal of cattle towards the end of the year.  If these measures do not ensure an adequate return to producers and reasonable outlets for processors I will be seeking other measures later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>After the flowers and frills and an indication by the Minister that he had a wonderful package for us does he accept, on the basis of what we know and what the farm organisations have said, that the package will meet less than half the losses sustained by farmers since the BSE crisis?  Why were losses incurred before 20 March discounted? Why were export refunds not discussed at Luxembourg?  Given the constraints imposed by GATT on the Commission's room to manoeuvre on export refunds, why have steps not been taken to have GATT renegotiated, given that because of the BSE crisis, we would be well entitled to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Losses before 20 March were incurred prior to the BSE crisis.  This package is targeted at people who have been affected by that crisis.  I am sure all farmers will gain.  Those who <Col N="1850" /> suffered losses before 20 March will gain through premia payments and BSE payments for later dates.</P>
      <P>The House agreed when the last GATT agreement was negotiated by the Fianna Fáil Minister of the day and the then Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, that it would have an adverse impact on Irish agriculture. Export refunds were reduced as a direct result of that agreement.  I agree that GATT agreement was very bad for Ireland.  We should take steps to do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that chickens come home to roost.  I would expect Deputy Byrne to pour cold water on the agreement.  As far as I am concerned, we produce 7 per cent of the produce and we got 10 per cent of the package.  That was very good.  I am sure that we did better than any other country in Europe.  All European countries are suffering a major problem and some of them have been affected more than us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements are now in place for a ministerial visit to Libya.  We have been waiting for this for some time and I hope it will prove to be beneficial.  An Iranian delegation will be visiting Ireland in two weeks time.  They are in France at present.  I hope we can make more progress in the Egyptian market.  I am confident that the situation will have eased for our producers and processors before the end of the year.  However, I do not want to paint too much of an optimistic picture here, but there is a <Col N="1851" /> major challenge ahead for our producers in this whole area.  During the budget negotiations in October the Minister will have an opportunity to seek further compensation for Irish beef producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting there was no crisis in the beef industry prior to 20 March?  If so, what were the farmers' marches in February and March outside this gate about?  The Minister knows full well there was a serious crisis then which was exacerbated by the BSE crisis.  Will the Minister agree that the export refund crisis has affected this country far more than any other economy in the EU and that therefore we had expected a much greater return?  Will the Minister accept that less than half of the problem is accommodated?  Given the Taoiseach's statement yesterday that consumer confidence is the key to recovery for the beef sector, why were the consumer issues not addressed at either Florence or Luxembourg?  What proposals are there to promote consumer confidence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price reductions arose principally from the GATT agreement and everyone knew export refunds would be reduced.  That was part of the crisis at that time.  This compensation package was negotiated on the basis of losses suffered because of the BSE scare.  Regarding consumer issues discussed at Florence, there is a proposal for a major promotion and marketing drive within the EU to be put in place to restore consumer confidence in the beef industry and get people to eat meat again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been suggested already and is ongoing.  If the EU is serious about restoring consumer confidence in the beef industry there will <Col N="1852" /> have to be a major promotion and marketing drive in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will fund this marketing drive to which the Minister of State has referred?  Will it be funded in total by the EU?  How will the £13 million discretionary money at his disposal be distributed?  Will it be concentrated on people who depend on beef for their livelihood?  When will there be a ministerial visit to the Middle East markets?  Will the Minister of State confirm that the Irish Ambassador to Libya, who is based in Rome, has not visited Libya for four years?  Surely this is proof of our claim that there is no concerted Government campaign to open up our third markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The £13 million will be directed at winter fatteners who are affected and at those who are selling heifers.  There will be a particular difficulty in targeting the money at those selling heifers, given that heifers are not included in any scheme.  An increase in the BSE package should help winter fatteners. Regarding the ministerial visit to Libya, hopefully arrangements will be put in place and the Minister should visit Libya &mdash; I do not have the specific date &mdash; in the next three to four weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that farmers are seriously concerned about the prices for weanlings, one year old and two-and-a-half year old cattle in September and October when there is likely to be a glut in the market?  Is the Minister aware that two year old bullocks and three year old bullocks are down £150 per head on this time last year?  Does the Minister intend to address this problem and, if so, will he indicate what steps he will take to ensure that the prices of weanlings, one-and-a-half year old cattle and two-and-a-half year cattle are maintained in September and October at the same level as in 1995?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that I have had regular meetings with <Col N="1853" /> the IFA in Kerry.  Last Monday evening I had a meeting in Tralee with the IFA in Munster on the beef crisis.  I am hopeful that the top up suckler cow premium will be of considerable advantage for suckler cow farmers and also the top up beef premium.  The suckler cow premium at £140 plus the top up of £23 will be of major help.  The special beef premium at £90 per head plus the top up of £19 per head, for cattle up to ten months and under 22 months, should be of considerable assistance to those producers. I accept prices will not return to their former rates.  The increased premiums will be of assistance to those farmers and will help in some way towards compensating them.  I accept beef farmers will not be in the same financial position as this time last year.  There are major difficulties ahead for beef farmers but I hope this package will help.  If it does not work I am confident the Minister will seek further support during the budgetary discussions.</P>

      <P>Bord Bia is in charge of the promotion and marketing of beef and has carried out a major public awareness campaign with the prime purpose of reassuring the consumer that Irish beef is safe to eat, that we have high veterinary standards, that beef is good for you and is important for a balanced diet.  Recent medical evidence would confirm that.  It has issued a large number of promotional leaflets through supermarkets, retail outlets and other sources.  Bord Bia is doing an excellent job in promoting and restoring confidence in Irish beef.  Recently the HORIZONS conference was a tremendous success.  I hope that will help to restore confidence among Irish consumers and also among the numerous foreign buyers who came to the conference and were impressed with what they saw.  A number of these people visited meat plants and farms throughout the country and have been reassured that the quality <Col N="1854" /> of Irish beef is on a par with the best in the world.  They have said that openly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister of State in congratulating those associated with the HORIZONS conference.  The presentation was excellent and I hope that as a result there will be increased sales.  The Minister of State mentioned foreign markets and informed us that an Iranian veterinary delegation will visit here next week.  Is he aware that during the debate on the Agriculture Estimate in committee the Minister confirmed that cross-Border surveillance to prevent illegal smuggling of cattle into this State costs approximately £400,000 per week or up to £20 million in a year? He also confirmed that a computerised movement permit system, compatible with that which exists in Northern Ireland, would cost in the region of £10 million.  When will the Minister obtain approval from the Department of Finance to proceed with the introduction of such a system?  Does the Minister of State agree that if such a system were in place, it would provide an unqualified guarantee &mdash; which many veterinary authorities, including the Iranians, have been seeking &mdash; that contaminated beef could not enter the food chain or the orders we export to Iran?  Will he confirm that a computerised movement permit system is the best guarantee of traceability and that it would be cheaper than the current surveillance activities on the Border?  Those gardaí would be better employed doing their primary job of guarding our citizens on the streets and in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister recently announced that he proposed to put in place a credible traceability system at a cost of approximately £12 million, but other matters must be dealt with first. We lag behind other countries in terms of computerisation of cattle movements, herd testing and so on.  Details of headage grants are computerised, but all matters must be co-ordinated and that will take time.  Due to pressure to introduce a credible traceable system, <Col N="1855" /> the Minister indicated at the HORIZONS conference that this is the way he intends to proceed.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to convince people throughout Europe and in third country markets that our veterinary regime differs from that which operates in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  If we allowed cattle to be taken across the Border without any controls in place it would be difficult to sell our beef abroad.  Border surveillance has been successful in that regard.  The Deputy may be aware of a documentary seen in Germany and elsewhere which showed Northern Ireland cattle moving in and out of this State on a number of occasions.  That caused serious damage to our beef products.  To reassure customers abroad we had to place proper surveillance along the Border so that cattle could not be smuggled from the North.  There have been 129 cases of BSE in this State compared with approximately 1,700 cases in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, while the surveillance is expensive, it is important in reassuring international customers that we operate a different system from Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 26, 29 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1858" /> The funding for the OPARDF, under which the control of farm pollution scheme is implemented, was agreed by the previous administration who negotiated the funding for the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>On taking up appointment I was very concerned to discover that the funds available for the operation of this scheme were seriously inadequate.  It was necessary as a result to suspend the acceptance of new applications on 27 April 1995.  Following negotiations with the Minister for Finance and the European Commission, revised funding arrangements were put in place to meet estimated demand from applicants on hand on 27 April 1995.  These new arrangements involved the transfer of additional resources from elsewhere in the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, as well as bringing forward substantial funds, already available in the operational programme, to 1996 and 1997 from later years.</P>
    <P>The revised funding arrangements enabled my Department to expedite payments to existing approved applicants as investment works were completed and also to issue approvals to outstanding applicants on hands.  Subsequent approvals issued to applicants were on the basis that payment would issue in 1997 when further funds became available.  It is not possible at this stage to bring forward additional funding to 1996.  As regards the BSE scare the Deputy will be aware of the recent package of measures agreed yesterday at the Agriculture Council in Luxembourg, details of which I have already given to the House.</P>
    <P>The position on funding is kept under constant review.  At this stage, however, no savings are envisaged which would permit the reopening of the scheme.  As regards cancellations since 20 March 1996, the position is that over the months April and May 1996 some 82 applications were cancelled.  This compares with 122 cancellations over the same period last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1859" /> I emphasise that the revised funding arrangements, now covering the CFP scheme, represent a major improvement on the position which applicants would have had to face had these not been introduced and that, based on best current estimates, there will be adequate funding to meet existing applications over the period to 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply, but he did not deal with the issue.  A large number of farmers who have entered into commitments and who will not get their grants until next year will be under severe financial pressure because of the BSE crisis.  In reply to an earlier question, the Minister said the extra cow premia was 27 ECUs, while the extra bullock premia was 23 ECUs.  For farmers with small herds, like many of those with which I would deal, that will not tide them over until the grants are paid. They will lose a lot more than that because of the potential drop in prices. Why can the Minister not get the funds from the Minister for Finance to pay the farmers who have entered into these commitments this year?  How is this relevant to arrangements which existed one or two years ago before the BSE scare?  Everything has changed since. Surely the Minister will agree that it is the Government's role to deal with the present, not to talk about the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate what the Deputy says, those who invested in pollution control did so on the understanding that they would not be paid until 1997.  Only for that provision, these people would not have got approval until 1998 or 1999.  There are about 170 applicants in that position representing a grant commitment of approximately £1.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme was underfunded; I am not making a political issue.  The original proposal before our national cake was reduced was £180 million and we got £90 million.  The funds were not <Col N="1860" /> available under the national programme. The original allocation for 1997 was £16 million but we will have to pay out £40 million in that year.  All these people will be taken care of then. They will have to wait another year but luckily interest rates are down if they have to borrow money.  If they are involved in REPS, they will get payments through it.  That is another factor which should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that farmers will be placed under financial pressure because of the BSE scare.  We are doing our best to advance payments and the arrangements which the Minister put in place after securing extra money will ensure that the 18,500 applicants will be looked after by the end of the scheme in 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a number of figures and he said there were commitments of £40 million for 1997.  Is that in respect of work passed, sanctioned and ready for payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some £40 million is available and will be paid.  The financial commitment to the 172 people who have received approval and who have completed the job is £1.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister cannot come up with £1.3 million to pay them now.  He should consult the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Health on how to get money brought forward because they managed to get £80 million and £60 million, respectively, brought forward. The Minister could solve this problem by getting a small amount of money to pay these people this year.  With all the buoyancy about which we hear, surely farmers could be paid now given the crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it seems to be a small sum of money, it has already been brought forward from 1999, which has enabled the Minister to allow these people to go ahead.  Rather than being <Col N="1861" /> paid in 1999, it is better that they are paid in 1997.  However, the Deputy's point is worth considering and I will bring it to the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>A large number of applicants were only too glad to be able to go ahead. In addition to the 18,500 qualified and approved applicants, many others would like to be in a position to go ahead.  We were most accommodating, although these people may now find themselves in financial difficulty.  I will bring the Deputy's point to the Minister's attention and we will look at ways of advancing payment to these people.  I am sure the Minister will ensure they are paid, if it is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that this Government seems set to continue its policy of discrimination against the farming community, particularly against small scale farmers who are being deprived of the opportunity to put in place proper on-farm facilities.  Will the Minister give a commitment as regards counties like Cavan where less than 50 per cent of applications for the control of farmyard pollution scheme have been approved to date?  Those applications were lodged in early 1995.  Will he give me a firm commitment that the remainder will receive immediate approval to enable urgent and necessary work to proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say how much money was decommitted last year and this year under the various schemes?  Does he intend to reintroduce a modified scheme in 1997?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister again consider an amendment we tabled to the last Finance Act, which might help to resolve this problem next year, if not sooner?  Farmers with taxable income would get a tax credit for the amount of grant due to them if payable under the direct grant scheme.  That would release the grant to those farmers with a non-taxable income.  The Minister has confirmed that this scheme is of the highest <Col N="1862" /> priority to ensure environmentally friendly farming and prepare farmers for the competitive future ahead of them in view of the more market oriented agricultural policies that will come onstream at European and other levels.  Given that there is a limited amount of money and there is an oversubscription of applicants, that would be a simple solution.  Will the Minister consider giving a tax credit to those with a taxable income so that they get their money while those with a non-taxable income could apply for the grant scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Smith.  As I said earlier, £90 million is not adequate under the programme.  We have succeeded in increasing the amount, but it is still not enough to meet the demand.  There are small-scale farmers who need to carry out pollution control work but will not be able to do so until after 1999.  As regards the commitment to funding, in 1995 there was a commitment of £22.6 million; in 1996, £18.6 million; in 1997, £40 million; in 1998, £18.8 million and in 1999, £4.8 million.  That money is committed to ensure the 18,500 applications are dealt with.  On Deputy Cowen's question about taxation, which he raised previously with the Minister, I am sure that matter can be considered and I will certainly explore it further.</P>

      <P>The fact that this Bill was published just days after the Supreme Court judgment demonstrates the Government's commitment to regularising the position of the estimated 80,000 people who currently find themselves in a legal limbo. Publication of the Bill, which I hope will progress swiftly through the Oireachtas, is an important milestone in the process of civil reform.  The laws and institutions of a democratic society must allow for the aspirations of all its members.  It must also reflect social reality.  Families in all their permutations make up Irish society.  The 60 year old prohibition on <Col N="1943" /> divorce has not prevented family breakdown. It has, however, made it more difficult for families in crisis to resolve their difficulties with dignity and finality.</P>
      <P>In the Ireland of 1996 families are under threat, not from divorce but from poverty, social disintegration, marginalisation and a myriad of other social and economic factors.  The cohesive strength of family life is undermined by such factors.  It would be simplistic and wrong, however, to equate poverty with marital breakdown.</P>
      <P>Having a job and security reinforces the ties that bind people together but essentially marriage is a contract between two individuals that depends on the free choice of both parties.  The changing of attitudes and the behaviour or outlook of each partner are also central to whether a marriage succeeds.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, established the Commission on the Family.  The brief of the commission is to analyse the needs and priorities of families in the light of changing socio-economic circumstances. The commission will make a valuable contribution to the development of public policy in this area.</P>
      <P>Those who voted for the Government amendment last November are not necessarily pro-divorce; I have yet to meet a person who would claim to be pro-divorce.  Those who voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; were facing up to reality.  They were voting for tolerance and pluralism, for a resolution of conflict, for certainty rather than uncertainty and for civil and social reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who voted against the amendment did so because of profound and sincere concerns about the impact of divorce on families and on society as a whole.  I did not share their view on the amendment but many of the concerns about the future of families are shared by those who voted for divorce, including myself, and they must be addressed.  The Commission on the Family has an important role to play in <Col N="1944" /> that regard.  I hope it will be possible for all sections of society to bridge the divisions that emerged during the referendum campaign and to work together to strengthen families.</P>
    <P>One of the factors driving families apart is domestic violence.  Violence in the home is as unacceptable as violence in the streets.  As somebody who worked for a long time with the victims of domestic violence I welcome the fact that such violence is no longer acceptable. It continues to be a feature of Irish life and it will not go away in the near future but it is no longer acceptable and it is not hidden in the absolute way it was in the past.</P>
    <P>Victims of domestic violence are reaching out for help and that is an important breakthrough.  In 1993, 5,000 calls were received by the women and child unit of the Garda in the Dublin area alone.  A total of 6,000 calls were received in that year by Women's Aid. That is an indication of the extent of domestic violence and the fact that women and children are understanding the concept of zero tolerance in relation to domestic violence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform which will improve the law in relation to domestic violence.  That legislation, which protects cohabiting partners and parents as well as spouses and children, recognises that the nature of Irish households has changed over recent decades and that the nature of domestic violence has changed also. That recognition of change must be central to the process of civil reform.  In accommodating change, we are ensuring that the aspirations of all our citizens are recognised in our social and legal provisions.</P>
    <P>When the referendum was put to the people the Government took the unique decision to publish the Bill in draft form.  The Bill before us today was, in all its essentials, put to a popular vote last November.  It was in the context of the provisions in the draft legislation published last year that a majority of people voted for the amendment.  It is <Col N="1945" /> important that we stay true to the spirit of that decision.</P>
    <P>Having been an Opposition Deputy I understand the impulse to propose amendments to Government legislation. Opposition amendments often clarify and improve legislation but this case is different.  To all intents and purposes the legislation has been passed not by one or both Houses of the Oireachtas but by the people from whom we derive our authority.  Were the final Act to differ substantially from the draft legislation published before the referendum, it would have serious implications, not only for the relationship of trust between voters and public representatives but also for the conduct of future referenda.</P>
    <P>I hope in the light of these considerations the parties opposite will reconsider any amendments they intend tabling and that the progress of this legislation through the Oireachtas will be marked by the same degree of crossparty unity which marked the conduct of the referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>It is just over 70 years since the question of divorce and the associated questions of pluralism, compassion and tolerance first entered political debate. Speaking in the Seanad in 1925, Senator W.B. Yeats advised those who were impatient for change that there was no use quarrelling with icebergs in warm water.  He went on to state his belief that when the icebergs finally melted, Ireland would become an exceedingly tolerant country.  He spoke on behalf of his Protestant brethren but he spoke for others too who wished to see a tolerant and pluralist society.  He stated:</P>
    <P>I think it is tragic that within three years of this country gaining its independence we should be discussing a measure which a minority of this nation considers to be grossly oppressive.  I am proud to consider myself a typical man of that minority. We against whom you have done this thing, are no petty people.  We are one of the great stocks of Europe.  We are the people of Burke; we are the <Col N="1946" /> people of Grattan; we are the people of Swift, the people of Emmet, the people of Parnell.  We have created the most of the modern literature of this country.  We have created the best of its political intelligence.  Yet I do not altogether regret what has happened.  I shall be able to find out, if not I, my children will be able to find out whether we have lost our stamina or not.  You have defined our position and have given us a popular following.  If we have not lost our stamina then your victory will be brief and your defeat final, and when it comes this nation may be transformed.</P>
    <P>Time is different now and we are bringing in legislation which truly reflects pluralism and a tolerance for difference. This is important legislation but it is only one part of an overall package of legislation which recognises that human beings are different and that they are entitled to a second chance if their marriages fail.  That is part and parcel of the views expressed by W.B. Yeats in the Seanad in 1925.  People's civil rights must be recognised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which represents great progress and will help to transform Irish society, and look forward to its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  When the Bill to provide for the amendment to the Constitution in relation to divorce was debated in the House last year I said I was conscious it was one of the most important ever to be discussed in the House, not because it was part of the socio-sexual agenda but because it would affect the very fabric of our society for a long time.</P>
      <P>I am still of that opinion and harbour the same sentiments about the measure before us today.  There is a major difference on this occasion and that is that the people have been consulted in the meantime and have expressed their opinions on the matter, if not over-whelmingly, at least conclusively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> That decision has since been ratified in the highest court in the land which is the reason we have this proposal before us today.  I do not agree with its measure in the same way I did not agree with the original proposal but I accept the democratic will of the people.</P>
    <P>When the Minister closed his book after the referendum result was announced and declared the task done, I was reminded of the words of Banquo, after Macbeth, in questionable circumstances to say the least, had finally assumed the throne of Scotland.  He said:</P>
    <P>Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all</P>
    <P>As the weird women promised; and I fear</P>
    <P>Thou played'st most foully for it.</P>
    <P>Nobody can claim that the result of the referendum was satisfactory and, in other circumstances, such a slim majority would signal a maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>.  However, such a course is not open to us and we must put in place the necessary legislation to give effect to the decision.  This Bill attempts to do that but to turn this proposal into proper legislation is like trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.</P>
    <P>Divorce was touted as a panacea, if not an outright cure, for all ills in marriage breakdown in the frenzied rush to impose it on the people.  As I said previously in this context, the divorce campaign has not been characterised by honesty on the Government's part, no more that the same parties, albeit without Democratic Left, were honest with the people in 1986.  Rash claims were made that anybody who had a difficult life within their marriage would have the means to get out of it if the measure was approved by the people.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>This is legislation for the better off and, without the required money, one must do without divorce and the dubious benefits it brings.  There was little talk about the costs involved before the referendum.  Nobody spoke about the <Col N="1948" /> £10,000 divorce or the fact that the minimum it would cost if there was agreement between the parties was £1,500. Where will the plain people of this country who have little or no property and resources get that sum of money? This is dishonest legislation, a measure which gives false hope to those who innocently think they can go into court and have their marriage declared over and get on with their lives.  That is not the case.  Money, as always, will speak volumes in the courtroom and without money access is denied, as a computer game would put it.</P>
    <P>Remarriage, as Dr. Johnson observed, is the triumph of hope over experience.  We are told that many people in this country harbour hopes of getting back into the marriage market courtesy, of this Bill.  They can do that if they have money but if they do not they can stay married as far as the Minister and the lawyers are concerned.  One can talk about free legal aid but access to the courts will be so difficult that one might as well ask the organisers of the national lottery to pick the few lucky people who will get into the courts, in the same way as they picked the visitors to the American aircraft carrier.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act provided for the appointment of additional judges and streamlining the work of the courts.  Much of this will be set at naught by the increased business of the divorce courts and I have no confidence in either the Minister's resolve or ability to extract from Cabinet the resources to appoint further judges.  He can hardly claim that he provided judges for divorce cases in the last round of judicial appointments when not only this legislation but the constitutional amendment had not been approved.  I hope there will be no clawback in the improvements effected by the Courts and Court Officers Act.  That would be a shattering blow to those who have been waiting for years for justice from this State.</P>
    <P>As a result of the nature and intensity of resistance to divorce, the Minister had to make concessions which will <Col N="1949" /> make the work of the courts far greater than in other jurisdictions.  This means that more court time will be spent on the questions of reconciliation and mediation which makes the appointment of more judges a <i>sine qua non</i> for the proper administration of this measure.</P>
    <P>The Bill runs to 37 pages and the social and humane provisions are dispensed with by page 11.  The rest of the Bill deals with economics, property, pensions, actuarial matters and worldly goods.  There is little or no mention of or provision for compassion and counselling, the alternatives that were bandied about by the Minister and his colleagues as they strove in every way possible to sway a majority of the electorate towards their way of thinking and conditioned them accordingly in the run up to the referendum.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister provide State mediation and counselling services or has this commitment gone the way of so many others of this discredited Administration? Is he not aware that many of the agencies which provide these services, often on a voluntary basis, are being slowly strangled by lack of funding? Does the Minister's commitment to a humane divorce regime run out in section 5 which places the burden of encouraging couples to stay together on the applicant's solicitor?  I can hardly think of a more unsuitable location for a discussion on the possibility of a reconciliation between warring couples than the cold formality of a solicitor's office.  Yet the only requirement on a solicitor acting for an applicant for divorce is that they discuss with their client the possibility of seeking reconciliation or mediation rather than requiring them in the first instance to seek such help. The same applies to the solicitor for the respondent.  Without wishing to impugn the integrity of an excellent legal profession, it is hardly in the financial interests of solicitors that couples do not proceed with their divorce.  Who could reasonably be expected to talk a client out of paying a generous fee?  Being aware of something rather than being <Col N="1950" /> encouraged or required to use it are two different things and, all things considered, I doubt that discussion is sufficient.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the concept of divorce as I remain to be convinced that this measure will improve the fabric of our society. Nevertheless, I am a democrat and I accept the will of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a little over 11 years since I instructed officials in the Department of Justice to begin work on preparing for a referendum on divorce and to prepare the legislation that would be required to give effect to its passing.  I am sceptical about the degree to which we should allow our conduct to be influenced by opinion polls, but in 1986 it appeared there was a good prospect that people would vote to remove the ban on divorce.  We had a debate which was not marked by any great manifestation of understanding or Christian charity and got a negative result.</P>
      <P>What happened in the meantime?  We have had 11 years during which time there was no jurisdiction for divorce and the constitutional ban remained in place.  My information is that the same period was marked by an increasing incidence of marital breakdown even without a divorce jurisdiction and the alleged incitement to marital breakdown constituted by the existence of a divorce jurisdiction.  We did not succeed in what we tried to do in 1986 and since then we have had a further 11 years of dealing with problems that have caused a great deal of pain and emotional suffering for many people, whether they were adults in relationships that had broken down, children of relationships that had broken down or other people witness to these painful situations.  A great many people suffer in such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opponents of the referendum in 1986 succeeded in dragging out the agony for many people for a further 11 years.  They also ensured that during that period more and more people found themselves in situations where <Col N="1951" /> they did not have the type of redress which they believed the law and the Constitution should give them.  We have delayed and denied that legal and constitutional remedy for 11 years. Although I am pleased with the result of the recent referendum, I am sad and angry at the extra suffering and pain we have visited on so many people during that period.  I am not only referring to Members of this House but to many others outside.</P>
    <P>There were many moments of the last campaign that we will remember although we probably would prefer to forget them.  I am among a group of people who were in favour of the measure then proposed and who were described as wife-swapping sodomites by a very Christain lady who took a different view although she did not apply any description to women who favoured divorce.  That illustrates a certain lack of understanding of human emotions, maybe even human sexuality, that was a large part of the problem we have had here for so many years and it certainly had little to do with compassion or Christian charity.</P>
    <P>Happily those 11 intervening years have not been entirely wasted.  Within that period we have had, most notably, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989, an Act of which I am particularly proud.  My party colleague, Deputy Shatter, was the main inspiration behind it, and the Front Bench of my party at the time persuaded the Government of the day to take it on. Deputy Shatter and my colleagues sat on a special committee and prevented that Government from emasculating the Bill.  It took a lot of parliamentary foot-work and finesse to ensure it was not emasculated by the then Government. The value of that Bill is eloquently illustrated in many of the provisions in the Bill before us.  Indeed its value has been admitted and accepted by very many people in the past couple of years, even by those who, in conscience opposed divorce and others who, without a great deal of charity, also opposed divorce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> We have had to deal with many other problems.  Apart from the principle of divorce in 1986, a great many other problems were properly highlighted. There were problems in succession rights of spouses and children, pension rights, social welfare rights and the treatment of divorced spouses for social welfare purposes.  There were problems and questions in regard to the disposition of property between parties to a marriage, others in relation to mediation, counselling, taxation and a great many more.  I have to admit it was something of an eye opener, in the course of the recent referendum debate, to discover that a number of those who spoke about problems that would arise from divorce, in particular those related to succession, appeared to have paid no attention whatever to what had been done in the meantime to address those problems.</P>
    <P>All of those problems raised in 1986, the subject of debate ever since, either have been or are being addressed.  Many of them have been dealt with by the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 and in various finance Acts passed in the meantime.  The Family Law Act of 1995 dealt with a great many of the issues raised, as did the Maintenance Act of 1994 and that just mentioned by Deputy Kenneally, the Court and Court Officers Act 1995.</P>
    <P>It would be silly to pretend it was not until 1996 that we had a sudden spurt of wisdom, a sudden rush of blood to the head, that made it possible for us to deal with all those problems.  That is certainly not the case.  All the issues raised in 1986, in 1995 and in the intervening period have been honestly and forth-rightly addressed in the Acts to which I have referred, introduced by various Governments.  One or two of those Governments did precious little about any of the problems.  Indeed one party in Opposition did nothing at all when in Government, to address any of those problems.  Its performance on this Bill will cast some doubt on the sincerity of its attachment to principles it claims to espouse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> It would be wrong to pretend all of those things had to wait until now to be resolved because that is not true.  In 1986 and 1987 we could have dealt with the problems of succession.  It was not beyond our abilities at that time to deal with pension rights &mdash; as we have done in the intervening period &mdash; to deal with property orders or any of the other issues requiring attention.  It is prefectly reasonable to suppose all of these issues could have been dealt with either in the period between holding a referendum in 1986 and the passage of a divorce Bill later that year, or earlier the following year, on in the period between the enactment of such a Bill and the implementation of its provisions.  It is simply untenable to say these issues could not have been dealt with 11 years ago.  That makes me even more unhappy and sad because we have unnecessarily visited delay, uncertainty and suffering on so many people.  The people who brought those circumstances about have nothing of which to be proud.</P>
    <P>I was astonished a few moments ago to hear Deputy Kenneally claim that some of the measures in this Bill dealing with a number of the problems discussed in the course of this divorce campaign should be regarded as concessions the Minister has had to make which will complicate the work of the courts.  That is utterly dishonest.  I would have more respect for Deputy Kenneally had he said here today that he is utterly and unalterably opposed to divorce and nothing we can say will make him change his mind.  To claim that provisions of this Bill designed to meet real life problems, or allow for our courts to deal with the multitude of different circumstances they are bound to meet in the course of dealing with these cases, will complicate life for the courts and present that as a criticism of this Bill is absolute, sheer hypocrisy and intellectual bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>If we have learned anything in the past 11 years, surely it must be that every individual is different, every marriage is different and, to the extent it is possible to do so, the legislation must <Col N="1954" /> allow the courts to recognise that.  The legislation must allow the courts latitude to deal with the infinity of different circumstances which will be brought before them.  God knows, we have sufficient problems with which to deal.  In the past week a number of my colleagues in this House, sometimes in the context of this Bill, disquiet me a great deal, when they suggested that in current events we are now seeing more consequences of the liberal agenda.  This liberal agenda, so criticised over the past 11 years is being blamed for what appears to be a rising incidence of armed crime, drug addiction, and the emergence of a certain type of vigilantism. It appears the people who opposed this measure, who showed themselves very resourceful in the kinds of arguments they used &mdash; often not very honest &mdash; having lost this issue, now attack from another front, suggesting that this Bill is another part of this liberal agenda that will bring dreadful consequences in its wake.</P>
    <P>I was not only disappointed but appalled to hear Deputy Kenneally claim that divorce was touted as a panacea. In the quietness and tranquility of his mind he should ask himself if he really believes that.  The Minister of State, Deputy McManus, eloquently made the point that nobody who argued in favour of the measure we have taken, passed by the people in the referendum, and who argues in favour of this Bill, likes the idea of divorce or considers it is anything like a panacea.  Deivorce does not cure anything, it provides a legal remedy for a situation.  I have every reason to believe that Deputy Kenneally wants to be honest because I respect the Opposition.  If he sits down and quietly thinks about it, he will understand the nonsense of what he said.  His claim is the most grotesque caricature of the case in favour of divorce that could be uttered.  Claiming that under the Bill divorce will be available for everybody as long as they have £10,000 is the type of scaremongering that bedevils far too much political debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> During the past three years the Minister substantially increased the provision for legal aid, bearing in mind that people will seek the remedy offered by the Bill who will not be able to afford to pay for what they are seeking and who will go to the Free Legal Aid Board.  It is idle, dishonest and unworthy of the Deputy to pretend that is not open to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We all rail against the cost of court proceedings, but as Members we have a duty to legislate and we should do so without the hyperbole and distortion we hear too often in this Chamber.  It costs money to have a court system.  Irrespective of whether we are talking about divorce legislation, criminal law or anything else, there is no way this House can in any way replace that system.  We must have courts to administer our law and, thankfully, it is incumbent on us to have them by virtue of our Constitution.  Having courts costs money.  Most people would expect to spend most of their lives without ever seeing the inside of a court and would not be capable of representing themselves properly or with justice in a court room.  We need advocates in court to make a case on our behalf and that costs money as well.  It is an idle statement to pretend that because court proceedings cost money there is something inherently wrong with them and that is of no help to the people on whose behalf we are legislating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from all the other provisions in the Bill, I am delighted the provision in section 33, dealing with the powers of court to restrain an individual from attempting to prevent or limit the relief which a court would otherwise be able to grant under various orders, is included.  It is a useful and wise provision. Likewise the provisions in section 35, dealing with the exercise of jurisdiction by the courts in relation to <Col N="1956" /> divorce, have been properly and prudently included.  Section 36 provides for notice to be given and I am glad that matter is dealt with in the Bill.  Although it is a reflection of the nature of some of the problems with which we are dealing. I am glad section 37 is included. That section provides that the court in making an order for the grant of a decree of divorce may declare either of the spouses concerned to be unfit to have custody of any children of the family. It is sad that we must make that provision because, irrespective of whatever difficulties there may be, it is not a situation in which we would like to see the children of any marriage, but it is wise and proper to make that provision. None of us political practitioners would have to go very far to find situations where that provision might well be extremely relevant.</P>
    <P>I hope the debate on this Bill will put a fitting end to what has been a very divisive period of 11 years which, I repeat, has unnecessarily prolonged pain, suffering and distress for far too many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. F. Fitzgerald Ms. F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make some brief comments on the Bill I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Taylor, and his staff for the extraordinarily hard work and commitment they have shown to the Bill over a long period.  The Bill remains true to the spirit of what was said and promised to the people during the election campaign.  It is extremely important that it stays true to it and, as the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, said, that we keep faith with the electorate. That has been done in this comprehensive legislation which covers many of the issues of great concern to people expressed during the campaign.  It is important that it does this in such a careful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes's point about the major suffering caused to people.  Marital breakdown is a reality and the Bill reflects that.  It analyses, accepts and deals with it.  It is a different issue to support healthy marriages and <Col N="1957" /> the family, which the Government has a commitment to do.  It has shown that commitment by setting up the Commission on the Family and the Joint Committee on the Family.  There is a good deal of work to be done in reforming our justice system, one which has creaked over many years and the reform of which has been left far too late.  For this we are paying a very high price.  There is no doubt that this Bill will put demands on that system and I urge the Minister to ensure he gets the necessary resources so that couples will not face inordinate costs and delays in seeking justice and having access to the courts.  That is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>This carefully framed legislation reflects a culture that recognises diversity, respects the rights of minorities and is pluralist in its approach.  As legislators we should support it as that is the way forward.  We often look at the past through rose tinted glasses and forget the inequalities children, women and families faced over many years.  A great many supportive services need to be put in place and I hope we can focus on those in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who addressed the House during the debate and I greatly appreciate the general welcome they gave to the Bill.  A number of issues were raised by Deputies.  I do not propose to cover all of them because they will be debated more fully on Committee Stage, but I would like to comment on a number of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to his party's five-year plan to deal with the consequences of marital breakdown, with particular reference to children.  At the time of its publication I welcomed it and undertook to examine it, and that is being done.  Deputy Woods will acknowledge that in the context of providing for divorce the Government has put in place a range of legislative and administrative measures to deal with the consequences of marital breakdown.  In <Col N="1958" /> particular the Government's commitment to supporting the family is seen in its decision to establish the Commission on the Family whose task is to analyse the needs and priorities of families in the light of changing socio-economic circumstances. As a Government, we are committed to supporting the institution of the family, and we are willing to take the steps necessary to give effect to this commitment.</P>
    <P>The welfare of children whose parents experience the trauma of marriage breakdown and who subsequently institute divorce proceedings is a fundamental concern to be considered in the context of the introduction of divorce legislation.  The civil law in relation to children has been updated and developed on a systematic basis in recent years.  We have a body of law comparable with the best in other countries. Important provisions in relation to children have been provided for in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Family Law (protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Judicial Separation Act and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1981 and other legislation.  In addition, as I already indicated to the House, it is my intention to bring forward in the near future proposals to amend aspects of the law on guardianship of children.</P>
    <P>The civil legal aid system has been substantially improved, extended and expanded.  At the beginning of 1994 there were 16 full-time and 19 part-time law centres throughout the country. There are now 26 full-time law centres and, in addition, 17 part-time law centres, a total of 43 centres in all.  The numbers of staff serving with the board has increased from 99 to 225 in the period from 1993 to date.  Notwithstanding the increased demand on the board's services, there has been a continuing reduction in the waiting time at the board's law centres.</P>
    <P>Likewise, in the area of family mediation and marriage counselling, <Col N="1959" /> major extensions and expansions have occurred.  In 1996 I am providing £300,000 for family mediation, more than double the amount allocated in 1993.  In the area of marriage counselling, I acknowledge that work of immense value is done by the many voluntary organisations.  I secured funding of £750,000 for those organisations in 1994 and again in 1995, which represented an increase of 150 per cent over previous years.  I am glad that this allocation is being increased further in 1996 to £900,000.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the alleged ambiguity of wording.  Someone said that the wording contains language that will ultimately have to be interpreted by the courts before absolute clarity with regard to divorce criteria is obtained. Whatever wording was inserted in the Constitution, court interpretation would inevitably have to come into the reckoning. If no wording was inserted, court interpretation of primary legislation would be equally relevant.  The courts have a role to play in interpreting these matters, that is one of their functions under the Constitution, and we should have confidence in the Judiciary to interpret the language of the amendment in a fair and pragmatic manner.  I thank all.  Deputies for their contributions and look forward to further constructive debate on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. F. Fitzgerald Ms. F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to respond to this Adjournment debate.  I welcome the opportunity to raise the question of the major fish kill, apparently caused by industrial pollution, in the river Dodder in south Dublin last weekend.  It is appalling that thousands of fish were killed in a one and a half mile stretch of the river from Rathfarnham to Milltown and Clonskeagh.  It appears to have started in the Churchtown stream linked to the Dodder at the rear of Mount Carmel Hospital and has been described as the worst in many years.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned that an official of the Eastern Fisheries Board said the recent discharge of industrial waste into the river was over a bank holiday weekend and that there appeared to be a pattern of this kind of incident at weekends.  This raises the question of whether an illegal activity of some kind is being carried out in relation to the discharge of pollutants at weekends.  There are real questions about whether that is due to carelessness, incompetence or other reasons.  It is also disturbing that the same official was noted as saying he was not confident that a prosecution would follow.</P>
      <P>Surely we are at a stage of technology where we can identify, in the first instance, where the pollution comes from and take appropriate action.  It is critical that industry develops effective waste management practices which are fully observed.  It is not good enough that an industry along the banks of the Dodder should cause this kind of pollution to a waterway which offers so many facilities and valued by so many people.  It must be asked whether industries are taking enough precautions, whether their awareness levels about the appalling damage that can be done is high enough, and if the fines in place are a strong enough deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note how rarely <Col N="1961" /> one hears about the outcome of prosecutions in this area.  The disruption to water and the damage to our rivers and lakes cannot be allowed to go on this manner.</P>
    <P>I am aware that action is normally taken by local authorities and at fishery board level, but I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the overall sanctions and legislation covering this are effective?  If not, what further action needs to be taken either at a legislative level or otherwise to ensure that the polluter pays?</P>
    <P>The Dodder comes under the control of four local authorities, and there are ongoing and numerous complaints regarding its pollution.  It has also been raised with me that a possible cause of some of the pollution, although not on this occasion, is due to the erosion of the disused tiphead at Friarstown.  When the river is in flood a cascade of rubbish comes downstream, and South Dublin County Council applied unsuccessfully in 1995 for the funding under the small schemes programme to carry out works to alleviate this problem.  This application has been refused and I ask the Minister to give further consideration to it.  I accept that this fish kill is being investigated very thoroughly, and I hope that those responsible will be found and appropriate action taken.</P>
    <P>When I was investigating this and getting the background information, I discovered it was extremely difficult to get a list of the industries that have access to the Dodder and whose practices might lead to this problem.  I have not found it possible to get a comprehensive list of the industries.  It is believed that a factory is causing the problem in this instance.</P>
    <P>This is the second industrial discharge into the Dodder in June, and clearly serious attention must be given to this problem as we move into the summer months.  I also call for increased public access to environmental information and increased information campaigns so that the public can be more actively and appropriately involved in protecting our environment in partnership with the <Col N="1962" /> local authorities.  I look forward to the Minister's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern over the recent fish kill on the river Dodder and other recent fish kills resulting from water pollution.</P>
      <P>Because we are now entering the peak risk period for our waterways, when low water levels and flows are combined with high water temperatures, it is vital that there is increased vigilance in guarding against water pollution.  For this reason and because of my concern at the damage caused in recent years, I issued a public statement on 11 June calling for extra vigilance.</P>
      <P>It is important that extreme care is exercised, in particular by the industrial and agricultural communities in relation to all waste handling and disposal activities. Irresponsible actions by a small number of people can have serious consequences for the wider community through disruption of water supplies and damage to the ecology of our rivers and lakes.  The recent incident on the Dodder illustrates just how vulnerable our rivers and fish life can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities and fishery boards have primary responsibility for pollution prevention and fishery protection in their areas.  Extensive powers are available under the water pollution Acts and fisheries legislation to take effective action against those responsible for pollution and fish kills.  In the very recent case of the Dodder incident, I understand that a full investigation is currently being conducted by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board.  While the investigation is at an early stage, preliminary results indicate that an industrial source was responsible and the local authority is likely to instigate a prosecution in this case.  The local authority, in line with the provisions of the water pollution Acts, will also seek to cover the cost of restitution from the identified source.  Water quality in the effected stretch of the river has returned <Col N="1963" /> to normal and arrangements will be made to restock the river.</P>
    <P>The practice of investigating fish kill incidents and considering legal proceedings is followed by the relevant local authority and fishery board in respect of all fish kills.  Only in exceptional circumstances should the Minister for the Environment become directly involved, as happened in the case of the fish kill which occurred in the River Lung in 1994 when the then Minister asked the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out a special investigation. In general, action is taken at the local authority/fishery board level where well established co-operation between the agencies results in effective sanction against the polluter, which I sincerely hope will be the case in the incident under discussion.</P>
    <P>In view of the functions assigned to local authorities and fishery boards in this area, it would be inappropriate and impractical that I should answer to the House in relation to the particular circumstances of each fish kill.  I am satisfied that adequate powers are available to local authorities under the water pollution Acts to deal with incidents such as the one that happened on the River Dodder in Dublin and also the recent Cork incidents.  I will, of course, keep the situation generally under review.</P>
    <P>On the question of access to information on the environment, the Deputy will be aware that I have greatly broadened the scope of such access.  On industries, I will shortly acquire information on all potential sources of pollution and I will have a toxics inventory release as part of the public information available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The physical and psychological impact on victims of child sexual abuse in both the short and long-term can be, and usually is, devastating.  All <Col N="1964" /> available evidence suggests that paedophiles continue to search out new victims. Where a small number of sex offences against children may genuinely be committed in an impulsive way, in the overwhelming majority of cases the offender has manipulated people and circumstances so as to set up the opportunity to offend.  For example, sex offenders tend to join youth clubs and other organisations with the intention of coming into contact with vulnerable young children.</P>
      <P>The risk of convicted paedophiles reoffending is great and persists over many years, often for life.  The Government recently admitted that, on average, a person convicted of a sexual offence against a child as a teenager will go on to commit an average of a further 380 such offences in his lifetime. Accordingly, it is imperative that the Garda is aware at all times of changes of addresses by paedophiles and that this information is constantly kept updated. If the Garda was armed with such information, it would not only help it identify suspects once a crime has been committed but it could also help it to prevent such crimes.  It would also act as a deterrent to potential re-offenders.  There is, therefore, a compelling need to keep the activities and whereabouts of convicted paedophiles under constant review.  At present a paedophile who is released from prison having served a sentence can roam around the country virtually at will seeking out new victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activities of paedophiles can be monitored as follows.  The Garda should retain at national level a separate register of those convicted of child sexual abuse.  A separate local register should also be available in each Garda district. Paedophiles should be compelled by law to notify the Garda of any change of address.  The relevant legislation should provide that failure to do this would be an offence carrying a mandatory term of imprisonment.  In addition, the requirement to notify changes of address should be made retrospective, if this is constitutionally permissible.  Unless there is some element of retrospection, <Col N="1965" /> it could be some time before those who need to use the records could be confident that the addresses were up to date. In short, there might be no benefit for many years and that would clearly be undesirable.</P>
    <P>If the Government took these simple suggestions on board, it would mean that the Garda would know at all times precisely where convicted paedophiles were and would be able to monitor their activities.  Such an innovation would protect potential victims from paedophiles. Surely that is the least that they and their families are entitled to expect.</P>

      <P>The issue of tackling the tragedy of child sex abuse is being given urgent priority by this Government. Part of this process includes the consideration of how best to protect children from convicted paedophiles.  The Government has published a discussion document on mandatory reporting of child abuse and a number of interested parties have made submissions which are currently being considered by the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for children.</P>
      <P>In addition, arrangements have been agreed between the Department of Health and child care organisations where prospective employers are provided by the Garda Síochána with a statement of criminal convictions, if any, recorded in respect of an applicant for a post which involves substantial access to children.  Such statements are provided with the full knowledge and consent of the applicant and on the understanding that they are made available for the confidential information of the prospective employer only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the child care posts covered by these arrangements are posts in children's residential care centres.  Directions issued by the Minister for Health also require the employing authorities in those centres to undertake checks into the applicant's character, qualifications, work experience and general suitability.  I assure the Deputy that his <Col N="1966" /> specific proposals in this Adjournment debate will be brought to the attention of the Minister of State with special responsibility for children.</P>

      <P>My question concerns an extraordinary matter.  I asked the Minister for Education in a Dáil question whether she would make a grant payable under the remote areas grant scheme to a child from Inishbofin who wished to attend Kylemore Abbey school.  I thought the request was a reasonable one and would be easily acceded to, particularly since there is no other girls' boarding school in County Galway.  In her reply the Minister said she could not accede to that request because the boarding school fees for Kylemore Abbey were in excess of £1,750, but she would pay the grant for the child to attend Kylemore Abbey as a day pupil and stay in a guest house in the area, irrespective of what lodgings would cost &mdash; notwithstanding the fact that a benefactor had offered to make up the difference between the grant and the fees being charged by the school. This is a most extraordinary decision.</P>
      <P>I understand that since that time the school in question has agreed on an exceptional basis to accept pupils who are entitled to the remote areas grant at the amount of grant that the Department is willing to pay.  It is most extraordinary that the Minister refuses to pay the basic grant for the child to attend this boarding school but would not have a problem paying the grant for her to attend it as a day pupil and stay in a guest house in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most parents believe their child would be safer in a boarding school and would be more likely to attend to her studies.  They would have fewer reasons to worry about her behaviour and safety if she were boarding than if she were staying in a guest house, no matter how good.  This is not a matter of cost but of bureaucracy gone mad.  A second such <Col N="1967" /> case has arisen.  Somebody on the mainland made a similar request.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the Minister's interest in the education of island pupils.  What educational arrangements does she propose to make for girls living on islands off County Galway?  According to the replies we have received, parents whose daughters wish to attend second level school are faced with the following options: (1) they do without schooling; (2) they attend day school and stay in lodgings or (3) the parents pay the full cost of boarding school.  The chance of getting lodgings in the Kylemore or Clifden area adjacent to the schools would not be great, but those two places are particularly convenient to Inishbofin Island.  It would be very awkward for a child from Inishbofin to attend school in Galway city.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reconsider her reply?  What arrangements will be made for female students entering the senior cycle for the first time to have boarding school education?  There is no second level school on Inishbofin or Inishmaan and provision for only first and second year post-primary education on Inisheer.  Will the Minister look again at this issue?  I am sure that in spite of bureaucratic rules sanity will prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education is grateful to the Deputy for this opportunity to clarify the position concerning access to second level education in County Galway.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the free post-primary education scheme, provision exists for a scheme of grants towards boarding or lodging costs in respect of pupils whose homes are outside the range of transport services to a second level school providing suitable free post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for the grant, an applicant must be a recognised pupil in a second level school in which the boarding fee charged to parents does not exceed £1,775 per pupil per annum from the <Col N="1968" /> commencement of the school year 1996-97.</P>
    <P>Where it is not feasible for a pupil to attend a boarding school, or where the boarding fee charged to parents exceeds £1,775, a pupil may receive a grant towards the cost of lodgings while attending a day school participating in the free post-primary education scheme.</P>
    <P>As the boarding fee at the school in County Galway to which the Deputy is referring exceeds £1,775, I regret that a pupil attending the school as a boarder would not qualify for assistance. However, I would point out that under the scheme a grant towards the cost of lodgings is available to any pupil from a remote area who wishes to attend the school on a day-time basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to listen to my submission on the need for a post-primary school at Knocklyon.</P>
      <P>A school is a focal point of the community. It is a place where dreams are realised, friendships are forged and plans are made for the future.  I speak as somebody who has been a teacher for some part of my life.  School is a place apart, yet a place at the centre.  It is where character and personality are shaped.  It is a place of learning, an institution yet in some ways a home.  School should be an expansion of the family, a secure and creative environment where the individual feels free to grow, inquire and learn.  The more connections and links developed between school and home the more enjoyable the learning experience becomes and the more secure the young person feels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alice Taylor vividly recounts her childhood experiences of school in her book, <i>To School Through the Fields.</i> In years to come the children of Knocklyon will write their accounts of an educational system that did not care about them, their dreams or the reality of their <Col N="1969" /> daily lives.  These children will write of their journey to school through the choked up traffic chaos of suburban south Dublin and all because this Labour Minister for Education thought that they and their families were too well off.</P>
    <P>Disadvantage has many guises and comes in many forms.  The people of Knocklyon work hard, pay their taxes and make a valuable contribution to the development of this society.  All parents want only the very best for their children. They want their children to make a similar contribution to the development of their community and country.  I suggest it is not too much to ask for their basic rights.  Looking for their basic rights is not placing somebody else at a disadvantage.  Seeking post-primary education for your children is not being greedy.  On the contrary every other parish in my constituency has at least one post-primary school in their area.</P>
    <P>Knocklyon has a burgeoning population. It has few facilities, the result of bad planning and unabated property development.  Its population is equal to that of many a large thriving country town.  It has a primary school so large that the pupils are not allowed to run during break time, not as a matter of management policy as in other schools but simply because there is not enough room.  These pupils disperse to 29 post primary schools in the South Dublin area.  Knocklyon has no heart but the Minister for Education can give it one.</P>
    <P>There is a proven need for a post primary school.  The Minister and I can throw statistics at each other until the next election.  People matter, children matter and futures matter.  In my view that is the bottom line.  The very future of the fabric of one of Dublin's fastest growing suburbs is at stake.  The Minister has the answer.  She can give Knocklyon a centre of educational excellence, a tribute to her own philosophy of alleviating educational disadvantage. She has it in her gift to provide the people of Knocklyon with a focal learning point for the community.  By granting a school for Knocklyon the whole of the local population will be <Col N="1970" /> open to new educational experience. Knocklyon would be particularly well placed to take advantage of the Minister's well publicised aims in the White Paper of being inclusive and bringing all sections of the community, including business and enterprise, into the education process.</P>
    <P>The Minister is denying many families the opportunity to avail of co-education. Her commitment to this ideal lies in tatters. She is preventing the forging of friendships, building a community and the betterment of society.  Without communities there can be no society.  In its place one would have human jungle without any values, connection or commitment to its future.  This would result in breakdown.</P>
    <P>By granting permission for the school the Minister would allow children to go to school through the fields, to continue to develop friendships formed at an earlier stage which can only help to build society.  She would allow girls and boys to grow and mature together as young responsible and mutually respectful adults who will contribute positively to their community.  She would open up countless opportunities for second chance education, further education and, most important of all, shared education between adults and children of the community.  I can think of no other community which would benefit more from a post-primary school.</P>
    <P>A community school means a school for the community.  A community without a school can never hope to be a proper community.  Will the Minister deny the people their legitimate rights or will she be the builder of dreams?  For 17 years the people of Knocklyon have been patient but their patience is wearing thin and they are becoming restless. I share their impatience and restlessness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair and the Deputy for giving me this opportunity of clarifying the position concerning the Department of Education's site at Scholarstown Road, Knocklyon, Dublin 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> The site was purchased initially by the Department in 1982 for the purpose of providing a post-primary school in the Knocklyon area.  In February 1994, the services of a planning consultant, Dr. Michael Bannon of UCD, were enlisted to provide an independent assessment of the impact of demographic trends and housing developments in the area. The main conclusion of Dr. Bannon's report, which was published in September 1994, was that a new post-primary school in Knocklyon was not warranted.</P>
    <P>In November last, following representations made by the Deputy, other public representatives and the Knocklyon Post-Primary Committee, the Minister for Education asked that the position be re-examined in the light of the latest data available.  Dr. Bannon reassessed the position, taking account of current enrolment trends, school accommodation, existing and planned, and house building in the general area.  He also took into consideration the Knocklyon post-primary committee's response to his original report and the assessment of it carried out by a consultant, Mr. Hendrik van der Kamp, at the request of the committee.  Dr. Bannon concluded that developments since his first report did not affect his original recommendation that a new post-primary school in Knocklyon was not required.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the Department that the demand for second-level school places in the Knocklyon area can best be met by providing additional accommodation at Coláiste Éanna, Ballyroan, and Templeogue College.</P>
    <P>With regard to Coláiste Éanna, the first phase of the extension project, comprising 743 square metres and costing approximately £470,000, is now completed. The accommodation provided in this phase consists of seven general <Col N="1972" /> classrooms, a commerce room, a staff room, a social studies room and a language laboratory.  The schedule of accommodation for the second phase provides for 2,000 square metres of accommodation. Architectural planning is under way for this project.</P>
    <P>The planning of a 1,050 square metre extension at Templeogue College is also under way.  The accommodation to be provided consists of four general classrooms, a language laboratory, a science laboratory and preparation area, a demonstration room, and art and craft room and a technology room.  All the proposed works I described are intended to cater for the projected long-term enrolments in both schools, including the anticipated enrolment of pupils from the Knocklyon area.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it was decided that the Scholarstown Road site was no longer required for educational purposes and the question of disposing of the property arose.</P>
    <P>More recently, however, the situation relating to the potential use of the site has changed.  An application for sanction to establish a Gaelscoil in the Knocklyon area has been made to the Department and is under examination. Given that the proposed school has not yet been sanctioned, it would be premature at this stage to make any definitive statement as to the implications for the future use of the Department's site. However, until a decision has been made on the establishment of the Gaelscoil and a technical examination made of the potential site requirements involved, the Department has decided that it would be prudent not to dispose of the site at Scholarstown Road and action in this regard has been deferred for the time being.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 2 July 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 25, 27, 35 and 119 together.  I fully recognise the importance of fostering customer and consumer confidence in our beef and in that regard being able to give the greatest possible assurance to consumers at home and abroad of the source and status of the raw material.  I am satisfied that we are in a position to successfully give high levels of assurance to the market on both the origin and the wholesomeness of our products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In giving assurances on the origins of the product we make use of many sources of information on the animals in the national herd and their various locations throughout their lifetime.  The main sources of such information are the cattle identity system and the extensive and comprehensive records on <Col N="1864" /> herds and animals tested annually under the disease eradication schemes.  These records are mainly manual with a limited amount computerised.</P>
    <P>There are also other potential sources of information on animal location which can be utilised and which if developed and combined with the disease scheme records could give on computer a comprehensive life history on any animal at any moment in time.</P>
    <P>In my recent statement I signalled my intention to develop the most comprehensive possible animal history or traceability system using a wide range of location information sources such as disease schemes, premium and headage schemes, movements off farms, movements in and out of marts, disposal for slaughter or export, etc.  The comparability of the system we design with those operated elsewhere, including Northern Ireland, would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Such a system has to be computer driven and supported.  In that regard our present animal location information is only partially computerised and considerable investment and development is necessary to arrive at the comprehensive computerised system to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The short-term aim is to centralise our present animal location information data on one computer file which will be available to assist our veterinary certification service in its work.  In the medium to long-term the aim is to develop the comprehensive traceability system to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to put a precise timeframe on that development but the most important computer supported elements should be in place within two years with the full system taking about another year to be fully operational.</P>
    <P>It is also difficult to give precise estimates of cost but over a two to three year period it is likely that at least some £12 million will be needed to fund the development of the computer systems and pay for the hardware, software and communications systems.  I cannot say to what extent the costs would have to be fully met by the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 28, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently revised the agri-environmental specifications which are the framework within which plans under the rural environment protection scheme (REPS) are drawn up by professional planners approved by the Department.  Such plans must set out the works to be carried out annually to comply with REPS measures.  Farmers who fail to comply with their commitments run the risk of obtaining reduced payments or face disqualification from the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specifications were revised to <Col N="1868" /> amplify and clarify certain aspects of the scheme and to give practical effect to modifications to the scheme which had been approved by the European Commission in late 1995.</P>
    <P>One of the more significant changes to the specification from a farmer's perspective is that it recognises the reality that much work and many payments under the control of farm pollution scheme (CFP) will not be completed until 1998.  Indeed some work of this nature will have to be completed without any grant aid.  The specifications in this regard have, essentially, been modified to give effect to a three year derogation approved by the European Commission for carrying out specified pollution control works.  Previously, REPS participants were required to have all pollution control works completed by the end of the first year of the REPS plan.  The three year derogation was sought by my Department to facilitate an orderly completion of construction works.  The one year time limit was making this impossible to achieve and furthermore some of the proposed work would not be grant aided because it was regrettably necessary to curtail the CFP scheme.</P>
    <P>As I am sure Deputies are aware, REPS places a major emphasis on good waste management practices.  To this end the revised specifications place a requirement on professional planners to inform participant farmers of their statutory obligations <i>vis-á-vis</i> pollution control, as enforced by local authorities and fisheries boards.  In drawing up REPS plans these professional planners must be satisfied that pollution can be avoided through careful use and good management of existing facilities.  Furthermore, REPS partipicant farmers must follow a strict waste management code which requires them to landspread half the waste produced on the farm by 1 July each year and the remainder by 30 September each year.  Additionally strict landspreading precautions must be complied with in disposing of farm wastes on REPS farms.</P>
    <P>A specific objective under the CFP <Col N="1869" /> scheme is the reduction of ground and surface water pollution with a view to improving water quality and the natural aquatic environment.  The scheme was drafted and is implemented with this specific objective in mind.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that my Department, through REPS and indeed other pollution control schemes such as CFP, seeks to achieve the same objectives as local authorities in the area of pollution control i.e. to avoid pollution and to bring about an improved water quality in our rivers and lakes.  To this end I am satisfied that the revised REPS specifications, when applied at farm level, will provide for a level of pollution control which is very much in line with the standards required by local authorities.  Furthermore, I take this opportunity to assure the Deputies that the basic principle of sustainability which underpins REPS has not been underlined in any way as a result of this revision.</P>

      <P>A system of compliance checks and penalties is in place for all participants in the rural environmental protection scheme.  At present all cases are being checked.  In cases where a participant has not carried out specific work during the first year in the scheme, penalties ranging from 10 per cent to 100 per cent of payment are imposed, depending on the importance of the measure in the scheme.  In cases where a 100 per cent penalty is imposed the participant is excluded from the scheme and a refund of all of any aid paid may be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that these controls, coupled with existing spot checks carried out by my Department, will ensure <Col N="1870" /> that REPS is implemented in the true spirit of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The best interests of the Irish farmers and the enhancement of the agri-environment can be served only by operating effective control and monitoring arrangements.  I stress the REPS participants who farm in accordance with the specifications of the scheme have nothing to fear from the control measures outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Animal Remedies Act, 1993, and regulations made thereunder provide a comprehensive basis for the enforcement of the law prohibiting the use of growth promoters and other illegal substances.  The enforcement powers available to authorised officers under the Act are the most stringent in the European Union. I am satisfied that these provisions as they stand are adequate.</P>
      <P>The penalties for breaches of the Act are very severe.  The courts may impose:</P>
      <P>&mdash;on summary conviction, a fine of up to £1,000 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both;</P>
      <P>&mdash;on conviction of indictment, a fine of up to £100,000 (or, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, £250,000) or imprisonment for up to ten years, or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the court may order the forfeiture of an animal or animal remedy to which an offence relates.  The courts may also ban a person who has been convicted on indictment from keeping animals, animal remedies or being engaged in the production of food for <Col N="1871" /> human or animal consumption.  The duration of such a ban is the discretion of the court and may be for life.  Nevertheless, I am considering a legislative amendment whereby, a farmer would, as a statutory consequence of conviction for a serious offence, be banned from farming.  Such a disqualification is being considered given the serious consequence of the illegal use of growth promotion.  Protection of the food chain is the shared responsibility of producers and processors.  In order to reinforce this responsibility, I am also considering an amendment to the legislation to provide for the regular publication of the results including the source of the sample, of testing carried out by my Department.</P>

      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) 2080/92 which is the basis for the current afforestation grant and forestry premium schemes provides that private persons as well as farmers, who undertake afforestation of agricultural land, are entitled to both grant and premium payments.  I, therefore, have no plans to confine premium payments to farmers, nor would it be legally possible to do so.</P>
      <P>Premium payments are differentiated in favour of farmers.  For instance, under the current forestry premium scheme, farmers are entitled to receive premium of up to £300 per hectare per annum over a period of 20 years, a total of £6,000 per hectare over that period, whereas the maximum payment for non-farmers is £120 per hectare per annum for a period of 15 years, or a total of £1,800 per hectare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 48, 49 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to third country markets for Irish beef is kept under constant review and all appropriate action is being taken to ensure that our cattle and beef products have free access to all markets worldwide.</P>
      <P>Many of the concerns raised by the recent BSE crisis are technical.  The Diplomatic Service, An Bord Bia and the Department continue to address these concerns and provide the necessary reassurances regarding the safety and quality of Irish beef to all existing and potential customers.  In that context a very considerable amount of technical data on our control systems has been provided and a considerable number of markets remain open to Irish products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> I am pleased to report that a veterinary delegation from Iran will be in Dublin next week to inspect the control systems in place in Ireland and I hope to discuss the conditions for the resumption of trade to this very important market. This visit will be a critical step in the process and whatever further action is necessary will be considered in the light of that visit.</P>
    <P>Saudi Arabia has recently introduced new regulations regarding imports of meat and related products following the BSE crisis.  My Department has, as a matter of urgency, prepared a comprehensive response to these regulations. We have been in touch with the Saudi Minister of Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is also intended that there be a ministerial visit to Libya as soon as the necessary arrangements have been put in place by the Libyan authorities.  It is a matter of some frustration that the visit has not taken place before now. Libya is a very important market particularly for live cattle and the reopening of that outlet would be of particular benefit to Irish cattle producers.  Efforts are ongoing on a regular basis to finalise the details of that visit.</P>
    <P>The market for beef continues to be very difficult in the wake of the BSE crisis.  The main challenge is the restoration of consumer confidence in beef and this is taking some time to achieve. The question of promotional visits to third country markets is under constant consideration but the correct timing of these promotions is very important.  A very successful promotional visit to Russia was recently held.  This was the biggest market for Irish beef in 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 33 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>About three-quarters of all the cases relating to my Department and dealt with by the Ombudsman arise in the area of headage and other livestock grants.  In his report for 1995 the Ombudsman lists 203 cases completed for my Department (of which 154 cases were in the headage and other livestock grants areas).  Taken against the back-ground of the number of applications for these schemes which have arisen from about 280,000 in 1990 to 593,000 in 1995 the number of cases dealt with by the Ombudsman represents only a tiny fraction of the total number of cases (about 1 in 4,000 in the headage and livestock grants area).  Indeed when account is taken of the fact that 110 of these 203 cases were either not upheld, discontinued or withdrawn the number of cases which were resolved or in which assistance was provided is only 93 (or about 1 in 6,000 of the headage and livestock grants applications).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very high standards should be expected of all Departments and with this in mind I introduced the Charter of Rights for Farmers.  The charter includes the establishment of an appeals unit within my Department.  This provides another avenue of redress for farmers who are dissatisfied with any aspects of their applications under the <Col N="1875" /> various schemes operated by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The EU budgetary allocation for the top-up ewe premium to Irish sheep producers in the non-disadvantaged areas, agreed at the December 1995 meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers, has been provided.  Payment of the premium, however, requires the adoption of specific legislation by the EU Council of Ministers.  The European Commission has submitted a proposal to the Council for a regulation to implement this agreement but the proposal cannot be adopted until the European Parliament delivers its opinion, which is expected in July.  I will seek to ensure that the Council will adopt the proposal immediately the opinion of the European Parliament has been delivered.  Payment will then be made as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The average June lamb price received by producers is at a record high this year in comparison with June prices for the last decade.  The price trend of the past two months has followed a seasonal pattern which occurs when lamb supply is boosted by the availability of new season lamb.  The current week's lamb price is 25 per cent above that for the same week last year and is 8 per cent above the previous year's level.  By any standards the returns to sheep producers have been good during 1996.</P>

      <P>I have raised with the EU Commission the difficulties which the eligible land rule is causing cereal producers here and I have proposed a number of solutions to the problem.  These proposals are currently being considered in Brussels.  In the meantime I have introduced some flexibility in the rule under which farmers can transfer eligibility from eligible to ineligible land within a holding</P>

      <P>On-going discussions have reached a position where the outline plans for the office requirements have been agreed with the European Commission; the site at Grange, County Meath has been selected and approved as the permanent location for the office; preliminary agreement in principle has been reached with the European Commissioner for Personnel and Administration for the erection and fitting out of the office accommodation under the direction of the Office of Public Works with the cost being borne by the European Commission; consultants have been engaged by the Office of Public Works to carry out detailed <Col N="1879" /> design work for the building and a formal request will shortly be made to the European Commission to conclude legal contracts to underpin the arrangements.</P>
      <P>The European Commission envisages the temporary relocation of a small advance guard to Dublin pending the completion of the permanent accommodation at Grange.

      <P>In July 1988, shortly after information on BSE was first made public, my Department <Col N="1883" /> ceased issuing licences for the importation of meat and bone meal from the United Kingdom, thereby effectively banning such imports.  Prior to that, a licence was required for the importation of such material under the Importation of Carcases and Animal Products (Prohib-ition) Order, 1966.  This ban was reinforced on 28 March 1996 by the European Communities (Importation of Bovine Animals and Products obtained from Bovine Animals from the United Kingdom) Regulations, 1996.  These regulations gave effect to the EU Commission decision banning imports from the UK of meat and meat products including mammalian derived meat and bone meal.</P>

In 1995, the Exchequer supplemented the lottery allocation of £220,000 by £180,000, bringing the total allocation for cultural relations with other countries to £400,000.  There is no difference between the activities funded <Col N="1885" /> under the G.1, national lottery, and G.2, Exchequer, sub-heads.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the allocation available through my Department for cultural relations with other countries is £510,000, of which £220,000 is from lottery funding.</P>
      <P>Grants are made under these headings by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the advice of the Cultural Relations Committee and go towards the promotion of Irish cultural and artistic events, lecture tours, etc. abroad.</P>
      <P>Applications for such grants may be received from groups and individuals anywhere in Ireland and in many cases are not readily identifiable with particular geographic locations.  Furthermore, most of the amounts granted are of the nature expended either abroad or on travel abroad.  Identification of expenditure by county or constituency is not therefore feasible.  I will send a complete schedule detailing the grants paid in 1995 to the Deputy.  Information on grants paid in 1996 will be available at the end of this year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A considerable volume of reasearch has been carried out internationally by various scientifc and health authorities including the World Health Organisation, into the possible adverse effects of non-ionising radiation associated with electromagnetic fields. All significant research in this area is monitored here by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, with whom my Department <Col N="1890" /> maintains liaison in relation to the human health aspects.</P>
      <P>As regards electricity installations, the general body of scientific evidence to date has not established an association between this form of radiation and ill-health.  As regards mobile phone base stations, the most recent position on health aspects can be found in the statement issued in April 1996 by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, which assessed all recent published scientific literature in the area.  This concluded that there is no substantive evidence that adverse health effects can occur in people exposed to levels of non-ionising radiation at or below guidelines set by the International Radiation Protection Association in 1988.  According to measurements made by Forbairt at a number of locations, the highest exposure levels in the vicinity of base station tower in Ireland are about 1,000 times lower than the IRPA levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As I stated publicly on a number of occasions, I am committed to putting the resources in place to support the development of enhanced maternity services in Cork.  I was pleased, therefore, to learn recently that consensus had been reached between the agencies in Cork to amalgamate the services on the Cork University Hospital site.</P>
      <P>It is understood by all parties concerned that this is a long-term solution which will now require detailed planning and examination by the Southern Health Board, in close consultation with the Department.  In this regard, the Deputy will wish to know that I recently gave the go-ahead to the establishment of a project team, whose task is to prepare a design brief for the development. I have received the Southern Health Board's nominees for the project team and I would expect the first meeting to take place in the coming weeks.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have received the <Col N="1892" /> application to which the Deputy refers. This proposal is one of many requests for significant capital funding which have received from the Western Health Board.  These various requests are being considered in my Department in the light of the major capital funding commitments which have been made to the board in recent times and having regard to the competing priorities for such funding in the board's area and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The health allocation of national lottery funds for 1996 is £22.084 million.  This includes £4 million which forms part of the funding for the capital programme.

A further £3.340 million is allocated to health agencies to fund the respite care grants scheme and the schemes of grants to voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question relates to the scheme of special housing aid for the elderly which is operated by a task force representative of voluntary bodies, Government Departments, local authorities and FÁS and administered by the health boards, under the aegis of my Department.  An initial allocation of £400,000 for 1996 was notified by the task force to the Southern Health Board for the operation of the scheme within its area.  A further allocation for 1996 will be notified to the health board later in the year.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Greater Dublin Water Supply Strategic Study, I approved a major integrated water conservation project to actively reduce leakage in the greater Dublin distribution system from just under 40 per cent to 20 per cent over an initial five year period.  It is estimated that this will yield savings in the region of 20 million gallons of water per day.  A Cohesion Fund application, seeking EU co-financing for this project was submtted to the European Commission in March this year.  The public procurement procedures to select specialist leakage <Col N="1898" /> reduction service providers have already commenced.  The water conservation project includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of infrastructure such as telemetry to monitor and maintain achieved levels of leakage reduction and to facilitate more efficient management of Dublin's water resources.  The project will benefit all relevant local authorities in the greater Dublin area, including South Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>A major expansion and refurbishment project is at present under way at the Leixlip water plant.  This project will increase the plant's treatment capacity from 22 million gallons per day to 38 million gallons per day.  The work already completed at the Leixlip plant has resulted in significant additional supplies being made available to the Dublin area.  I have also approved contract documents for the construction of a new clearwater tank and pumping station which, when completed, will allow for improved distribution within the greater Dublin area.</P>

A comprehensive review of the impact, effectiveness and cost of the urban renewal schemes which have operated to date is currently under way to assist in the formulation of future policy in this area.</P>
      <P>It is not intended that the current scheme will be extended to any additional towns or areas.

    <P>The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 1995 <Col N="1910" /> was 544 pupils.

    <P>I have no plans at present to extend the disadvantaged area scheme to the school in question.  However, the Deputy may be aware that I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  The initiative is in response to reports which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations in the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.  In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports. Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the schools in question, inviting their application. The centre will prioritise all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome.  Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five-year development plans. Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage.  Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>In 1993, the latest year for which information is available, out of the 10,252 committals to prison, 277 people were committed by the courts for non-payment of debts, default of sureties and contempt of court.  This represented less than 3 per cent of total committals for that year.  At any one time, persons in these categories represent less than one-half of one per cent of persons in custody.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100, 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Committee on Human Rights expressed its concern over the use of imprisonment in cases of wilful refusal to obey a court order for payment of money, without specifying civil debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently reviewing the question of providing alternatives to imprisonment in cases of non-payment of debtfines including the question of a system <Col N="1913" /> of attachment of income where a court could order debts to be deducted from a person's income.  The issue of the scope of such a system, and whether it should be confined to civil cases where actions have been taken for non-payment of a debt, will form part of that examination as will the cases where there is no income or an income from social welfare only.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has issued two reports on debt collection. The first deals with the law relating to sheriffs and the second with retention of title.  These reports, in so far as they relate to matters for which I have responsibility, are under consideration in my Department at present.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  I understand from them that the Investigation Unit commonly known as the &ldquo;Murder Squad&rdquo; which was attached to the Technical Bureau at Garda Headquarters was decentralised on a divisional basis in 1988.</P>
      <P>A pool of expertise has been retained at Garda Headquarters and these members are available on request to divisional officers in major and complex cases.  There are trained teams of investigators within each Garda division and extra members are available to any division for major crime investigations as and when required.  Forensic-technical support, such as crime scene examiners, fingerprints, ballistics etc. continues to be provided from Garda Headquarters. Training in the investigation of murder and serious crime is provided to members of the force on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation, with the training and development of investigators nationwide, has made the divisional investigation teams self-sufficient and, of course, more readily available at short notice.  This means that investigations are now working nearer sources of intelligence and have a knowledge of the local community.  In addition, their services can be used effectively on other duties when not engaged on major crime investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána have the skills and expertise necessary to successfully investigate all serious crimes, including murder.  The Garda authorities consider that the <Col N="1915" /> existing arrangements provide for a more efficient and effective use of Garda resources and there are no plans at present to alter them.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice for the Minister for Justice to comment in detail on provisional crime figures.  Accordingly, all I propose to say in this case is that the provisional figures compiled for the first five months of 1996 show that there has been a decrease in the overall number of indictable crimes recorded as compared to the corresponding period last year.</P>
      <P>I have on many occasions outlined in the Dáil the wide-ranging measures that have been taken to combat crime, including legislation, regulations, ministerial orders, administrative changes e.g. regionalisation of Garda, courts service decision etc.  I will continue to process further changes in the law as required as well as providing continued resources for the fight against crime.</P>

    <P>A deciding officer disallowed her claim to benefit.  The decision was made on the basis that the person concerned <Col N="1923" /> took a voluntary career break, her contract of service with her employers was not broken and consequently she was not considered to be unemployed.</P>
    <P>The person concerned appealed the decision, was granted an oral hearing and her appeal was disallowed by an independent appeals officer on 11 June 1996.</P>

      <P>Under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which came into effect on 13 May 1996, responsibility for the regulation of bank charges has been transferred to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Under that provision credit institutions have a period of three months within which they must notify the Director about existing charges.  A small number of institutions have already done this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once this notification has taken place institutions may apply for increases in existing rates.  They can also apply for the introduction of new charges not already notified.  In addition, the Director can issue directions to institutions in <Col N="1924" /> respect of such charges, including prohibitions. The Director has informed the Minister with responsibility for commerce, science and technology that, so far, no increases have been sought in existing rates nor have any applications been received in respect of new charges.</P>
    <P>While the Director cannot issue directions in respect of existing charges, it is his intention to take these into account when examining increases and considering applications for new charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that the system as outlined provides adequate protection for consumers in this area.</P>

    <P>While the Deputy will be aware that examinership is a court procedure, a requirement exists to notify the Companies Registration Office in each case. Accordingly, the above figures, which are the latest available from the Companies Registration Office, are based on examinership appointments notified to that office and relate to the date of <Col N="1925" /> registration of the relevant documents and not to the actual date of appointment.</P>
    <P>With regard to plans for amending the examinership legislation, the Minister with responsibility for commerce, science and technology is at present considering proposals prepared on foot of the recommendations of the Company Law Review Group in this area and he intends to bring forward legislation to implement those proposals which he considers appropriate.</P>

      <P>The small business sector is of vital importance to the national economy and is a major priority for the Government.  Complementing the priority given to small businesses at national level, I am determined that the small business sector will be given high priority at EU level during the six months of Ireland's Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important items on which we must strive to reach agreement during our Presidency is a new multiannual programme for SMEs and <Col N="1926" /> the craft sector.  The programme provides the legal and budgetary basis for community enterprise policy actions which are not based on other general community policies and will cover the period 1997 to 2000.</P>
    <P>The third programme proposes activities which are vital to the development of SMEs in Europe and reflects priorities identified by small businesses in Ireland in recent years.  The five primary aims of the programme are: to simplify and improve the administrative and regulatory business environment; to improve the financial environment for enterprises; to help SMEs to Europeanise and internationalise their strategies, in particular through better information services; to enhance SME competitiveness and improve access to research, innovation and training; and to promote entrepreneurship and support special target groups such as small and craft enterprises.  Ensuring agreement for this programme during the Irish Presidency will establish a work programme at EU level for the coming four years designed to enhance the operating invironment for small businesses and encourage growth and employment creation.</P>
    <P>A revised integrated programme in favour of SMEs and the craft sector is currently under discussion within the Commission and the document is expected in the very near future.  In this context, I am currently having discussions with the Commission with a view to bringing a resolution to Council with appropriate emphasis on the needs of small businesses.</P>
    <P>In November, I will host a major SME forum in Dublin Castle which will be designed to identify best European practices in the area of support services to enterprises with particular emphasis on establishing the most appropriate services to meet the needs of enterprises in the start-up phase and early years of development.  This forum, which will be part funded by the European Commission, will bring to Dublin almost 300 representatives from the 15 member states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> I am close to finalising agreement with the Commission on the holding of another forum in Dublin in December aimed specifically at small business and craft enterprises.  The December forum will discuss key issues for small businesses and is part of the process for preparation for the Third European Conference on the Craft Industry and Small Enterprises which will be held in Milan in May of next year.  The aim of the preparatory forum and the Milan forum is to ensure that the needs of small business are widely debated and taken into account in development of Community and national policies affecting them.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has also taken a Presidency initiative in a research context. The EU RTD policy advisory committee CREST has established an <i>ad hoc</i> working group, chaired by Ireland, to specifically address the role of SMEs in an RTD context.  The group will do a comparative analysis of schemes and initiatives, at EU, national and regional level that foster SME participation in RTD activities.  It will make recommendations which will: feed into the process for developing strategic aims-directions under the Fifth Framework Programme for RTD; ensure appropriate interface and complementarity between national and EU schemes; and optimise SME participation in these schemes.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> group will shortly present its report which will be the subject of conclusions at the December Research Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention <Col N="1928" /> of the Minister with responsibility for commerce, science and technology as chair of the Consumer Council during our forthcoming Presidency, to concentrate on achieving as much progress as possible in a number of key consumer protection areas.  The subjects which have been targeted as priority issues, and which the Minister feels will be of most benefit to consumers, are Consumer Access to Justice &mdash; this draft directive represents a logical and significant step in the advancement and protection of consumer rights.  It has been framed in the context of the completion of the internal market and the development and proliferation of new distance selling techniques such as minitel and teleshopping, which allow products and services to move from the supplier in one member state to the consumer in another.  The directive will enable injunctions to be taken against perpetrators of unlawful practices aimed at consumers in another member state.  It is intended that the injunction would be sought by legally recognised consumer groups or other competent bodies in the country in which the complaint originated. At the November Council meeting the Irish Presidency will seek to progress the draft directive, and detailed work towards that work will commence immediately under the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>Settlement of Consumer Disputes in the Internal Market is a Commission initiative, which takes the form of an Action Plan, when taken together with the previously mentioned draft directive on access to justice, is designed to provide consumers with an efficient and speedy avenue of redress in relation to complaints.  The plan envisages a simple, efficient system, similar to our own small claims procedure, for the settlement of cross-border consumer disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the proposals in the Draft Amending Directive on Consumer Credit is to harmonise the application of a common formula for the calculation of APR throughout the EU.  In addition, the proposals provide for the use of a Community-wide symbol <Col N="1929" /> accompanying the APR quotation to enable consumers to compare, with certainty and confidence, the credit products available throughout the EU.</P>
    <P>Action on the Protection of the Vulnerable Consumer is an initiative which will be taken by the Irish Presidency to highlight the plight of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society. The basic principles are still in the formulation stage but it is my intention that a comprehensive proposal on the subject will be ready for presentation at the Consumer Council next November. A draft discussion paper has been prepared on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Conference on &ldquo;the Consumer in the Information Society&rdquo; which is due to take place on 3 and 4 September, is an Irish Presidency initiative, in cooperation with the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  Themes which the conference would hope to explore include affordable access for all consumers to new communications technologies and information services; benefits-concerns for consumers; and the establishment of an effective regulatory system and of legal and contractual standards.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing there are some other important matters which will remain unresolved from the current Presidency.  These include draft directives on Distance Contracts and Comparative Advertising, both of which may need to be steered through the conciliation and co-decision procedures involving the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, met a delegation from BEUC, the European Consumers' Organisation, on 7 June.  BEUC has 30 member organisations, including the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  Following the meeting BEUC, which has raised a range of issues on which it sought progress, issued a press statement indicating its welcome for the Irish Presidency's obvious commitment to strengthening EU consumer policy.</P>

The strategy, which covers the period up to the end of 1999, provides for a total investment of £641 million in the industry, of which £283 million, including £205 million in EU aid, will be provided from public funds.

      <P>At producer level through a special supplementary measure to the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) financial incentives are available to farmers who are engaged in or who convert to organic farming systems. The introduction of this measure has increased the number of farmers opting to farm organically.</P>
      <P>In the area of research the provision of grant aid from my Department has allowed for considerable research into organic farming by Teagasc at its organic unit in Jobstown Castle and at its centre in Kildalton.  Research has also been carried out at Mountbellew Agriculture College.</P>
      <P>My Department has approved three private inspection bodies to carry out inspections and certification work under an EU regulation in relation to the organic production of plants and plant products.  These bodies are also operating standards for organic live-stock production.</P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-1999 an allocation of £1 million has been provided for marketing, promotion and distribution projects. A number of applications are being considered for grant aid under this scheme at present.

      <P>My overall objective during Ireland's forthcoming Presidency will be to further the interests of the agriculture, food and forestry sectors in the Union generally and in Ireland by the efficient and effective conduct of the Council's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major priority of the Irish Presidency will be to achieve a satisfactory resolution of the difficulties in the beef <Col N="1936" /> sector arising from BSE, including a restoration of consumer confidence in beef and changes in the market organisation which will better suit the sector in the longer term.  The finalisation of the 1996-97 prices package and the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector on which the June Council meeting failed to reach agreement will also be given priority attention.</P>
    <P>A further priority will be to secure a satisfactory outcome to the debate within the Council on the reports which the Commission is required to carry out on the application of the quota system in the sheepmeat sector and of the quotas transfer and national reserve arrangement for the suckler cow premium and to bring any resultant Commission proposals to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>Other priorities of direct interest to Irish agriculture will be the finalisation of a number of proposals in the veterinary area relating to food safety, animal welfare and trade, the siting of a new EU veterinary agency in Ireland and agreement on a common organisation of the market in potatoes.  There will also be a number of major issues such as the reform of the market organisations for wine, olive oil and tobacco which, though of less direct concern to Ireland, I intend to pursue as priorities during the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I recently introduced a further scheme for the subsidisation of the purchase of quota by smaller scale producers, who satisfy the specified criteria, as set down under the 1996 milk quota restructuring scheme. The rate of subsidy has been set at a <Col N="1937" /> range of £0.40 to £0.50 per gallon.  The exact rate of subsidy will be determined by the level of applications.</P>
