    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach state whether the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, will include changes in the DPP's office? Given the report prepared by Grant Thornton on the DPP's office, what action does the Government intend to take, if it is not included in the legislation? Will the Taoiseach tell the House why this important report which was completed and presented to the Government at the beginning of February reached the Dáil Library only yesterday? This is an important report and it has been allowed to sit around for five months.</P>
      <P>On the issue of crime generally will the Taoiseach clarify the Strategic Management Initiative which has not yet been debated in this House, except for a five minute hearing.  It recommends that when the cross-departmental groups get their acts together they look at issues such as child care, drugs and other matters. It appears from what the Minister for Justice said that this group will examine the Garda administration difficulties. The Taoiseach and I have spent much time dealing with the report and we are familiar with it &mdash; I thanked the Taoiseach before for his involvement in it.  This group is at a preliminary stage. In its early deliberations it suggested setting up an SMI group, a Cabinet subgroup, a development of project teams, a strategic result areas group and a cross-departmental teams group.  We are trying to help the Garda and if we are to set up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assist Deputy Ahern in raising relevant matters but this is a rather long speech about miscellaneous matters of varying <Col N="476" /> kinds.  I feel sure there is a more appropriate way of dealing with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately there are a lot of miscellaneous matters which happen to be very important and we are trying to bring them to the attention of the Government.  The question I am asking the Taoiseach is how can the Strategic Management Initiative &mdash; which this House and the relevant Minister of State said will take some years to operate &mdash; assist the Garda if it has to go through this convoluted process?  It would be far better, as this Government is always doing, to appoint outside consultants. At this stage they are already consulting the association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly this is not appropriate to the Order of Business. In respect of matters appertaining to crime there will be a considerable opportunity for Members to raise such matters.  They are clearly set out in Items Nos. 13, 14, 15 and 16 and ought not to arise now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if the Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will include an amendment in respect of the DPP's office as recommended in the Grant Thornton report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report in question is a preliminary report and the beginning of a study.  There is no likelihood that legislative changes would be required or capable of being made in the time between now and 25 July when it is hoped the Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be brought before the House.  A number of other points were made by the Deputy but, unfortunately they are more appropriate to Question Time or to the debate we will have on 25 July.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Government decision to publish legislation to provide for holding a referendum on the bail issue in November is it the intention to hold a referendum on the same day in relation to Cabinet confidentiality and any other matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No final decision has been taken on that issue but, as the Deputy is aware, work is proceeding on drafting appropriate amendments to the Constitution in the area of Cabinet confidentiality. No decision has yet been taken as to when that referendum might be held but certainly the possibility of holding the two referenda on the same day has not been excluded.</P>

      <P>On a related matter to that raised by Deputy Ahern in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions' office, reforms have been promised and a review is taking place following a consultancy report.  In the light of the fact that this Government has signed up to a proposal put forward by this side of the House for a unified prosecution service what legislative proposals will be introduced in relation to putting that proposal in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, the review is proceeding.  It will not be possible until the review has concluded to say what precise legislative proposals, if any, are necessary.  Certainly if legislative proposals are necessary they will be brought forward.  I know the Deputy has been concerned about this matter for some time.  As the Deputy is aware we have increased the accountability of the office, as a result of exchanges between the Deputy and myself here.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as the Deputy acknowledged, a thorough review &mdash; and perhaps the first review &mdash; of the operations of the DPP's office since it was established in the 1970s is now being undertaken.  To the best of my knowledge no similar review of the DPP's office was undertaken by any previous Government.  It is important to allow the review to conclude before being categoric about the precise legislative changes that are necessary.  If legislative changes are necessary they will be made and the Deputy has my assurance on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be necessary to bring forward legislation if the Government adopts a different way of dealing with the capital programme?  Traditionally it has been funded directly by <Col N="479" /> Government projects.  It appears from what the Minister for Justice said today that she will look at a proposal for design, build and lease.  Is it not the case that in relation to detention centres the Government had, for many months, a proposal to design, fund, build and lease a modern prison facility which shows that an outline plan could be ready in 30 days and, with planning permission, in three to six months it could be under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Deputy's consistent pursuit of this matter. We will endeavour to have the Bill ready, if we can, for that date.  The Bill consists of 227 sections, the heads of which were not even cleared for drafting when we came into office.  We have cleared them for drafting, thanks to the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, who was able to overcome interdepartmental arguments that had remained unresolved throughout the tenure of two or three previous Governments. We were able to proceed to draft the Bill and while we will endeavour to have it ready before 25 July, that may not be possible.  It will certainly be published during the summer.  I hope the Deputy will be able to participate constructively in the debate on the Bill because she has been calling for it for some time.</P>

      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1996, to provide access to polling stations for disabled <Col N="486" /> people was a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill that was not opposed in the House.  It subsequently went to Committee which supported the principle. As far as I know, there is no difficulty between Government and Opposition with the Bill and the Minister has been helpful in this regard.  Will the Taoiseach agree to have the Bill mentioned here on 25 July so that it can go back to Committee for reconstruction in September?  There is no necessity for the Bill to have another Second Stage debate in the House.  If the Bill could be mentioned on 25 July it would allow Deputy Mary Wallace to process it in Committee with the Minister who, I understand, supports the principles of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The House will recall that I undertook on Committee Stage to re-examine sections 25, 26 and 27.  These sections repeat sections 29, 30 and 31 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, and were included in that Act to ensure that persons could not imply, by the simple registration of a name, business name, trademark or design, that their company's products sold or manufactured by them, were produced to any particular standard in an effort to deceive the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke stated on Committee Stage that the use of the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; is commonplace and cited company names which include it.  I accept the point made by the Deputy in that <Col N="495" /> regard.  The risk of deception, albeit small, still exists and I propose retention of the sections.  However, having regard to the common usage of the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; I propose an amendment to sections 25, 26 and 27 which will clarify the sections and retain their intent.  I propose therefore that the registration of the words &ldquo;Irish standard&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Caighdeán Éireannach&rdquo;, or the initials CE or IS, or a name which nearly resembles any such words or initials so as to be likely to deceive will be prohibited.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When this amendment was debated on Committee Stage I dealt with it in considerable detail because I believe the lines I am seeking to delete are not in line with the normal process of industrial relations.  In that respect I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  The thrust of my argument is that there has not been full consultation in regard to the Bill with the trade union and staff representatives.  There is an obvious fear among the staff that changes will occur and that there will be a worsening of conditions of employment because, for the first time, we are copperfastening in legislation temporary modes of employment.  I accept the Minister of State has instructed that some positions be changed from temporary to permanent but that poses a real dilemma for the trade union involved in that some of its members will enter the promised land while others will be forever in temporary employment.  I am happy for those who will enter permanent employment, having been in temporary employment, but I urge the Minister of State to look at this matter again.  We are told this is being included in the Bill because we must conform to EU regulations in regard to accreditation, but a letter from the German construction committee indicates that its federal Government is not dancing in this respect to the tune of the accreditation demanded by the EU.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  In that correspondence the committee has shown quite clearly that this is a matter of domestic responsibility.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment on the basis that the wording in this section is not in line <Col N="498" /> with standard industrial relations practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister of State to ensure the Bill has the full support of the staff. A problem still exists, however, in regard to section 38 (1) (b).  I ask the Minister to outline the reason for the inclusion of this section.  Is he aware of staff concerns about the inclusion, for the first time, of contract work in the Bill?  I welcome the fact that approximately 38 people &mdash; perhaps the Minister will give us the exact number &mdash; will be made permanent but is there any way those staff members could be made permanent before the establishment day? The staff acknowledge there will always be contract employees in the organisation but I ask the Minister to address the two outstanding elements, namely, making staff permanent before the establishment day and the possibility of deleting the contract element referred to in section 38 (1) (b), even at this late stage.  Will the Minister give his views on these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Rourke would be to excise fully from the Bill the only provision relating to the contract staff currently employed in the NSAI.  Such excision would not be in the best interests of the staff concerned. Its inclusion recognises their existence and regularises their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the new Authority.  The nature of the functions of the NSAI is such that there will always be fluctuations in demand for its services.  There has been a great demand in recent times for registration to the ISO 9000 series of quality management system standards and, while it is considered that demand for registration to those standards has reached a plateau, continuous assessment of registered companies is necessary. I confirm that a large number of staff currently on contract will be made permanent if the Bill is passed and the NSAI is accredited by the National Accreditation Board as fulfilling all the <Col N="499" /> requirements of an independent certification body.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that demand for other NSAI standards and certification schemes will continue to grow, particularly in relation to environmental management &mdash; the IS310 series.  There is potential for additional permanent employment opportunities in the authority. Rather than perpetuate the concept of contract or temporary employment in semi-State companies, this section gives rights, recognises contracts and ensures that NSAI will continue to accept those contracts.  Accordingly, the amendment proposed cannot be accepted.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy O'Rourke's and Deputy Sean Ryan's acknowledgment that I have tilted the balance of this Bill since we started to such an extent that the concerns and requests made to me by the trade union representing the staff concerned and staff representatives have been met.  The issue has been narrowed to the contract staff.  It is untrue there was not full consultation, as Deputy O'Rourke said.  Rarely in my experience has there been more consultation. We should have enacted this Bill at least three months ago, but I, not my officials, was responsible for the delays. Time and time again after meeting the staff, I sent the officials back to research arguments advanced by the staff representatives. There has been exhaustive consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke also said that conditions are worsening.  However, that is not true.  There is a significant advance in conditions which would not normally be accepted in these circumstances.  I cannot and I do not want to deal with Deputy Sean Ryan's query about the number of staff who will be offered permanent contracts because I am not dealing with industrial relations issues. There are 52 temporary or contract staff in the organisation as it now exists, which is a high proportion of staff.  I have made it clear to the NSAI that it is not a good situation &mdash; I accept the argument about fluctuations &mdash; and that <Col N="500" /> once this Bill is enacted it will not be desirable for such a high proportion of people to continue as temporary staff.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to trade numbers with Deputy Seán Ryan or engage in negotiations in this House, which is the function of the trade union concerned and the management, a substantial number of existing contract people will be offered permanent employment for the first time.  That is as it should be.  As a result, these people will have security of tenure which they could not look forward to before.  I have also made it clear that as a result of the projected workload of the authority, it is likely that an additional number of the remaining people will be made permanent in the future.  I also want to make it clear, in case I am misleading anyone, that there will always be a demand for a small number of contract staff because that is the nature of the business.  That has never been challenged during any of the discussions I have had with the staff. They accept there could be an optimum number of permanent staff yet, because of the workload, there will be a demand for contract staff with the requisite expertise.</P>
    <P>It is untrue there will not be full consultation or that conditions will worsen &mdash; there is a significant enhancement of conditions.  Deputy O'Rourke said that for the first time we were giving expression in law to the concept of contract staff.  I do not know if that is true but it is important to acknowledge the existence of these staff, to protect them and to ensure that the contracts of those who are not offered permanent posts continue.  I am happy that will be the smaller number of the two.  However, it is important that they do not find themselves out of work on Monday morning or whenever the operative date of this legislation is.  I hope that answers Deputy Seán Ryan's query.</P>
    <P>It would not help if I became involved in the nitty-gritty arguments about the number of people who will be made permanent.  I am pleased that so many people will become permanent as a result of this legislation.  I do not deny <Col N="501" /> the staff's right to make representations to whomever they wish, but I ask them to acknowledge that if there was a different Minister in this position, they might not have made the same progress. It is a significant improvement and I hope the staff will acknowledge that, as Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Seán Ryan have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I and Deputy Seán Ryan acknowledge the change in status for some of the staff.  My argument was based on two points.  We are recognising contract temporary employment in legislation.  Some members of the staff representative group will become permanent while others will not.  As trade unionists, we know that is an invidious position in which to put people.</P>
      <P>The Minister concentrated on what he has done, which we acknowledge. However, if democracy had not dictated that staff representatives could meet anyone in an elected assemply to put their points of view, which they did, would we have been so successful?  Perhaps we should praise democracy rather than the Minister's efforts.  Government and Opposition have an important role to play.  It is important that the Opposition is alert and willing to meet people who want to express a point of view, which we can then incorporate in legislation. This progress, where some members were made permanent, involves both Government and Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepted some of my amendments which he encapsulated in his amendments on Committee Stage.  I stick by my amendment but rather than pressing it to a vote now I will call one at the end of the debate.</P>

      <P>I acceded to the Deputy's request and got the advice of the parliamentary draftsman on the impact of the proposed substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in section 38 (2).  I was advised that this is not acceptable on the grounds that there must be provision for a final arbiter.  If there is disagreement between Forfás and the staff of NSAI as regards their terms and conditions which cannot be resolved between the two bodies the matter would be decided by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. They are responsible for all matters relating to the staffing and financing of the Authority and decisions taken in that context are open to judicial review. The parliamentary draftsman gave an adamant response to Deputy O'Rourke's request.  In his adamant view there must be a final arbiter and it is not intended that the Minister would intrude on the process earlier than would be necessary for finality.  If the normal process of consultation and so on resolves the issue, so be it.  If the industrial relations machinery must be resorted to and it resolves the process, that is to be welcomed, but there must be finality.  The Minister for Finance has the ultimate responsibility and in the view of the draftsman the technical framing of the section is as it should be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter on Committee Stage and said I would table an amendment on Report Stage.  We all appreciate that there is a world of difference, a large chasm, between the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo;. Because of the issues involved and the <Col N="503" /> strength of the case I put forward, I ask the Minister of State to accept &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo;. &ldquo;Conclusion&rdquo; is like &ldquo;consumer and consensus&rdquo; which are meant to induce cosiness and warmth and signify that something is being done and views are being taken on board, but consultation often ends in a decision being taken that reflects the views of only one side.  &ldquo;Negotiation&rdquo; is clearly understood to mean the trading of points of views and arrangements until a negotiated settlement is reached.  That is why I put forward &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; to replace &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.  Negotiations are in the ambit of trade relations and staff representatives putting forward their views. Consultations usually take place in circumstances where jobs and conditions are not at issue and usually involve the exchange of views and arriving at a consensus of opinion.  &ldquo;Negotiation&rdquo; is a stronger word with a deeper meaning which invokes rights being traded for rights.  I ask the Minister of State who has a long experience of negotiations on trade union matters to recognise the veracity of what I am saying and to accept the word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo;.  It would give the staff some crumb of comfort to know they would have a right to negotiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Rourke's amendment.  The word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; is rather passive in the context of the Bill, particularly in view of the many concerns expressed about the staffing of the agency.  The word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; would be more proactive and would admit that there would be a more active role for the trade unions and staff associations concerned.  &ldquo;Consultation&rdquo; is rather vague and implies that one will consult with someone, but one may not accept what is said, whereas &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; implies that different points of view are exchanged and there is an active sense of people debating the course to be embarked upon.  The term &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; is preferable in the circumstances, particularly in regard to the Authority.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; as it appears in the Bill is intended to encompass the nature of the relationship that Deputy O'Rourke advocated in terms of normal trade union industrial relation practices.

      <P>I just wished to give some information to Deputy O'Rourke on consultation and negotiation.  If the view of the House is that Deputy O'Rourke's amendment ought to be accepted against the background we have discussed in terms of assuaging the feelings of staff and so on, I would be disposed towards accepting it.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he was open to persuasion and would wait to hear further arguments.  I thank Deputies Keogh and Seán Ryan for their support on this amendment.  It may seem a small thing to have accepted, but I would be less than gracious if I did not thank the Minister.  I am glad the word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; is to be included.  The people concerned have a right to trade, which is what negotiation is about, and the inclusion of the word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; will go some way to assuage the very deep anxieties of some staff members about this Bill.  On the basis that the Minister has agreed to accept this amendment, which in a small way encapsulates many of my concerns, my party will not press a vote on the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of thanking the House for their co-operation in facilitating the passage of the Bill and, in particular, to thank the spokespersons from the Opposition parties, Deputies O'Rourke, O'Keeffe and Keogh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with the argument that the process of scrutiny of the Bill has improved the ultimate product, and it probably is better legislation.  I ought not to let go unremarked Deputy O'Rourke's contention that the changes I made were as a result of the democratic process alone.  I again make the <Col N="506" /> point that as a result of detailed attention to staff concerns I made changes that had nothing to do with what transpired in the House.  I draw attention, for example, to the decision to give representation on the board to the staff concerned.  That was not a demand made to me by the staff.  It was not a demand made by the staff to the other parties in the House or to my own party, but it is an important acknowledgement of the role of the staff.  In an organisation like this where a high proportion of the staff are professional people who have valuable insights into the work of the Authority, it is right that they should be enabled to make their views known where it is most important.  Even if it has taken us somewhat longer than might be ideal, the Bill is a good one.</P>
    <P>I thank colleagues for their co-operation and sincerely hope that in the process we have managed to assuage the fears and concerns of the staff, and that the high reputation they have established for the quality of their own work and for the reputation of the authority will continue.  It provides a very important service and has an enhanced reputation in terms of its ability to raise work and fees outside the normal State subvention.  I hope this legislation will strengthen that reputation in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Before we all get swallowed up in this cosy, comfortable consensus, my fears remain very strong that there are perks in this Bill for the chiefs and not so many for the Indians. That was one of the reasons for my distrust of it.  I am glad there have been some useful drafting changes, particularly where parts of Bills from 1961 were lifted without regard to the fact that in 1996 terminology and words have taken on new meanings.  The changes made in relation to some staff members were good.  I very much regret that there is not a commitment to make all staff members permanent.  I hope the active use of the word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; will lead to further changes in that regard.  I hope the subsequent negotiations will <Col N="507" /> be conducted in the spirit of the Minister's acceptance of the use of that word.</P>

      <P>I welcome the passing of this Bill.  I appreciate the amount of work that went into making it a more acceptable Bill, particularly in relation to the fears expressed about staffing.  On the issue of contract workers, I did not intervene on the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Rourke, but more and more often we are coming across contract work rather than what might be termed full long-term employment.  It is something that needs to be scrutinised. In terms of this Authority.  I hope we will not see a bias in favour of larger numbers of contract workers.  I welcome the passage of the Bill because it is important to address management standards in our society and in business generally.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment and his officials on having consulted me and the authority staff on their fears.  While acknowledging they did not obtain everything they had hoped for, they recognise, as I do, that major improvements have been effected to the Bill as originally presented.</P>
      <P>We hear much about democracy and the operations of this Parliament.  Many former Ministers adopted a very rigid attitude to Bills they presented here irrespective of the merits of any case advanced by the Opposition.  Therefore, I am all the more pleased to compliment the Minister of State on having consulted and accepted views presented to him leading to constructive amendments of the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened attentively to the views expressed by the Minister of State to the proposed management of the new authority in regard to casual and contract workers, since past experience proved back-to-back contracts were generally unacceptable.  I hope the Minister's <Col N="508" /> views will be seriously considered in the course of the many negotiations following the authority's establishment.</P>

      <P>I move the following motions:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, done at Strasbourg on the 8th day of November, 1990, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 2nd day of July, 1996.</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, done at Vienna on the 20th day of December, 1988, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 2nd day of July, 1996.</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters done at Strasbourg on the 20th day of April, 1959, and the Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters done at Strasbourg on the 17th day of March, 1978, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on the 2nd day of July, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Criminal Justice Act, 1994 (Section 46(6)) Regulations, 1996,</P>
    <P>a copy of which was laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 26th day of June, 1996.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce these motions to seek the approval of Dáil Éireann for the terms of these three important criminal law Conventions and for associated regulations.  The completion of the process in approving these conventions is long overdue.  I wonder why Ministers for Justice before me did not take the necessary action.  Why was the convention on drugs signed in 1989 by Ireland left to one side by the three Fianna Fáil Ministers since that time? Perhaps they will tell me today.</P>
    <P>I will outline the provisions of the conventions, and then explain the purpose of the draft regulations and how they are linked to the conventions.</P>
    <P>Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution provides that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.  The operation by Ireland of these conventions will involve a charge upon public funds and I am therefore asking the House for its approval as required by Article 29.5.2.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters was opened for signature in April, 1959.  The purpose of the convention is to establish the means whereby one State can provide assistance to another in the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences.  Such assistance usually consists of written evidence, including sworn evidence obtained in court, the search for and seizure of material required as evidence, the service of judicial documents, arranging for the appearance of witnesses at hearings and the tracing of witnesses and suspects.</P>
    <P>The Additional Protocol to the convention was opened for signature in <Col N="510" /> March, 1978.  One of its main features is that it provides that a contracting party will not be entitled to refuse assistance under the convention on the grounds that a request relates to a fiscal offence. In addition, the Protocol extends the application of the convention in certain respects, including the service of documents and the communication of information on the conviction of foreign nationals.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was opened for signature in December, 1988 and signed by Ireland in December, 1989.  Under its terms, Convention States are obliged to: enact certain national offences regarding drug trafficking and the use of drugs; extend jurisdiction in respect of these offences to national aircraft and ships; provide in national law for the confiscation of the proceeds of drug-related offences, and for the enforcement of confiscation orders made in another convention State; co-operate with each other by way of mutual legal assistance, such as the service of judicial documents and the obtaining of statements or other evidence for use in trials abroad; and co-operate with each other in the suppression of drug trafficking by sea.</P>
    <P>There will be a period of ninety days from the date of ratification to the date the convention comes into force as regards Ireland.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1994 has provided, both directly and by way of regulations, for the changes to our laws which are necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the convention. Part V of the Act provides for necessary changes to the law on drug trafficking at sea and Part VII provides for necessary changes to the law on international co-operation.  The only substantive change which remains to be made, to enable Ireland to discharge its obligations under the convention, is the making of regulations under Part VII modifying the confiscation provisions of the Act so that foreign confiscation orders can be enforced here.  Those regulations, which require the advance <Col N="511" /> approval of both Houses, are before this House today.  I will go into more detail about them in a few moments.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime was opened for signature in November, 1990.  Under its terms, Convention States are obliged to: (a) enact certain national offences regarding money laundering; (b) provide in national law for the confiscation of the proceeds from crime; (c) provide for the enforcement of confiscation orders made in another Convention State; (d) provide for the taking of provisional measures such as freezing property in anticipation of the enforcement of confiscation orders made in another Convention State; and (e) co-operate with Convention States in tracing and identifying property liable to confiscation.</P>
    <P>There will be a period of three months from the date of ratification to the date the convention comes into force as regards Ireland.  Apart from the requirements in relation to money laundering, in many ways the convention is similar to the Drugs Convention in its provisions on confiscation, except that this convention is wider in that it applies to offences in general, and not simply drugs.  The changes to our laws which are necessary to enable Ireland to sign and ratify the convention are, therefore, similar to those needed for the Drugs Convention.  The additional element, that is, money laundering, is also provided for in the Criminal Justice Act.</P>
    <P>The conventions provide for the making of certain reservations, declarations and notifications by contracting States and Ireland will, on ratification make appropriate reservations and declarations to reflect our laws and will also make the necessary notifications as to procedural matters.</P>
    <P>Up to now, Ireland's capacity to assist criminal investigations in other States has been, quite frankly, less than satisfactory, being limited essentially to the taking of depositions for use abroad. The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, with the <Col N="512" /> regulations before the House today, gives us the capacity to enter into the obligations set out in these conventions. The range of potential co-operation will be extensive, from the service of judicial documents to the taking of statements, from searching for evidence to confiscating the proceeds of crime.  Apart from the inherent desirability of providing this level of international co-operation, it should be noted that, under these conventions, we will be entitled to the same level of co-operation.  Orders made by our courts confiscating the proceeds of crime will, for example, be enforceable in other convention states. There will be no hiding place in these countries for the property of persons convicted before our courts.</P>
    <P>The ratification of these conventions will give concrete expression to the Government's commitment to international co-operation on criminal matters, a commitment I know is shared by this House.  They will enable us to play our full part in the international fight against crime and I ask the House for its approval.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations are regulations which the Government proposes to make under section 46 (6) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  Section 46 provides in principle that foreign confiscation orders may be enforced, by way of corresponding Irish court orders known as confiscation co-operation orders.  It goes on to provide that the necessary detailed technical changes to the enforcement provisions in the Act may be made by regulation.  The section requires the approval of both Houses to be secured in advance of making the regulations, and I ask the House for that approval today.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the regulations, therefore, is to modify the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, to enable Irish courts to enforce confiscation orders made by foreign courts, which as I said is a requirement of the convention on drugs and the convention on the proceeds from crime.  Under the Act, as we have been discussing recently in this House, Irish courts are empowered, where a <Col N="513" /> person has been convicted of drug trafficking or another serious offence within this jurisdiction, to make an order confiscating the proceeds of that crime.  The courts are also empowered to make an order to freeze property in anticipation of making a confiscation order.  The regulations modify these provisions so that Irish courts can enforce similar foreign orders against property held in this country.</P>
    <P>The regulations constitute technical modifications to the Act.  In the interpretation section, some definitions have been modified.  For example, under the Act the term &ldquo;defendant&rdquo; refers to a person against whom proceedings for an offence have been instituted in our courts, whereas, to give effect to a foreign order, the regulations define a &ldquo;defendant&rdquo; as a person against whom proceedings have been instituted in a foreign court.  In some cases, provisions in the Act which are not relevant to the enforcement of foreign confiscation orders have been omitted, for example subsections (2, (8) and (11) of section 3.</P>
    <P>As regards the changes to Part III of the Act, many of the modifications are uncomplicated in nature, providing only for the simple substitution of the phrase &ldquo;confiscation co-operation order&rdquo; for the phrase &ldquo;confiscation order&rdquo;.  Other modifications comprise detailed redrafting of provisions, in particular section 23, dealing with when a restraint order may be made.  In that section, instead of referring to intended criminal proceedings before our courts and the making of a confiscation order, there are now references to intended criminal proceedings abroad and the making of an application for a confiscation co-operation order.  The modifications will of course apply only where the enforcement of a foreign confiscation order is in question.  Where domestic confiscation orders are concerned, the original provisions of the Act will apply.</P>
    <P>These regulations are necessary to enable Ireland to ratify important international conventions on criminal law. This will put Ireland to the forefront of international co-operation on crime and <Col N="514" /> will have potentially significant benefits for our criminal justice system.  I know that this House is united in its appreciation of the importance of such international co-operation, and I ask the House, therefore, to approve the draft regulations and the conventions before it today.</P>
    <P>Over the last few days we had an extensive debate to which many Members contributed.  Built into many of those speeches was a recognition of the international nature of much organised crime.  That is why this is an extremely important day for us in preparing to ratify these conventions which have been in existence for many years, one dates back to 1978.  It is an indication of this Government's resolve to play our part in fighting organised crime, both in this country, other European countries and member states of the convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measures proposed by the Minister for Justice to ratify the conventions.  There is international recognition of the great need for co-operation in the detection and prosecution of crimes involving drug trafficking.  There is no other area of criminal law in which the location of assets and the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime is more important that that of drug trafficking.  We know that the amounts of money involved can be enormous and that movement across international boundaries is inherent to the process.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom ratified this convention in June 1991 and by March 1992 there were 59 parties to it.  The United Kingdom went further and, under Part II of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act, 1990, gave domestic effect to the requirements of the convention.  The Vienna Convention of 1988 deals with illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.  The purpose of the convention is to promote co-operation between the parties to address more effectively aspects of drug trafficking having an international dimension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> I mentioned the British law because Article 3 of the Vienna Convention requires parties to establish a range of criminal offences in domestic law.  Some of the necessary legislation is in place in this country, but the impression must not go out that all the legislation which is required under the 1988 Vienna Convention is in place because it is not.  The Misuse of Drugs Acts and certain provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, meet some of the requirements of the convention, but the ratification of the convention itself <i>per se</i> has no effect in domestic law.</P>
    <P>The issue which the Minister and the Government must face is what legislation they will enact to introduce into domestic law those parts of the 1988 convention which do not form part of domestic law at present.  I regard today's move, welcome as it is, as a minor step in the process, for the reasons I outlined. While they are effective, as far as section 46 (6) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 allows, there is still a lacuna which must be filled.  There are also other lacunae which need to be filled.</P>
    <P>In recent days there was a debate in this House on organised crime, drug trafficking and crime generally.  Yesterday the ongoing internecine dispute between the Government parties was turned into an incestuous dispute within Fine Gael.  The chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party laid the blame fairly and squarely on the Labour Party and Democratic Left because they did not and would not support measures which the Minister for Justice put forward more than a year ago.  He went further &mdash; this is extremely serious &mdash; and said that Fine Gael Ministers appointed by the Taoiseach did not give the Minister for Justice the support she required and deserved at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>If these assertions are true is it any wonder there was never a referendum on bail or that the Minister for Justice, having promised the referendum in March 1995 was unable to deliver; or that having promised new bail proposals <Col N="516" /> in January 1996 found herself unable to deliver within the promised six weeks or that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, was in a position to cancel the proposed prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy in the absence of the Minister for Justice.  Is it any wonder that with three judges trying to deal with 1,000 indictable offences each year at the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court there is a backlog and logjam of serious indictable offences in the Central Criminal Court where more than 50 cases were adjourned in May 1996 and where a very serious offence may not be heard for a period of two years from the date of the first appearance before a district judge?  Is it any wonder that 4,000 people are granted temporary release from Irish prisons every year, many on the sole criterion that there is not enough space for them?</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte, Minister of State and hybrid Minister illustrated in that speech how out of touch this Government was with the crime problem.  The epithets he used were neither unbecoming nor unworthy <Col N="517" /> of him, living as he does in the rarefied closeted atmosphere where all hybrids hold the high moral ground.  Deputy Rabbitte and his party conspired with the Minister for Finance to ensure that there would not be sufficient prison places.  He and his party also conspired with the Labour Party to ensure there would be no referendum on bail, no improvement in criminal procedures, and that political infighting within the Rainbow Coalition would take precedence over resolving the problem that existed on the streets in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte ensured that we would see a situation where there would be no coherent attempt to resolve the problem and this begs a question, the answer to which is as simple as it is clear.  The Rainbow Coalition Government in prioritising its spending decided that the personal glorification of given Ministers when it came to distributing funds was more important than dealing with the crime problem.  In this context the Minister for Justice must shoulder some of the blame because it was she, the prison proposals being cancelled in her absence, who defended the decision of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  From there on in, as sure as night follows day, she was treated by her Cabinet colleagues with what I can only describe as political contempt.  If Members want evidence of that look at the U-turns.  Fourteen days ago, the Rainbow Coalition Government under the direction of the Minister for Justice voted down a minimalist change to the right to silence.  Two weeks later the Minister for Justice and the Government decided that there should be a minimalist change to the right to silence.</P>

      <P>Is it any wonder <Col N="518" /> that the public cynicism about these U-turns is the highest ever in relation to our political system.  I say no wonder. The Government which decided it would not bring forward a referendum to prevent people who were likely or even definitively going to commit serious criminal offences if admitted to bail has now decided that they were wrong and that the referendum should go ahead.  The Government which rejected restrictions on bail last year now proposes to enact precisely the measures I put forward in this House. The Government which saw no need to amend the criminal procedures now see the need to do so.  In a fanfare of publicity where everything was subsumed to reflect the egos of those involved in it in a more glorious light, the Rainbow Coalition Government announced a £54 million crime package.  It did so only after a motion had been tabled in this House to reflect the serious concern that exists in Irish society regarding the problem.  It did not do this of its own volition, rather it was forced to do so.  It now transpires, as the dust has settled, that it is not a £54 million package but more like a £14 million package&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no greater monument to the failure of the Rainbow Coalition to react to organised criminality than the decision to postpone the building of Wheatfield Prison until 1998.  It is a monument to a shambles of an administration at odds with itself and the problem in the sense that it fails abysmally to understand what precisely is wrong and how it should be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not the only one saying this.  Two eminent members of the Fine Gael Party, Deputies Shatter and Deasy, one of whom served as a senior Minister, have said it.  The chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party has also said <Col N="519" /> it.  He said: &ldquo;The Minister was left hanging out to dry by members of the Government, including Fine Gael&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government is being attacked from within.  There is dissatisfaction in the Fine Gael Party and on the Government benches.  The members of the Fine Gael Party who have stood up and been counted realise that for the past 18 months the reputation of Liam Cosgrave's, James Dillon's and John Costello's party as the party of law and order in this State has been in tatters. The Fine Gael Party sold its political soul on the day it entered Government with the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  Power for power's sake became the all consuming passion.</P>

      <P>Once Ministers were safely ensconced in their State cars the truth was out: it did not matter that there was a serious problem on the streets of this country which had to be resolved, what mattered was that the political egos of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare had to be massaged and assuaged at all costs.  That was done but at a high price.  The price is being paid by a suffering general public. Our youth are increasingly finding that hard drugs are freely available to them.  The Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Democratic Left have yet to pay the price but, as sure as I am standing here, there will be a high price to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians are not the only people who are dissatisfied, alarmed and appalled at the behaviour of the Government in this matter.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors indicated yesterday that an attempt was being made by the Government to scapegoat the Garda Síochána.  This view is given credence if one studies the comments of the chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party who blamed the Garda Síochána for much of the problem stating they had hidden <Col N="520" /> agendas and too many other things to do.  As the adage goes, it is a poor workman who blames his tools.</P>
    <P>In this instance laying the blame on the Garda Síochána is a convenient way of escaping responsibility.  The time has come for the Government and the Minister to realise that the buck stops with them.  Over a period of 18 months they were told on numerous occasions that there was a serious problem and when solutions were preferred, be they legislative, pragmatic, practical or technical, they were voted down and dismissed not because they were unconstructive, would not work or did not constitute a positive contribution to the debate but because they came from the Opposition side of the House.</P>
    <P>Political expediency is not the answer to the crime problem.  It is, however, something we have seen even at the height of the present crisis.  When the Fianna Fáil Party originally proposed its Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996 the Minister said on RTE television that similar legislation was already in place. The following day, beginning to feel the heat, she rowed back and said that she could accept it in principle.  The day after that, as the public's anger increased, she said that it was her view that its provisions were unconstitutional. Last night two Government backbench Deputies said on television that they could not vote for it even though yesterday afternoon members of the Fine Gael parliamentary party had indicated their support.</P>
    <P>Where do we now stand in relation to the legislation?  What, in the name of goodness, is going on?  The time for confusion, procrastination, prevarication, indecision, inactivity and frozen indifference has passed.  These provisions do not exist in criminal law, are constitutional workable and reflect the will of the people.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, introduced by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, provides for the confiscation of assets which are the proceeds of crime and drug trafficking.  It also provides for a restraint order to be made in the event that a charge has been made against an individual and that such an order may be made even if no charge has been made, provided the court is satisfied that a charge will be made.  The application must be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our legislation provides that a revenue commissioner or a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána can go into the High Court and say it is his opinion that the assets concerned are the proceeds of organised criminal activity.  If the court is satisfied that the revenue commissioner or the chief superintendent had reasonable grounds for forming that opinion it may make an interim restraining order.  Clearly the assets are frozen at that stage and the individual in possession of them may not use them or dispose of them.  The court will make an order requesting the person against whom the interim order is made to file an affidavit in the court stating his assets, where he got them and his source of income for the previous ten years.  If the court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the assets <Col N="522" /> concerned are the proceeds of organised crime then it may freeze them by making an interlocutory order.</P>
    <P>In such cases the onus is shifted from the normal whereby the person who is prosecuting will have to prove his case. The presumption has to be rebutted and the person against whom the order is made must come into the court and establish that the goods were obtained honestly and legally.  If he fails to establish this then the order is made and the goods are not returned.  If after a period of five years the court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the goods or assets are the proceeds of organised crime then it may dispose of them.  If after a period of seven years no affidavits have been filed or if the person against whom the order is made refuses to file them then the court can dispose of the assets to the Minister for Finance, or, alternatively, to the true owner.</P>
    <P>Such legislation does not exist in criminal law and nobody should ever again suggest that it does.  It is of crucial importance for the following reason. Very often when dealing with organised crime the authorities are unable to obtain sufficient evidence to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt.  This legislation will allow the authorities to touch the untouchables.  The Vienna Convention specifically encourages the enactment of this kind of legislation.  It also permits, but does not require, the reversal of the burden of proof regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds and saves, without detailed provisions, the rights of bona fide third parties.  The convention not only provides for the freezing of assets, as proposed in the Fianna Fáil Bill, but also provides for the reversal of the onus of proof.  Surely the Minister for Justice and the rainbow coalition Government must recognise that, having failed abysmally and utterly in terms of having the courage to lead, they must now follow in the fight against crime.</P>

      <P>The debates in the House this week have properly been dominated by the need for laws, political action and the provision of services <Col N="524" /> which will at long last tackle organised crime and put in place procedures and methods to fight fire with fire.  The escalation and increasing sophistication of organised crime is only beginning to be debated.  Courageous journalists, living and dead, have served the public interest by shining a light on the activities of the untouchables.  The assassination of Veronica Guerin brought it home to all Members of the House and the entire nation that we will ignore at our peril the message that some people consider themselves above the law, will stop at nothing and will confront the State brazenly with arms and terror when people get in their way.  These people care little for civil liberties or the rights of ordinary citizens, yet they claim the protection provided by civil liberties and due process when they are caught or being investigated.  They rob banks and then launder the proceeds of those crimes through the same institutions. They also avail of tax amnesties provided by foolish Governments.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to anticipate or predict the creativity of the criminal mind. Their swagger and arrogance undermine the law and confidence in the criminal justice system, while their activities demoralise the Garda Síochána and scandalise members of the public. They use the proceeds of their crimes to buy respect in the same communities they have devastated with drugs.  It is clear that so far successive Governments have failed to stop them. We must get it right, now that there is political consensus on the way forward. The Dáil must be courageous and surefooted and we must not be put off at this very important time by the predictable bleating of those who want to hold on to the failed <i>status quo</i> or those who forecast the wrecking of traditional notions of civil liberties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court has said &mdash; and we must be mindful of this when introducing new measures &mdash; that the potential damage to society from the use and distribution of controlled drugs is so great and constitutes such a pernicious evil that when it comes to their control <Col N="525" /> the Dáil has a very wide discretion in reconciling the interests of the common good with individual rights.  It represents the people and has the capacity, authority and duty to reconcile and balance the rights of the people to live in safety with the rights of those who threaten it.</P>
    <P>An important constitutional review group report published today echoed this championing of the public interest and the need to balance the rights of the people to live in safety as against the property rights which are so championed in our Constitution.  I support that view.</P>
    <P>President Mary Robinson has spoken of the need for a global ethic.  Her message is relevant today as we debate these international conventions, measures to improve co-operations to assist individual states to protect their citizens from organised criminality and subversion. There is a need for morality and for the public interest to pervade the professional and commercial world.  Organised criminals and terrorists can and do avail of the professions and commercial institutions of the world to launder money which flows directly from their evil trade in crime.  There are professional people here and all over the world who turn a professional blind eye to that fact.  Casinos, betting offices, property companies, haulage firms, lawyers, accountants and banks must reconcile the public interest, their ethical professional responsibilities to their &ldquo;clients&rdquo; and the public interest.  The State has introduced laws and regulations in relation to banks and financial institutions but to ignore other institutions and commercial bodies is dangerous and undermines our efforts in this regard.  We must seek to analyse how effective these regulations have been to date.  Are they being enforced? How many orders have been made under section 32 of the 1994 Act which places an obligation on banks and financial institutions to report suspicious <Col N="526" /> transactions exceeding a particular amount of money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What action has flowed from that?  We must consistently analyse the regulations to see whether they are sufficiently effective and if they are being enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the banks need further assistance?  Is there political will to assist our financial institutions to champion the public interest?  It is futile to create an impression by regulations that procedures are in place to report such matters if in reality the procedures are not effective.  In April 1996 we discussed section 44 of the 1994 Act.  We approved regulations to seize drug trafficking money.  How many orders have been made under section 44 of that Act?  There are difficulties too in European States in relation to EUROPOL &mdash; the European drugs unit based in The Hague &mdash; relating to rivalry and sovereignty matters and a political difference of opinion in individual member states.  We also need a single computerised database on criminals in Europe.  We need formal co-operation between member states and their forensic science laboratories to enable police to track illegal drugs through the EU and determine scientifically the source of those drugs.  We need agreement among European states on jail sentences on drug trafficking offences.  All these must be harmonised if we are to come together as a European Union to fight the common enemy of drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must seek to ensure adequate co-operation in the protection of the external borders of the Union.  In Ireland we need an EU funded coastguard service to protect our waters and police our ports.  Some 80 per cent of heroin seized in Europe comes from Turkey.  We must be as sophisticated as they are.  These criminals are highly mobile, very rich, <Col N="527" /> totally sophisticated and can avail of the best possible advice and the legitimate institutions &mdash; financial institutions and banks &mdash; to launder their money.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill which Deputy O'Donoghue moved gives the power to freeze the assets of criminals if we cannot arrest the criminals.  Its purpose is to challenge the <i>status quo.</i>  Deputy O'Donoghue can look to the constitutional review group recommendations because there will be people who will say we cannot do that, it is unconstitutional. There will be people who will say that goes against our adversarial system of justice, and it does.  It is a courageous and radical Bill.  We must look at new measures and take a radical approach to tackling crime.  That Bill, which must be supported, can be amended in Committee if necessary.  It is saying that if the <i>status quo</i> has failed we must look to new ideas.</P>
    <P>Inherent in that Bill is the introduction of elements of the inquisitorial system used in other European states under which, as distinct from the adversarial system, there is a provision for suspects to be questioned before judicial officers.  The burden of proof is not on the prosecution to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt, there is an obligation on the tribunal or the court or the judicial officer to make a determination of facts before the trial.  I believe, like the DPP and many others, that our adversarial system is not capable of dealing with modern criminality.  It has failed across many areas.  We have to consider introducing elements of the inquisitorial system.</P>
    <P>Money laundering is a most important front in the battle against organised crime.  It is the means by which criminals can legitimise and thus enjoy the proceeds of their crimes, but financial institutions can also be used by criminals as a means of effecting payment to other criminals, for example, to pay for drug consignments.  The more successful a criminal is in his activities, the more need he has for money laundering.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> The increased integration of financial markets and the EU-inspired removal of barriers to the free movement of capital have enhanced the ease with which criminal money can be laundered and have complicated the process of tracking criminal assets.  It is, therefore, urgent and timely that we are bringing in an international dimension to our laws on money laundering.  This country has a growing and unhappy reputation as being an artery in the international transportation of drugs so it is time we made an important contribution, as an equal partner in Europe, to the fight against organised crime.</P>
    <P>These regulations have come before the House under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  Despite the various claims as to the credit for this Act, it is inspired by an EU directive like many of our laws which, quite properly, are driven by our responsibilities and our obligations under the European Union. They should have been brought into Irish law by 1 January 1993 but were not passed into law until the end of June 1994.</P>
    <P>Money launderers use a wide variety of techniques: currency smuggling, the conversion of cash into negotiable instruments, the creative use of facilities offered by tax and financial havens, the use of shell companies, currency exchanges and brokerage houses and the use of casinos.  This debate on casinos will have to take account of the internationally recognised dangers of casinos in relation to money laundering. We should not allow ourselves to be blinded by science.  It was rather disconcerting and upsetting to read in Tuesday's newspapers of the comparative ease with which one major criminal is believed to launder his money.  It is alleged that he does so by simply making large cash bets and insisting on payment by cheque.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act imposes certain obligations on designated bodies to report suspicions of money laundering.  I note that betting shops and on-course bookmakers are not deemed to be designated <Col N="529" /> bodies for the purposes of the Act.  The Act gives the Minister power to designate bodies other than those described in the Act.  I call on her to consider introducing regulations that would make the betting industry subject to the reporting obligations of the 1994 Act. Obviously, some practical details would need to be worked out, as was the case when we imposed such regulations and obligations on the banks.  They were given time to train staff and to prepare for the legal obligations to which they were being subjected.  The Government must consider widening the scope of the term &ldquo;designated bodies&rdquo; to include casinos and betting offices.  All methods used by criminals to launder money must be brought within the ambit of our money laundering legislation.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider we have adequately implemented the EU directive on which the 1994 Act was based? Much of the meat of the money laundering regime is left to guidelines prepared by a body known as the money laundering steering committee which operates under the aegis of the Department of Finance and includes representatives from the relevant Government Departments, the Central Bank, the Garda and major representative bodies of the financial sector.  It has done some valuable work, including the preparation of detailed guidelines for the various financial areas.  However, I question whether it is appropriate that such important matters should be dealt with on a non-statutory basis.  It smacks too much of self-regulation which in other jurisdictions has been associated with an increase in money laundering.</P>
    <P>The Government must provide leadership and political authority on these matters.  It did a political U-turn this week by accepting a range of measures it previously treated with contempt. While this is in the public interest, it was public outrage that forced the Government to make the U-turn.  It casually nodded through measures it treated with derision and contempt last February.</P>

It is obvious the Government is on the run from the people.</P>
      <P>Words such as &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; have lost their natural meaning.  The Government announced its proposals as swift, immediate and radical action, but they are unravelling before our eyes. Immediate now means in two years' time.

      <P>This is not the first time the Minister for Justice has come into the House without the facts on her area of responsibility.  That is at the heart of the crisis management of the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>There was never a more important time for sure-footedness in the Justice field.  We are faced with unprecedented levels of sophistication and terror from organised crime and subversion.  The capacity to backtrack, to make decisions and then reverse them, to accept proposals and then reject them and to reject proposals and then accept them, is unacceptable.  We are swinging from place to place.  We are in a leaking boat and our citizens are losing confidence in the system, but the spindoctors will probably give them their version of events.</P>
      <P>This is a large Government.  It is selfbloated by an unprecedented level of programme managers, media spindoctors, advisers and consultants.  As the Government increases, the relevance of the Dáil diminishes.  The Dáil reform measures merely nibble at the surface in terms of the primacy of this Parliament.  The accountability structures from the Executive to the Dáil have not improved, if anything they have diminished.  I have served in Opposition for only four years but I have marked two separate Administrations. This Administration is less transparent and less willing to give information, which is ironic when one considers that the last Government was booted out of office because it failed the test of accountability to Dáil Éireann.  Lessons were not learnt from that debacle.  This is a serious development in our democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is practically impossible to get information from the Executive by way of parliamentary question.  The report on Dáil reform will be meaningless because the structures of accountability that deal with parliamentary questions have not changed.  There must be root <Col N="532" /> and branch cultural reform of the method by which the Executive responds to parliamentary questions, but the Government does not intend to do that.  My main recommendation to the sub-committee dealing with Dáil reform was that a root and branch reform of the structures dealing with parliamentary questions should be carried out.</P>
    <P>The last Administration failed on many occasions to reply properly to parliamentary questions and this one has done likewise.  It is even more unwilling to supply information.  I am persistently thwarted by the replies I get to parliamentary questions.  One would need to have the persistence of Veronica Guerin, who would not go away and because of that she was murdered.  The House must learn that accountability to Dáil Éireann is not mere fiction.  It is essential in a democracy that a parliament is relevant and holds the executive to account.  That is not happening here at the moment.  Throughout a series of near misses this year on the Duncan extradition case and other matters, we have seen this House swept aside with incomplete information.  A question was tabled in respect of which the Government had six weeks notice, yet the Minister for Justice was permitted to come into the House without being in possession of the facts for which she has political responsibility.  It goes to the heart of the people's diminishing confidence in this Administration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motions which are an essential part of the participation this State, as an equal partner in Europe, must play in introducing measures to stop international money laundering and drug trafficking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Costello.  Organised crime poses a grave threat to our democracy and our people.  The Labour Party, with its Government colleagues in Democratic Left and Fine Gael, is prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to tackle this problem at a law and order level.  We must eradicate the drug <Col N="533" /> barons and the crime lords from our society by legal means.</P>
      <P>The drugs crisis is a huge problem.  In Dublin alone it is estimated that between 70 and 80 per cent of all crime is drug related, yet less than 2 per cent of our police force is directly engaged in the fight against drugs through membership of a drugs unit.</P>
      <P>There is more than one drugs problem. Opiate addiction is largely confined to Dublin and its inner city.  So called soft drugs, like ecstasy, are widely available at other centres throughout the country.  Measures undertaken by the Government since it announced its package of anti-drug measures in July 1995 have been most useful and successful. There is no doubt that more resources are being directed at this problem than heretofore.  However, we have always believed that these measures are not sufficient to tackle the scale of the problem which now exists.</P>
      <P>There are two obvious ways of containing the drugs problem.  The first &mdash; supply reduction &mdash; advocates measures like the establishment of an anti-organised crime unit.  If we are to reclaim our streets and communities from organised drugs related crime, all the powers of search and arrest, entry and seizure, confiscation and sequestration, as well as electronic and other forms of surveillance that are vested in different agencies, must be combined in one all out assault.  Our first aim must be to reduce the amount of drugs on the streets.  Our second aim must relate to demand reduction; reducing the level of demand for drugs and, consequently, the impetus for people to supply them.  The third aim must be to ensure adequate treatment facilities for those with addiction problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the level of demand for drugs remains as high as it currently is there will always be people ready to fulfil it. For every drugs baron we lock up there will be another to take his place.  There is more to solving this problem than passing legislation.  We must reduce the grip of heroin on individuals and, <Col N="534" /> through that, liberate their communities.</P>
    <P>Veronica Guerin was aware of the social dimension of the drugs problem. The Health Research Board's document entitled <i>The Drugs Menace and Organised Crime</i> indicates how strong that dimension is.  In her work, Veronica Guerin was subjected to extraordinary levels of intimidation, but intimidation of varying degrees in communities ravaged by drugs is a fact of everyday life for those seeking to fight back against the drug barons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new measures announced by the Government to fight organised crime and the drugs menace. They will cost money but the problem is already costing us money in terms of Garda resources, high insurance premiums and health costs including those associated with family breakdown and stress.  The exact amount of money is difficult to gauge.  Addicts have habits of varying sizes and intensity.  Heroin fluctuates in price but the community at large is in no doubt about the extent to which the drugs problem impinges on their quality of life.</P>
    <P>The Government is now embarking on a war against drugs barons and crime bosses.  Every arm and resource of the State must be used in this fight.  The package announced by the Government this week is only the first step in the fight against the godfathers who wish to destroy Irish society.  I fully support the motions before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing these three motions and the motion on the draft regulations to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. However I castigate those who were in power for so long.  Deputy O'Donnell's party was in power from 1989 to 1992, but did nothing.  Deputy O'Donoghue's party was in power from 1987 to 1994, a period of seven years, but did not introduce any of these motions, the last of which was available for introduction in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are forever whinging and oppose all tax and <Col N="535" /> spending proposals.  They do not want anything to be spent yet they want everything to be done.  How this is to be achieved is mind boggling.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue really takes the biscuit.  I am as surprised as the Minister for Justice that Deputy O'Donoghue's party &mdash; which has discovered crime since leaving office at the end of 1994 &mdash; did not ratify any of these conventions while it held the ministerial portfolio for Justice.  Where then is the priority of this national emergency which Deputy O'Donoghue has proclaimed since his arrival on the Fianna Fáil Front Bench?  I am becoming increasingly weary of listening to Deputy O'Donoghue's tirades in this House.  His rhetoric bears no resemblance to Fianna Fáil's achievement in the justice portfolio.  I would give Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn far more credit for her time in St. Stephen's Green than Deputy O'Donoghue for what he is prepared to do.</P>
    <P>How Deputy O'Donoghue purports to blame the Labour Party, or for that matter Democratic Left, for the shambles of our criminal justice system really is mind boggling.  Unlike Fianna Fáil, whose tenure in the Department of Justice has been considerable, a Labour Minister has not held that portfolio.  If Labour had held that office we might not be in the sorry mess we are in at present.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Government has decided to promote changes in the bail laws, although I would not like to stand next to Deputy O'Donoghue when he finally realises such changes will not eliminate crime.  It might be possible to take the Deputy's concerns about crime seriously if he was prepared to be tough on issues which affect levels of crime other than criminal justice measures.</P>
    <P>If he is interested in the causes of crime he might do well to open his eyes when next he is in central or west Dublin and, having done so, he should have a word with Deputy Cullen and Deputy McCreevy who are of the same rather bilious nature as himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> Having listened to him earlier, I was reminded of the description by another Member that Deputy O'Donoghue is somewhat &ldquo;like the Bull McCabe, who rages from Caherciveen to Leinster House while widows cower in the bushes as he goes by&rdquo;.  That is a very apt description&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Say that to the victims of recent crime.  The Deputy is not worthy of epithets, but he should repeat those words outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;listening to somebody who talks all the time about special measures, while the only interest the Deputy ever has is one of repression.  He has not made any statements about the causes of crime such as disadvantaged areas of high unemployment which give rise to the problems we now face.  I would welcome a little balance from the Deputy who is spokes-person on Justice.</P>
      <P>Even though the Council of Europe convention on money laundering was introduced in 1990 and the drugs convention was introduced in 1988, at both of which times the Deputy's party was in power, they are only being ratified now.  Similarly, the mutual assistance convention between member states, which was introduced in 1959, is only being dealt with now.  Successive Governments have failed to deal with these measures, which are long overdue. If they had been introduced at an earlier stage, more progress might have been made in dealing with the terrible problem of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention on mutual assistance is an extremely important measure in view of the extent of the drugs problem worldwide.  Interpol has a major role to play in this regard.  Since the tragic death last week of Veronica Guerin, who was assassinated because she was getting too close to some of the drug barons, we have read in the papers that many of the drug barons are away on holidays, in Malaga, Amsterdam and the Caribbean.  It is obvious that those people are wealthy.  The convention on <Col N="537" /> mutual assistance between countries is essential to deal with money laundering, improve co-operation in investigation matters and identify assets of criminals from Ireland who launder money abroad and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The murky arrangements between Nationalist and Loyalist paramilitary groups have, to a large extent, been responsible for many of the contacts made abroad.  That matter must be considered very carefully.  We must be prepared to go to the four corners of the globe to pursue drug barons from Ireland who use other countries to launder money and smuggle drugs.  Those people must be prosecuted under this convention.  The convention will speed up the exchange of information and documents and will assist in co-operation, particularly in terms of extradition.</P>
    <P>Under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances all member states are obliged to enact common legislation in this area.  It is important that specific offences be common to all jurisdictions that are party to the convention.  That will be of enormous assistance to police forces in pursuing ill-gotten gains.  The convention extends jurisdiction in terms of aircraft, ships and marine activities.  This is extremely important for Ireland because, with the exception of ecstasy which is manufactured here, drugs are imported through our airports and sea ports.  This is a desirable element of the convention which, if it had been signed sooner, would have enabled us to cooperate to a greater degree in preventing the importation of illicit materials.</P>
    <P>The convention on crime deals with money laundering, search, seizure and confiscation.  We are obliged to enact common legislation in this area also, which will be of assistance in enforcement, freezing assets and property and so on.  This convention applies not only to drugs but to all offences, which is desirable.</P>
    <P>On the draft regulations under <Col N="538" /> section 46, the approval of the Oireachtas is required to enable the courts to enforce confiscation orders made by foreign courts, thereby ensuring the mutuality of the convention.</P>
    <P>All those conventions, which are long overdue, should have been introduced by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.  The conventions will enable us to be good Europeans and to co-operate with our neighbours in the pursuit of crime.  They will ensure that there is no hiding place in our jurisdiction for the perpetrators of crime. Ireland has long been considered as a place where criminals find it easy to launder money, and we must plug that loophole.  I welcome the recent Government decision not to introduce legislation to allow a casino to open in Dublin. Casinos are notorious as centres for money laundering and the profits from drugs could be easily laundered through a casino.</P>
    <P>At last we are achieving unity of purpose in dealing with this problem, which has been festering for a long time while successive Governments stood idly by. The Opposition motions on crime and drug trafficking, which have been accepted by the Government, together with the Government's package of measures on the Garda and prisons &mdash; there is a comprehensive Labour Party document on this issue &mdash; will be considered in conjunction with the motions on international co-operation.  We are in a position to seriously tackle this problem, which originated in deprived areas. However, rather than dealing with it purely by providing for more Garda personnel and more prison places, a broad package of proposals must be introduced.</P>
    <P>As well as setting up special crime units to deal with supply reduction and designating courts to fast-track prosecutions, a set of proposals is necessary on demand reduction.  I welcome the Minister for Education's announcement last night of the school awareness programme dealing with substance abuse awareness and prevention and the antiheroin programme.  The major problem, <Col N="539" /> particularly in deprived areas of Dublin, relates to heroin.  Teachers are being trained to implement these programmes and a 24-hour help line is proposed to make people aware of the services available.</P>
    <P>There must be a broad approach to the question of treatment.  There are hundreds of addicts in this city queueing up for methadone substitution, counselling, therapy and rehabilitation, but there is an insufficient number of satellite community clinics and detoxification beds &mdash; there are only 24 detoxification beds for the entire city, which is totally inadequate.  It is difficult to get general practitioners to treat drug addicts.  Family doctors refuse to treat HIV patients and drug addicts.  When the Eastern Health Board tried to put together a team of general practitioners in the city, only ten volunteered, which represents an outrageous response.  What is the point in taking a Hippocratic oath if doctors are not prepared to treat people who are ill?  It reminds me of the time when leprosy was a major disease in Africa and other areas and that problem was not dealt with by the medical profession but by volunteers who risked their lives to help those people.  There is an onus on general practitioners to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Previous Governments treated the problems of crime too lightly.  They hoped it would not get out of hand or that it would disappear of its own accord, but the callous murder of Veronica Guerin has given us a reason to focus on the issue.  If we do not deal with the problem of crime now, having allowed it to fester for the past 17 years, we will never resolve it.  I trust this package of proposals will be implemented efficiently by the statutory organs of the State and all the relevant personnel to ensure this scourge is eliminated from our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the two previous speakers on the tenor of their remarks.  That is the spirit in which this debate should be conducted.  I would <Col N="540" /> say to Deputy Costello, however, that the Labour Party was in Government for 11 of the past 16 years while Fianna Fáil was in Government for approximately seven of those years.  Those are the facts.  It is irrelevant to the debate for the Deputy to suggest that Fianna Fáil nor the Labour Party did or did not do something to address this problem. The politicisation of the debate by Deputies is an error of judgment on their part; those of us in this parliamentary Assembly should stand side by side in the fight against these gangsters in our society.</P>
      <P>In their time in office Fianna Fáil Governments did their duty by the State.  Previous Ministers for Justice including Deputy Gerard Collins, Deputy Ray Burke, Padraig Flynn and Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn were seen as Ministers of courage and outstanding integrity.  I am not suggesting Minister Owen does not have these qualities.  She has an extremely difficult task in circumstances which have effectively got out of control since this Government came to power.  That is an unfortunate coincidence but it is a fact.</P>
      <P>It appears to me, as a Member who has served in this House for many years, that we have not tackled the problem of crime and that we are only now coming to the realisation that we have a national emergency on our hands.  In those circumstances we must deal with the problem as a national emergency.</P>
      <P>The Minister is undoubtedly under great stress and strain, and I sympathise with her in her dilemma, but I urge her to adopt the politics of consensus rather than the politics of confrontation.  In the past number of days, and I say this with great respect to her, she had adopted an aggressive, arrogant attitude to the effect that she is right and we are wrong. That is not the way to deal with this problem.  The way to deal with it is to stand side by side in an all-party context and stop the political quibbling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wreaths on the railings outside Dáil Éireann were not only a tribute to the assassinated journalist, Veronica Guerin, but an indication that the <Col N="541" /> majority of the public were dissatisfied with this parliamentary Assembly and with us as their representatives.  On the scale of human values, Dáil Deputies do not rate very highly at this time.</P>
    <P>We must depoliticise this debate and get down to the job of fighting this evil in our society as one group rather than having a disparate spreading of our energies.  The only people that will help are those whom we seek to expose and imprison.</P>
    <P>Snide remarks from the Minister about my being down in the Law Library are unhelpful.  I declared my interests in the Register of Interests.  I am a barrister.  I had to work up my practice for the fifth time over so many years and I have done that successfully. I balance that, however, with my obligations to my constituents and the constituency I represent.  People have given me a mark of confidence in successive elections.  I will seek that support in the next election and I believe I will get it. I am not making any apologies.  If I have been down in the Law Library I will say so.  I have never hidden anything in my public life.</P>
    <P>I see myself as a long serving Dáil Deputy who has a responsibility to this House and to the Minister who I acknowledge has an enormous task on her hands.  I pay tribute to her courage and integrity but she should focus her mind on that task rather than attacking people like myself and my honourable colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    <P>In that regard the previous speaker criticised Deputy O'Donoghue.  Of all Deputies in this House over the past number of years, his record on justice matters bears scrutiny along with that of Deputies from every party, including the Minister's own record since she took office.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister for Justice well in her war against organised crime, particularly the drug barons who operate not only in Dublin but in Limerick, Cork and, to a lesser extent, in Galway.  The Minister has engaged in the politics of confrontation rather than the politics of <Col N="542" /> consensus but the House needs consensus to tackle this problem.  We all have a responsibility to stand up and be counted and to stand side by side in the war against drugs.</P>
    <P>I strongly object to the actions of the gangster who recorded gunshots on Deputy Shortall's telephone answering machine.  Unless we stand up and support her at this time we will be seen to be failing in our obligations to parliamentary democracy and to this House. I deplore in the strongest terms that threat against Deputy Shortall.  It is wrong and it is cowardly.  It is very easy to record gunshots on a telephone answering machine but this was is being conducted in a manner of subterfuge and, by definition, under ground.  We must expose people like the gangster who made the threatening telephone call to a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to stand up and be counted.  If these criminals want to come after me, I am a big enough target, but I will not shirk my responsibilities.  The Minister has my unequivocal support in this fight against crime, and if she wants the support of the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy O'Donoghue or all members of the Fianna Fáil Party, she will have it without reservation.  I urge the Minister, however, to lower the tone of the manner in which she is trying to justify her own position.  She does not have to justify her position.  She is doing her best and we are doing our best.  We do not seek credit, but she should give it where it is due.  She should not dismiss us out of hand.</P>
    <P>I deplore the assassinations of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe in Adare and Veronica Guerin in any free, democratic and, in this case, republican society. People are entitled to live and to the freedom of their views which this democracy gives them.  They should not be killed for expressing those views. Veronica Guerin should not have been killed under any circumstances, least of all for writing articles which exposed crime.  Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was shot for doing his duty and for being a member of a decent and <Col N="543" /> honourable group of people, the Garda Síochána.  I have nothing but the greatest regard and respect for the Garda.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to temper her views.  We should have the Garda Síochána on side, as it wants to be.  It needs all the assistance it can get.  The Minister should be praised for announcing an increase in the membership of the Garda Síochána.  I also welcome the deployment of people from within the Garda bureaucratic structure to the city streets.  It is not all bad news.  Leadership is made up of many qualities.  It is a chemical makeup which one either does or does not have.  I am concerned that the Minister's attitude does not reflect the chemical ingredients required for leadership in this war against these criminals.</P>
    <P>The message should go out from this debate that we are serious about this national emergency and that we are not afraid to express our condemnation of the killing of people who are doing their duty on our behalf, whether they are journalists or members of the Garda Síochána.  We must defend their right to be members of whatever organisation they want, although we may not like the organisation.  Organisations are entitled to survive, except those such as the Provisional IRA and other terrorist organisations. They are not entitled to survive in a democracy because they fly in the face of what we believe in &mdash; freedom to express our views and to go wherever we want without hinderance, which is fundamental in any democracy.</P>
    <P>The decision to have a debate on crime at the end of the month is an extraordinary error of judgement.  We are giving the criminals a months' notice to put their illegal and ill-gotten gains away, to do their laundering, to get rid of their drugs and to become cleansed. It is an extraordinary error of judgement not to have this debate this week or next week.  I know we are talking about crime today because of the Minister's requirement to bring in the regulations under the convention.  However, the decision to have a debate at the end of <Col N="544" /> the month on this important subject is an aberration.</P>
    <P>The Vienna Convention of 1988 deals with illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.  The purpose of the convention is to promote co-operation among the parties to address more effectively aspects of drug trafficking with an international dimension. Article 3 of the convention requires parties to establish a range of criminal offences in domestic law.  Some of the necessary legislation is already in place. The Criminal Justice (Misuse of Drugs) Act and certain provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, meet some of the requirements of the convention.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, was introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  It was probably one of the most far reaching Bills introduced since the foundation of the State.  Unfortunately, she did not have the opportunity to implement its provisions.  The present Minister has the honour of doing that.  The Minister should, as a matter of urgency, introduce the necessary regulations to deal with this battle which looms ahead.</P>
    <P>In England, Part 2 of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act, 1990, was passed specifically to give effect to the requirements of the convention. The ratification of the convention has no effect in domestic law. Article 3 of the convention requires parties to establish a range of criminal offences in domestic law.  These include not only offences of production, cultivation and possession of drugs, but also the manufacture, transport or distribution of equipment, materials or specified substances knowing that they are to be used for their illicit cultivation, production or manufacture.  Organised drug trafficking is directly attacked by the creation of the offence of organising, managing or financing drugs offences, and of a series of offences of participation in laundering the proceeds of such offences.  These offences may be committed by the drug traffickers when they try to launder the profits.  In United Kingdom law the money laundering <Col N="545" /> provisions of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act, 1986, caught only other persons.  A more extensive provision meeting the requirements of the Vienna Convention was created by the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act, 1990.  The convention goes into considerable detail on such matters as the need for heavy penalties and a long limitations period.</P>
    <P>It is now emerging in the United States that the petty criminal has literally been getting away with murder in relation to the sale of drugs.  We must begin by tackling the petty criminals because they are the faces of the cowards who sit in their mansions which have swimming pools or equestrian centres, as was mentioned in the case of one individual.  That is not good enough. That man is entitled to a fair trail, but he does not give others one.  It would probably be wrong to single him out in advance of any charges he may have to answer in future.  The fact that people can make millions of pounds out of drug trafficking is surely anathema to all we stand for.  That is why this side of the House welcomes Deputy O'Donoghue's excellent Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996. It is not good enough to abuse Deputy O'Donoghue for doing his duty.  He did what the Minister should have done.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to him for his work in the national interest in assisting a Government which sometimes appears to be spread all over the place in terms of addressing this major problem.  It may appear I am doing what I said I would not, politicising the debate, but I am not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I support much of what was said about law and order.  Like other Members, I have taken a strong approach to it over a long period.  We need to adopt a double-barrelled approach to the problem, if it is to be dealt with effectively. We need to take a law and order approach which I strongly support because if we do not the most feeble in <Col N="546" /> our society, young children who are preyed upon and induced to take drugs and old people who are afraid to leave their homes, will suffer most.  What greater human right is there than the right to life and the peaceful enjoyment of one's home?  Supporting a strong law and order approach is consistent with human rights and protecting the feeble and needy members of society.</P>
      <P>In tandem with that approach we also need to address the source of social injustice in our society.  I am not a bleeding heart politician who will apologise for or exempt anybody from the punishment they might deserve for being involved in crime, I am involved in the community and strongly of the view that a double-barrelled approach, that of law and order and dealing with the source of social injustice in communities, is the most effective way to redress these problems.</P>
      <P>There was a time when a Deputy could effect the transfer of a garda, which was a serious abuse of power. However, Members are fearful of speaking their minds and are not prepared to repeat inside the House what they say outside it.  Many members of the Garda management are committed to their jobs, but there is a great deal of concern about the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána and we should support its examination, particularly that of the senior Garda management, which is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in laying the blame for the problem of the door of the Minster for Justice, that is a cop-out.  The Minister and the Government of which I am a Minister of State are primarily responsible for law and order and I accept that responsibility, but those to whom we have given authority, including the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda Commissioner, Garda management and staff must be held accountable for the efficient and effective discharge of their responsibilities.  Under the Constitution the other arm of Government, the Judiciary, which is independent in the exercise of its duty, must consider its operations and in so <Col N="547" /> far as the Government has a role in the efficient and effective administration of the courts, it must make that arm of Government more effective.  I heard a judge commenting on this in the context of successive Governments, but she is part of the judicial wing of successive Governments.  If we lay all the blame at the feet of the Minister for Justice, we will do a grave injustice to the memory of Detective Garda McCabe and Veronica Guerin.  All we will do is trade untruths.  It is time we had the courage to say there are other people who have authority and they must be made account for it.  It is time we took back some of the power to this House to manage our affairs.  Those of us involved in the community have firsthand knowledge of the problems facing people.</P>
    <P>I was shocked by the death of Detective Garda McCabe in the exercise of his duty, but many of those who expressed shock at his death have had a sneaking regard for the IRA down through the years which introduced a level of tolerance of murder, mayhem and violence to our community.  Those who have a sneaking regard or gave succour to the IRA must examine their consciences, not only in the context of the murder of Detective Garda McCabe but that of Veronica Guerin because a level of violence has been allowed to increase in our community which has resulted in those unbelievable losses.</P>
    <P>The late Veronica Guerin was a friend of my wife and her murder is a personal loss.  My wife and Veronica grew up in the same housing estate and played on the same basketball team and members knew Veronica Guerin from coming in and out of this House.  If we are to do anything in memory of Detective Garda McCabe and Veronica Guerin, we should tell the truth, that many people who have authority must be made accountable.  That includes the Government, but also others.</P>
    <P>Unless there is an integrated approach in dealing with law and order, <Col N="548" /> we will fail in that task.  The Government and the Minister for Justice seek to adopt an integrated approach in the context of the measures announced and those that will be announced on 25 July. I do not agree with the criticism expressed by Members and others outside the House that we should not wait until 25 July, which is only three weeks from today.  The Government announced many measures and it will have more to say on 25 July when it has considered the remaining areas that need to be addressed.  It is important to take that breather to ensure that everything is not seen to be a knee jerk reaction.</P>
    <P>I am a strong law and order supporter and I do not need to rehearse that argument. In the past three years a good deal of legislation has been passed including the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993, the Criminal Justice Public Order Act, 1993, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996 and the Criminal Law Bill, 1996 currently before the Dáil as well as the measures we are debating today, the motion to approve a Convention on Money Laundering, motion to approve a Drugs Convention, motion to approve a Mutual Assistance Convention and Additional Protocol and the motion to approve Draft Regulations under section 46 (6) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>There is much law in place and more promised.  For example, the Government promised to examine the law on bail and to bring forward appropriate proposals. When we have introduced all the law required this House must turn its attention and energies to the substantial breakdown of order generally in society.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples.  In all cases it is not a matter of inadequate resources as in most they have been provided. As Deputy Briscoe knows, the Eastern Health Board has devised a plan to introduce community-based drugs treatment centres.  Drugs are the <Col N="549" /> cause of most crime in society.  Why do people mug others?  Usually it is to obtain money to purchase drugs.  Yet there is very strong resistance on the part of almost all communities to community-based drugs treatment centres to tackle the drugs problems.</P>
    <P>The next question that needs to be posed is: what is the consequence of that resistance?  It is that in many churchyards and schoolyards dangerous, lethal needles are abandoned which can be picked up by children.  We are not taking measures to support the relevant agencies and authorities to tackle this problem.  Sometimes the very people who hold themselves out as the friend of the man in the street, as being concerned for the dreadful conditions in which people live, have not got the guts to give some leadership to the communities they represent or convince them that this type of programme must be positively approached and implemented.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Eastern Health Board programme, in isolation, constitutes the solution but it is one attempt in that direction.  It should be given a chance so that it can be reviewed or adjusted to ensure maximum effectiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On access to third-level education, the reality is that in parts of the county of Dublin it is approaching 50 per cent while in the inner city &mdash; those areas experiencing most of the crime problems, with open drug selling &mdash; the percentage is of the order of 15 per cent.  Yet we spend in the order of £74,000 annually to keep a child in care and God knows what amount of money to keep people in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> In addition, a sum of £5 million was spent recently on refurbishing a flat complex which had fallen into disrepair, but no funds were provided for its continued maintenance.  We must find sufficient resources to target those areas and support the Minister for Education in her efforts.</P>
    <P>How often have we spoken about estate management but also tolerated the bad practice within Dublin Corporation &mdash; there are almost 10,000 flats between the canals &mdash; of bad management and bad trade union practices with the result that there is practically no estate management of those flats, where there is breakdown in law and order.  If we allow this to continue, as sure as night follows day, that disorder will become imbedded in our community and it will become ever more difficult to redress the problem.</P>
    <P>In addition to tackling problems of law and order we must deal with societal injustice.  There has been much talk in this House about the need to provide additional prison places.  There must be places for those sentenced to their full term.  On the other hand, those who do not pose a threat to society should not have to go to prison, we should devise other penalties.  For example, the person who does not pay his or her television licence should have their set confiscated.  Prisons should not be places one enters without a drugs problem but emerges with one.</P>
    <P>Has the need for rehabilitation within our prisons system been addressed? Young mothers regularly plead to have their sons serve their sentence in Cork, anywhere, but not in Mountjoy prison. They tell me their sons never touched drugs before.  We need to advise and implement a regime to reform the prison system, beginning with the appointment of an inspector of prisons.  We must acknowledge that this problem threatens us all in one way or another, if not mine, other people's children. Unless we address this issue all we are doing is adding something else, in this case prison, which is supposed to be part of the solution, to the problem.  That is <Col N="551" /> not bleeding heart politics; it is practical politics.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to read the Denham report on the courts.  State institutions such as the courts need to be made more efficient.  Part of the solution lies in the hands of the judges.  Politicians do not always reside in their constituencies but most do and are on call morning, noon and night.  Some of us spend a disproportionate amount of our time in the inner city where there is a small electoral turnout, no traditional support for centre parties, no great dividend, but do so out of genuine concern for those communities.  I wish the judges would do likewise.  I am not attacking judges &mdash; this is by way of constructive comment &mdash; because I do not believe many judges understand the reality of the problems.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  When Dublin Corporation endeavoured to evict drug pushers known to be preying on children in flat complexes &mdash; one complex comprised between 300 and 500 flats with a population equivalent to that of a large village or small town in rural Ireland &mdash; it came up against a conservative approach by judges who required three or four witnesses.  How could the corporation obtain three of four witnesses when people are being intimidated?  If judges moved more within communities and saw the effects of crime on people, they would become more pragmatic in addressing the problem. We should adopt the Denham report concept of a courts authority administered by a very hard-nosed chief executive who will not be intimidated by judges.  None of us can be judges in our own cause.  We need somebody who will be strictly charged with rendering the system efficient, effective, will find the requisite resources in imaginative ways, including the use of some generated by the courts.</P>
    <P>There is a need for an overall review of the Garda Síochána.  I say to Garda management and the Garda representative bodies, that as we are confronted by a serious general crime problem there is <Col N="552" /> no point in knee-jerk reactions.  Nobody wants to denigrate the Garda; we want to boost their morale and to work with them, but all is not well in the force and there is no point in pretending otherwise. Everybody has been saying so <i>sotto voce</i>; it is time it was said openly. We can be proud of most of the operations of the force.  We support the Garda in their task and meet representatives regularly.  However, there is a need to examine some sections of the force where inefficiencies exist.  There is much talk about their pay and conditions, which are determined independently, but we should also examine some of their working conditions, for example, the condition of some of the stations.  An improvement in conditions would boost morale.</P>
    <P>There is need for us to accurately assess the extent, levels and intensity of the crime problem confronting us, Garda statistics alone are not sufficient. They reflect the crime rate, just as the unemployment statistics reflect the unemployment rate but they do not reflect the prevailing rates or effective prison sentencing.  We need to take a more general approach to the publication of crime statistics which incorporates prisons and court sentencing.  Some judges are very imaginative in their use of sentencing.</P>
    <P>On local development, I am the Minister responsible for local development and I have an integrated plan to tackle disadvantage.  It concentrates on employment, education, training, environmental improvements and estate management training for tenants which is very important; tenants should be trained with the Garda Síochána and with the local authorities to take back control of their estates.  This plan has been examined by the OECD, warts and all, and it said we not only have a very worthy system which not many Members of this House understand &mdash; as it evolves I hope people will understand it &mdash; but something we could offer to the rest of Europe as a way of dealing with the breakdown of order and justice. We have not ever at any time in <Col N="553" /> our history been materially so well off, yet we are developing a two-tier society. We must tackle societal injustice effectively as well as taking a strong law and order approach.  If we do not do both together we will diminish the effectiveness of our approach to dealing with a serious problem.  I hope our approach will be comprehensive and integrated and we will not fear to stand for social justice as well as standing against organised criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>For years I have talked in this House about the right of citizens to walk our streets in safety.  From time to time we read in the media about the poor attendance in this Chamber when there is an important debate such as we are having today.  However not one member of the media is in the press gallery while this debate continues.  I hope they are listening in their rooms, because my quarrel is with them.  For years I have been portrayed as right wing and as a fascist because I wanted something done about law and order. Last night I watched Derek Davis's programme and was sickened when I heard people like Mr. Duffy speaking, the liberals who opposed me when I spoke about the need to introduce laws and to have places of secure detention for young people, particularly those under the age of 15 when we did not have one secure place of detention.  The journalist, Derek Davis, covered the opening of Loughan House for RTE when, for the first time we had a place where we could contain 20 or 30 of the worst young criminals.  It was described as a children's prison and as being contrary to human rights.  The cost of running the place was enormous and it had one teacher to every five inmates.  We had children who had committed the most dreadful crimes in open centres that could not contain them.  I was accused of extremism when I went so far as to say parents should be held responsible for the activities of their children.  The crimes we are witnessing today are being committed by people who in the 1970s were the youngsters who could <Col N="554" /> not be contained who have now grown into the gunmen of the 1980s and 1990s. I am very frustrated and angry, and the people who criticised me then have the cheek to call for more action now and to ask what is the Government doing.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have been reluctant to take the necessary action to protect our citizens because of pressure from the media.  I told the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, we needed in the Department of Justice a person who was not afraid of bad publicity, because we had a fight to fight on behalf of the people.  Our citizens cannot walk the streets in safety any more because we have forsaken our responsibility. The record of this House shows that I said that if the State did not act to protect the citizen, subversive organisations would come to their rescue, and this is happening.  In my area subversives are deeply involved in some of the concerned parents' groups, and when it comes to election time the subversive elements will remind those people about who looked after them when they were in trouble.  When drug dealers are murdered in the streets &mdash; I will not mention by whom, although we have a pretty good idea &mdash; there is an outcry at people taking the law into their own hands, but the ordinary man and woman in the street thanks God somebody is doing something about the problem.  I am so angry, because I do not want that to happen.  My compassion for the victim is what makes me feel so strongly on the question of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we like it or not there is a state of emergency.  It is no use saying otherwise.  This has happened because people like Vincent Browne, who are always trotted out whenever there is a situation like that created by the dreadful murder of the journalist, Veronica Guerin, have been saying for a long time that criminals are entitled to their civil rights.  These murderers and criminals do not recognise other people's civil rights.  Why should we recognise theirs?  We should open up the Curragh and intern them.  People who are caught <Col N="555" /> selling drugs, purchasing drugs, or selling them to get their own free deals should be taken out of circulation. There are about 800 drug pushers in the south inner city of Dublin alone selling 2,500 deals a day, but we are not doing anything about it because we do not have the prison spaces, etc.  The people are at the end of their tether.  When I suggested holding parents responsible in the 1980s, the newspaper <i>Southside</i> described my ideas as Victorian.  I said in this House that the hooligans of the 1970s would be the gunmen of the 1980s and 1990s.  I have been proved right.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell and I, and other public representatives, met the Dolphin's Barn traders not too long ago, and they told us the most horrifying stories about life in that area of Rialto and Dolphin's Barn.  Through the good offices of Deputy Mitchell, the Garda Síochána put in a task force.  Only today I spoke to the people again and they told me the task force was good for a few days but then disappeared and the criminals are back again selling all sorts of stolen goods as well as drugs &mdash; shoes, clothing of all descriptions &mdash; and nobody is doing anything about it.</P>
    <P>When confiscating profits, how will we deal with drug barons and criminals who get family members to keep some of the money in their accounts?  There is a story in today's evening newspaper about drug criminals who have already transferred assets out of this country since we, in Fianna Fáil, introduced our Bill.  That is happening at an ever increasing rate.  God knows how they are transferring them.  To a large extent I hold some of the building societies who held money for these people responsible.  I do not know how they got away with it.</P>
    <P>I predict that the next stage in this saga will be the corruption of officials, gardaí, civil servants, judges and possibly politicians.  It has happened in other countries such as the United States and Colombia.  Why should this country be an exception?  Vast sums of money are available and we must deal with that.  If <Col N="556" /> we do not recognise that possibility there is no hope for this country over the next 50 years because a totalitarian state will emerge in which nobody wants to live.  We have a right to defend our democracy.  We thought nothing of introducing internment over the years when the political situation worsened. There are even more grounds for introducing internment to deal with current criminal activity.  I urge the Government not to be afraid to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>There is low morale among the Garda and I do not blame them.  I would be most unhappy working under conditions where lawyers make all sorts of excuses. There was a law lecturer on the television programme in which Deputy Byrne participated last night.  Their job is to defend the criminal at any cost and look for loopholes.  We are fighting the lawyers as well as the criminal element in many of these cases.</P>

      <P>I did not identify that particular lady.  I am just talking about some of the lawyers who make a good living from these drug barons while knowing exactly what they are.  They may even be advising them on the transfer of assets.</P>
      <P>This country is in trouble and we have a serious problem.  We must tackle it firmly and show the people that we are determined to do so.  It is interesting that throughout this debate not one member of the media has invited me to give an interview.  I was always known as the law and order man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the attempts we are making to open a clinic in the inner city and the opposition which Deputy Byrne, Deputy Mitchell and I have received from some local people.  I am sad to say that a member of the Labour Party has not been fulsome in his support.  The Labour Party should have been to the fore in doing <Col N="557" /> something to treat young people who are up to their eyes in drugs.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, will have a word with this person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only concerned about my own constituency.  Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Byrne and I have been staunch in our support of action on the drug problem.  We have acted as one and I wish there was more cross-party co-operation in other constituencies. However, that is not our problem, I am elected to do a job in my area.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Health on the amount of money he has allocated to combating the drug problem.  It is not enough to introduce penalties and lock people up.  One must counter the effects of drug abuse.  Parents of young people come to us for help to get their children off drugs and we must do so.</P>
      <P>I want to see more evictions of drug pushers from corporation complexes. Many years ago Deputy Mitchell and I had a resolution passed by the housing department providing that anyone convicted of selling drugs would be evicted by the corporation and the corporation would be under no obligation to rehouse them.  There have been a couple of cases, but it has been difficult to get convictions against some drug pushers.</P>
      <P>Night courts should be used for road traffic offences such as driving over the alcohol limit.  Community work should be required of those convicted of white collar crime.  It could involve building prisons, which we need urgently.  It is not enough to say we only need them temporarily.  We must do something about this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue said recently that organised crime is concerned with the illicit accumulation of wealth.  He said that the death of Veronica Guerin gives rise to a question which we in this <Col N="558" /> House and this country generally must answer.  He asked whether we are prepared to continue to tolerate the unhindered existence in our society of people who have accumulated vast and unexplained wealth from criminal activity. That is the kennel of the problem. Whether we are in Government or in Opposition we must unite as one assembly in the common fight against drug abuse.  If we do not, we will have failed everyone.</P>
    <P>The media also have a role to play. Politicians should not be intimidated by the media if labelled right-wing or fascist. I hate these terms and I do not fit into either category.  I believe in the protection of our people and I have spoken in my constituency about the rights of people.</P>
    <P>Every meeting in our constituency which is attended by Deputy Byrne, Deputy Mitchell and myself has law and order on the agenda.  At residents association meetings people are crying out, not just about drugs but also about burglaries and addicts stealing to feed their habits.  We hear them; the Government and the civil servants who advise the Ministers must hear them and enact laws to deal with the problem.  If a measure cannot be implemented because it is unconstitutional, we must find a way to pass the necessary law.</P>
    <P>We are told that certain things can only be done if a state of emergency is declared.  A state of emergency exists and everybody in this country is saying it.  For God's sake let us do something about it and be seen to do so.  We have worked and tried so hard.  If we fail now, we will have let everyone down.</P>
    <P>I hope that politicians will show courage, introduce the necessary legislation and ignore the so-called lily-white liberals. They are not liberals but would rather see people suffer than do something about these murderers and criminals who openly flaunt their wealth.  It is a horrifying indictment of us all that they have been able to do this for so long.  Life has become unliveable in every section of society, but particularly in the poorest sections who are the <Col N="559" /> greatest victims and suffer the most.  We have a responsibility to these people. Let us hope we can do something about it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of my constituency colleagues, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Mitchell, are present.  I confirm Deputy Briscoe's comment that we work in difficult circumstances and with unity of purpose.  Treatment services is one of the key and most politically difficult areas in which we involve ourselves.</P>
      <P>If we are to be successful we must tackle the accumulated wealth of the drug barons.  They are not all huge barons; many of them have come from the ghetto themselves.  They lived in poverty in inner city flat complexes, but now act as a shining example of how one can make money from crime.  This has led to a new generation coming on stream in their hundreds.  The obvious signs of the wealth accumulated from drug dealing attract them to gain a foothold and wealth and get out of the ghetto.</P>
      <P>If a constitutional referendum on the right to private property is needed to freeze and seize the assets of drug barons, I will be happy to support it.  If legislation adopted by the House on freezing the assets of so called drug barons has not been properly thought through, they will use the best brains in the legal profession to test its constitutionality. That would be a setback to the democratic process.</P>

While the Government would have hoped that the negotiations could have proceeded more rapidly to matters of substance, nonetheless it is perhaps understandable that the early stages of negotiations involving so many parties, with such different viewpoints, would make relatively slow headway.  I am hopeful that agreement on the rules of procedure will soon be reached and that it will be possible to move into the substantive negotiations which we all wish to see without undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 6 June, the two Governments invited a group consisting of Senator <Col N="563" /> George Mitchell, General John de Chastelain and Mr. Harri Holkeri to play a role in chairing various aspects of the negotiations which require independent chairmanship.  They invited the chairman of the group, Senator Mitchell, to chair the plenary sessions of the negotiations, and also invited General de Chastelain to chair the Strand II negotiations and the business committee, and Mr. Holkeri to act as alternate chairman in any of the chairmanship roles.  On Wednesday, 12 June the Opening Plenary formally appointed Senator Mitchell, General de Chastelain and Mr. Holkeri to these chairmanships. I, and other members of the Government negotiating team &mdash; like each of the other negotiating teams &mdash; have, of course, been in intensive and ongoing contact with Senator Mitchell and his colleagues since the negotiations began. We are very fortunate to have secured the services of three such distinguished personalities, whose skills and dedication have already been amply demonstrated.</P>
    <P>Following the formal opening of the negotiations on 10 June by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, the Government has been represented at political level by a team drawn from myself, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Minister of State, Deputy Coveney and the Attorney General.  This allows us the flexibility to be represented in a variety of formations, depending on the subject matter and the particular stage reached in discussion.  A list setting out the details of attendance on particular days is being circulated in the Official Report.  Officials have also been present throughout.</P>
    <P>The ground rules establish the basic parameters for the Strand II negotiations. They will cover relationships within the island of Ireland and will involve the British and Irish Governments and the political parties participating in the negotiations.  As I indicated earlier, formal meetings in Strand <Col N="564" /> II will be chaired by General de Chastelain. Negotiations will take place on the basis of an agreed agenda and in appropriate formations as agreed by the participants. On 6 June the two Governments put forward a draft agenda for Strand II, but this has yet to be considered by the other participants in the negotiations.  The ground rules also state that Strand II negotiations will take place in Belfast, Dublin and London, at times agreed by the business committee.  No precise arrangements have yet been made.</P>
    <P>As regards the venues for the other elements of the negotiations, meetings in Strand I will take place at Castle Buildings, Belfast; the two Governments will determine where Strand III meetings will take place; and the business committee shall determine the venue of its meetings.</P>
    <P>As I stated when last answering questions in this House, on 30 May: &ldquo;the Government's approach will be based on the Framework Document.  While it is intended as an aid to negotiations and not as a rigid blueprint to be imposed, both Governments have stated that it sets out a realistic, balanced and achievable framework for agreement&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach reiterated the commitment of the Government to the Framework Document in his address at the opening of the negotiations on 10 June.  Ultimately, of course, it is for the participants themselves to determine the outcome of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>As regards treatment of the decommissioning issue, the two Governments maintain their joint commitment, originally stated in the communiqué of 28 February, that as one of a number of confidence-building measures all participants would need to address, at the beginning of the discussions, the International Body's proposals on decommissioning. In the documents, published on 6 June, the two Governments also confirmed their commitment to all aspects of the report of the International Body, including our support for the compromise approach to decommissioning set out in paragraphs 34 and <Col N="565" /> 35.  Both Governments agree with the International Body that this approach provides the opportunity to move forward, and that it is on the basis of working constructively to implement this and all other aspects of the report that the negotiations should be advanced.  We confirmed we would work with all the participants to implement all aspects of the report.</P>
    <P>The question of how to deal with decommissioning in the negotiations has not yet been agreed, and indeed has not so far been the subject of serious discussion in the negotiations.  The conditions for participation in the negotiations remain as set out in the ground rules.  All political parties with an electoral mandate deriving from the 30 May elections in Northern Ireland which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and have shown that they abide by the democratic process are entitled to be involved.  Sinn Féin's participation in the negotiations, and the resumption of ministerial dialogue with them, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.</P>
    <P>I continue to urge the Sinn Féin leadership to immediately seek such a restoration.  That is the only basis on which the 15 per cent of the Northern Ireland electorate which voted for them &mdash; after they had campaigned on the slogan &ldquo;Vote for Peace&rdquo;&mdash; can be directly represented at the negotiations. The Government wants to see this happen as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is clear that the recent IRA atrocities in Adare, Manchester and Osnabruck, which I once again condemn in the strongest possible terms, with the discovery by the Garda of the Clonaslee bomb factory, have added greatly to the anger and doubts of the public about the intentions of the republican movement.  It will be for the republican movement to find ways of overcoming these extra obstacles and of demonstrating the credibility of any future statement that the ceasefire has been restored.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to be open to communication with Sinn Féin <Col N="566" /> at official level.  In the period leading up to 10 June, we used official channels to convey to Sinn Féin our conviction that the arrangements being put in place for the negotiations were fair and balanced, and our determination to ensure that the negotiations would be serious and comprehensive.  While we will continue to keep channels of communication open as appropriate, I must make clear the view of the Government that the restoration of the IRA ceasefire is not a matter for negotiation, but rather a matter where the most urgent action is required by the leaders of the republican movement themselves.</P>
    <P>I repeat the assurances given by the Government to the House that all possible action will be taken to prevent further IRA outrages, and the resources of the State fully deployed in pursuing the perpetrators of crime, from whatever quarter they come.</P>

      <P>That is a very comprehensive reply to the series of questions. On the question of the ceasefire, does the Tánaiste see grounds for optimism in relation to a renewed IRA ceasefire <Col N="567" /> and is he aware of any grounds for the slightly more optimistic views expressed in statements yesterday by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and the British Prime Minister?  Does he see anything new in the IRA interview published in <i>An Phoblacht</i> today?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to comment on the lines requested by the Deputy, it would be pure speculation.  I will be honest and frank in my replies to the Deputy in that respect.  Earlier this year, leading up to 10 June, the time we completed our negotiations with the British Government, we believed that everything that was required was in place for the cessation of violence to be restored. Unfortunately, since then those hopes have been dashed because of what has happened in Adare, Manchester and, of course, the attack on the Continent.</P>
      <P>Against that background it is fair to acknowledge that there are people who want to bring Sinn Féin into the democratic process, into talks and negotiations. I hope those people will be successful because we want them at those talks.  The public has difficulty understanding how there are people saying they want peace talks, the peace talks were arranged for 10 June on the clear understanding that we wanted Sinn Féin to be at them but now the atrocities are continuing.  The message from the Government is very clear and I know it is one with which Deputy Burke agrees in that there will be no negotiations or discussions until there is a clear restoration of the ceasefire.  We urge it to call a ceasefire as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that there cannot and should not be any talks until the ceasefire is restored.  What he is saying, in effect, is that he has no information to confirm the assessment of the situation by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland who engaged in speculation yesterday that there is hope for a ceasefire.  I hope from everybody's point of view that it is accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> The Minister will be aware of the disappointment many people feel in relation to the lack of progress in the procedural wrangles at the talks which began on 10 June in Stormont.  Will he comment on the disappointment expressed by the deputy leader of the SDLP, Mr. Seamus Mallon, at the lack of action and resolve of the two Governments and their failure to take a lead role in the process?  Will he accept that these procedural issues need to be settled as rapidly as possible and that signs of progress would have a most positive effect on the chances for a renewed ceasefire?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Governments want to make progress.  Some parties are more anxious than others to do so.  I do not think anybody was particularly surprised that there were difficulties at the launch of the talks.  There are parties present with widely diverging views, some of whom have never sat down with one another in the past in formal negotiations.  We want to create space to overcome these difficulties.  We had hoped that progress would have been made by now.  We still hope that progress can be achieved before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>In relation to the comments made by Mr. Seamus Mallon, in close co-operation with the British Government, the Government is active in trying to conclude the procedural phase of the negotiations as quickly as possible.  We are also working closely with the other participants, not least, in terms of meetings, the SDLP.  We will continue to do everything possible, in close co-operation with the British Government, to move the process forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to expedite matters we have to get agreement among the participants. We have to be careful in our approach because from time to time we are accused, I believe unfairly, of imposing propositions and solutions on various parties.  We will try to progress matters in a careful and sensitive way. <Col N="569" /> We are working to obtain the agreement of the parties sitting at the table with us.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your concern but the Minister covered a considerable amount of ground, including the issue of decommissioning, the subject matter of Question No. 8 in the name of Deputy O'Donnell.  I ask you to bear with me.</P>
      <P>The ground rules for the talks were set out by the two Governments.  It is essential that they take a lead role.  It will be easier for them to bring the parties with them if there is consistency in the membership of the negotiating teams, particularly at a high level.  The Government should do everything possible to allay the concerns of Mr. Seamus Mallon who was a participant in the 1992 talks and is not unfamiliar with the way the talks process should be moved forward.  The two Governments have a leading role to play, not a passive one. That has not been done so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy said.  The Government is right to consider that it is playing a leading role.  Ultimate responsibility rests with the two Governments.  That is the basis upon which we will continue to work in the talks.  I understand the frustration of politicians like Mr. Seamus Mallon who wants to get on with serious and meaningful negotiations.  We will do everything in our power to ensure we can get to that stage as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the decommissioning question be dealt with in the absence of Sinn Féin?  Is it the Government's position that once there is a ceasefire and the six Mitchell principles are accepted and observed no party can be excluded from the talks?  Does Sinn Féin expect to be allowed in once the ceasefire is restored on the grounds that <Col N="570" /> it accepts the Mitchell principles, despite the horrendous incidents in Adare, Manchester and Osnabruck?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I made clear on the last occasion I answered questions in the House, we want Sinn Féin at the table. The difficulties in relation to its participation have been exacerbated because of the atrocities committed since.  Notwithstanding this, it received a 17 per cent mandate in the Northern Ireland elections.  We strongly believe that a great deal of this is accounted for by people who want peace and Sinn Féin to participate in negotiations.  We will do everything we can in that respect.</P>
      <P>So far as the Government is concerned, the Mitchell report governs the decommissioning issue.  It would be unwise to try to unscramble the Mitchell report in its totality.  Paragraphs 34 and 35 in particular offer the best and perhaps only way of dealing with this difficult question, if we are to be successful.</P>

      <P>As this House will be aware, the Western European Union Assembly is a consultative body made up of parliamentarians from the ten Western European Union member states.  Parliamentarians from Western European Union observer states, Western European Union Associate member and Associate partner states also attend in accordance with their respective statuses but do not participate in the adoption of recommendations by the assembly.  In accordance with Ireland's observer status in the Western European Union, Ireland was represented in an observer capacity by Members of this House at the recent regular session of <Col N="571" /> the Western European Union Assembly in Paris from 3 to 6 June.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the assembly's position on the issues referred to by the Deputy. As I have made clear in this House in the past, the views of the Western European Union Assembly are not binding on the member states of the Western European Union.  They bind no one but the assembly itself.</P>
      <P>Ireland's commitment to nuclear disarmament is well known and is set out in detail in the White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have noted that the Western European Union Assembly called on the Western European Union Council to engage in a debate on European defence consolidated, possibly, by concerted deterrents, by establishing initially a strategic study group to examine the role of nuclear weapons in Europe's security and the role all Western European Union member states might play in defining a future European nuclear strategy.  In the context of the Intergovernmental Conference, will the Minister assure the House that there is no question of Ireland supporting a proposal to amalgamate the Western European Union and the EU?</P>

      <P>I do not think that any of my actions have been different from the actions of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Foreign Affairs in relation to our participation as an observer at the Western European Union.

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Intergovernmental Conference, the Deputy is well aware that we will enter the next phase of the negotiations during our Presidency of the European Union.  Our position on these matters is well known. <Col N="572" /> As I have said on numerous occasions in the House, there are widely divergent views on the development of EU-WEU relations, ranging from total amalgamation or integration of the Western European Union into the EU, the development of the relationship over a period of time and the need to keep them totally distinct, as at present.  We set out our views on this debate in the White Paper and we will continue to maintain this position in the negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 13, 26 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>As I have said publicly on a number of occasions recently, the situation in former Yugoslavia is a priority foreign policy issue for the European Union during Ireland's Presidency.  In relation to Bosnia Herzegovina in particular, our efforts will be directed towards ensuring an effective EU contribution to the international effort to assist the parties in fully implementing the General Framework Agreement which was concluded at Dayton.</P>
      <P>One of the cornerstones of the peace process will be the general elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will take place on 14 September.  The responsibility for ensuring that conditions exist for the organisation of free and fair elections lies with the parties themselves &mdash; this is clearly stated in the peace agreement.  As regards international assistance, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, was requested by the parties to supervise the preparation and conduct of such elections.  The task of determining if and when conditions exist for elections to be held in a free, fair and democratic manner was also given to the OSCE and its chairman-in-office, currently the Swiss Foreign Minister, Mr. Cotti.</P>
      <P>On 25 June Mr. Cotti announced that the elections will go ahead in September, but also made clear his assessment that conditions for the holding of free and fair elections were far from ideal.  However, having weighed all factors carefully, Mr. Cotti came to the conclusion that there were no convincing alternatives to the holding of elections and that these should go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Malley's question as to whether there is any point in holding elections unless they can be guaranteed to be fair and democratic, I <Col N="574" /> refer to the statement made by Mr. Cotti on 25 June that, &ldquo;the question of whether or not it is opportune to hold the elections should not be seen only from the short-term point of view of prerequisite election conditions.  It must be placed in a more global context&rdquo;. The elections are not an end in themselves, but a means to an end, a step on the road towards stability and reconciliation. Mr. Cotti's overall assessment is that postponing the elections would have put the process in reverse and had the effect of causing a deterioration in the conditions stipulated for polling and an acceleration of the trend which exists towards political separation.  It is also fair to say that the elections represent the only hope for the reconstruction of ethnically-mixed communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>
    <P>Forty-nine political parties and 33 independent candidates have registered to participate in the elections.  This reflects the interest which the Bosnian people have in the electoral process, and demonstrates the progress being made in the establishment of democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, elections took place in Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 30 June &mdash; the first elections in that country since the outbreak of the war.  The assessment of those who were present on polling day was that the elections were generally well conducted and the turnout &mdash; in the region of 60 per cent &mdash; was high.  More than 8,000 refugees exercised their right to vote in the elections in third countries.  I hope that the successful holding of the Mostar elections will be a positive indicator for the general elections in September.  The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina need our support for their efforts to organise those elections.</P>
    <P>The OSCE is fulfilling its tasks with the assistance of the European Union and its member states.  The European Community Monitor Mission ECMM, of which Ireland has now assumed the leadership, is providing invaluable assistance to the OSCE throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The EU has also <Col N="575" /> responded positively to an OSCE request to adopt a joint action to contribute to the OSCE's election supervision mission.  All EU member states, including Ireland, will contribute significant numbers of personnel to this effort in advance of elections and the EU will make available some three million ECU from Community funds in support of this effort.</P>
    <P>In addition, EU member states have also contributed nationally to the voluntary fund established by the OSCE to finance the OSCE electoral programme &mdash; Ireland has donated more than IR £200,000.  The EU and its member states are also contributing to various initiatives aimed at promoting the independent media in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the work of other international organisations, such as the UN and its various agencies, which are involved in the effort to improve conditions for elections.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these efforts, there is no doubt that much hard work remains to be done to improve conditions between now and polling day.  The human rights situation is still a cause for concern, particularly in the Republica Srpska.  While physical obstacles to freedom of movement have been removed, groups within the population feel that they cannot exercise free movement, particularly across the inter-entity boundary line, IEBL, because of the risk of intimidation and aggression.  This situation must be addressed by the parties who have an obligation to ensure such freedom.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious threats to the electoral process is the continued liberty of indicted war crimes suspects.  It will be recalled that, under the terms of the Dayton Agreement, no individual indicated by the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague can hold, or seek to hold, public office.  As part of their commitments under the agreement it is the responsibility of the parties to co-operate with the International Criminal Tribunal and to ensure that such suspects are handed over.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> Ireland, with its European partners, is monitoring compliance in this area very closely.  I have always strongly supported the activities of the tribunal and will continue, in my capacity as President of the Council of Ministers, to urge the parties to co-operate fully.</P>
    <P>I am greatly concerned that the Bosnian Serb entity, the Republica Srpska, continues to disregard the demands of the international community to abide by its commitments under the peace agreements. In particular, Radovan Karadzic has persistently refused to deliver himself, or any other indicated person, to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The European Union supports the efforts of the High Representative, Carl Bildt, who is working for Karadzic's withdrawal from public life.  Ireland and its European partners will continue to emphasise to the leaders of the Republica Srpska that indicted war criminals must be extradited to The Hague to stand trial.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Tribunal has been attempting to fulfil its mandate under difficult circumstances, in which it has only recently seen a number of successes.  Under its statute, it is not permitted to try suspects <i>in absentia.</i> However, under Rule 61, where there has been a failure after some time to execute arrest warrants, such as in the case of Karadzic and Mladic, the tribunal has the opportunity to review its indictment against the suspect.  A Rule 61 hearing is not a trial, merely a review by the judges of the evidence before the tribunal and a chance for it to respond to the failure by the parties to comply with the arrest warrant.  If the judges decide that the indictment was correct, they must issue an international warrant of arrest, which binds all states.  Rule 61 hearings also permit public exposure of the evidence which supports the indictment, allowing victims of vicious and horrific crimes against humanity a chance to tell their story.</P>
    <P>Once a defendant is brought or voluntarily appears before the tribunal, to answer to the charges made against him, he is allowed a full defence.  Until that <Col N="577" /> time no trial may be held of the charges against him and, therefore, no person is required to appear in his defence.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the proposed elections on 14 September will be based on the electoral register of some date in 1991 before the worst of the conflict arose in Bosnia and that a very high proportion of the people registered in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the early part of 1991 now live outside Bosnia or in a different part of the country and almost certainly do not have access to their former homes, particularly if they lived in the Serboccupied part of the country?  How is it considered possible to have normal, free, fair or democratic elections when it is impossible for a significant proportion of the electorate to travel to vote and there is, apparently, no arrangement for any form of postal or proxy voting?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that the election held in Mostar during the past week or so is not in any sense an example of what the position might be in Bosnia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is he aware that Mostar is a relatively small city divided by a river with the Muslims on one side and the Croats on the other, that there are no Serbs and there are 2,500 heavily armed IFOR troops in the city who do not let anything untoward happen?  The conditions which existed in Mostar on polling day could not be replicated in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole and particularly <Col N="578" /> could not be replicated in the Serb occupied part.  Will he comment on the difficulties which have arisen and say how in the circumstances elections can be held?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concerns.  They are concerns we have voiced from time to time.  The Dayton Agreement set out a certain scenario including elections, the OSCE was charged with assessing whether the election should take place and Mr. Cotti, President of the OSCE, spent a great deal of his time and energy over a period of months assessing the election process. It is worth reflecting on what Mr. Cotti said given the amount of time and effort he and the OSCE team spent in assessing whether the elections should go ahead.  We have to accept that the situation is far from perfect.  I would not attempt to equate Mostar, which as the Deputy rightly said is a small city with clear divisions, with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The elections were devised to cater for those divisions.  My brief informs me that there Muslims, Croats and Serbs voted in the city of Mostar and the elections were considered to be generally satisfactory.  I agree there was a heavy presence of IFOR troops.  Elections are scheduled for 12 September where on the balance of probabilities it is considered by international agencies and by most Governments who have expressed views on it that it is the correct procedure.  I would not attempt to suggest, on the basis of the Mostar elections, that success is guaranteed in terms of free and fair elections or democratic procedures in respect of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The alternative is so bleak we should get on with the elections in the best possible way and ensure we keep moving on the Dayton Ohio agreement. If we were to lose the momentum of the Dayton agreement I fear the future would be bleak in the region.</P>

      <P>In view of the failure of Mr. Karadzic to deliver himself or Mladic or any of the other 50, approximately, Serb people who have been <Col N="579" /> indicated for war crimes of a serious nature will the Tánaiste in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers advocate the reimposition of sanctions not only against the self-declared Republic of Srpska within Bosnia but against Serbia?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcomes the ideas put forward by President Santer in his proposals for a Confidence Pact on Employment.  President Santer's proposals to a large extent involve economic and social measures to improve the conditions for creating employment.  They were largely endorsed at the Florence European Council and they will be pursued vigorously by the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One element only of President Santer's proposals involved allocating additional Community funds.  This was for the provision of further Community finance mainly for the priority transport projects under the Trans-European Networks programme.  It was not possible, however, to reach agreement on this at <Col N="581" /> Florence.  Ireland, for its part, was prepared to support the proposal.</P>
    <P>As Presidency, we will ensure that, in accordance with the conclusions at Florence, the Budget Council will give full consideration to the issue.  The first step, however, is for the Commission to come forward with detailed proposals.</P>

If the Deputy wishes I can provide him with the details.  There was not any agreement on the priority transport projects under the Trans-European Networks programme. Ireland would support the funding of those projects because we see them as an element of addressing the unemployment question throughout Europe. They are not the ultimate solution but they are an element of the package and we hope to have that matter resolved during our Presidency.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Foreign Affairs, in view of the statement in the White Paper on Foreign Policy that the Government intends to initiate a campaign to seek membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights, his views on the recent statement by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Ayala Lasso, that the already limited resources which were allocated for human rights in the regular budget for 1996-97 had to be reduced by $2.7 million, or 6 per cent; the additional financial resources, if any, the Government intends to commit in the current financial year to support the crucial work of the Commission and of the UN in general in the field of human rights.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland was recently elected to the UN Commission on Human Rights for a three year term which will commence on 1 January 1997.  As a member of the Commission, Ireland will continue to give the fullest expression to the priority attached by the Irish people to the promotion of respect for human rights.  Our main priorities will include a commitment to developing the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and strengthening the role of that office including its management of the UN Centre for Human Rights in Geneva. We are also committed to seeking the allocation of additional resources to human rights in the UN system under the overall direction of the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner.</P>
      <P>In view of this we greatly regret that the allocation of funding to human rights in the UN regular budget has been reduced.  This is part of system-wide cuts which apply to every agency throughout the United Nations system and not just to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  These cuts have been applied because of the general financial crisis in the UN budget, caused to a large extent by arrears of payments by some member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to member states of the United Nations also to make voluntary contributions to UN programmes in the field of human rights.  In the current financial year, for example, Ireland is contributing to the UN Fund for Victims of Torture, the UN Voluntary Fund for Technical Development in Human Rights and the Centre for Human Rights, which is under the direct control of the High Commissioner.  In addition, a number of human rights projects are supported under my Department's Human Rights and Democratisation Fund.  Contributions to all these funds <Col N="583" /> in the current financial year show a substantial increase over the last financial year.  In the case of the Centre for Human Rights this is the first contribution by Ireland to assist the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed in the Minister's reply. While I accept there are major funding problems in the UN and that some countries have not contributed their fair share, surely human rights issues should receive priority.  How can we expect the UN Commission on Human Rights to carry out its work if there is a major reduction in funding?  It is not appropriate for the Minister to talk about a commitment to resources when they will be reduced significantly.  Where will resources be found to fund the drafting of international instruments, the prevention of discrimination, the protection of minorities, Protocols, conventions against torture, the protection of persons detained on grounds of mental ill health, <i>ad hoc</i> committees on procedures and so on?  How will this work be carried out if we allow such a reduction in resources?  What is the Minister doing to prioritise the issue of human rights?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We share the Deputy's concern in this regard and I conveyed that message to a meeting between Ministers and the Under Secretary General last week.  Ireland makes its payments on time, but there is a serious financial crisis in the United Nations.  The European Union contributes 35.28 per cent of the regular budget and 37.72 per cent of the peacekeeping budget.  All EU member states paid promptly and in full.  We raise the financial difficulties in the UN with the United States at every appropriate opportunity.  During our recent State visit to Washington we expressed concern at the US proposal to reduce funding.  This is a difficult issue, but we will continue to do everything possible to support the role of the High Commissioner, including making representations for an adequate budget. <Col N="584" /> We have paid in excess of our requirement for human rights issues and will continue to contribute generously.</P>

      <P>When drafting documentation on the new Union agreements at the Intergovernmental Conference, will the Minister use the EU Presidency to ensure that human rights issues have a central place on the agenda?  As the agreement to set up the EU was based primarily on trade, it does not have a coherent human rights basis.  During our Presidency, will the Minister endeavour to remedy the defect in the Union and Maastricht agreements and give human rights issues the priority they deserve?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is well aware of the priority we give to human rights issues, which is outlined in paragraph 8.19 of the White Paper.  We are committed to developing the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and strengthening the role of that office, including its management of the UN Centre for Human Rights in Geneva.  As the Deputy correctly stated, these are important issues to be considered on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>An important conference will take place here next Tuesday at which all the NGOs and the Secretary General of the Red Cross will be represented.  A number of these issues will be considered at that conference and there will be a further opportunity to develop the question of human rights when the Intergovernmental Conference considers the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, in reply to Question No. 55, I recalled that in 1979, when Ireland established diplomatic relations with The People's Republic of China, the Government of Ireland recognised the Government of The People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.  The Chinese position at that time was and still is that China includes Tibet.</P>
      <P>In relation to Tibet, protection of the human rights of Tibetans is a central concern of Government policy.  I have consistently raised this issue of human rights with the Chinese authorities in the past and I will continue to do so at every appropriate opportunity.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the problems which have been mentioned by the Deputies, human rights violations; immigration to Tibet of persons of Han-Chinese origin; the question of religious freedom, including the whereabouts of the Dalai Lama's choice as Panchen Lama.</P>
      <P>These issues have been raised by the European Union, specifically at the EU Troika-Human Rights Dialogue Meeting which took place earlier this year in January; these matters will be actively pursued with the Chinese authorities during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a priority the Government wishes to see the early re-establishment of the dialogue between the Dalai Lama and <Col N="586" /> the Chinese authorities and I am prepared to do everything possible to encourage this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste again referred to 1979 when we established diplomatic relations with China.  Tibet was never part of China.  It is a separate country and the only connection it had with China in 1979 was that it had been occupied, against the will of the Tibetan people, by the Chinese from 1949.  That armed occupation should no longer cut any ice.  Is the Minister aware that the persecution of the Tibetan people has intensified?  It is now apparently a capital offence to even have a photograph of the Dalai Lama in one's possession or house.  Large numbers of monks and nuns have been taken out of monasteries and tortured and the monasteries destroyed.  The nuns have been tortured in an unspeakable fashion.  Is the Minister aware that the Panchen Lama, at six years of age, is probably the youngest political prisoner in the world and I am sure does not even know why the Chinese arrested him?  Does the Minister agree that these consistent actions against Tibet and the Tibetan people are too much to expect the world, the United Nations or the European Union to accept?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is slightly disingenuous in reinterpreting, with hindsight, the decisions of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1979.  If the Deputy wishes, I can produce files that will show the facts.  When the Government, representing the Irish people, established diplomatic relations with The People's Republic of China in 1979, it recognised it as the sole legal government of China as it was claimed to exist in 1979.  The Chinese view at that time was that China included Tibet.  The Deputy may not like to hear it, but that is the position the Irish Government at that time accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way we deal with the abuse of human rights in Tibet is a separate matter. From my information, the Dalai Lama is willing to negotiate with the <Col N="587" /> Chinese authorities about the future of Tibet.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, met representatives of the Dalai Lama two months ago and, while emphasising the human rights issue, urged them to keep talking to the Chinese. I raise this matter every time I meet Chinese representatives, including the Foreign Minister, and on behalf of the European Union, we will continue to raise the question of human rights and the treatment of the Tibetans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the Chinese presence in Tibet is an armed occupation and that the ruthless suppression of its people and their religion is an affront to humanity and a flagrant violation of the rights of self-determination of the Tibetan people?

      <P>The position of this Government, as of previous Governments since 1979, has not changed in relation to recognising the Chinese Government as the sole Government of China, including Tibet.  That is the factual situation and there has not been any variation of it.  In relation to the situation in Tibet, the EU Troika raised the dispute between the Dalai Lama and the central government over difficulties referred to by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Burke.  We will continue to do so as is our obligation and duty, whether or not we hold the Presidency of the European Union, as a country that has a strong track record on human rights.</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that the German parliament's resolution condemning China's policy of repression in Tibet, and calling for the protection of Tibetan culture, was right?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in <Col N="588" /> condemning the policy of repression and the way the Tibetan people have been treated.  I have been consistent in that respect.  I am well aware of the discussions that took place in the German parliament, but the difficulty is that the Germans have no opportunity to influence events in China now that the proposed visit of their foreign minister has been cancelled.  The Chinese have made it clear that they do not want the German foreign minister to travel to China. He will not have the opportunity of raising these issues face to face with the Chinese foreign minister.</P>
      <P>It is a question of striking a balance, but I have no difficulty in condemning the policy of repression and I will continue to do so.  Last year, however, the Tibetans wanted us to participate in the Beijing conference on women's affairs. They thought it was right for us to air our views and make our concerns felt in that forum.</P>

It is not prepared to be party to a policy of appeasement in order that its minister can visit China. We should stand up and speak out about repression and other human rights violations.  Torture and ill treatment of prisoners is common in China despite the fact that they have signed for various UN conventions against torture. They are involved in torture on a daily basis which results in the deaths of victims throughout their society, particularly, in Tibet.  Surely we should condemn that.  Why should we be afraid to condemn it?</P>

      <P>On my instructions, the situation concerning these three permanent vehicle checkpoints has been raised again with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat. They have responded that, due to the present security situation, these checkpoints will remain in place for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>When I replied to previous questions from the Deputy on this issue on 27 June 1995 and 18 October 1995, I assured him that I would continue to press for the removal of these checkpoints. The de-escalation of security forces activity in Northern Ireland was discussed at meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in October and December 1995 during the ceasefire period.</P>
      <P>In the lead up to the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire, some progress had been made on easing security restrictions at Border crossings.  Approximately 95 per cent of previously closed cross-Border roads have been reopened since August 1994 and have remained so despite the breakdown in the IRA ceasefire.  However, the situation in regard to the removal of static checkpoints was disappointing, as I noted in reply to a parliamentary question on the checkpoint at Aughnacloy on 7 February 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I continue to be of the view that the permanent vehicle checkpoints at Mulan, Gortmullan and Wattlebridge should be removed as soon as possible. It is clear that a restoration of the IRA <Col N="590" /> ceasefire would substantially improve the prospects of achieving this goal.</P>
    <P>At the most recent Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting on 22 May there was a full discussion of the measures being taken by the security forces in response to the current security threat.  The Government accepts the need to take account of the situation created by the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire and to counter any threat of terrorist activity.  I know that the Garda Síochána has the support of the whole House in its co-operation with the RUC and the British police to this end.  At the same time the two Governments are agreed on the importance of confidence-building on all sides and on minimising inconvenience to the public.  The Conference meeting on 22 May reaffirmed our willingness to respond appropriately to reductions in the security threat.

I appeal to him to continue to raise this matter with the British authorities through the Intergovernmental Conference.

      <Quest>and Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will consider changing the regulations for the issuing of passports for minors in cases where one parent is deceased in order that the surviving parent does not need to get a sworn affidavit to confirm sole guardianship of the child, particularly in the case of a passport renewal.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 the mother and father of a child born in wedlock are its joint guardians, subject to any qualifying court order.  The Act further provides for the right of a parent to appoint, by deed or will, a person to act as guardian of his or her child in the event of the parent's death.  Such a person, known as a testamentary guardian, acts jointly with the surviving parent.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office is not automatically aware of situations where a testamentary guardian has been appointed. Accordingly, in order to safeguard the rights of parents and guardians as laid down in the Act, a parent claiming to be a child's sole legal guardian, on the basis that the other parent is deceased, is asked to swear an affidavit to that effect and that no other person has been appointed a guardian by the courts or by operation of law.</P>
      <P>The affidavit is normally returned to the applicant by the Passport Office and can be re-used when renewing the passport provided that the surviving parent confirms, in writing, that there has been no material change in the circumstances and that he or she continues to be the child's sole legal guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the purpose of affidavits is to ensure protection of the legal rights of <Col N="592" /> parents and guardians under the Guardianship of Infants Act and other legislation, I do not believe it would be prudent to alter present practice.</P>

      <P>The measure referred to in Deputy Smith's question relates to cross-Border co-operation between public bodies and a total of 10.834 MECU in funding has been made available under the measure.  An additional 2.5 MECU is available for the same purposes under measure 3(B).</P>
      <P>While no projects have yet been assisted, it was recently agreed between the relevant Departments, North and South, to allocate the available funding under measures 3(A) and 3(B) in two tranches.  The first tranche allocation which will not exceed one third of the available funding will be made in mid-July and it is anticipated that the second and larger allocation will be made in mid-September.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Tánaiste is aware of the concern and frustration of Members of the Oireachtas of all political parties over the lack of economic development that has taken place, given the opportunities that arose during the cessation of violence.  Does the Tánaiste agree that flagship development projects are needed to enhance the economic regeneration of the Border <Col N="593" /> region?  Such projects would act as a catalyst for other developments.  I have in mind a particular project that took place a number of years ago following a decision of the then Government, of which Deputy Ray Burke was a member, to restore the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.</P>
      <P>Major projects such as that act as a catalyst for other developments.  This is an opportune time to make the relevant funding available to bring those projects to fruition.  Investment in that regard would be well rewarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Smith.  As I said publicly at a function attended by the Deputy, the decision to restore the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal was very wise.  Although it was questioned by many people, that decision, made by the Government led by Mr. Haughey who had a personal commitment to the project &mdash; I publicly acknowledged his role in that regard &mdash; showed vision.  There has been a great spin-off in the localities through which the canal runs in terms of redevelopment of villages, tourism facilities and so on.</P>
      <P>A number of other exciting projects have been undertaken in the Border region in recent years in terms of top quality hotels and sports facilities, which are welcome, and it is important that we build on those.  I hope the Deputy will consider the announcements to be made in the middle of July as signs that we will see this programme through. Further decisions will be made in September. I would like to think that the desired effect of those announcements will be what the Deputy is seeking and that they will be seen as a positive contribution to the development of the region.</P>

      <P>Following the attack on the UN base at Qana on 18 April 1996, the UN Secretary General instructed his military adviser, Major-General Frank van Kappen, to investigate and report on the circumstances of the attack.  Following intensive investigations and discussions with the parties involved, General van Kappen completed his report on 7 May 1996.  The Secretary General presented the report to the Security Council, which is still considering the matter.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomed the report as a thorough, professional and objective assessment of the circumstances surrounding the attack.  We made clear our strong view that all parties in conflicts should fully respect the mandate of UN operations and the inviolability of UN installations, to ensure that attacks such as that at Qana can never happen again.</P>
      <P>The safety of civilians and of the UNIFIL contigent in Lebanon remains a priority of the Government.  We made our grave concerns on this issue clear to the Israeli authorities during the recent conflict, both before and after the attack on Qana, and we will continue to stress the importance we attach to it in our contacts with all parties in the region.</P>
      <P>The best means available for securing peace in Lebanon is support for the ceasefire agreement of 26 April 1996 and a commitment to negotiations between Israel and Lebanon in the Middle East peace process.  The EU's policy in this regard was reaffirmed in the declaration issued by the Florence European Council on 22 June 1996.</P>

      <P>The Minister replied to a certain extent with tongue in cheek.  I would welcome the appointment of ambassadors in a wide range of countries, but I accept that resources are scarce.  Membership of the Council of Europe has increased enormously in recent years.  With the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain, a whole series of central and eastern European countries have joined or are in the process of applying for membership of the Council of Europe.  They attach great importance to that body and invariably they have assigned residential ambassadors to Strasbourg.  It is fitting, therefore, that we should do likewise.

Despite the fact that we have expanded our diplomatic services by opening four new missions this year, there are difficulties in terms of limited resources.  As the Deputy made a reasonable request to consider the matter, I will certainly do that.  A diplomatic officer will be assigned from the Council of Europe section in the Department of Foreign Affairs to be a representative in Strasbourg for the duration of the Presidency, and that is a step in the right direction.

Is the Minister aware that human rights issues in Northern Ireland with regard to Republican prisoners in British jails have assumed great importance in terms of the peace process? Does he realise that European countries can be of considerable assistance to us in ensuring that Irish citizens, south or north of the Border, get fair treatment, and that the Council of Europe is the precise forum where that can be done.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;weapons of mass destruction&rdquo; commonly refers to nuclear weapons, biological and toxin weapons and chemical weapons.  The 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, BTWC, and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, CWC, already provide for the total elimination of these categories of weapons of mass destruction. I informed the House in detail on 30 May of the action which Ireland as Presidency will be taking to strengthen the implementation of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Ireland's ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention on 24 June means that we are now in a position to press the three remaining EU partners to ratify and, importantly, to take diplomatic action on behalf of the Union to promote the earliest possible entry into force of this important international disarmament agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to nuclear weapons, Ireland will use every opportunity to seek to ensure that the nuclear weapons states pursue systematic and progressive efforts to reduce these weapons globally with the ultimate aim of eliminating <Col N="599" /> them, in accordance with the 1995 Principles and Objectives for Nuclear NonProliferation and Disarmament.  Successive Irish Governments have held that a halt to nuclear testing and rapid conclusion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, would provide the single clearest proof which the nuclear weapon states could offer of their commitment to nuclear disarmament and their determination to control the qualitative development of the arms race.  In line with this long-established position, the Government attaches very high priority to the timely conclusion of the CTBT negotiations which are now at a decisive stage.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting of the General Affairs Council, the European Union stated on 22 April 1996 that it attaches the highest priority and is strongly committed to the conclusion of the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty before the end of the spring session of the Conference on Disarmament so as to permit signature by autumn, at the outset of the 51st UN General Assembly.  The House will be aware that the session in question ended in Geneva on 28 June without adopting a treaty. While the failure to reach agreement by 28 June is a matter of concern to the Government, the Conference on Disarmament will reconvene on 29 July to decide what action to take on the draft text before the end of its 1996 session in mid-September.  It is important that the month of July be used for high level consultations with those delegations which have the greatest difficulties with the draft treaty, with a view to working out the necessary compromises on key issues.  In this context, Ireland has made clear our readiness as Presidency to undertake any approaches to third countries which partners believe would be conducive to early conclusion of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the statement of 22 April, the European Union is committed to achieving a comprehensive test ban treaty which prohibits any nuclear weapons test explosion or any <Col N="600" /> other nuclear explosion, viz. the socalled &ldquo;zero yield&rdquo; option, and which is universal and internationally and effectively verifiable.  The Union considers that such a treaty would be a concrete step in the full realisation and effective implementation of Article VI of the NPT which concerns nuclear disarmament. It would contribute to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to the process of nuclear disarmament and, therefore, to the enhancement of international peace and security.  In broad outline, the draft treaty which is on the table would go a long way towards meeting these criteria.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in its capacity as an observer, has followed the negotiations closely and has intervened to present our national position.  There are continuing deep differences between the negotiators of the treaty on such central issues as the preamble, the verification system and the conditions to be met for the treaty to enter into force.  It is important, in my view, that the conditions of entry into force be based on an agreed political balance between the need to secure the treaty's rapid entry into force and the need to ensure that the treaty is ratified by those states for which its terms are of particular relevance. That political balance must take account of India's announcement that it will not subscribe to the draft treaty in its present form.  Those delegations which insist that the treaty cannot enter into force without India's ratification must now reflect deeply on the implications of their position.</P>
    <P>The international community, with strong support from the EU and the Irish Government, has identified the achievement of a comprehensive test ban treaty in 1996 as a key objective in the area of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Now that a treaty appears at last to be attainable, it is important that no effort be spared to this end.  Those who insist on linking this treaty to wider nuclear disarmament <Col N="601" /> objectives, however important in themselves, must expect to be held accountable for an eventual failure to achieve what is achievable at this time.</P>

      <P>The Wassenaar Arrangement is a co-operative arrangement established to contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfer of conventional arms and dual use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilising accumulations.  Representatives of 28 states, the EU Fifteen, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States, agreed in the Netherlands on 19 December 1995 to establish the Wassenaar Arrangement on the basis of a set of purposes and procedures, termed &ldquo;Initial Elements&rdquo;, which would be submitted to governments for approval.  They agreed to locate the secretariat of the Wassenaar Arrangement in Vienna and established a preparatory committee whose report was available to the first plenary meeting of the new Arrangement on 3-4 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> At the April meeting, Argentina, Romania and the Republic of Korea were admitted as founder members of the Wassenaar Arrangement.  While there are still a number of candidates for admission, the participants in the arrangement already include all the major exporters of conventional arms and relevant dual use goods and technologies, with the exception of China.  This means that the arrangement has the potential to play an important role in shaping international restraint in exports of arms and conventional weapons-related dual use goods in the future, through the mechanisms of information exchange and peer review. Ireland is, therefore, keen to see the arrangement in place and operational at the earliest possible date.  In this connection, exploiting the potential of information exchange among participating countries on their arms exports in the seven categories of the UN Register of Conventional Arms should have priority; in the first instance, over extending the scope of the arrangement to include, for example, transfers of light weapons.</P>
    <P>As full consensus on the Initial Elements of the Arrangement was not reached at the Vienna plenary meeting in April, the meeting is scheduled to resume on 10-12 July.  Provided full agreement is reached at the start of next week's meeting on outstanding points in the Initial Elements, including the question of whether notifications in certain circumstances will apply to licences or to transfers, the position on the questions of structure and organisation raised by the Deputy should also be clarified.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Unfortunately, I do not have a copy of the table to which he referred, which leaves me a little in the dark; I hope the Minister does not want to keep <Col N="604" /> me in the dark.  From replies to previous questions tabled on this issue, I note there was a number of flights from Kerry to Dublin.  Why are such flights necessary?  I understood air transport was to be used to ensure the Minister attended various meetings and engaged in whatever processes were necessary to carry out his functions.  I am amazed at the number of flights from Kerry to Dublin when, on occasions, only one passenger was carried.  Will the Minister clarify the position?  Will the Minister outline the cost to his Department of all transport arrangements for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty giving the Deputy all the information he requires.  The Deputy seems to have an inquisitive nature in relation to my mode of transport.  I live in Tralee in County Kerry.  I am elected to represent the people of North Kerry and I am the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Deputy will be aware there is a regional airport in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>I will use commercial air transport at 6.25 a.m. or 10 p.m. because that gives me a longer day in the office.  The Deputy is aware the hours required are demanding.  If he speaks to any of his colleagues who have served in the Department of Foreign Affairs, he will be told the Department works around the clock.  I want to participate in that work.  I use internal air travel quite often, as is customary for Ministers if they are resident in Cork or Limerick, for example, and are attending meetings in Brussels on Sunday evenings or Monday mornings.  It would be normal for Ministers to be collected from Cork airport so that they have the opportunity to spend Sunday with their families.  I am sure the Deputy is also aware that Ministers who live in the Cork region use air transport to Dublin so that they can be in their offices early in the morning to attend to their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the demands on any Minister, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs. <Col N="605" /> However, the Minister has avoided answering the question about his transport arrangements.  Some people are concerned that although a Garda driven car is available to the Tánaiste to transport him to and from Kerry, he chooses to use an Aer Corps craft, the Government jet or commercial flights at the taxpayers' expense.  I presume the Tánaiste appreciates the concerns of the public in this regard.  If he uses a car in Dublin which brings him to Baldonnel, what car meets him at Farranfore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements whereby I have a car and a security driver have been in place in all Departments for a long time.  That is a matter for the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice.  The Deputy may appreciate the reasons for that if he consults some of his colleagues who held ministerial office.  If I take a commercial flight to Kerry at 10 o'clock on a Friday night, as happens regularly when I am working in my office, my driver will probably be waiting for me at Farranfore. Unlike the Deputy, I am unable to get home in ten minutes by car.  Every year I have been in office I have succeeded in reducing the transport costs in my Department from what they were when previous Ministers held office.</P>

I had hoped the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, would be here because I wanted to congratulate her on introducing more legislation in this House to deal with the crime barons than any Government has done for the past 50 years.  As a new Deputy in this House, I have not seen such attacks as those made on the Minister for Justice.  Fianna Fáil was in Government for the past seven years but it did not build one prison. Its members tell us what a great party it has been for 70 years.  It was in Government for 50 of those 70 years and now we are paying the price.</P>

      <P>When Fine Gael was in Government in 1986 crime fell by 5.2 per cent and in 1987 it fell by a further 1.4 per cent, but as soon as Fianna Fáil came into Government crime escalated.  One would think from the way that party acted for the past two weeks that there was never a crime problem in this State.  Deputy O'Donoghue and his Fianna Fáil colleagues let crime get out of control and did not take on the drugs barons when they had the opportunity. They should stop making attacks on the best Minister we have had in this State. They should support her and help the Government.

The Deputies opposite should study the legislation introduced since this Government came to power.  They and the Progressive Democrats have some neck to criticise the Minister.  If they analyse her performance to date and the package she has put together to counteract the criminal influence in our society, they will realise that she deserves praise rather than criticism.</P>

      <P>Our concern regarding justice matters and drugs, in particular, is that we deal with crime and its causes. Anyone who says that the solution lies only in law is misleading the people. There is a necessity for strong and improved law, but there is an equal necessity to stop young people creating a demand for the supply of drugs.  We must educate our young people in this area.  The crash education programme announced today by my colleague, the Minister for Education, to address the problem of the high demand for drugs by young people in disadvantaged areas is as important as the package of initiatives announced by the Government to provide additional gardaí and prison spaces.  I remind Deputies on the Opposition benches that unprecedented numbers of extra prison spaces will be provided in the next three years.  If we are to have a fair debate, due recognition must be given to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party has focused on the need to set up a special squad to deal with drug-related crime, along the lines of other successful special squads in the Garda.  Four hundred extra prison places could be provided tomorrow but, <Col N="744" /> without the capacity to get convictions &mdash; we witnessed the collapse of one court case last week &mdash; those additional places will mean nothing.  We need a special, dedicated group.  There have been other parallels within the Garda Síochána, such as the Special Response Unit which, for the most part, successfully contained the threat to the security of this State by the IRA.  It will clearly be seen there are precedents here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is need also to review the operactions, management, priorities and policies of the Garda.  Our taxpayers will be asked and, I predict, will willingly contribute large amounts of taxation to fund these proposed initiatives.  The money must be spent wisely and effectively. We must examine the management, priorities and policies of the Garda to ensure its best usage and maximum response to the current crisis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the international conventions to which we are acceding today, including that in relation to money laundering, in the course of this debate, Members tended to concentrate on the Irish dimension in the wake of the awful murders of Detective Garda McCabe and Veronica Guerin.  This problem must be tackled not just internally but at European and international level.</P>
    <P>To press home this point, I might give an example.  Poor Third World countries, either totally repressed or near collapse, such as Burma, Afghanistan or Nigeria are at the heart of the serious worldwide drugs trade.  Without concerted international action to restrict the worldwide supply of drugs our efforts may meet with some degree of success but, in the long-term, will not adequately tackle or resolve this huge problem.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that, this country, is being targeted nor merely by Irish drugs barons &mdash; small fry in terms of the international drugs trade &mdash; but by international drugs barons and that our coastline is being used for transit purposes and for the creation of a market for drugs here.  This means we must <Col N="745" /> co-operate with other European countries and United Nations institutions in an effective international response to this evil trade.</P>
    <P>We must also address the drugs problem in South America, in countries like Columbia and Peru and the question of providing alternative sources of income for farmers in certain regions who cultivate cocoa for cocaine, a major revenue producer for them.  The regimes in Burma and Nigeria, to say the very least, have not honoured their responsibilities. One need only look to Burma, and the golden triangle from where so much heroin originates, or Afganistan, another major source of heroin for this country.  I am glad all parties in this House support these conventions to allow us participate effectively in the international fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>I will refer to another matter of enormous importance particularly to those Members representing the South and South West.  We have a unique, long coastline with many inlets and bays which makes the country an attractive transit point.  The European Union can and must assist us, within the context of a European-wide approach to tackling this problem.  While we can tackle the problem internally, we need the support of our European Union counterparts. The recent development of the transatlantic alliance between the United States and the European Union, allied to specific co-operation in tackling the drugs problem will be effective in tackling this scourge confronting us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, for her attendance this afternoon.  My case is all the more urgent in the wake of the recent horrific murders of Detective Garda McCabe and Veronica Guerin. This crisis has been addressed by many Members of the House in respect of which the Government has announced <Col N="746" /> an agreed package of measures to be introduced promptly.</P>
      <P>In the past 18 months I have raised the matter of our growing drugs problem, more specifically the importation of illicit substances through our south western ports.  I cited instances based on my knowledge of local people, in addition to the very substantial importation of drugs through Castletownbere Harbour, which were seized at Urlingford, and highlighted in the media.</P>
      <P>I and many others know that major drugs barons have taken up residence in the south west.  As is the case in Dublin, they are well known to locals.  Despite having been a Member of this House for some decades, in my innocence, I assumed the Government was serious in tackling this problem.  As we are aware, our south west coast is one of the busiest shipping traffic lanes in Europe, Castletownbere being the busiest port in the south west, a designated major fisheries port which in addition accommodates pleasure craft.  There was one customs officer there but the Rainbow Coalition closed that office last year following which a major shipment of drugs came through that port.</P>
      <P>We are an island nation, and drugs are imported by sea, yet it appears we give these drug barons all the assistance they need by not having any Customs presence in Castletownbere.</P>
      <P>As a gesture, the authorities said, and the Minister for Finance told me, during the peak fishing season they would allow that office be open but at other times it would be serviced from Bantry. Anybody who knows the geography of the south west will know that it takes one hour to drive from Bantry to Castletownbere, which means that to service that port from Bantry is ludicrous.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday last I was informed that the assignment of a full-time officer of Customs and Excise is authorised in the peak period.  That is an absolute disgrace, an insult to those who expect to be protected by our authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Government, the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Justice to ensure that people can walk <Col N="747" /> the streets, drive around Castletownbere or any other town or city without the menace created by drugs.  There is only one route by which drugs can be imported here, through our ports.  The closure of a Customs post manned by one officer would appear to indicate the Government is not serious about tackling the problem but is merely paying lip service to it.  If the Government was even half serious about it, it would agree that we need a full-time static presence in places like Castletownbere.  We are serious about this matter, and to that end we want to ensure full protection and surveillance.  For the Government to say it will take this in hand in due course is not good enough.  Today, I hope for the last time, I call on the Government to assign officers of the Customs and Excise service to Castletownbere on a full-time basis to prevent the smuggling of illicit and illegal drug substances through the south-west coast, particularly through Castletownbere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here on behalf of the Minister for Finance who cannot be present.  This issue has been raised by the Deputy on many occasions and responded to comprehensively. Parliamentary questions were answered on the subject in September 1995, May 1996 and as recently as 2 July 1996.  The position remains as outlined previously.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the management of the Customs Service and the deployment of Customs staff, are satisfied that the most effective means of providing a customs service in the Bantry BayBeara Peninsula area is to have staff centralised in and operating from Bantry, and deployed on a flexible basis to various locations, including Castletownbere, as required, to meet the needs of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been informed by the commissioners they cannot accept that a sufficient volume of work exists <Col N="748" /> to warrant the full-time attendance of an officer of Customs and Excise in Castletownbere.  In recognition of the large concentration of fishing vessels at the port at certain times of the year, however, the full-time assignment of an officer is authorised during the peak period and, in fact, an officer was in full-time attendance there over three months this year.  As to the off-peak season, a customs service is, as indicated, provided by means of the deployment of staff from Bantry.</P>
    <P>As to the question of illegal imports, including drug smuggling, the commissioners are fully alert to the dangers of such trafficking along the coastline, including through ports in the south-west. Experience has shown that intelligence gathering and surveillance, rather than a static presence, are the best means of combating this activity.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have made a substantial commitment in terms of staff and other resources to the Customs National Drugs Team.  Sixteen members of the team are based in Cork to staff operational, intelligence, maritime and sniffer-dog units.  Intelligence units, each comprising two full-time members of the team, are also based in Bantry and Tralee and are supervised by two higher executive officers, who become involved in drug-related work as necessary. All units are mobile and employ the most modern means of communication and have access to aerial and sea surveillance.  Specialist CNDT officers in the Cork and Kerry region can call on assistance, where the need arises, of other Customs and Excise staff.</P>
    <P>The Customs Service has also enlisted the assistance of the business community engaged in the import-export trade in fighting smuggling and in particular drug smuggling through the Memorandum of Understanding Programme as well as the general public through the Drugs Watch Programme, which encourages coastal communities and maritime personnel to report unusual occurrences in their areas to Customs and Excise by Freefone or Freepost.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Minister is <Col N="749" /> satisfied that the present measures taken by Customs and Excise, in co-operation with the other enforcement agencies concerned, provide adequate protection against the illegal importation of drugs and other sensitive goods along the south-west coast, and that the provision of a static Customs presence in Castletownbere would not enhance these measures.  The deployment of resources is, of course, kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received many requests from constituents of mine who are awaiting admission to Croom Orthopaedic Hospital for hip replacement operations and other procedures. It is a matter of grave concern to me that there is now such a long waiting list that it will be years before some of those patients are treated.  That is intolerable and we cannot allow it to happen.  There are almost 1,000 patients on the waiting list, over 200 for hip replacement operations and 750 for other procedures. Orthopaedic surgery is one of the areas in medical science that has experienced phenomenal success in the past 20 years. Enormous social and lifestyle benefits are afforded by it.  What can now be achieved in this field is almost a miracle. Long may it last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that as people live longer and are more motivated to be up and about, the likelihood of fractures and the need for specialist orthopaedic surgery increases, displacing patients awaiting hip replacements and other operations. It also seems that the general hospitals have ceased to handle any trauma of an orthopaedic nature.  As a result, Croom Orthopaedic Hospital is swamped with the volume of trauma cases.  The Minister will appreciate that the situation which pertains at present cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.  He must immediately ensure that the Mid-Western Health Board increases the operative time for surgeons in that <Col N="750" /> hospital, provide additional anaesthetists and increase the theatre space and do anything else that is necessary to bring about an improvement so that hip replacement operations can be more expediously carried out.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the advances in the midwest and the investment which the Minister for Health made in the regional hospital and other places which, in time, will help in dealing with these matters.  Many of these changes will have long-term benefits for the communities in the midwest.  I want to use this opportunity to earnestly request him to do whatever is in his power to relieve the pain endured at present by patients waiting a long time for hip replacement operations and other procedures. A waiting list of 1,000 must be as unacceptable to him as it is to me. Therefore, I ask him to do whatever possible in the interim to give some relief in this area.  That is my plea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade (Mr. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to respond to this issue. One of the difficulties faced in dealing with hospital orthopaedic services generally, is the ever-increasing demand for this service.  This is evidenced by the numbers seeking orthopaedic services and the great strides which have been made in recent times in orthopaedic joint replacement surgery.  Indeed, the success of joint replacement surgery, such a hip and knee replacements has led to an upward surge in demand for these services all over the country.</P>
      <P>The increase in the demand for orthopaedic services has in turn led to demands for an expansion of facilities to cater for this new workload.  For instance, in the Mid-Western Health Board area trauma attendance at injury clinics has increased by 53 per cent in the period from 1989 to 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Nessan's Hospital, Croom is the regional centre for orthopaedic services for the Mid-Western Health Board.  The <Col N="751" /> Deputy has referred to immediate steps to improve the situation in relation to orthopaedic services at Croom Hospital. I would like to set out the following. Since coming to power this Government provided £300,000 to Croom Orthopaedic Hospital for ward refurbishment. In addition £90,000 was provided in 1995 to Croom Orthopaedic Hospital for the acquisition of orthopaedic medical equipment.</P>
    <P>Phase I of the redevelopment of Limerick Regional Hospital, which was sanctioned by this Government, includes the provision of a dedicated orthopaedic theatre.  As the Deputy will be aware this building work is ongoing. Planning of phase II of Limerick Regional Hospital is currently in progress and will incorporate a 30 bed orthopaedic ward.  I acknowledge the Deputy's generous recognition of this investment.  It is appreciated.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that much work is under way to improve orthopaedic services for the people of the Mid-Western Health Board Region.  The waiting list initiatives of recent years have also contributed greatly to improve access to orthopaedic services for people in this region.  Between the years 1993 and 1996, inclusive, a total of £2.844 million has been allocated to the Mid-Western Health Board area under the waiting list initiatives.  Orthopaedic surgery has been one of the specialities which has been specifically targeted and a total of 700 additional procedures have been funded in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
    <P>Despite ongoing developments there is room to improve and to make orthopaedic services more accessible and available to the patients who need them. However, I am sure the Deputy will agree that much has been achieved in the development of orthopaedic services in the Mid-Western Health Board area since this Government assumed power.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I share the concern he expressed for the people on <Col N="752" /> the waiting list and I will convey his concern to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the important issue of primary school teacher reductions on the Adjournment.  About 300 teachers in primary schools will have to move out of their schools because of demographic trends.  This has come about this year in particular because the Minister has failed to improve the pupil-teacher ratio.  A very small improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio this year would have made a tremendous difference to many of those teachers who would not have to move from one school to another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the good work she has done in recent years.  The pupil-teacher ratio has improved fairly dramatically over the past four or five years, but it is a mistake not to continue that improvement, particularly this year.  Despite all the efforts of the Minister and the Government we still have the highest pupil-teacher ratio in Europe and I regret this.</P>
      <P>I am led to believe that this year the Minister did not enter into discussions with the unions on this issue.  I am told there was no discussion about the announcement or the plans to be put in place.  That is poor management on her behalf and I would regret it if she was to ignore the unions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 309 schools which have disadvantaged status.  Some 25 of those are to be plucked out and given special status.  They are in urban areas and will have extra staff resources available to them.  Some 25 rural clusters are also to get special help.  I am told that their pupil-teacher ratio will not improve but they may have the use of a visiting teacher.  I question whether that <Col N="753" /> will make any real difference to those clusters of schools.</P>
    <P>I also question the method of declaring a school disadvantaged.  We have encountered cases where in the same town a boy's school, for example, may be declared disadvantaged while the girl's school is not.  It does not make sense and this question must be resolved carefully.  The major criterion which should be used in assessing disadvantage is educational disadvantage rather than social disadvantage.  Educational disadvantage is a much fairer way of assessment and one can find educational disadvantage where one does not have social disadvantage.  This area should be examined.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw to the Minister's attention the situation in Fore National School in County Westmeath.  Up to now that has been a three teacher school, but on 30 September last they were two pupils short of the quota needed to retain their third teacher. However, within two weeks of 30 September they had those two pupils and are now facing this year with 60 pupils and two teachers.  They had subdivided a classroom to accommodate the other teacher but that subdivision will have to be taken down.</P>
    <P>The sad feature is that next year they will have the numbers for three teachers and will have to put up this partition again and reinvent the wheel in terms of creating three classrooms.  They have not been able to use the remedial teacher assigned to them because they do not have the extra space.  It is disappointing that Fore National School will lose their teacher this year.  I hope, even at this late stage, that the Minister might do something about it.  In the larger urban schools a very small improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio achieved something.</P>
    <P>Balloting has taken place in about 100 schools around the country and strike action has already taken place in two of those schools.  I hope the Minister, even at this late stage, will intervene and prevent an industrial dispute on this matter.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I thank Deputy McGrath for allowing me time to support his call.  When a school loses a teacher due to the shortage of one, two or three pupils it is automatically at a disadvantage because two teachers will be doing the work of three or three will be doing the work of four. While we have plans for disadvantaged schools, the retention of teachers where they are short one or two pupils might prevent further disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister or Education and I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to the House on this issue.  I should emphasise that there will be no overall reduction in teaching posts in the next school year. Some schools are due to lose posts because their enrolments have declined. Other schools' enrolments are increasing and they will gain additional posts.</P>
      <P>The number of teaching posts allocated to a primary school is determined in accordance with the staffing schedule. This schedule is drawn up every year in consultation with the education partners. The number of teachers to be allocated to each school is determined by reference to the enrolment figure of 30 September of the previous year.  The Deputy has already made that point.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of teaching posts which would have become surplus due to declining enrolments over the past number of years have instead been retained in the system.  This has resulted in a steady improvement in the staffing schedule whereby numerous schools were able to retain teaching posts which they would otherwise have lost.  As a consequence of these improvements the pupil-teacher ratio has now been reduced from 25.2:1 in 1993 to 22.9:1 in the school year just ended.  A further reduction to 22.6:1 is anticipated from September next.  In addition the maximum class size guidelines have been improved by four units over the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not all of the surplus teaching posts <Col N="755" /> have been used to improve the staffing schedule in recent years.  Dramatic improvements have also been implemented in special education and disadvantaged areas.  In the past three years a total of 570 new posts have been targeted for pupils with the greatest needs.  While these improvements had a significant impact on educational provision for these children the Minister is committed to taking further steps to ensure that all children can benefit fully from education.  Therefore, this year the Minister has decided to use surplus posts, not to reduce staffing schedules as in the past two years but to implement the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre's report to break the cycle of education disadvantage.  This will involve the allocation of additional teaching resources to the most disadvantaged schools in the primary school system.</P>
    <P>Both urban and rural areas will be targeted.  The programme supports will be made available to 25 large schools in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  In addition to being provided with a range of generous grants and other supports these schools will have a maximum of 15 pupils in all junior classes.  Furthermore a special initiative will focus on rural schools with less than five teachers.  Supports will be made available to 25 clusters of small schools, each cluster having a combined enrolment of some 300 to 350 pupils.  Each of these clusters will be served by a newly appointed co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>In addition a further 20 teaching posts will be used to extend the substitute supply panel scheme from September next.  This scheme which was initiated in 1993, provides cover for teachers on absences of short duration and has been widely acknowledged as being very successful. The staffing schedule for the 1996 and 1997 school year therefore shows no change from the 1995 to 1996 schedule.  It is accepted that this has caused disappointment, especially in the case of schools which are losing posts <Col N="756" /> which might have been saved by small improvements in the staffing schedule. Nevertheless, the continuing difficulties in areas of particular disadvantage as highlighted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre report demand a positive and generous response.  The Minister has responded to this demand by targetting all available resources on these areas this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges that there are particular difficulties associated with one teacher schools.  Consequently, she has decided that any two teacher school which was due to lose a post at the end of the current school year and thus become a one teacher school will continue as a two teacher unit for the 1996-97 school year.  This is a further indication of the Minister's determination to ensure that, in the allocation of limited resources, priority is given to those children who are in greatest need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this important matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, would agree with me that the Glanmire area of Cork is one of the fastest growing satellite areas of Cork city.  In the coming two years approximately 1,800 new houses will be built. There is also ongoing commercial development such as banks and so on to provide the necessary facilities in the area.  The local GAA club, Sarsfield's, are spending large sums of money in developing their facilities for the youth of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, no second level schools in this area.  For the past ten years an excellent local committee has been campaigning with the full support of the local community for second level educational facilities.  The first concession from the Department of Education came in the early nineties when they provided financial assistance to the local community to bus the children to <Col N="757" /> schools in other areas.  More than 600 students are bussed out of Glanmire every day to 12 schools, including schools in Carrignavar, Midleton and St. Aidan's College in Dublin Hill.  That shows the magnitude of the problem.</P>
    <P>There was great rejoicing when it was agreed finally that a school would be built.  Everybody welcomed that decision.  There was unanimous political support for the campaign and everybody worked together to ensure that the case articulated by the local community was made.  We had been told that building would proceed on the school from the middle of last month, but unfortunately that has not happened.  There were hiccups along the way earlier but this was the final straw.</P>
    <P>The local committee had sent out circulars advising the local people that the school was proceeding.  However, this has not happened and there is widespread local concern that the school will not be ready to allow pupils enrol for September 1997.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, my colleague from Cork, is taking this Adjournment Debate.  I rarely raise an issue on the Adjournment but it is very important to convey the concerns of the people of Glanmire.  I understand there are problems, but I have been told they are minute.  Will the Minister of State enlighten us as to when these problems will be resolved and, more importantly, when work will begin on this urgently needed school?  Everybody is agreed on the need for the school to relieve pressure.</P>

      <P>I must apologise to Deputy Dan Wallace on behalf of the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen, who are both unavoidably absent.  Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of responding to this Adjournment debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994 approval was given by the <Col N="758" /> Department for the provision of a community college in the Glanmire-Riverstown area of Cork to cater for 750 pupils and the County Cork vocational education committee was authorised to employ a design team to plan the school.</P>
    <P>Architectural planning for the project has been completed and tenders have been invited for the construction work. As the project has been included in the 1996 capital programme, finance is available to allow the work to start this year.</P>
    <P>The project in Glanmire is one of the largest post primary building projects being dealt with by the Department at present.  In addition to 13 general classrooms, the accommodation to be provided will consist of lecture rooms, science laboratories, computer technology areas, woodwork-construction studies areas, a language laboratory and numerous other specialist areas, as well as staff accommodation and administrative offices.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Bernard Allen, are fully aware of the long and intensive campaign that has been undertaken by the people of Riverstown and Glanmire to have a post primary school provided in the immediate locality.  I might add that the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, has actively supported this campaign over the years.  As a Deputy for Cork North-Central, I am well aware of the protracted campaign and the difficulties posed for people of the area.  For many years children had to leave their community, travelling to all parts of the city and county to as many as seven different schools.  The new school, which will have the most up-to-date educational facilities possible, will be a tremendous asset not just for students and teachers but also for the whole community.  This endorses Deputy Wallace's point of the Sarsfield hurling club and the role it is playing in the community.</P>
    <P>At present the Department's technical staff are examining the final tender report.  When this examination has been <Col N="759" /> completed, the Department will be in contact with the County Cork vocational education committee regarding the placing of the contract.  I understand that this technical examination will be completed in a matter of days.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the understandable anxieties of the people of Riverstown-Glanmire at what may seem to be a lengthy process before construction starts.  However, the House will appreciate that with a major project such as this costing well over £3 million, the Department must ensure that the necessary formalities are properly completed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> Both the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, and the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, are conscious of the urgent need for post primary accommodation in the Glanmire-Riverstown area.  I assure the House that the remaining technical details will be sorted out very quickly so that construction work can begin as soon as possible.  It is the intention of the Department to have the accommodation completed and ready for occupation by September 1997.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 5 July 1996.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy dealt in some detail with human rights issues which come under the responsibility of my Department, including the European Convention on Human Rights.  It recognised that the greatest achievement of the Council of Europe has been its success in human rights standard setting.  The role of the Council of Europe in seeking solutions to social problems and standard setting in areas other than human rights is also mentioned.  The European Social Charter, which is a very important standard-setting instrument comes within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to enhancing the effectiveness of the work of the Council of Europe.  In this context, it will consider in the near future the question of signature of the 1991 Protocol amending the European Social Charter.  This Protocol is intended to improve the efficiency of the Council's machinery for supervising compliance by state parties with their obligations under the Social Charter.  In addition, a detailed study is being carried out on the implications of signing the revised European Social Charter which incorporates the rights guaranteed in the 1988 additional Protocol mentioned by the Deputy.  The question of signing the 1995 Protocol providing for a system of collective complaints will also be examined as part of this study.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the events which took place on 10 and 11 June 1996 in Baucau, the second city of East Timor.  Riots which involved some hundred of young people broke out after protesters clashed with local police and military units.  The police and military units are reported to have used rubber bullets.  The protests were prompted by the profanation of a statute of the Virgin Mary.  I understand that there have been continuing arrests following these riots in Baucau and that upwards of one hundred persons have been wounded.  Upon hearing of these incidents, Ireland took the initiative of consulting EU partners in the matter.</P>
      <P>On 26 June 1996 the European Union adopted a common position on East Timor which aims to contribute to the achievement by dialogue of a fair, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor, which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people, in accordance with international law; and to improve the situation in East Timor regarding respect for human rights in the territory.</P>
      <P>In pursuit of these aims, the European Union supports the initiatives undertaken in the United Nations framework which may contribute to a solution of the question of East Timor, in particular the current talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General, and encourages the continuation of intra-Timor meetings in the context of this process of dialogue.</P>
      <P>As EU Presidency, Ireland will actively pursue the Union's policy on East Timor in accordance with the Common Position.  Efforts to promote progress towards a settlement, however, continue to be hampered by serious obstacles.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> On a national level, the Minister of State for development co-operation at my Department, Deputy Joan Burton, has indicated the Government's willingness to make a financial contribution available for further intra-Timor meetings two of which have already taken taken place in Burg Schlaining in Austria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government continue to be extremely concerned about the need to expedite a return to full democratic rule and full observance of human rights in Nigeria.  As I stated in my previous reply of 30 May, there are some signs that Nigeria may be beginning to respond to the pressure being exercised by the EU and other members of the international community in furtherance of these objectives. At that time, I reported that the Nigerian authorities had, in a letter to the UN Secretary General, undertaken to carry out a number of reforms.  These include the exclusion of military personnel from special courts; the establishment of an appeals mechanism; a review of the cases of all those held without trial under government decree of 1984 and the restoration of <i>habeas corpus.</i>  I also confirmed that the Government will continue to monitor these and other <Col N="609" /> developments closely to evaluate the real progress being made.</P>
      <P>An important recent development was a meeting which took place in London between the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group and the Nigerian Government in London on 24-25 June. On that occasion, the Commonwealth again raised the situation relating to human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria. In reply, the Nigerian authorities reiterated their determination to implement democratic transition.  They informed the meeting of developments relating to human rights and rule of law which have taken place since the visit of the UN Fact-Finding Mission to their country in March-April 1996.  The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group therefore agreed at the meeting to hold in reserve the restrictive measures it had prepared for implementation against Nigeria last April.  It will convene again in September to review the actual progress being made towards meeting its concerns in Nigeria.</P>
      <P>In order to help ensure the implementation of the promised reforms and other measures, Ireland has strongly supported the renewal of the EU Common Position on Nigeria in June.  This has maintained existing EU measures against Nigeria for a further six months during which progress on the ground will continue to be kept under close review.</P>
      <P>The Government have been unequivocal in support for further measures aimed at promoting meaningful reform in Nigeria.  We also recognised that to be effective such measures, and those which have been suggested by the inter-action group to which the Deputy has referred, will need widespread international support.  We therefore support ongoing EU consultation with like-minded states and organisations such as the United States and the Commonwealth, on the adoption of these and other appropriate measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, both bilaterally and with partners under the terms of the EU Common Positions of 20 November and 4 December 1995, will continue to do <Col N="610" /> everything possible to help ensure that the undertakings given by Nigeria to take specific steps towards an early transition to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law, are fulfilled.  The championing of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights are priority objectives of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy which the Irish Presidency will strongly seek to advance regarding Nigeria and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the contents of the Annual Amnesty International report referred to by the Deputy.  Amnesty International makes the important point that before allowing the transfer of military, security or police equipment, technology or training from one country to another, Governments should take the receiving country's human rights record into account. The Government wholeheartedly shares this concern.  The Government's views on the matter of arms exports are well understood by the international community including our partners in the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Luxembourg and Lisbon common criteria on arms exports represent both the first significant result of EU intergovernmental co-operation in the field of arms exports and the essential foundation for progress on arms exports policy at EU level in the future.  The common criteria relate to factors such as the respect for international commitments, the existence of tensions or conflict, the attitude of the buyer country to terrorism and the risk that arms and equipment would be diverted or reexported under undesirable conditions. The respect of human rights in the country of final destination is the second of these eight criteria.</P>
      <P>Under the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Union, member states inform and consult each other increasingly on matters of arms export control policy.  The discussion of the common criteria is ongoing with a view to developing a common approach leading to a harmonisation of national policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency, this discussion will be pursued in the light of Ireland's overriding objective in the field of arms exports, namely the promotion of restraint and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and of technologies for military use.  The Government continues to believe that <Col N="613" /> further progress is necessary to promote restraint and to develop more effective controls on the export of arms from EU countries.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Intergovernmental Conference or Intergovernmental Conference which is considering possible amendments to the European Union treaties opened in Turin on 29 March and is expected to run well into 1997. Chairing the Intergovernmental Conference will, of course, be a major priority of our Presidency.  Our aim will be to advance the negotiations as effectively and expeditiously as possible in the interests of all member states and of the European Union as a whole bearing in mind the particular mandate which we have received from the Florence European Council to prepare for the European Council in Dublin in December a general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministers have overall responsibility for the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, and the Intergovernmental Conference meets at Foreign Minister level in principle once a month.  The work of Foreign Ministers is prepared by a working party of their representatives which meets more frequently. A copy of the draft calendar of meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference during our Presidency has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of constituting a European Council as a meeting of the <Col N="614" /> Intergovernmental Conference does not arise.  However, European Councils normally play an important role in Intergovernmental Conference negotiations. The Intergovernmental Conference is expected to be one of the major agenda items at the Dublin European Council in December.  As I have indicated, the aim is to have for that meeting a general outline for a draft revision of the treaties.</P>
    <P>As regards the special meeting of the European Council in October, the intention of Florence was that such a meeting would be particularly useful to keep up the momentum of the Union's business in view of the wide range of issues facing the Union over the coming period.  The broad intention of the Heads of State or Government is that this special European Council would be a relatively informal meeting offering an opportunity for a strategic think-in on the major issues facing Europe in the run up to the year 2000.  The meeting will therefore offer an opportunity to address the range of issues facing the Union and among other things to take note of the progress at the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is not envisaged that there will be a formal agenda or formal conclusion.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the anticipated agenda of the European Council meeting in December, it is not possible to define this in detail at this stage.</P>
    <P>However, the expectation is that the agenda will to a large extent reflect the priorities of the Irish Presidency.  Apart from the Intergovernmental Conference this includes areas such as employment, co-operation in the justice and home affairs area including tackling the problems of drugs and associated criminality, European Monetary Union, pursuing completion of the internal market and addressing a range of issues in the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</P>

      <P>During the course of the conflict in former Yugoslavia, Ireland has provided a number of personnel to UN peacekeeping operations, including members of the Permanent Defence Forces who served as military observers.  Irish personnel served at one time or another with the UN peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia and the former Yugolslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
      <P>At present, three officers are deployed as military observers with the UN Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, with which 15 gardaí are also deployed, and one Defence Force officer is serving with the UN Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP), both in Croatia.  Two officers are currently deployed with the UN Preventative Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
      <P>With regard to military peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Hercegovina, the Deputy will be aware that UNPROFOR &mdash; the UN Protection Force in Bosnia, to which Ireland made available a number of military observers &mdash; is no longer in existence.  The involvement of the United Nations in peacekeeping in Bosnia and Hercegovina is now limited to its civilian police operation &mdash; the UN International Police Task Force.  A total of 31 gardaí are deployed with this force, and the IPTF Commissioner is Assistant Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1995, the UN Security Council authorised a coalition of member states to form the international Implementation Force (IFOR).  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has the role of establishing and leading the Force, with the main troop contributors being NATO members or states which <Col N="616" /> are members of the &ldquo;Partnership for Peace&rdquo; programme.  No approach was made to Ireland to participate.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government intends to continue to make a significant effort to the efforts to implement the peace agreements for the former Yugoslavia.  During the Irish Presidency of the European Union, 75 Defence Force personal, and five Irish diplomats, will be among those serving with the European Community Monitor Mission, which is making a significant contribution to the efforts by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to prepare for the elections which will be held in Bosnia and Hercegovina.  Four further members of the Permanent Defence Forces are also serving as part of the OSCE Mission in Bosnia and Hercegovina.</P>

      <P>The Government continues to be concerned at the deterioration of the situation in Burma [Myanmar].</P>
      <P>Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with Burma.  However, as we hold the EU Presidency we are in ongoing consultation with our partners on the evolving situation in Burma which is likely to be discussed at the next meeting of the EU General Affairs Council on 15/16 July 1996.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about the position of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and arrangements have already been made to ensure that regular EU contacts are made with her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The Government are seriously concerned at the restriction on the fundamental rights of freedom of speech, movement and association in Burma. The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) should implement, without further delay, respect for human rights and democratic reform. SLORC should release, immediately and unconditionally, those members of the National League for Democracy who are still detained and all other political prisoners.</P>
    <P>In addition, SLORC should enter into meaningful dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other representatives of pro-democracy groups in Burma in order to bring about national reconciliation and a full and early restoration of democracy, which respects the aspirations of the Burmese people, as expressed in the elections of May 1990.</P>
    <P>The European Union awaits a full and satisfactory explanation from the Burmese authorities of the circumstances surrounding the death in custody in Rangoon, on 22 June 1996, of the late Mr. Leo Nichols.  Mr. Nichols had served as Honorary Consul for several European states and was a friend of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 45 together as they deal with similar subject matter.</P>
      <P>I assume Deputy Ahern's question relates to the arrangements both the Taoiseach and I have made, and continue to make, to keep in touch with our counterparts in the European Union in the context of our Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has engaged in an extensive round of consultations with his colleagues with a view to planning and preparing for our Presidency since the start of this year.  These contacts will be developed and extended through the Presidency period especially with a view to the two European Council meetings that will be held in October and December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach met with then Prime Minister Dini at the start of the Italian Presidency in January.  Prime Minister Simitis of Greece visited Dublin in March and both the Finnish President and the Finnish Prime Minister visited Ireland and had meetings with the Taoiseach in May and June respectively.  The Austrian Chancellor, Mr. Vranitzky, visited also in May, as did the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Dehaene.  And in June the Taoiseach had a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Kohl in Bonn.  The Taoiseach had meetings with the new Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Prodi, and the new Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. <Col N="619" /> Aznar in Brussels also in June.  In addition, the Taoiseach discussed EU issues on a bilateral basis with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>As well as the series of bilateral meetings, the Taoiseach had a number of opportunities to discuss issues on the European agenda with the EU Heads of State or Government when they met at the Europe-Asia meeting in Bangkok at the beginning of March.  Since the beginning of the year the Taoiseach has attended also two European Council meetings: in Turin in March and in Florence in June.</P>
    <P>Now that the Presidency has begun and with a view to discussing the Irish Presidency's priorities and preparing for the European Council meetings in October and December, the Taoiseach will have a range of meetings with his counterparts.  For example, the Taoiseach will meet the President of France, Mr. Chirac, next week in Paris and Chancellor Kohl will visit Ireland in October.  Details of further meetings are being worked out at present.</P>
    <P>In preparing for the Presidency the Taoiseach has also had a series of meetings with the President of the Commission, Mr. Santer, and with a range of Commissioners.  Every Government Minister who will chair the Council of Ministers has had extensive contacts with the relevant Commissioner or Commissioners during the past six months to ensure the necessary planning and preparation for the Presidency. These preparations culminated with the Commission-Government meeting held in Dublin on 2 July.</P>
    <P>For my own part I am in the process of holding Presidency consultation with all European Union Foreign Ministers. Following meetings in Madrid and Lisbon this week, and in Athens next week, I will have completed a full series of bilateral meetings with my European Union counterparts.  In addition I have the opportunity to meet my colleagues at least every four weeks in the context <Col N="620" /> of the General Affairs Council which I will chair from this month.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House in response to questions on 6 February, 25 March and 30 May, and in my statement on the Florence European Council and the Irish Presidency of the European Union on 26 June, a Calendar of Council meetings, a list of Presidency related meetings to be held in Ireland and the schedule for Intergovernmental Conference related meetings during our Presidency have been lodged with the Oireachtas Library for the information of all Deputies.  These have been updated regularly and will continue to be updated during the Presidency.  I will continue to lodge updates of all three documents in the Oireachtas Library on a regular basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have previously welcomed the suggestion of an independent body to arbitrate on parades as an important contribution to the very necessary debate on parades and parade routes.  I informed the House on 25 April last that the Government would support such a proposal but acknowledged that acceptability to the parties involved would be an essential condition for its success.  I continue to believe that this proposal does not yet command sufficiently widespread support among those directly involved in the issue to say that it represents a solution to the problem.  Let me add, however, that the proposal for an independent body is one of a number of matters relating to the parades issue which continue to be discussed with the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> The most recent meeting of the Conference on 22 May considered the outlook for this year's marching season.  It called on all those involved in the planning of parades to exercise compromise and balance in the interests of the community as a whole.  The Government hopes that as we approach the height of the marching season a repetition of the major confrontations which marred a small number of the thousands of parades which were held last year will be avoided.  Such confrontations significantly increase community tensions throughout the whole of Northern Ireland and merely serve to deepen divisions and mistrust.  They would be all the more regrettable at this time when the two Governments and political parties in Northern Ireland are involved in intense talks which have as their objectives the establishment of a lasting political settlement between the two traditions.</P>
    <P>I will continue to urge the British Government, through the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference, to take steps consistent with the principle that parades should not take place in an area or along a route where they are not welcome.  This principle reflects the rights both of the local residents to object to what they judge to be unwelcome parades and of those who wish to celebrate their heritage and identity by marching.  I assure the Deputy that my Department monitors the situation closely and that we will explore fully all the avenues, including that of an independent tribunal or commission, which offer the best prospects of a peaceful and agreed solution to the parades issue in the longer term.</P>

      <P>The establishment of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) under the Maastricht Treaty represented an important step in equipping the European Union with the capacity to respond effectively to international developments.  The principal implication of the CFSP for Ireland at present relates to the responsibilities which we have assumed as Presidency of the European Union since 1 July.  The Presidency plays a central role in the conduct of the CFSP during its term of office.  In this capacity, Ireland will be responsible for organising the work of the CFSP, implementing CFSP measures and representing the European Union on foreign policy issues. The Presidency's role includes the chairing of meetings on a wide range of CFSP issues and ensuring the co-ordination of EU positions in international fora.  In representing the European Union as Presidency, Ireland will conduct political dialogue meetings with third countries, assisted in some cases by our Troika partners, and will represent the Union's positions at multilateral meetings and conferences.</P>
      <P>The functioning of the CFSP is currently under review at the Intergovernmental Conference.  Issues which are being considered in this context include the day-to-day management of the CFSP, decision-making procedures, the role of the Presidency and the external representation of the Union.</P>

      <P>The Government have conveyed to the Chinese authorities on a number of occasions the <Col N="623" /> deep concern of the Irish Government about the care of Chinese orphans.  Following allegations about abuses of the human rights of disabled and orphan children, made in the Channel 4 programme &ldquo;The Dying Rooms&rdquo; in June 1995, the matter was raised with the Chinese Ambassador by a senior official at my Department.</P>
      <P>On 22 January 1996, after the airing of another television programme, &ldquo;Return to the Dying Rooms&rdquo;, I wrote to the Chinese Ambassador asking her to convey to her authorities the sense of outrage which the programme and report had evoked amongst the Irish people.  The Government also raised the matter with the then European Union Presidency and the EU Commission, and the attention of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe was also drawn to the issue.  Contact was also made with the Executive Director of UNICEF and his organisation subsequently reached agreement with the Chinese Government to start a programme aimed at improving the care of institutionalised orphans and disabled children.  This programme came into effect on 23 April 1996.  Moreover, Irish Aid is planning to provide assistance through both international bodies and NGOs.</P>
      <P>The EU Troika at senior official level, on which Ireland was represented, visited Beijing from 22-24 January 1996 for a human rights dialogue meeting with the Chinese authorities.  They raised the Channel 4 programme with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, which is the Ministry responsible for orphanages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chinese authorities arranged for a group of EU consular officials, including a representative from the Irish Embassy at Beijing, to visit the No. 2 Social Welfare Institute on Chong Ming Island in Shanghai which was featured in the television programme.  This group reported that, relative to Chinese standards, conditions at the institute were <Col N="624" /> not inconsistent with those found elsewhere in China and that nothing which they saw indicated any systematic ill-treatment or abuse of inmates there.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to give close attention to the issue of care for Chinese disabled and orphan children.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Foreign Affairs the current position regarding reception of RTÉ television in Northern Ireland; whether there are ongoing talks regarding this matter; if so, the body under which these discussions are taking place; the way in which they are progressing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of access to RTE television in Northern Ireland is one on which the Government places particular importance.  I am confident that greater availability of RTE television throughout Northern Ireland would make a significant contribution towards the creation of better North-South awareness and understanding and in this way assist in the process of reconciliation between the two parts of this island.  I also believe that it would contribute to greater understanding between the two main traditions in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government's objective of greater access to RTE television in Northern Ireland is shared by the British Government.</P>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference established a bilateral Broadcasting Group comprising officials and technical experts to examine the issue of RTE television reception in Northern Ireland.  That group identified that the most significant improvement in the short-term could be achieved by increasing the power from the RTE transmitter at Clermont Carn in County Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> However, the British side were concerned that the increase in power could have adverse effect on the reception of its local services in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the two relevant regulatory agencies, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications in Dublin and the Radiocommunications Agency in London, have had a series of meetings to discuss ways of overcoming any problem of interference which could arise from an increased power output from Clermont Carn.  I understand that a joint technical report on how to meet these concerns, has been agreed at official level and that political agreement to a phased implementation of the proposed changes to the transmitter at Clermont Carn is now awaited.</P>
    <P>At its recent meeting on 22 May last the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference noted the significant progress which has been made in the work which it commissioned on ways of improving RTE reception in Northern Ireland and looked forward to a full discussion of this subject at a future date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 57, 58, 59, 60 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993 provided for two separate amnesty schemes: an incentive amnesty under which, subject to compliance with specified conditions, certain liabilities to income tax and capital gains tax, together with interest and penalties, could be discharged by payment of 15 per cent of the underlying income or gains on a confidential basis to the chief special collector established under the Act; a general amnesty under which other tax arrears had to be paid <Col N="638" /> in full with remission only for interest and penalties.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the aggregate amount of tax and levies remitted to the chief special collector under the 15 per cent incentive amnesty is estimated to be £185.4 million on behalf of some 39,700 individuals in respect of declared amounts of income and gains.  This represents an average payment of almost £4,670 per person.  Companies were not eligible for this amnesty.</P>
    <P>The total yield of tax, PRSI and levies under the general amnesty, including some £14.1 million in value added tax paid to the chief special collector, is estimated at close on £76 million.  Separate figures on numbers of individuals and companies availing of the general amnesty were not maintained by the collector-general.  Many payments were presented to the collector-general by taxpayers and agents without being identified as payments under the general amnesty.  I understand, however, that an analysis carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor-General revealed that this amount was received from 15,055 taxpayers, indicating an average yield of £5,048 per taxpayer.</P>
    <P>As regards amounts of tax written off by the Revenue under the incentive amnesty, the position is that, because of the special confidentiality arrangements that apply to that amnesty, the collector-general will become aware of payments under it only as the taxpayers concerned produce to him the prescribed Form of Evidence of payment made to the chief special collector. Where taxpayers had liabilities on record they have been reminded by Revenue of the need to send in the form of evidence.  In cases of people with undeclared income who availed of the incentive amnesty, Revenue clearly would not be in a position to write to them.</P>
    <P>Some 7,200 Forms of Evidence have been received by the collector-general to date and a total of £8.1 million has been discharged on the basis of examination of about 1,200 of these forms.  The <Col N="639" /> forms are being worked through systematically with a block of staff currently made available to the Revenue Commissioners from the decentralisation surplus.  The work is time-consuming as it involves checks to ensure that the taxpayer correctly availed of the conditions of the incentive amnesty.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it is not possible to say at present what will be the total tax discharged under the incentive amnesty or indeed how much, if any, of it would have been otherwise collectible.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, given the special confidentiality arrangements that applied, normal Revenue records will not identify all the individuals who availed of the amnesty.  Where people do not meet their ongoing tax obligations, they will of course be picked up through Revenue's ongoing compliance and enforcement programmes.</P>
    <P>There was no requirement under the amnesty legislation to record past or future convictions for criminal offences. I want to make it clear, however, that the amnesty provided no protection against tax liability on foot of income from an unlawful source.  Nor does it impede in any way Garda investigations into criminal activity.</P>
    <P>In this connection I want to point out that among the specific exclusions from the 15 per cent incentive amnesty was tax on income or gains which arose from unlawful sources or activities.  Accordingly, income from such sources did not qualify for that amnesty.  Tax on income from such activities was required under the scheme to be paid in full by 14 January 1994.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions of the incentive amnesty was that a person had to make and sign a declaration form which included an undertaking that no part of the declared income or gains arose from unlawful sources of activities.  If a person included income or gains from unlawful sources or activities in an amnesty declaration, the declaration would be false.  A person who made a false declaration is not entitled to any of <Col N="640" /> the benefits of the amnesty and, accordingly, remains liable to the full tax, interest and penalties.</P>
    <P>Where tax had been discharged there is provision for it to be reinstated.  In addition, the making of a false declaration is an abuse of the amnesty scheme. There is provision under the legislation to challenge any declaration made under the amnesty if it appears to be false.  In accordance with the amnesty legislation the person concerned would be liable to severe penalties, including imprisonment, which were introduced specifically to curb abuse.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works intend to engage consultants to carry out a review of the GSA.  The purpose is to identify immediate steps which can be taken to improve efficiency.  A restricted tendering procedure has been used with a closing date of 4 July.  A number of public sector and private sector firms with substantial procurement functions have been asked to tender for this work.  This is consistent with my wish that the GSA adopt the best practices prevailing in the public and private sectors.  As the tender competition is not yet completed it would not be appropriate to name the firms who have been asked to quote.</P>
      <P>The firm which submits the most economically advantageous tender will be selected for the work.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where a niece of the disponer i.e. a child of a brother or sister of the disponer has worked substantially on a full-time basis in the trade, business or profession of the disponer during the five year period immediately prior to the date of the disposition, which is usually the date of death, an inheritance of property used in connection with that trade, business or profession will attract the current inheritance tax threshold of £182,550.  In the case of all other assets <Col N="642" /> the appropriate threshold for an inheritance taken by a niece is £24,340.</P>
      <P>No credit is given to a successor who has acted as an unregistered carer and who has lived in the house for 46 years in the absence of a legal claim for compensation for services rendered.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also advised that there are hardship provisions under the capital acquisitions tax code which allow for postponement of the tax until the property is sold or passed on to the next generation.  Hardship cases are viewed on their individual merits in the light of all the circumstances of the successor.</P>

      <P>The present urban renewal scheme was introduced on 1 August 1994 and will operate for a three year period.  The scheme applies to 35 cities and towns throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Late last year, Deputy Liz McManus, Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal announced a comprehensive review of the entire urban renewal scheme to assess the experience gained over the last ten years.  As part of this review a team of independent consultants were appointed and their report on the matter should be completed during the summer. Deputy McManus has said on a number of occasions that until the outcome of this whole review process has been assessed, no new areas or towns would be designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more than 50 areas in cities, towns and seaside resorts already designated either under the urban renewal scheme or the pilot scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  To introduce additional designated areas under either of these two schemes or to introduce a completely new scheme could, in my <Col N="643" /> view, greatly dilute the benefits of the existing schemes.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Question Nos. 68, 83 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made by the Medical Council in relation to the matters raised by the Deputy.  The Medical Council has informed me that it does not have a policy of unionising its staff. It is a matter for the staff as to whether they wish individually or collectively to join a union.  The Medical Council does not have information on the number of staff that may have joined unions in each of the years 1994-96.  Its policy on staff joining unions is that one body should represent the staff in matters of concern to the staff.</P>
      <P>The number of staff employed by the Medical Council for the years 1994 to 1996 is as follows:</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The administration of the registration system is a matter for An t-Ard Chláraitheoir, Registrar-General of Births and Deaths and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An t-Árd Chláraitheoir has advised <Col N="646" /> that the Births and Deaths Registration Acts 1863 to 1994 and regulations made under these Acts prescribe the procedures for the registration of births, the issue of certificates and the correction of errors in entries in the registers.</P>
    <P>I understand an error occurred in the registration of the birth in question. Certified copies of entries are required to be exact copies of the particulars entered in the register.  It would appear from the information furnished by the Deputy that the certificate issued on 12 March 1990 was not a true copy of the event as registered.  The prescribed procedures for the correction of the type of error in an entry in the register of births as occurred in this instance requires either the attendance of a qualified informant at the office of the registrar, the completion by him or her of a statutory declaration form in the presence of a peace commissioner or the authority of An t-Árd Chláraitheoir.</P>
    <P>An t-Árd Chláraitheoir has advised that the entry in question has been amended to show the true sex of the child and that the parents may now obtain a copy of the amended entry from the Superintendent Registrar's office Joyce House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The report of the expert group on a Protocol for the prescribing of methadone set out recommendations for the involvement of general practitioners in methadone maintenance programmes.  The Protocol recommended that general practitioners should become involved by taking on responsibility for the care of drug misusers who had first been stabilised at community drug treatment centres.  It also outlined the criteria necessary to ensure that methadone prescribing <Col N="647" /> occurs in a controlled, responsible fashion.</P>
      <P>Many elements of the Protocol have already been implemented.  Most notably, a central treatment list of all patients being prescribed methadone has been established.  A general practitioner who is considering prescribing methadone for a patient can check whether the patient's name is on this treatment list and thus ensure that the patient does not receive methadone from more than one source.</P>
      <P>A methadone maintenance project involving GPs and pharmacists commenced recently.  This involves a selected number of patients who have been stabilised in drug treatment centres and who are being referred to general practitioners for continuation of methadone maintenance treatment and overall medical care.  The elements which are included in this pilot programme are: drug misusers, who are referred to general practitioners, will have been previously stabilised in a health board treatment clinic; each patient is provided with a personalised treatment card; a facilitator, appointed by the Eastern Health Board, is providing liaison between treatment centres, general practitioners and pharmacies and any drug misuser who becomes destabilised while under general practitioner care will be referred back to a treatment centre for attention and further treatment.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 30 doctors prescribing to 71 patients with treatment cards who are being dispensed methadone from 21 pharmacists.</P>
      <P>The programme will run initially for a six month period and it is hoped that, with the support of the appropriate professional organisations, general practitioners and pharmacists will continue to be part of the overall programme for the provision of treatment services for stabilised drug misusers in their own communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the pilot project over 700 drug misusers are prescribed methadone in treatment centres at Pearse <Col N="648" /> Street, Baggot Street, Amiens Street and Ballyfermot.  There are also over 690 patients being prescribed methadone by 25 general practitioners in the community.</P>
    <P>Another element of the board's methadone treatment programme includes the introduction of a mobile clinic.  Plans are at an advanced stage and it is hoped the service will be operational later this year.</P>
    <P>The board is endeavouring to expand treatment services to drug misusers who are on waiting lists for such treatment. The number of additional persons for whom treatment will be provided will depend on the success of the Eastern Health Board in establishing further community drug centres in local areas and also on the number of additional general practitioners and pharmacists who are prepared to prescribe and dispense methadone respectively to stabilised drug misusers.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse has been considering the issue of a national telephone helpline in line with the Government decisions on demand reduction measures to prevent drug misuse. A helpline has been operated in Cork since November 1995 and its operation is currently being evaluated.  A national information line is being operated in conjunction with the current multi-media drugs awareness campaign and the response to this is being closely monitored.  When the results of these two evaluations are to hand I expect the National Co-ordination Committee to be in a position to make a proposal in relation to a national helpline.  In the <Col N="649" /> meantime all health boards have been instructed to establish a contact service which will provide information, advice and assistance on drugs and related issues to the public.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware that German teenagers are being placed in foster care in different health board areas.  These placements are arranged by a number of German youth agencies and private agents.</P>
      <P>There is a legal requirement, under the Children Acts, on a person or body proposing to foster a child privately to notify the local health board in which the proposed placement will occur.  My Department issued a circular to all health boards in June 1995 in relation to the placement of German adolescents with families in this country.  This was primarily designed to promote closer working relationships between the boards and organisations involved, bearing in mind the overall best interests of the children.</P>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board have informed me that they have no knowledge that any of the young persons placed with families in the Sligo/Leitrim area have been convicted of crimes.  They inform me also that they are aware of five agencies placing German children in their area.  The five organisations involved work closely with the board and comply with the various requirements regarding notification.</P>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board indicate that they are aware of a recent disturbance in a derelict house, involving both German and Irish teenagers, but that they have no reason to be concerned in relation to the professional levels of care provided to these foreign children.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The General Medical Services (Payments) Board compiles statistics on the number of persons with medical card eligibility in the various age categories.

However, given that the published Census figures relate to 1991 and that the statistics from the payments board are current, it is not possible to provide the precise information requested by the Deputy.

    <P>It is estimated that the average cost of providing general medical services to those aged 65 years and over is approximately £320 per person per annum.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive office of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  These guidelines are higher for persons aged 66 to 79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, <Col N="656" /> the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision, I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to all citizens aged 80 and over, without reference to their means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
    <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card must, of course, receive one and I am satisfied that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications made on the grounds of special needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The draft of the order amending the Adelaide Hospital Charter to form the legislative basis for the governance of the new hospital at Tallaght contains specific provisions regarding the composition of the board of management.  Those provisions reflect the terms of an agreement reached in May 1993 by the three hospitals transferring to Tallaght, the Adelaide, Meath and National Children's Hospital, and agreed to by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically, the draft order provides for the establishment of a statutory board comprising 23 members.  Fifteen members will be appointed by the Adelaide Hospital Society, the Meath and National Children's Hospitals; six members shall be appointed, from among the persons nominated by the <Col N="657" /> President of the hospital, by the Minister for Health; one member shall be appointed on the nomination of the Eastern Health Board or any successor to its functions by the Minister for Health; and one member shall be appointed on the nomination of the board of Trinity College, Dublin by the Minister for Health.  Members of the board shall hold office for a period of three years.  It shall be open to each of the bodies referred to above to nominate a general practitioner to the new board if they so wish.</P>
    <P>Generally, and in line with the health strategy, the new acute hospital at Tallaght must be seen as part of a multifunctional and integrated health system. For example, it will be important for the hospital to complement the role of the general practitioner as the first point of contact with the health service and to <Col N="658" /> ensure that patients are not unnecessarily referred to hospital for services which should be provided by general practitioners.  I will, therefore, be expecting the board to develop its services in keeping with this policy to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the provision of services in the hospital setting and in the community.</P>

    <P>The figures for 1985 are based on the 1981 census, for 1990 on the 1986 census and 1995 and 1996 on the 1991 census. The figures are calculated on the revised approved levels of expenditure for the agencies in the years 1985, 1990 and 1995 and the original approved level of expenditure in 1996.  The 1995 and 1996 figures reflect the fact that the responsibility for funding the disabled person's maintenance allowance was transferred to the Department of Social Welfare in August 1995 and that there was substantial once-off expenditure in 1995 which will not be incurred in 1996.  It should be noted that expenditure per head of population is an unweighted average which does not take into account a number of demographic and geographical factors.  The difference in the cost of health care in each region is also influenced by other factors such as access to higher specialities, density of population and the present stage of development of the services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Because of the nature of the service provided, it is essential that there be flexibility within the health service in relation to the types of employment contracts offered to employees.</P>
      <P>The various types of employment contracts issued are permanent contracts, temporary contracts, and special purpose or fixed term contracts.  Each contract type could potentially be used in relation to any grade of staff, depending on the particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the individual employer to decide the length of contracts issued, dependent on the nature and duration of the vacancy being filled. The amount of notice given to employees about the renewal or otherwise of contracts varies depending on the duration of the contract and the demands of the service, within the terms of the relevant legislation.</P>

      <P>In 1993 the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department purchased blanket bog at Gleneaskey-Letterunshin. County Sligo for nature conservation purposes.  Several attempts were made to get sheep owners to remove <Col N="664" /> trespassing animals from the property so that a sustainable number could be permitted to graze there under licence.</P>
      <P>The owners did not remove their livestock and on 17 May 1996 three NPWS rangers herded the animals off the property as they are entitled to do under the law.  Two complaints were made regarding the manner of the removal of the sheep and a small number of goats. These complaints allege that some animals were killed or injured in the process of herding.</P>
      <P>The allegations have been investigated by the NPWS Regional Manager (North West) and his Deputy.  I have been informed that no injured animals have been seen or shown to either the rangers or the investigating officials. The actual owners of the animals have not complained to NPWS about the manner of their removal and the investigation concluded that no injuries were caused to any animals by the herding which I understand was done as normal practice at a walking pace.</P>

      <P>Statistics in respect of fish kills are compiled by the Marine Institute's Fishery Research Centre from reports furnished by regional fisheries boards and local authorities.</P>
      <P>According to these statistics, the number of fish kills in each of the years since 1992, and to date in 1996, was as follows: 1992, 51; 1993, 33; 1994, 32; 1995, 84; 1996, 29 (to 3 July).</P>
      <P>The increased incidence of fish kills recorded in 1995 was influenced by low river flows due to the prolonged spell of dry weather, together with high temperatures. Although the number of incidents was high in that year, major fish kills in the rivers were relatively few.  A further analysis of the 1994 and 1995 fish kills and the factors responsible is set out in the Marine Institute's report on <i>Fish Kills in 1994 and 1995,</i> a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

However, my Department publishes in the Bulletins of Housing Statistics &mdash; copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library &mdash; a series of indices which relate private new house prices to the average earnings of adult workers. These indices show that, in the five years 1990 to 1994, average earnings, based on figures provided by the Central Statistics Office, increased by 16 per cent and average new house prices by 11 per cent.

As regards comparative costs of different waste management options, I refer to the reply to Question No. 121 of 15 May 1996.</P>

The steering committee of the office includes a representative at senior official level of Dublin Corporation and 11 elected representatives of the corporation have been appointed to the local authority committee of the office.  Any additional administrative arrangements for liaison <Col N="678" /> between the Office and Dublin Corporation are matters to be agreed between the two organisations.</P>
      <P>In the light of the Government decision to establish the Office of Director of Traffic, a special consultancy study is being undertaken to define the organisational structures required to ensure that the director can fully and effectively discharge his/her functions and that the new unit within Dublin Corporation will have optimum operational capacity, functional independence, and self-financing capability.  I expect that the study will be completed in the next two to three months.  When it is completed, firm decisions can be made on implementation matters generally, including the precise role and functions of the director <i>vis-à-vis</i> other officials and elected representatives.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to any primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>During the period 1994-1995, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children <Col N="685" /> who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiatives aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <P>There are 81 ordinary primary schools in County Cavan.  Twenty-six of these do not have access to a remedial teaching service.  The names of these 26 schools are detailed in the following table:</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to make child care assistant posts available to primary schools.  Child care assistants are employed in special schools to assist all the pupils attending those schools.  Child care assistants are not allocated to individual pupils attending such schools, as a general rule.</P>
      <P>There are eight child care assistant posts assigned to the two special schools in County Meath.  St Ultan's Special School, Navan has two child care assistant posts and St. Mary's Special School, Navan has six child care assistant posts.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the important role which child care assistants play in assisting children with special needs attending special schools. Since my appointment, I have allocated an additional 155 child care assistants to special schools bringing the total in place to 232.  One hundred child care posts were allocated to special schools with effect from September 1995.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following recommendations from the Department's inspectorate and having regard to data supplied by schools.</P>
      <P>The substantial improvements which have already been achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.  However, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period 1993-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 child care assistants, I have adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes. These include a reduction in the pupil teacher ratio in all facilities, a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates, additional remedial teachers and <Col N="691" /> additional resource teachers for pupils with special needs enrolled in mainstream schools.</P>
    <P>This year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach, a major new initiative was recently launched aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that substantial advances have been achieved across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the child care assistant area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>On Tuesday last I obtained Government approval for the necessary capital funding to enable the construction of the new Women's Prison at Cowley Place, near Mountjoy, which will provide 60 extra prison places, to begin in January, 1997.</P>
      <P>I recognise the need to separate remand and convicted prisoners.  The design of the new Women's Prison provides for the separation of prisoners by categories and will, therefore, permit remand prisoners to be held apart from convicted prisoners.  In view of the overall numbers of female prisoners involved, a separate remand institution could not be justified.</P>

      <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the Law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  That independence excludes any action by the Executive which could be interpreted as direct interference in the exercise of those judicial functions including imposing a training or briefing programme on the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>Our system of recruitment to all levels of the Judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in people who are experienced and trained legal practitioners and on appointment judges can generally be expected to have a fairly wide knowledge of the law and its application. However, it is acknowledged that this training and expertise may not always be sufficient, for example, in relation to crimes of sexual violence. Recent legislation, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, introduces a number of measures to facilitate training for the Judiciary.  It enables me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and also provides that persons wishing to be considered for judicial appointment must agree to undertake training courses following their appointment. The provisions of the Act enable the Judiciary to promote judicial training in every way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always assisted with initiatives which the Judiciary have brought forward in this regard.  Funds have always been made available to judges at all levels to enable them to attend training <Col N="696" /> seminars, conferences and meetings both at home and abroad.  The Chief Justice has recently established the Judicial Studies Board to ensure that funds which are made available for training are used as effectively as possible. I very much welcome this initiative and will continue to support and facilitate judicial training in every way open to me.</P>

      <P>There are a number of services available in the prison system where offenders can avail of counselling and training with a view to their rehabilitation, i.e. the Psychology Service, the Probation and Welfare Service, the Chaplaincy Service and the Education and Work Training Services.  As well as these there are a number of volountary groups with which offenders may have contact.</P>
      <P>The psychology service which comprises six psychologists provides a service to offenders in the prisons.  This service specially targets a number of offender groups within the Prison System, e.g.</P>
      <P>&mdash; juvenile offenders</P>
      <P>&mdash; sex offenders who require specialised treatment</P>
      <P>&mdash; female offenders</P>
      <P>&mdash; difficult, disruptive and dangerous offenders</P>
      <P>&mdash; offenders who represent a known suicidal risk and</P>
      <P>&mdash; offenders serving very long sentences.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of the Psychology Service is to participate in the implementation of pre-release programmes for offenders and to participate in the positive management of their sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Services provide a counselling service to offenders in the prisons.  Their duties include counselling offenders, helping them cope with personal and domestic problems, guiding them towards services within and outside the prisons which will assist them in coping with specific problems such as substance addiction, encouraging contact with families and volunteers from the community, helping them generally to cope with their sentences, preparing them for eventual release, and very often putting in train arrangements in the community <Col N="698" /> to help them re-integrate into that community.</P>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service, in conjunction with the psychology service, is also involved in the delivery of specialised counselling by way of a sex offender treatment programme.</P>
    <P>An Education Service which offers a wide curriculum to offenders is operated by the Department of Justice in conjunction with the Vocational Education Committees, the Public Library Services and other outside agencies. This service helps to prepare offenders for life after release by giving them an opportunity to access education at an appropriate level while serving their sentences.</P>
    <P>A Work-Training Service is also provided. The service insists on high and up-to-date standards in the work which offenders do and in the training they undergo.  Both the work and the training must produce skills which are relevant for offenders after they leave prison and must meet the requirements of the modern workplace.</P>
    <P>There are at present nine full-time and seven part-time chaplains working in the prison service.  Their work involves extensive counselling of offenders, not just in spiritual matters but in everyday human activity &mdash; assisting in their rehabilitation and helping them to cope with personal and family traumas.  I am satisfied that all these services work well together in assisting the rehabilitation of offenders.</P>
    <P>The above services are complemented by a number of voluntary groups with whom offenders may have contact.  There is quite a number of those groups and it would be invidious of me to single out any one of them for mention here.  I would, however, like to put on record my appreciation of the very good work they do.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, that recidivism is likely to remain a feature of behaviour amongst those inclined towards criminal activity but I am committed to take whatever action seems likely to prove beneficial to minimise its impact <Col N="699" /> both on the individuals concerned and on society as a whole.</P>

These statistics indicate that 596 applications under the procedure proceeded to a District Court hearing and that awards were made by the court in 300 of those cases.  Statistics are not available in relation to the number of these awards which have been paid primarily because, in many cases, the Small Claims Registrars are not informed of the settlements which take place between the parties following court proceedings.</P>

    <P>In addition to the above, Public Relations of Ireland Ltd. have been on contract since June last year, providing guidance and advice to myself and the Department on public relations matters at an annual fee of £44,000, including VAT.  Fitzpatricks Associates have been on contract since October last to act as external evaluators for the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 and to date, they been paid a total of £30,812 of which £23,109 is recoupable from the EU.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980 implement EC Directive 77/187 aimed at safeguarding the rights of employees in the event of the transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business from one employer to another employer as a result of a legal transfer or merger. The directive and the regulations provide that, where such a transfer takes <Col N="710" /> place, the rights and obligations arising from an employment contract or relationship existing on the date of the transfer are transferred from the original employer to the new employer.</P>
      <P>Arising from disputes which have arisen over the years in different member states of the European Community as to whether the directive applies in certain situations, the European Court of Justice has issued a number of judgements relating to the directive which have widened the concept of a transfer of an undertaking to include, in certain instances, the contracting out of services.</P>
      <P>If the employees of the company currently providing the services are not retained by the new company taking over the contract, it would be open to those employees to bring a case for unfair dismissal to a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, provided they fulfil the eligibility criteria under the unfair dismissals legislation.  In the past, the tribunal has heard a number of cases involving the application of the regulations in the context of the unfair dismissals legislation. In one case, the tribunal found that the regulations applied where a company was successful in tendering for (contract) work which had previously been carried out by another company.</P>

      <P>From their establishment until the end of 1995, all city and county enterprise boards, regardless of the size of population, the level of unemployment in the area or the local opportunities for enterprise development, were allocated the same annual allocation.  The Government recently approved the introduction of a new system for determining the annual allocations to the boards for 1996 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>The level of funding for each area has now been determined on the basis of an objectively-based resource allocation model taking account of such factors as:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the population, overall size and relative needs of each area</P>
      <P>&mdash; the capacity of each area to successfully utilise enterprise funding and to create employment</P>
      <P>&mdash; the quality of the enterprise plan prepared by each city and county enterprise board.</P>
      <P>The different allocations also take account of the overall expenditure pattern of boards and their record in programme development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the allocations I announced on 13 June, Dublin city enterprise board received £754,000, the highest project approval allocation for 1996 of any CEB in the country.  This represents more than a doubling of the allocation provided to the board in 1995.  In addition to the allocation for grant approval, the board received an allocation of £200,000 in 1996, also the highest such allocation in the country, to support a wide range of enterprise support activities, such as <Col N="713" /> advice, counselling, mentoring and management development.  I do not consider that this represents an underfunding of the Dublin city enterprise board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the introduction of this new system of funding for the CEBs will enable them to achieve the targets set for the county enterprise initiative under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> With a view to ensuring that any further quota becoming available during this year is directed towards these smaller producers, I have decided that they will have total priority under the second and third stages of this year's temporary leasing scheme.  I have also asked the milk quota group to meet again following the completion of the second stage of temporary leasing in order to assess the impact of its operation.</P>
    <P>I have also recently announced a subsidised milk quota restructuring scheme with a subsidy of 40 to 50 pence available specifically for smaller scale producers who purchase additional quota.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that both these arrangements will go some way towards assisting the situation for those smaller scale producers who have the greatest need in the current year.  I would, however, caution that producers will be required to manage their production in the knowledge that there will be a very strong demand on the amount of any quota available under the next two stages of temporary leasing.</P>

      <Quest>his views on a press report (details supplied) which indicated that Ireland could face further fines from the European Commission arising from further irregularities in the beef industry; the current position in regard to the investigation of this matter; and the reason there was a delay of 16 months in the reporting of the matter by his Department to the Garda Fraud Squad.</Quest>

      <P>While it is not normal practice to comment on any investigations involving individual traders or operators the following points will clarify the position in relation to the case cited in the article:</P>
      <P>&mdash; beef export refunds as claimed by the company were not paid in this case and the possibility of a fine being imposed subsequently by the Commission does not arise;</P>
      <P>&mdash; it was the vigilance of my Department's staff and the various improved control procedures in place that uncovered what were contraventions of the requirements of the relevant EU Regulations;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the Commission was notified at an early date of these contraventions and during the course of subsequent investigations detailed consultations were held with both UCLAF, the Commission's anti-fraud agency and the Commission's services responsible for FEOGA expenditure.  Detailed explanations and information were sought and received from the company</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; as soon as these consultations and administrative investigations were concluded and the necessary follow up work undertaken, the case was referred to the Garda Bureau <Col N="724" /> of Fraud Investigation as the agency responsible for the investigation of situations where the criminal law may have been violated. I understand that the Garda enquiry is continuing.</P>
    <P>The referral of any matter to the Garda Authorities is in itself a serious step and could only have been done on a formal basis in this instance after appropriate investigations involving the Commission, Customs and the company had been concluded.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the application of a person (details supplied) in County Cavan for Leader aid who qualifies on all accounts for a grant of £8,000 but who was advised in December 1995 by the Cavan/Monaghan Rural Development Co-operative Society Limited that his grant has not been approved due to the fact that work was substantially completed and that a project can be considered for aid only where the work involved commences after the formal application is acknowledged; if he will accept that the applicant endeavoured to apply for Leader in April 1995 and was referred to the Cavan county enterprise board who were acting in the absence of Leader and this application was formally submitted to Cavan county enterprise board on 20 April 1996 and that this should have been taken as his date of application due to the fact that the county enterprise board subsequently referred him back to Leader and, on 17 October 1995, the Cavan/Monaghan Rural Development Co-operative Society acknowledged that it had received the information from the Cavan county enterprise board and that no work had commenced when the Cavan county enterprise board official inspected the site following the formal application of 20 April 1995; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the terms of the operating rules for Leader II a group selected for Leader funding is authorised to implement the measures in the business plan from the date that the formal legal agreement is signed with my Department.  The agreement for the implementation of Leader in Counties Cavan and Monaghan was signed with the local group on 2 October 1995.  Activity undertaken or work commenced on a project before this date is not eligible for grant aid under Leader.  As the person referred to commenced work on his project in <Col N="726" /> August 1995 it is not eligible for Leader funding.</P>
      <P>The fact that the person had endeavoured to apply for Leader funding in April 1995 and had submitted an application to the county enterprise board does not alter the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the International Agreement which Ireland entered into in respect of the North-West European Loran C System, France and the Netherlands are to contribute 50 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, towards the capital cost of the Irish station.</P>
      <P>As part of this cost sharing arrangement, France and the Netherlands are to meet the cost of the mast and electronic equipment.  I understand that the French and Dutch Governments have already paid £1,524,455 in respect of their contribution towards the cost of the Irish system.</P>
      <P>As a result of a lengthy planning and legal process, Ireland has had to pay £23,428 for mast storage costs to date.</P>
      <P>Before the International Agreement was signed, the full implications of establishing a Loran C System were carefully considered by the Government and the matter was extensively debated by the Dáil when it approved the project on 8 October 1992.</P>
      <P>The development of ground-based Loran C Systems has been identified as a prudent investment to ensure accurate comprehensive coverage and also as being an essential ground-based backup for satellite-based systems.</P>
