      <P>Last week when this matter was targeted by the Government Chief Whip I asked for a very short debate on the Supplementary Estimate. It was indicated that the issue would not be debated this week.  At 10 a.m. today I received a phone call from the Government Chief Whip asking that the matter be taken without debate.  We are still of the view that there should be a very short debate on it and unless the Government accedes to our request we will press it to a vote.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is for a token sum of £1,000 for access to islands.  The subject was debated extensively here on 7 March and we do not believe that there is necessity for another debate on the subject.  At this point it is necessary to put the financial regulations in place so that the work can be done to improve living conditions in island communities.  Action rather than another debate is required at this juncture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome the conciliatory and constructive tone of the British Prime Minister's article in <i>The Irish Times</i> which is helpful as far as it goes.  There is a compelling case for a reinstatement and maintenance of the IRA ceasefire. We do not understand why the British Prime Minister did not mention the Framework Document after all that has been said by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and what was stated at its launching about there being a shared understanding between the two Governments. They strongly commended it to the parties and people in the island of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being very patient and understanding.  I am anxious to help but these matters are strictly not relevant to the Order of Business.  They are topical and as such the Taoiseach may wish to comment, but it places the Chair in an invidious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I will be brief.  It would be helpful if, on this issue, the Irish Government could convince the British Prime Minister to state his position once again.  I agree with what the Taoiseach said that there should be a time frame for the talks. Having gone so far it is a mistake not to state some kind of timetable.</P>

      <P>We hope the article will be received in a positive spirit and that it will be further built on by the two Governments.  It is important to ensure in the next few weeks that the window of opportunity is successfully taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would wish to hear Deputy Harney on the same topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the conciliatory tone of the British Prime Minister's comments in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times.</i> I particularly welcome his assurance that the decommissioning issue will not block all-party negotiations.  The biggest obstacle in the way of the all-party negotiations remains the failure of the IRA to restore its ceasefire.  We must ensure that we do not endanger the peace process by engaging in a war of words or analysing it to death.  There is an enormous opportunity now and we must not let it be frittered away.  That opportunity must be grasped by the politicians in Northern Ireland who must go into the talks process willing to do business and willing to compromise.  I call on the leader of Sinn Féin to use his influence to have the IRA ceasefire restored so that Sinn Féin can take part in the all inclusive talks which give us a great opportunity to have a political settlement in Northern Ireland and to transform this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note there is consensus in this House that the conditions have now been fulfilled wherein the IRA should restore its ceasefire straight away.  It should be noted that there is unanimity in this House on that point.  It is important that all who speak of consensus should recognise the democratic consensus in this House on the urgent need to restore the IRA ceasefire and on the fact that the conditions justifying that, from the point of view and perspectives of all the parties in this House, have now been fulfilled.  It is particularly important to take into account that there is a big opportunity available that may not <Col N="1219" /> come easily again on 10 June.  That opportunity arises from the specific provision for all party talks to start on that date, and from the fact that this British Prime Minister is deeply engaged and interested in ensuring a solution is found in those negotiations.  He could not be more committed to that end. That is very clear from his article.  It also arises because the present US Administration and US Congress on a bipartisan basis are focused now on solving this problem at this time.  If the opportunity created by that focus is frittered away because Sinn Féin cannot participate because the IRA will not declare a ceasefire, it will not be easy to reassemble that bipartisan focus in the United States on finding a way through these difficult issues.</P>
      <P>On the question of a timetable &mdash; this matter was raised by Deputy Ahern &mdash; a timetable of approximately a year, with the possibility of renewal is envisaged in the legislation setting up the election and the subsequent negotiations.  It is possible the work could be done in a shorter period.  When the parties get together they may well agree to do the work within a shorter time frame and set themselves targets for agreement on various topics within that shorter time frame.  All the parties must agree a time frame as they are the ones who will negotiate.  They must own that time frame and be committed to achieve the objectives, intermediate and ultimate, within it.  That is something the parties can and should do when they meet on 10 June.  It would be difficult for anybody else to do that for them before their first meeting.  It is important that one of the parties there on 10 June to agree that time frame should be Sinn Féin.  The only requirement to allow Sinn Féin to be there is that the IRA should restore the ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to make the point that the assurances I gave in Finglas about the way in which the negotiations would be conducted are not assurances solely based on my authority or the <Col N="1220" /> authority of the Government, they are based in large measure on specific agreements negotiated between the Irish and British Governments which are on the public record, for example, the ground rules document for the talks which was negotiated by the Tánaiste.  I was able to give the assurances I gave in Finglas because of agreements which bind and involve both Governments &mdash; Prime Minister Major's Government and the Irish Government.  It is important that people analysing or comparing the speech I made in Finglas with the necessarily more brief article published by the British Prime Minister recognise that the assurance I gave in Finglas were, in large measure, based on earlier agreements which involve the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    <P>That should also be taken into consideration.  It is useful to have had this opportunity to respond as representatives of the entire spectrum of opinion in this State to the article published by the British Prime Minister this morning. It is important that the message which goes forth from this House is unanimous, democratic and one on which there is consensus and that it asks those who can ensure the talks are fully inclusive not to delay any longer in restoring their ceasefire.  It is also important that the House acknowledges there are two ceasefires which need to be maintained and tended.  The loyalist ceasefire, which remains in place, is very important to the peace process and we hope the IRA ceasefire will be quickly restored so that the talks on 10 June will not be only truly inclusive but also ultimately successful.</P>

    <P>An explanatory memorandum setting out the background to the agreements and their content has been provided for the information of Deputies through the Whips' office.  Copies of the Europe Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and of the Partnership and <Col N="1230" /> Co-operation Agreements with Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, were laid before the Dáil on 23 October 1995.  Copies of the PCAs with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were laid before the Dáil on 2 May 1996.</P>
    <P>Partnership and Co-operation Agreements were initiated by the European Union with a view to replacing the 1989 Trade and Co-operation Agreement with the former Soviet Union with contractual relations with each of the new states.  As their name indicates, they are intended to assist the new states through partnership and co-operation with the European Union, in meeting the challenges of fundamental political and economic reform.</P>
    <P>Good relations between the EU and a democratic Russia are clearly in the interests of both parties and are essential to stability in Europe.  Ireland, and its partners in the European Union, are committed to establishing a substantial partnership with the Russian Federation in order to promote Russia's economic and democratic reform process, to enhance respect for human rights and to achieve the full integration of Russia into the international community.  We must avoid the creation of new dividing lines in Europe.</P>
    <P>These considerations underpin the action plan recently adopted by the Union with regard to Russia.  There are five main elements in the Union's approach, viz:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Union will contribute to the democratic reforms in Russia by, for example, participating in the international observation of the forthcoming Russian Presidential elections; encouraging contacts between the European Parliament, members states' parliaments and the Russian parliament; supporting Russian institutions, particularly in an OSCE and Council of Europe framework, and assisting in the development of local and regional administration in Russia;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" />&mdash;economic co-operation between the Union and Russia, through, for example, the early ratification of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with Russia; developing trade relations and promoting Russia's integration into the international economy; the establishment of joint EU &mdash; Russia mechanisms with a view to facilitating the development of trade relations with Russia and encouraging the development of regional relations between Russia and its neighbours;</P>
    <P>&mdash;co-operation between the Union and Russia in justice and home affairs, through, for example, co-operation in the fight against organised crime, drugs trafficking and money-laundering; co-operation in relation to illegal immigration and in matters relating to asylum and re-admission;</P>
    <P>&mdash;co-operation with Russia on matters pertaining to security in Europe including on issues relating to disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and conflict prevention and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the further development of consultation at all levels between the Union and Russia on foreign policy issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise in the House today the importance which Ireland, on the eve of its EU Presidency, attaches to the successful and harmonious development of EU-Russia relations on the basis of the Union's strategy and the action plan.  As incoming Presidency, Ireland will have an important role to play in its implementation.  From the perspective of Irish-Russian bilateral relations, we have much to gain from its success.</P>
    <P>Ukraine is, after Russia, the largest of the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union in terms of population and potential economic importance.  Members will recall the enormous <Col N="1232" /> difficulties faced by Ukraine following its independence in 1991 &mdash; a severe contraction of economic output, inefficient heavy industrial and mining sectors, an energy sector badly in need of reform, dislocation of trade relationships, soaring prices and an agriculture sector heavily concentrated on inefficient collective and state farms.  Moreover, there was uncertainty about the scope, pace and direction of economic reform.  Happily, 1994 marked a turning point for Ukraine with the adoption of a comprehensive reform package leading to considerable progress in stabilisation last year in the areas of economic output, inflation and the government deficit.</P>
    <P>The European Union fully supports the Ukrainian authorities' commitment to the current process of economic reform and has continued to provide support for Ukraine through macroeconomic assistance.  The Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with Ukraine explicitly recognizes that support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine will contribute to the safeguarding of peace and stability in the region of central and eastern Europe and on the European continent as a whole.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of nuclear safety in Ukraine, the EU's concerns on this point led it to propose last summer, in co-operation with its G 7 partners, an action plan for (i) the definitive closure of Chernobyl; (ii) reform of Ukraine's energy sector including the development of alternative energy sources; (iii) the up-grading of construction and operation standards in its nuclear subsector and (iv) ratification by Ukraine of the Vienna Convention on nuclear liability.  This plan will involve a considerable effort for the international financial institutions and the EU &mdash; through EURATOM loans and TACIS grants.  At its most recent meeting in Madrid, the European Council welcomed the agreement reached with Ukraine on the closure of Chernobyl by the year 2000.  I know that I speak for all Members of this House when I <Col N="1233" /> emphasise the importance, for our own and for future generations of Europeans, in carrying through on this agreement.  The horrors of Chernobyl demonstrate the need for solid partnership and co-operation among all European countries if transboundary challenges are to be effectively overcome in the future. This, in essence, is the philosophy which guides our approach to relations with the Republics of the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine.</P>
    <P>The Agreements with Ukraine and Russia were signed in June 1994; with Moldova in November 1994 and with Belarus in March 1995.  Agreements with Kazakhstan and Kyrgystan in Central Asia were signed in January and March last year, and with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, in the Caucasus region, in April this year.  It is the aim of the European Union, circumstances permitting, to conclude PCAs &mdash; as they are called &mdash; with all of the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union in due course.  An agreement is currently under negotiation with Uzbekistan.</P>
    <P>The PCAs are founded on respect for human rights and democratic principles as essential elements in the partner countries' relations with the European Union.  They are intended to provide a framework for political dialogue, to promote trade, investment and economic relations, to provide a basis for co-operation in various fields and to consolidate democracy and economic transition.</P>
    <P>The Agreements are designed to assist actively the reform process in the countries concerned.  The economic aspects, however, also have a political dimension.  There is a close relationship between economic prosperity and political stability in this context, and many of the problems of the region &mdash; for example, the problems of minorities &mdash; will prove far more difficult to resolve without economic growth to change their context and to underpin solutions.</P>
    <P>However, the agreements do not rely solely on an economic underpinning of reform for their political effectiveness &mdash; they include specific arrangements <Col N="1234" /> for political dialogue.  This process is also intended to contribute to strengthening the relations of these countries with the wider community of democratic nations as a whole, from which they had been cut off for so long.  The dialogue is also intended to bring about a convergence of positions between the dialogue partners on international issues of mutual concern.</P>
    <P>Co-operation in the areas of strengthening stability and security in Europe, observance of the principles of democracy, respect and promotion of human rights, particularly those of persons belonging to minorities, are identified as priorities.  The dialogue provisions of some of the agreements foresee the possibility of dialogue taking place on a regional basis, with a view to contributing towards a resolution of regional conflicts and tensions.  This is intended to signal to these partners that political dialogue with the EU should not be seen as a substitute for their own efforts to solve regional problems with their neighbours.  The dialogue would take place at ministerial, senior official and expert levels, and there is provision for co-operation of national parliaments with the European Parliament.  In addition, in the case of Russia, consultations shall take place in principle twice a year between the Presidents of the Council and the Commission, on the one hand, and the President of Russia, on the other.  Similar arrangements are provided for in the case of Ukraine.</P>
    <P>Respect for democracy and principles of international law as defined by the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, and the Charter of Paris for a new Europe are essential elements of the Agreements.  Such provisions are a standard feature of all agreements between the EU and its OSCE partners.  I would like to underline the importance which the EU, including Ireland, attach to these elements.  There is provision in each of the Agreements for their suspension if their terms are breached.</P>
    <P>The countries to which these Agreements relate are in the process of rapid and fundamental political and economic <Col N="1235" /> change.  Their economic and political development had been stunted over a long period by totalitarianism.  It should not surprise us, therefore, to find weaknesses and faults in the political and legal systems in many of them.  Specific policies of the previous regimes have combined with historical tensions and rivalries &mdash; both within and between individual states &mdash; which the normal democratic process was not available to help resolve.  This has meant that many latent conflicts and tensions have now come to the surface.  Many of them involve also serious human rights abuses.</P>
    <P>These conflicts &mdash; such as those in Chechnya, Nagorno-Karabakh and elsewhere &mdash; continue to be of serious concern to us, and the EU continues to work, bilaterally and through the OSCE or other fora, to seek solutions to them. What these Agreements do is to establish a partnership with the EU wherein a range of problems can be addressed, where the EU approach can be made known and assistance offered in seeking solutions.  On the EU side, we must recognise that resolving these problems will take time and that we must, while seeking to promote our own standards, be prepared to make a long-term commitment to dialogue with the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>The PCAs are broadly similar in structure and content but are tailored individually to meet the particular circumstances of each country.  It is of particular interest to us in Ireland that the Agreements with Ukraine includes particular provisions regarding nuclear safety.  In this connection, the recent Nuclear Safety and Security Summit in Moscow held by the G-7 countries, together with Russia, was an encouraging step in this direction.  The countries that took part in the summit have committed themselves to working together to ensure the safety of nuclear power and to promote greater security for nuclear material.  The summit communiqué recognises, <i>inter alia,</i> that all states have a legitimate concern that <Col N="1236" /> nuclear power is managed safely everywhere.  The summit agreed a programme for preventing and combating ilicit trafficking in nuclear material.  This programme aims to ensure increased co-operation among their governments in all aspects of prevention, detection, exchange of information, investigation and prosecution in cases of illicit nuclear trafficking.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Agreement with Ukraine commit the parties to co-operate, including in international fora, in addressing the problems that have arisen as a consequence of the Chernobyl disaster.  Such co-operation shall address efforts in combating the radioactive contamination of air, soil and water; medical problems related to the impact of nuclear accidents on the public health; monitoring and supervising the radioactive condition of the environment; and training in the area of preventing nuclear accidents.</P>
    <P>The parties to the PCAs grant each other most favoured nation status. Trade is to be free of quantitative restrictions, with certain exceptions, and discriminatory practices are banned.  A safeguard clause is included, however, which may be invoked in the event of increased quantities of imports causing or threatening to cause substantial commercial injury.  There is also provision for negotiations on anti-dumping measures.</P>
    <P>The Agreements contain provisions relating to labour conditions, conditions of establishment and operation of companies, trade in services, transport, competition, intellectual property and financial and economic co-operation across a wide range of fields.  Provision for co-operation in preventing illegal activities, including money laundering and drugs smuggling is also provided for.  Pending ratification, the trade and economic aspects of the PCAs with Russia and Ukraine are being implemented by means of Interim Agreements concluded between the countries concerned and the European Community.  Similar interim agreements are envisaged in the case of the other countries concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> I have no doubt the Agreements will assist in the further development of trade and economic ties with the countries concerned.  This is, of course, a matter of very great interest to a country such as Ireland, given our high degree of dependency on external trade. The Agreement with Russia recognises that Russia is an economy in transition and that continued progress towards a market economy will be fostered by co-operation.  Since 1990 GDP in Russia has fallen significantly.  Industrial output appears to have halved since January 1992 and inflation has been severe since price controls were lifted in January 1992.</P>
    <P>There have been more encouraging signs recently, however.  According to the OECD economic survey of Russia, published in September 1995, the Russian economy could enter a period of rapid growth if macroeconomic stabilisation is successful and the momentum of liberalisation is maintained.  Some upturn in GDP appears to have begun in the first half of 1995 and may accelerate to annual rates of up to 10 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>Irish exports to the Russian Federation were almost £140 million in 1994 compared with £60 million in 1993. Exports for January to November 1995 reached £200 million.  Beef exports came to over £50 million in 1994 and preliminary indications are that sales were even more buoyant in 1995.  Russia is now our largest non-EU market for Irish beef. The other main exports in 1994 were automatic data processing equipment and metal ores &mdash; Alumina.  Earnings from exports of services have also been very satisfactory and many Irish firms or organisations have successfully won consultancy contracts.  This includes a number operating under the European Union's TACIS programme for technical assistance to the newly independent states in areas such as power generation, training, agricultural development, transport, aviation, software systems and financial/banking services.  Irish <Col N="1238" /> companies have secured valuable technical assistance contracts since the inception of TACIS in 1990.</P>
    <P>The Partnership and Co-operation Agreements now before the House are an important step forward in the European Union's relations with the countries of the former Soviet Union. Through the support which they will provide for the processes of political and economic reform, they will assist in the creation of new relationships based on shared values and on economic prosperity.  I commend the agreements to the House for approval.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Europe Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the House will be aware that, to date, Europe Agreements have been negotiated with nine central and eastern European countries.  These are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania and Bulgaria as well as the three Baltic Republics.  The background to the Europe Agreements lies in the momentous events of 1989. In response to the new situation which emerged following the fall of the Iron Curtain, the European Council in Dublin in April 1990 decided to negotiate wide-ranging association agreements with the countries of the region on the understanding that basic conditions with regard to democratic principles and transition towards a market economy are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The Agreements with Poland and Hungary were approved by the Dáil on 30 October 1992.  The Agreements with Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were approved by the Dáil on 15 June 1994.  These Agreements have been ratified by all the Contracting Parties and are now in effect.  The Europe Agreements with the countries of central and eastern Europe provide a broad and comprehensive framework for relations with the EU. They provide for structured, high level political dialogue, phased movement on an asymmetrical basis towards free trade, and an intensification of economic co-operation geared to the needs <Col N="1239" /> of the reforming economies.  The Agreements have ushered in a new era in relations between the EU and its eastern neighbours.  They have helped stabilise the political and economic situation in the countries of the region and have contributed significantly to the impetus towards economic and political reform.  The Agreements, also, constitute an important element in the new architecture of the Continent and in the movement towards European integration.</P>
    <P>The general structure and content of the Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will be familiar to the House from our previous deliberations on the agreements with the other central and eastern European countries.  I do not propose, therefore, to dwell at length on these features of the Agreements.  The Agreements recall the historic links between the Baltic Republics and the member states of the European Union.  There is a sense of pride shared by all in this House at the position adopted and maintained by Ireland during the years following the annexation of these countries by the former Soviet Union.  That act of annexation was not recognised by the Irish people or its Governments.  I take this opportunity to salute the peoples of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for successfully maintaining their national identities and to congratulate them on the recovery of their national independence.</P>
    <P>The negotiation of the Europe Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania was greatly facilitated by prior conclusion of free trade agreements between these countries and the European Union.  The Europe Agreements are based on the commitment to intensify political and economic liberties and respect for human rights, including the rights of minorities.  The main objectives are the further development of a free trade zone, and the promotion of economic relations and the advancement of economic, financial, cultural and social co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> The Europe Agreements also cover the conditions attached to the movement of workers from the associated countries within the Union.  They provide for non-discrimination for legally employed workers and for the co-ordination of social security systems.  This is the case also with regard to the PCAs with Russia and others of the newly independent states.  As a result of this, extra costs could arise to the Exchequer through the provision of old-age, invalidity and death benefits and for medical care purposes.  It is considered, however, that such costs will be negligible.</P>
    <P>There are also important provisions for political dialogue with the European Union which are intended to ensure increasing co-ordination on international issues.</P>
    <P>The Agreements recognise the wish of the Baltic Republics to participate in the process of European integration, and, in particular, to accede to the European Union.  Ireland's approach to enlargement of the European Union has been set out in detail in the Government's recent White Paper on Foreign Policy.  Ireland welcomes the future enlargement of the Union as an historic opportunity to enhance European stability and confidence.  We have no doubt but that enlargement will provide major economic opportunities, as well as significant political and economic challenges.  We have already seen significant growth in our exports to the countries of central and eastern Europe, notably in manufactured goods and foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The European Council at Copenhagen decided that any European country which meets the required political and economic criteria shall be eligible to join the European Union.  The capacity of the Union to absorb new members is also a consideration in this regard.  The European Council at Essen agreed that the Baltic Republics will be included in the pre-accession strategy for the states of central and eastern Europe once the Europe Agreements are concluded. This strategy lays down a &ldquo;route plan&rdquo; for the central and eastern European countries as they prepare for Union <Col N="1241" /> membership.  Its central component is the progressive preparation of the associated countries for integration into the Internal Market, with flanking policies to promote integration by means of financial assistance, dialogue and co-operation in the areas of common, foreign and security policy, the environment, justice and home affairs, culture, education and training.</P>
    <P>The promotion of co-operation among these countries, their integration into the trans-European networks and the preparation of plans for the development of relations in the agricultural domain are also provided for.  The European Union's PHARE programme is assisting the countries of central and eastern Europe to pursue the pre-accession strategy and some 5,000 million ECU have been allocated to PHARE to date.</P>
    <P>The European Council at Madrid, last December, arrived at a number of important conclusions regarding future enlargement.  Among these was the decision that following the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference which is addressing, <i>inter alia,</i> institutional questions in preparation for an enlarged Union, the Council will, at the earliest opportunity, and following receipt and consideration of the Commission's opinions on the applications, take the necessary steps for launching accession negotiations.  The Council also expressed the hope that the preliminary stage of negotiations with the associated countries of central and eastern Europe will coincide with the start of negotiations with Cyprus and Malta, which are due to open six months following the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The Baltic Republics have made considerable progress in a short time in consolidating democracy and in carrying through structural reforms in their economies.  Rampant inflation has been brought under control and economic growth is now under way.  I am happy to note our trade with the region, while small, is growing; exports to the three countries were worth £14 million in the <Col N="1242" /> ten months of October last year.  Of greater significance, perhaps, is the growth in our exports of services.  The Irish experience in economic development and in institution-building is particularly relevant to the needs of these countries and I am happy to note that Irish consultancies are very active in the region in a number of areas including tourism, civil aviation, telecommunications, rail transport, banking, power industry and management.</P>
    <P>Since signature of the Europe Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in June last year, each of the Baltic Republics has formally submitted an application for membership of the European Union.  These applications have, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union, been referred to the European Commission for its opinion in the usual way.  I have mentioned already, A Leas-Cheann Chomhairle, the pride we feel in the solidarity our people have shown with the Baltic Republics during the long period when they were denied their statehood.  As for the future, we look forward to working closely with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in pursuit of our common goal of European integration and a peaceful and prosperous European continent.</P>
    <P>To this end, I commend the Europe Agreements with the three countries concerned to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for his very detailed account of these agreements. Ten years ago people would not have heard about many of these countries or known where they were except perhaps Lithuania which had a brotherhood in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Community needs to appreciate that these countries have won their independence.  One of my neighbours is a Ukrainian who had been captured at the age of 15 by the Germans in 1941.  He brought his brothers and sisters to Ireland for a short visit and they were fascinated with the number of shops and the goods in them.  They live <Col N="1243" /> on a collective farm and had not been outside the Ukraine before.  He gives them approximately £30 a week but has to bring it himself as otherwise the Government will take 30 per cent from foreign remittances.  We can appreciate how grossly unfair that is because during the 1950s the second largest source of income here was the money sent home in ten shillings and pound notes by emigrants to their families.  We should urge Governments not to tax the remittances sent home by relatives.</P>
    <P>The Ukraine is the largest debtor of the Russian Federation and owes about £6 billion.  The Ukraine exports 35 per cent of its products to Russia.  The Russian Federation pays 74 per cent of the Ukraine's service industry which is mainly for oil and gas exports piped through the Ukraine.  I am worried about falling standards due to cutbacks in the nuclear power industry.  Forty per cent of the Russian Federation's nuclear capacity is in Belarus and the Ukraine. Recent reports from Chernobyl are frightening.  Children from Chernobyl have come to my part of the country due to the dedicated humanitarian work of Adi Roche originally from Clonmel but now living in Cork.  Her work has shown us that whatever pain or ache we have, there are others who are far worse off.  Despite their deformities those children in their short lives will have enjoyed some happiness.  As a result of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster 20 per cent of the land around Belarus is no longer suitable for arable farming and its agricultural export trade has collapsed because of fear of contaminated products.</P>
    <P>The level of nuclear fallout from that disaster ten years ago is still being monitored from Chernobyl to as far as the Wicklow hills, the Comeragh Mountains and Donegal.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is monitoring the level of nuclear fallout in this country, particularly mountain areas to ascertain if the level of radiation is above and acceptable limit.  It is frightening that ten years after the disaster <Col N="1244" /> this country, which is thousands of miles from Chernobyl, could be affected by it. If the European Union does not address this problem, ensures sufficient moneys are allocated to close nuclear reactors as quickly as possible and ensures their safe operation over a short period, the consequences will spell disaster not only for the unfortunate people in areas surrounding those reactors, but for everybody in Eastern Europe.  I hope the Government will insist that the European Union will play a stronger role in observing, supervising and monitoring the safety of nuclear energy plants and that necessary funds will be provided towards that end to protect the long-term future of those countries and member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste did not refer to the safety of the Russian fleet, particularly its nuclear submarine fleet, which I understand poses great danger and is sited in the waters of many Eastern European countries, particularly in Belarus and the Ukraine.  I hope that will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste stated that our increased business with the Russian Federation amounted to £140 million last year.  That increased business is welcome, particularly in the service area where we could be of greater assistance. I condemn the high level of corruption and bribery in the Russian Federation system.  Contractors involved in building projects there must add a minimum of 10 per cent to the estimated cost of a project to cover the cost of paying the Mafia to guarantee the protection of contractors to enable them to complete their work.  The high level of corruption there has resulted in the downfall of many small entrepreneurs who have invested in that country.  Most people who conduct business there hire bodyguards and use their cars during business transactions.  That level of corruption is not good for democracy.  That country is experiencing the extreme negative aspects of democracy, which we are beginning to experience in this country, crime, terrorism, vandalism <Col N="1245" /> and drug trafficking.  Following the collapse of the Soviet regime, the people there immediately experienced those negative aspects of democracy which have led to corruption and the corrupt appear to be winning the battle.  The police and other law enforcement agencies are lower paid under the new regime than previously and do not command the same status while the criminals are better paid.  The European Union, through international policing co-operation, has a role to play in assisting the Russian Federation in addressing the problem of drugs importation from areas by way of various contacts. Not all Russians are involved in drug trafficking, but 12 million Russians who wish to leave are on the move at any one time.  They are not financially well off and may be tempted to smuggle drugs.  I ask the Tánaiste and the Minister of State to ensure that the European Union guarantees the greater protection of its citizens who are providing services in the Russian Federation and other eastern countries.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the enlargement of the European Union.  The only way to achieve world peace is to guard against the growth of two absolute powers which marked the Cold War period. That can be achieved by ensuring that necessary moneys are used to assist democracy.  That is something many people have been prepared to die for and the European Union should be prepared to pay for it.  I appreciate that an injection of money is not the only way that can be achieved.  In one of the elections in the Russian Federation candidates were allowed to spend only $50 on their election campaigns.  That is a very small amount compared to what is spent by candidates in this country on elections.  I am sure the Minister of State would not be embarrassed by the amount of money he would spend in ensuring that the Labour Party is elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>If only £50 could be <Col N="1246" /> spent by each candidate, candidates would have to draw many posters.  It is essential that the European Union should allocate more money to protect the democratic procedure and that we would assist the growing new political parties which have an interest in democracy, about which they learned only recently.  We should fund a training system on electioneering and the party political system in the Russian Federation. I do not suggest that we should impose our political system on it, but such training would give them some idea of how a democratic system work.  The European Union, particularly this member state, could help in that regard.  I hope that money will continue to be allocated to achieve that.  The best way world peace can be achieved is to ensure that countries which have become democratic remain so and that they will become economically viable.  We are assisting that in a practical way, but moneys targeted at political education should also be provided.  The European Union will act as observers in the Russian Federation elections, but it should play a role in advance of them by providing political education.</P>
      <P>My party supports these motions.  The Department of Foreign Affairs, which has a great record abroad in helping the poorer sections of democracies, should provide more in-depth assistance to these countries.  More people should be sent to assist smaller eastern countries. Our concentration in the past has been on sending aid to Africa, but those fledgling democracies are experiencing difficulties and, therefore, the European Union should invest more in political education in those countries.  That would help to achieve political stability which, I hope, will bring about economic stability from which we can all only gain.  Nobody has anything to lose from improved democracy in those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party supports these motions.  Everybody in this House and country favours the strengthening of ties <Col N="1247" /> between the European Union and the former constituent republics of the USSR.</P>
      <P>These proposals must be viewed in distinct categories.  The first one I propose to address is that of the Baltic Republics.  Those republics are undoubtedly much closer to Western Europe than they have been since their establishment as separate states after the First World War.  They are now looking to the European Union, not merely for their economic futures but to secure their political independence from the former Soviet Union.  In that respect, the Government has a somewhat difficult role to play because of our ambivalence on co-operation with common collective security arrangements in the European sphere.  Obviously we will tread very carefully in our dealings with other states which are primarily interested in political, economic and defence security and which wish to join the EU.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the Russian people, through their Government, are concerned that NATO could extend up to their borders and that they would, in effect, find themselves hemmed in on all fronts by an alliance which they would perceive as potentially hostile to them.  By the same token, none of the Baltic republics is in a position to guarantee its own independence or autonomy in the present circumstances and in some cases the presence of a significant Russian minority within those republics gives rise to considerable internal tensions and tension in the relationship between them and Russia.  It is unrealistic to expect the Baltic republics not to want a security umbrella to extend over them, but whether a security umbrella such as NATO can be extended to cover them without creating a source of friction and instability in that area is a matter on which I have an open mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that some new <i>modus vivendi</i> between the West and East has to be arrived at in regard to the Baltic region.  It is interesting that Russia still occupies a portion of the Baltic coast <Col N="1248" /> west of the Baltic republics in the former East Prussia; this piece of land was taken by Russia in the aftermath of the Second World War.  All that area is fraught with difficulties from the point of view of maintaining a satisfactory <i>modus vivendi</i> between the various states.  The European Union should be generous in accommodating the Baltic republics and, if necessary &mdash; short of outright NATO membership &mdash; some degree of security should be afforded to those republics to guarantee their independence, if possible by an arrangement to which Russia is a party rather than one from which it is excluded.</P>
    <P>The debate in Ireland on European security is very stunted and it always concerns the issue of neutrality, whatever that means to the various participants in the debate.  I do not think there is a huge appetite here to join NATO; I have not seen a significant number of people who want to join it.  There is a combination of feelings among people. First, most people would be reluctant to become a member of an alliance which commits them to fight if any of the other members are involved in a war and, second, people are conscious that as a society we are not a significant military element and that to gear up our forces to participate in NATO would involve considerable levels of expenditure which would not be justifiable in modern Irish circumstances.</P>
    <P>We should, therefore, look to the European Union to see how we can play a meaningful role in the common security arrangements of the EU as it develops.  On several occasions I have suggested in the House and elsewhere that Ireland could usefully promote and participate in an EU equivalent of the American coastguard, which is short of a military naval force but which is considerably more sophisticated than the present coastguard arrangements in the EU.  I do not think anyone would object to our participating in a force which would basically police the maritime western fringes of Europe.  I have <Col N="1249" /> always thought that people would participate in such a service if it were established on an EU basis and that Ireland could play a meaningful role in European Union security at that level.  I do not think anyone would object to such a force having facilities in Ireland, provided it was equivalent to the American coastguard and not so much a navy.</P>
    <P>There is a huge need for such a force to prevent smuggling and to deal with international crime at sea, drug trafficking etc.  There is also need for Ireland to participate in an effective policing system for fisheries policy, environmental matters, maritime law etc.  This service could include a sophisticated European Union maritime rescue element in which we could participate.  I believe most people would regard this as a fair basis on which Ireland could make a contribution and co-operate with other member states of the EU in doing something which, while military in one sense, would be short of an outright military alliance of the NATO type.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the various states in the former USSR, other than the Baltic republics, with which these motions are concerned.  It is in the interests of the European Union that these states, in so far as they want to maintain a separate existence from Russia, are encouraged to do so by deepening their economic relationship with the European Union. It is worth noting that already the relationship between the Ukraine, Moscow and Belarus is changing.  However, it is not entirely beyond the bounds of possibility that there will be a political upheaval in Moscow in the near future in which the communist party will regain power.  Regardless of whether the threat comes from the left or right in Russian politics, it is by no means beyond the bounds of possibility that adventurism towards re-establishing the substance of the Soviet Union be on the horizon within a number of years.  The best way of ensuring that there is no temptation to go down that road and to safeguard those people who might fall victims to such an expansionist viewpoint is to deepen economic and trading <Col N="1250" /> ties between those republics and the European Union.</P>
    <P>These motions are timely.  Ireland should be seen to give enthusiastic support to deepening and extending the relationship between the European Union and the republics which are the subject matters of these agreements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with the present fad for political correctness and because we have nonsensical legislation in place I declare an interest in this matter, having been involved in an advisory capacity in various PHARE and TACIS programmes covered by these agreements.  I have no trouble in saying that. The reason I am involved in these programmes is that I have a deep interest in these countries.  That leads me to welcome these Agreements.  I do not make that statement because of any consideration of &ldquo;the other way around&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not flagellation but simply a comment on the stupidity of some of the politically correct fads which pale into insignificance beside the problems these Agreements are intended to deal with.</P>
      <P>I am delighted we have a motion to ratify them.  They have been concluded for some time, but cannot come into operation until they have been ratified by the national parliaments of member states and the European Parliament.  I do not know why it has taken so long to get around to ratifying them, but I will not be begrudging because there are provisions to make the arrangements work on an interim basis pending ratification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission in Brussels deserves a great deal of congratulation for the way it went about constructing these Agreements.  I know that the Council of <Col N="1251" /> Ministers and the European Parliament have been involved, but it was the Commission which did the ground work with a good deal of imagination and flexibility, given the very difficult and varying situations in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>In various contexts, both political and otherwise, I have had the opportunity of visiting many of them and being involved in discussions on economic, trade and political matters.  The variety of problems which have to be dealt with is astonishing.  It would do us well to reflect on their concerns which are very well addressed by these Agreements.</P>
    <P>There are concerns about security and stability.  I agree entirely with everything Deputy McDowell said, particularly his remarks about security.  It would do us good to look at the security problem through central and eastern European eyes occassionally when we would see how much of our traditional position is rather futile mythology.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great satisfaction that there are provisions in these Agreements which insist on human and political rights in these countries.  There are grounds to fear that previous injustices may be followed by new injustices.  In Estonia, for example, almost 30 per cent of the population is of Russian origin. The Estonians, who feel justifiably angry at how they were oppressed and exploited for many years by the former Soviet regime, are now in danger of perpetrating an injustice on people of Russian nationality who live there.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are involved in any way in these discussions &mdash; we are, probably, in a good position to do this &mdash; should make the point that one discrimination can never wipe out the effects of a previous one and that it is wrong to repeat the sins perpetrated by those who have gone before.  The Agreements insist on the maintenance of and adherence to democratic principles and human rights.  That is a very important provision.</P>
    <P>In many of the countries covered by these Agreements and arrangements <Col N="1252" /> there are still only the very beginnings of what we might call a normal political party system.  If one looks at the political systems of many of these countries, one will find that there is a very high degree of fragmentation in politics.  In some cases one will find one large party and a number of smaller parties and in others a multiplicity of small parties. This creates tensions.  In some cases one will find that the largest party, which may not be very large in overall terms, derives from the previous Communist Party and that they have not lost all the habits of the former regimes.</P>
    <P>Although there is in some places the appearance of multi-party democratic parliaments the actual operation of the system is not anything like what it appears on the surface.  For this reason the close involvement and support offered by the European Union, through these Agreements, for political development is an essential component in helping the people of these countries to realise what their liberation from former Soviet rule really means and can bring to them.</P>
    <P>All of them are still going through a process of shake down where what one might call the long-term lines of their political systems and ideological divisions have not yet emerged and there is a certain degree of fluidity.  This is a period of some delicacy and danger.  The more assistance that can be given to avoid the traps and pitfalls inherent in such a system the better.  This means, very often, that we should talk to people in these countries, be involved with them a great deal and, whatever their political inclination, help them to see how they can make a multi-party democratic system work.  Not all of these states are yet out of the woods.</P>
    <P>On the economic front they face a similar and, very often, bewildering array of problems.  The shock of transition has been enormous.  There are, of course, the wry jokes that one associates with some countries in Eastern Europe. In Hungary, for example, one of the jokes asks what is worse than communism, to which the answer is whatever <Col N="1253" /> comes after it.  In many ways, one cannot blame people because certainty has been replaced by uncertainty which is usually accompanied for some period by rapidly rising prices, both in nominal and real terms, decline in living standards and the emergence of unemployment, about which they knew nothing as the system was designed to mask substantial levels of unemployment or under employment.</P>
    <P>It is a totally new system for many people involved in productive enterprises in these countries to have to find out what a market is and make decisions about what can be produced economically.  It is a totally new science to find a customer for what is produced. Many of these countries are still very far away from having in place the normal systems of market channels to which we are all accustomed.  In many of them the credit system is rudimentary at best and has been marked in the years since liberation by a succession of bank failures which have tended at times to give the market economy a bad name.</P>
    <P>These agreements should give us cause to reflect in another way.  When looking at the possible enlargement of the EU we are quick to identify competition difficulties which may arise &mdash; how many of us have heard that Polish, Czech or Hungarian agriculture will pose a threat?  That is a blinkered view &mdash; we should be looking at the possible emergence of a set of new, vibrant market economies in central and eastern Europe which will add to the economic space of the EU in a way which will benefit all and we should direct our efforts and policies to helping them emerge.  On a visit here last year, the Hungarian President said we should not worry about Hungary being competition for Ireland because it will be a market for us for many years to come.  His approach, the same as that set out in these agreements, is far more constructive than the defensive reflex we have adopted up to now.</P>
    <P>Finally, we should be conscious of one particularly delicate element of this EU enterprise.  We should ensure the <Col N="1254" /> peoples of the countries involved in these agreements do not have reason to believe we are treating them as a political, economic and sociological laboratory.  We should not preach, we should assist and that is what these agreements are designed to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  These eastern European countries have a difficulty which is not fully appreciated in the west.  To date, additional member states which have joined the EU such as Austria, Sweden and Finland have been well prepared and economically sound. We are now anticipating the membership of six eastern European countries and possibly the three Baltic states, as referred to in some detail in the Minister's speech.  Other countries, whether small like Cyprus and Malta or large like Turkey, are also considering joining the EU.  As the living standards in the nine countries under discussion are so much lower than any country currently in the EU, tremendous financial strain will be put on the Union's budget over a long number of years if their membership is accepted.  I ask the Tánaiste to provide an approximate timescale for when these countries will join the EU and to outline the financial consequences of their membership, not alone in respect of those countries but also for Ireland.  We will obviously benefit much less than we have to date but we must be given a realistic assessment of the position.  I have asked questions about this matter in the House but I have not received an exact or even an approximate reply.  It is time that the implications of these countries joining the EU was spelt out; I do not oppose their membership but we are entitled to an assessment of what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association and co-operation agreements with Russia, the Ukraine and the other independent republics are welcome.  If anything, western Europe, the US and Japan have been negligent in supporting these countries financially. It is in everyone's interest that democracy is made to work in those countries <Col N="1255" /> because if it does not they will slide back into communism or, worse still, a more militant form of dictatorship.  We can all see this trend.  The Communist party is favourite to win the Russian elections and people like Mr. Zhiranovsky also have considerable support. They have painted a drastic picture of what they will do if they regain power.</P>
    <P>There are 78 republics within the Russian Federation and events like the Chechen conflict have drawn our attention to countries which we did not know existed.  Chechnya and the surrounding countries were barely, if ever, heard of previously.  The political situation in Russia and some of the other countries mentioned in these agreements is so fluid it is frightening.  When President Yeltsin uses the Chechen war as an election platform, or threatens to expel British diplomats for spying in what some feel is a bogus effort to boost his election chances, one sees how fragile the system is.</P>
    <P>I would have thought western countries would have gone out of their way to invest heavily in eastern Europe, to ensure political stability and to safeguard democracy for the future but that has not happened sufficiently.  Anyone who has been to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic &mdash; which are better off than most of the countries under discussion &mdash; knows that their infrastructure and standard of living is far short of anything in the EU.  Western investment is, therefore, essential.  Co-operation and partnership are fine but the practical day-to-day details of running a country are far more important.  If people are hungry and fed up with a democratic system, I fear they will revert to something more radical.</P>
    <P>The Ukraine and Russia have a substantial amount of nuclear materials and it is worrying to read that individuals are smuggling them out and selling them illegally, to get western currency in exchange for weapons of war.  The Indonesian navy's complement of ships and submarines is almost totally made up of military hardware purchased from <Col N="1256" /> countries in the former Soviet Union, primarily the Ukraine.</P>
    <P>Another alarming development is the gangsterism which has evolved in Russia and has not simply remained there but spread to countries in western Europe. Gambling, prostitution and drug trafficking in many German cities, such as Frankfurt and Berlin, have been taken over by Russian gangsters.  It is very disturbing that there are elements out of control in Eastern Europe, particularly Russia.  Our democratic system seems unable to combat that.  The West has not done enough.  I know the amounts of money required are very large but we should try a little harder.  There are not enough people in the West prepared to make the necessary sacrifices to maintain democracy in these countries.</P>

      <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I welcome the motions on the Agreements moved in the House this morning by the Tánaiste.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell will reply.  Many of the states involved in these Agreements have been in touch with me, either through discussions with members of my Committee or through their embassies and aspire to become members of the European Union.</P>
      <P>A new situation arose on the dissolution of the USSR.  The European Union is very concerned to support the political and economic reform process in these emerging independent states. This is a responsibility of the European Union in the context of its commitment to enlargement, although enlargement will have financial consequences for us. If we agree with the concept of the European Union, we must have trade agreements with these countries in the interim before their full membership. That will allow them to converge with EU policy and have trade and economic relations with the EU in preparation for full membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also chapters in the Agreements dealing with political dialogue which set out the general objective of <Col N="1257" /> that dialogue, which is to strengthen links with the European Union. Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs were extremely concerned when they visited Lithuania, one of the Baltic states, to learn it came under attack a few years ago.  The attack focused on the House of Parliament, which was the most obvious sign of democracy in the city.  Twelve people lost their lives in what was intended to be a military coup.  Tanks rumbled down the streets again, there was an assault on the parliament building, the television station and other key installations.</P>
    <P>These states want to have relations with the European Union and to have agreements which will assist their democratic and political progress.  They want to participate in all aspects of the Union and to be involved in the area of common defence and security, which is very important for them.  In addition, they want to be part of the whole concept of European trading.  I was pleased to note that in many of the debates we had with them they did not express any interest in competing for funds under existing agricultural policies, because some of them already have efficient and low cost agricultural operations.  The Scandinavians found the terms of the Common Agricultural Policy more restrictive than their Governments' policies.  We have an obligation, as members of the Union &mdash; and my Committee also feels this obligation &mdash; to welcome this development which is being endorsed by the House.</P>
    <P>The common goal of these central and eastern European states is membership of the European Union.  The nine states which have already applied are Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and the Czech Republic.  From our discussions with some of these states, either at ambassador or parliamentary delegation level, it seems quite a number of them have achieved the economic status required for membership of the Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> The European Council concluded in Copenhagen that these countries shall become members as soon as they are able to assume the obligations of membership.  The Commission and the Council of Ministers have decided the processing of the applications from Malta and Cyprus will start immediately after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference.  I presume all other negotiations will not await the conclusion of those negotiations, and that as soon as the requirements for membership have been complied with we will initiate the process of expanding and enlarging Europe.</P>
    <P>At all our committee meetings we are concerned with the implications of enlargement because we are net beneficiaries at the moment.  However, we had a meeting yesterday with the budgetary committee of the European Parliament, which came to seek the approval of our Parliament for a redistribution by returning funds to the member states because they have a surplus of 11.5 billion ECUs.  The states which are major contributors to the fund want to get this money back whereas other members would like it to be channelled into areas of need.</P>
    <P>We have various areas of need and I reminded the delegation of the problems with regard to flood relief, which they conceded, and the range of problems which arise for our beef sector because of a problem in another member state.  Funds will have to be made available to maintain the income of existing member states' farmers and producers.  The 11.5 billion ecus could be used for that.  There is a further 1.5 billion ecus in the social fund.  The Government and the House need to know about these areas and the plans of our Departments to ensure the maximum amount of funds available to us is drawn down.  That is a problem for the existing members.</P>
    <P>I support the concept of these Agreements.  Lobbying by these states gave us some cause for concern that delay in finalising them was creating instability in the various countries.  It is important, <Col N="1259" /> particularly before the elections take place in Russia, for them to realise there is a commitment from us, as members of the European Union and co-signatories of these Agreements, to finalising our own affairs.  I fully support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this debate and will reply to the points that have been made.  In the context of the preparations for our Presidency of the European Union, the Government has identified the further development of the Union's relations with the associated countries, and with regions outside the Union generally, as being among the areas which are likely to be the main focus for the Union during our term in office.</P>
      <P>The ratification of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreements with Russia, Ukraine and the other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, and of the Europe Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, will be a major step forward in this regard. The importance of the Agreements in terms of the overall efforts of the Union to support the processes of political and economic reform among the countries of central and eastern Europe has been set out.  The House is aware of the significance attaching to the Agreements in helping to ensure that peace and prosperity, founded on democracy and respect for human rights, shall prevail in Europe and among the European Union's partner countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As set out in the Government's recent White Paper on Foreign Policy, Ireland recognises that the process of change in Russia over the past decade has been fundamental.  We consider, and this is central to the Union's approach to future relations with Russia, that the reform process should continue to receive our support.  Our policy is based on the recognition that Russia should not feel marginalised by the West and that relations with Russia and the other <Col N="1260" /> countries of the region should be based on partnership, not confrontation.</P>
    <P>This partnership approach, and practical co-operation in furthering the political and economic process of transformation in Russia and among the other newly independent states, is the essence of what is envisaged in the partnership and co-operation Agreements. If we truly wish, in a spirit of solidarity as well as of self-interest, to achieve the goals of peace and stability based on the fundamental humanitarian precepts which we have adopted, there is no alternative starting point for the development of our relations with the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>Ireland has its own role to play in this. During our Presidency we will be encouraging those member states which have not ratified the Agreements to do so.  We will be chairing the many working groups and committees dealing with the EU's policy in all its aspects towards these countries.  We will ensure that the work of the EU in this area is given the priority it deserves.  We will be watching closely, on behalf of the Union, developments in the region.  With regard to Russia, for example, last Monday the EU adopted an action plan to give practical effect to the strategy agreed by Foreign Ministers in November 1995. The strategy sets out the framework within which EU policy operates in its relations with Russia, outlines the principles of that policy and prescribes the elements which a common approach to the conduct of EU-Russian relations should include in the areas of democratic reform, European security, external relations and economic reform. Implementation of that plan will be an important focus of our Presidency.  We do not propose, however, to neglect other areas of the region, and will be particularly mindful of the conflict situations there.  The situation in Chechnya is important in this regard.</P>
    <P>In all of our efforts in this context, we will be very much aware that we are to a large extent breaking new ground. There has been enormous change over a very short period of time.  Who among <Col N="1261" /> us would have thought a few short years ago that we would now be in the middle of a genuine presidential election campaign in Russia?  Much still remains to be done, but the reform process is under way in all of these countries, and these agreements will serve both to provide further impetus to reform and to support and enhance those reforms already under way.</P>
    <P>A future enlargement of the European Union, and the many complex issues associated with it, will be a major focus of our Presidency.  The associated countries of central and eastern Europe, including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, see membership of the Union as the key to consolidating the hard won results of democratic reform, of accelerating their economic development and, most importantly, as enhancing their security.</P>
    <P>The challenges facing the associated countries as they seek to deepen economic and political reform are enormous. Huge progress has been made in a short period of time, and the pre-accession strategy laid down for them by the European Council meeting at Essen provides an important route map as they proceed towards greater integration with the Union.</P>
    <P>The Baltic Republics enjoy an historic relationship with the countries of the European Union and their proper place lies in co-operation and integration within the new Europe.  In this connection, the Government is gratified at the welcome accorded by the Heads of Government of countries in the wider Baltic region, including Russia, at their meeting in Visby in Sweden earlier this month, to the EU's Baltic Sea Region Initiative.  The initiative was prepared by the European Commission at the request of the European Council and was introduced at Visby by Commission President Santer.  The initiative aims at promoting the region as an area where co-operation, democracy and market economy prevail.  Among the topics to be included in action programmes which will be further elaborated are support for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in their preparation for membership of the <Col N="1262" /> European Union and in their preparations, together with Russia, for membership of the World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of regional co-operation is a major aim of the Europe agreements and of the PCAs.  The Government considers that such initiatives will play an important role in the continued progress of political and economic reform among the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>Our Presidency priorities also include such areas as the fight against crime and, in particular, against drugs.  Both in the partnership and co-operation agreements and the Europe agreements under discussion contain provision for increased co-operation between the Union and parties of the agreements.  In addition to drugs, money laundering and other forms of crime, including arms smuggling and illegal immigration, are addressed with a view to enhanced co-operation in measures to counter them.</P>
    <P>Control of drug trafficking in a two-way process.  We in the European Union countries must do all in our power to reduce demand and convince our young people that drugs involve not glamour but misery, crime, squalor and death.  At the same time, we must engage with countries which are a source of channel for drugs or their precursors and co-operate with them in controlling the gangs which are behind the traffic.  The drug traffic, and the violence and corruption which goes with it, is highly destructive of civil society, especially in emerging democracies.  It is in all our interests to secure the greatest possible measure of mutual assistance and co-operation to control this scourge.</P>
    <P>The Presidency offers an opportunity to promote joint action and co-operation in the European Union to alleviate the scourge of drug trafficking and drug abuse.  The Government is at the moment considering initiatives it might take.  There are, of course, two aspects to the drug problem - demand and supply.  Efforts have to be directed at both. Addicts must be treated to wean them <Col N="1263" /> off their dependence.  Steps must be taken to eliminate the kind of social conditions that promote the drug culture.</P>
    <P>We do not have so much a law problem as an order problem.  We need to approach it on two fronts.  We must deal severely with the criminals and reawaken in this House and in the country a sense of social justice.  We have become like wets, afraid to mention the term &ldquo;social justice&rdquo;.  What brought most of us into politics was the need to change society.  However, we are now accepting conditions, especially the housing conditions in which people live. There is an absence of estate management and access to third level education &mdash; the rate of access is only 15 per cent for most inner city dwellers.  We also need to reawaken a sense of social justice in the emerging democracies.  It would help us to deal with the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>In all these areas there are useful programmes and useful forms of co-operation that the European Union can assist with.  The provisions contained in the Agreements now before the House will provide an important element in the international effort to combat drugs trafficking.  In approving the terms of these Europe Agreements and Partnership and Co-operation Agreements, the House will be bringing the EU a step closer to the goal of a Europe in which the divisions of the past will gradually diminish in importance.</P>
    <P>When implemented, the Agreements will permit the creation of a true partnership between the EU and the countries concerned.  It will allow the EU to bring to bear on the political and economic situations in those countries its not inconsiderable resources, thereby assisting the reform process in which these states themselves are already engaged. It will not of itself solve all their problems, but it will provide the long-term structure necessary for so doing.  It will go a long way towards creating conditions of economic prosperity and democracy without which long-term <Col N="1264" /> regional peace and stability would not be possible.  Finally, it will secure the future of all the countries of the Continent as members of the one European family of nations.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly deal with a couple of points raised.  Deputies McDowell and Dukes raised the issue of the security concerns of the Baltic states and Russia. Ireland understands and fully respects the wishes of the countries of central and eastern Europe who wish to join NATO and the EU at the earliest possible date.  The right of sovereign states to choose their security and defence arrangements is an important principle recognised by the UN and the OSCE. Our position is that any enlargement of existing security organisations should enhance security in Europe, be responsive to the security concerns of all states and should not result in the creation of new dividing lines in Europe.</P>
    <P>We recognise that Russia has legitimate security interests which must be respected.  In the OSCE, Ireland and our EU partners work closely with Russia to develop this key pan-European forum.  Russia has also been welcomed into the Council of Europe.  All these developments illustrate that the countries of Europe are committed to building relations of mutual respect and maximum co-operation with Russia. With regard to the Deputy's comments on Irish participation in European security arrangements, Ireland will adopt a broad and comprehensive approach to this debate at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern was concerned about the statehood of newly independent states.  The matter of the Baltics, in particular, was raised.  I am aware of minority problems in these countries as elsewhere.  There are a number of structures in place &mdash; for instance.  OSCE missions in these countries to assist in reducing tensions.  The EU has encouraged negotiated settlement of outstanding difficulties in a democratic and peaceful way.  Deputy Davern also mentioned training in democracy in these <Col N="1265" /> countries.  I very much support that concept.  There are a number of programmes in place to assist democratisation &mdash; for example, the EU Tacis Democracy Programme and the work of the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights &mdash; ODIHR &mdash; as well as a number of programmes of the Council of Europe.  Deputy McDowell mentioned the independence of the former Soviet states.  The PCAs will help to strengthen that independence.</P>
    <P>Deputies Deasy and Ferris raised the question of enlargement.  It is time we dealt with this issue in a more open way. We need enlargement for two reasons: first, for selfless reasons &mdash; we must help emerging democracies and show them there is a target which they can achieve; and, second, for selfish reasons.  The only reason Western Europe is experiencing prosperity &mdash; Ireland is approaching 90 per cent of average <i>per capita</i> GNP of the 15 wealthiest states in Europe &mdash; is that there has been peace and stability on the Continent since the creation of the European coal and Steel Community.  In the early part of this century there were two world wars in Europe.  So far this century 190 million people lost their lives in conflict, 60 million of them in Europe.  The European Union is about peace and stability. Without peace and stability we could not have prosperity and our children would be at war.</P>
    <P>For selfish reasons we need enlargement, and that will take place.  Six months after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will open with Malta and Cyprus and thereafter with some of the central European states, probably Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The Nordic countries will then ask about the Baltics.  Shortly after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference the European Commission will present the Union with a report on the consequences of enlargement.  There will be challenges in terms of Structural Funds and cohesion countries will be very wealthy compared to some of the <Col N="1266" /> applicant states.  There will also be challenges to the common policies, particularly the Common Agricultural Policy, but these challenges are open to negotiation.  We are in the driving seat and changes cannot be made without agreement.  There is an opportunity for us, in a very peaceful way, to negotiate enlargement of the Union with all the implications that involves.  It is a great challenge, but we should look at it as a great opportunity.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Criminal Law Bill, 1996, is to provide for the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.  That distinction marked the original approach to the classification of offences, felonies being the graver class and misdemeanours the less grave class of offences.  The distinction has been eroded over many years and in today's conditions has no real relevance.  Today, for example, serious offences such as <Col N="1267" /> fraudulent conversion, obtaining property by false pretences and some sexual offences are classified as misdemeanours.  This classification would suggest, for example, that fraudulent conversion is a misdemeanour, regardless of the amount involved, whereas stealing a penny is a felony.</P>
    <P>The distinction also gives rise to a number of unnecessary complications and anomalies in the law.  Certain statutory provisions and common law rules depend on the continuing distinction between those two classes of offences. The Bill is for the most part comprised of provisions that are consequential on the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and related matters.  It provides that in general the law and practice for misdemeanours before the commencement of the Bill will apply to all offences.  The abolition of the distinction is also a very positive step as it provides the opportunity to amend and restate the law in a modern form.  It is, therefore, a progressive reform.  It means that a considerable number of older enactments can be repealed or, in some cases, simplified.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that there is a long history to the preparation of the Bill.  In England and Wales, the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours was given effect by the Criminal Law Act, 1967.  In this jurisdiction, work proceeded almost simultaneously on the same task &mdash; it was of course substantially the same law that was being reformed in both jurisdictions.  The Criminal Justice Bill, 1967, which contained those proposals lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil of the time and it is only now that the proposals carried in today's Bill are being proceeded with.  Deputies will be aware that other key proposals contained in the 1967 Bill have since been enacted. The intervening years represent a highly unusual delay in bringing forward reform in this area of the law and I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity to influence and advance this much demanded and necessary reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> I think we would all agree that the criminal law must be more relevant and responsive to modern day crime.  This Bill, by modernising and clarifying the law in key respects such as in relation to the powers of arrest, is a very significant advance in that regard.  I might also mention that I obtained Government approval last month for my proposals for a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  It will contain provisions for a more effective and efficient use of Garda time and resources and other proposals for reform of procedure in criminal cases.  Both of these Bills are key elements of a comprehensive programme of legislative reform that I have undertaken to modernise and codify important areas of the criminal law.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill is at Committee Stage in the House. Other legislative measures which are at an advanced stage include a Non-fatal Offences Against the Person Bill, a Juvenile Justice Bill and a Criminal Justice (Insanity) Bill.  I have also done a substantial amount of work on proposals for fundamental legislative reform in the area of fraud.  In addition, I am at present consulting with my colleagues on comprehensive proposals to deal with the problem of offending while on bail.</P>
    <P>These reforms, which were set out in my criminal justice plans announced on 30 January last, form part of my law and order response to today's crimes.  In this connection there has been some comment in the media and elsewhere about the worrying development of gangland style murders or professional killings by so-called &ldquo;hit men&rdquo;.  Murder is murder whether it occurs in the context of a family dispute or whether it is a cold-blooded killing carried out by a professional assassin.  The authorities are often depicted as powerless to respond to these sinister gangland murders.  The reality is that they must be dealt with in accordance with the rule of law and comments which characterise the authorities as powerless ignore the seriousness with which this Government is responding to developments and trends <Col N="1269" /> in modern day crime.  My law and order response is comprehensive and far-reaching.  It includes making available additional prison places, improvement of Garda structures, reform of the courts and putting in place meaningful legislative changes to our criminal justice system.  This response is geared to tackling crime of all description whether it is so-called gangland murder or serious crime in rural areas.  Considered reform of the law within constitutional precepts that is aimed at standing the test of time, not quick-fix solutions, is the most appropriate and long-lasting response to developments in crime patterns.  That is the course I am following.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the individual provisions of the Bill.  Section 3, the pivotal provision' abolishes all distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours.  It provides that the law and practice in relation to offences shall be that applicable to misdemeanours.  In my opening remarks I explained how the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, which was originally a distinction between serious and minor offences, has become blurred over the years.  So, as a consequence of abolishing the distinction, the law needs to be updated and in some cases restated.</P>
    <P>At present there is a power of arrest without warrant at common law in respect of felonies.  No such power exists in relation to misdemeanours.  As a result, it is necessary to obtain an arrest warrant in respect of a number of serious offences which are classified at present as misdemeanours, such as fraudulent conversion, obtaining property by false pretences and some sexual offences.</P>
    <P>Because it is now proposed to abolish all distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours, section 2 will put in place a new category of arrestable offence which will comprehend most felonies and the more serious misdemeanours.  An offence that is punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty, including an attempt to commit such an <Col N="1270" /> offence, will be an arrestable offence for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For the most part the Bill restates and clarifies the existing law relating to arrest.  The fact is that practically all present felonies come within the new arrestable offence category as nearly all of them are punishable with maximum sentences of at least five years imprisonment.  The only substantive change is that the new category of arrestable offence extends the power of arrest without warrant to include some of the more serious misdemeanours.  These are misdemeanours which at present carry a penalty of at least five years imprisonment.  I am satisfied that this change makes the law relating to arrest much more relevant and effective as the new powers will now be related to the seriousness of the offence in question as determined by the penalty that may be imposed for the commission of that offence.  That this is the most appropriate test is self-evident.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for an effective power of arrest without warrant.  It would be hard to justify in today's conditions the retention as part of our criminal justice system of the requirement that arrest for the commission of some serious offences can be effected only on foot of a warrant while other equally serious offences do not necessitate obtaining a warrant.  I am satisfied the criterion of a penalty of at least five years imprisonment is an appropriate and proportionate indication of what constitutes a serious offence.</P>
    <P>The definition of arrestable offence is the same category of offence referred to in section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 in respect of which the provisions of that Act relating to periods of detention in Garda custody apply.  It is no coincidence that the new arrest provisions before the House today and the provisions of the 1984 Act have a common reference point in terms of the seriousness of offences to which both provisions relate.  This represents an important step in the codification of our criminal law.  It is desirable that the law in relation to arrest and the law relating <Col N="1271" /> to Garda procedure after arrest are underpinned by a common reference point in respect of offences committed.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is concerned with the powers of arrest which are exercisable by private citizens and by gardaí.  At present the powers of arrest without warrant are either contained in statutes, of which there are many, or conferred by the common law in respect of felonies.  Statutory powers of arrest are unaffected by the provisions of this Bill.  The section contains powers that correspond to the present common law rules in respect of felonies.  They are exactly the same as the power of arrest conferred by section 19 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 in respect of offences in Northern Ireland and associated offences in the State.</P>
    <P>There is of course a crucial distinction in law between the relative positions of private citizens and gardaí in the matter of arrest.  When a private citizen exercises a power of arrest, it is essential that a felony can actually be proved to have occurred.  If no felony has in fact occurred, the private person will be liable to a civil action.  Therefore, a private person must exercise caution when they decide to exercise a power of arrest.  However, a garda may arrest any person whom he or she reasonably suspects of committing a felony whether or not any offence has actually taken place. The garda is immune under the law from a civil action for damages should the offence not actually have been committed.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to maintain the distinction in law between the powers of arrest of gardaí and the powers of arrest of private persons.  While it is appropriate that private persons should have a power of arrest, and the courts have commended such persons for exercising these powers in particular cases, there is a question of balance here which must be settled in the context of the constitutional right to personal liberty.  It is worth emphasising that the only substantive change proposed in the Bill is <Col N="1272" /> that such powers of arrest without warrant will now extend to a number of serious offences previously classified as misdemeanours.</P>

      <P>The powers of arrest of private persons is in practice of most relevance to store detectives or security personnel who do not and who will not have under this Bill any additional powers at their disposal in the matter of arrest than has any other private person.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides that a member of the Garda Síochána may execute a warrant for the arrest of a person or an order of committal without the need to have the actual warrant or order in his or her physical possession which is what the common law appears to require. There are precedents for this approach contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, as regards arrest on a warrant for failure to surrender to bail and in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, as regards arrest on extradition warrants and I am happy to extend this to cover all arrests on warrants.  I think it is most unsatisfactory that a garda is not generally empowered to arrest a person when he or she knows that a warrant for the arrest of that person has been issued. Nevertheless I consider it to be a prudent safeguard that the warrant or order must be shown to the arrested person on demand as soon as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the powers of entry and of search of premises to effect an arrest for an arrestable offence or on foot of an order of committal.  This power restates in a much clearer way the existing common law rules of entry applicable to felonies which will now apply to arrestable offences as defined <Col N="1273" /> in the Bill.  That the use of force to effect an entry must be reasonable is, I think, a vital qualification of the power; it is an important safeguard for the citizen and a strong direction to the Garda as to the appropriate manner of implementation of this power.  I would stress that the purpose of the power of entry is to effect an arrest.  It does not entitle the Garda to search a premises once they have arrested a suspect.</P>
    <P>The current law varies as to how persons involved in a crime who do not actually carry out the deed are treated depending on whether the offence in question is a felony or a misdemeanour. With regard to felonies, distinctions are made between a principal in the first degree, that is the person who does the act in question, a principal in the second degree, that is a person who aids or abets the commission of the offence by the principal in the first degree and an accessory before the fact, that is a person who counsels or procures the principal in the first degree to commit the offence.  For misdemeanours, there are no such distinctions made and all persons involved are treated alike as the principal offender.  There are no good reasons for maintaining the distinctions in regard to felonies and accordingly section 7 provides that the misdemeanour rule will now apply to all indictable offences so that all of those who aid or abet, counsel or procure the commission of such an offence are treated alike as principal offenders.</P>
    <P>The section also creates a new offence of impeding the apprehension or prosecution of a person who has committed an arrestable offence.  This replaces the common law offence of being an accessory after the fact to a felony.  A scale of penalties for this new offence which are graduated according to the seriousness of the principal offence is set out in the section.  For example, where a person A has committed the arrestable offence of murder, a person B who commits the offence of impeding the apprehension or prosecution of person A, shall be liable on conviction on indictment to <Col N="1274" /> imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.</P>
    <P>Section 8 creates a new offence of concealing an arrestable offence.  This arises from the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.  As a result of abolishing felonies, the old offence of misprision of felony disappears.  The new offence will in effect be one of accepting a bribe not to disclose relevant information to assist the prosecution or conviction of an offender.  The new offence of concealing is similar to the existing offence of compounding a felony with one important difference.  The old offence of compounding a felony also covered any consideration accepted for not disclosing information including consideration consisting of the restitution of or compensation for stolen goods.  Under the section, it will no longer be an offence not to disclose information about an arrestable offence where the loss is made good or compensation is made for it.</P>
    <P>The current rules about alternative verdicts, that is where a person may be found guilty of a less serious offence than that on which he or she has been arraigned, differ as between felonies and misdemeanours.  At present on a charge of felony the accused may be convicted of a less serious felony of which the ingredients are included in the felony charged.  While the same rule applies to misdemeanours, a person charged with a felony cannot be convicted of a misdemeanour except under statute.  As a consequence of the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, section 9 provides for a general rule on alternative verdicts in relation to all indictable offences.</P>
    <P>In addition, I decided that it was prudent to provide in the section for the alternative verdicts which should be open to a jury on a charge of murder lest there be any doubt arising from the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.  The section provides for a limitation on the extent to which a person found not guilty of murder may be found guilty of a lesser <Col N="1275" /> charge.  There is a clear need for certainty as to the verdicts open to the jury in murder cases.  In this connection, I will be publishing a Bill as soon as possible to amend the law on criminal insanity which will involve a further development of the law in respect of alternative verdicts.  The section also make a similar special provision for alternative pleas in respect of an indictment for murder to which section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, relates &mdash; which was formerly referred to as capital murder &mdash; or an attempt to commit such murder.  The section also provides for a general rule for alternative verdicts in relation to all other indictable offences.</P>
    <P>The section restates the law that a person charged with having committed an indictable offence may be convicted of attempting to commit that offence.  It also provides that a person charged with the attempt may be convicted of the attempt even where the person is proven to be guilty of the completed indictable offence.  Although this is a restatement of the present law where the completed offence is a felony, the section clears up uncertainty on the same legal point in respect of misdemeanours by applying the rule to any offence which is an indictable offence.</P>
    <P>Section 10 limits to two years the maximum term of imprisonment to apply in respect of indictable offences where no maximum penalty is provided. A number of obscure and quite minor statutory misdemeanours prescribe no maximum penalty and in theory there is at present no limit to the term of imprisonment that may be imposed.  These offences mostly relate to the making of false statements for the purposes of the particular statute.</P>
    <P>The section gives statutory effect to the existing rule of practice whereby the maximum fine or term of imprisonment for an attempt to commit an indictable offence should not exceed the corresponding punishment for the completed offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> Under common law there is no general power to fine in the case of felonies; that power exists only in relation to misdemeanours.  The Bill confers a general power on a court to fine an offender convicted on indictment except in the case of treason and murder where the sentence is &ldquo;fixed by law&rdquo; as defined in section 2.  The power to fine a person convicted on indictment will be unlimited except where there is a statutory limit on the amount of a fine and the power is also subject to any statutory requirement that the offender be dealt with in a particular way, for example by disqualification.</P>
    <P>Moving away from the provisions of the Bill that relate to the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, I come to deal with a long obsolete area of the law badly needing to be updated.  Penal servitude, which was sentence of imprisonment with compulsory labour, was substituted for transportation in the middle of the last century.  For many years there has been no distinction in the treatment of prisoners sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment.  Imprisonment with hard labour as a form of punishment has fallen into disuse.  Prison divisions &mdash; the placing of prisoners into divisions of varying severity &mdash; no longer applies either.  It is past time that the law was cleared of these outmoded categories of imprisonment and that is the main purpose of section 11.</P>
    <P>The sentence of whipping is available to the courts under statute in respect of males but it is, never used in practice. Whipping of females is prohibited by statute.  The European Court of Human Rights had adjudged the practice of birching to be degrading and contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Accordingly, section 12 abolishes whipping.  There are, and probably always will be, some who consider such punishment should be part of the answer to the problem of crime.  I believe that the answers to crime lie far deeper than this.</P>
    <P>Section 15 mainly enables prosecutions commenced before the coming <Col N="1277" /> into effect of the Bill to be dealt with on the basis of the existing law.  I look forward to hearing colleagues' comments about that.  The procedural provisions of the Bill will apply where the accused is arraigned after the Bill comes into effect.  Where the accused is arraigned in respect of a felony committed before the Bill commences, all the procedural provisions of the Bill relating to trials for a misdemeanour shall apply.  Where an indictment has been framed and signed in accordance with the law existing before the coming into force of the Bill, the accused may only be found guilty of an offence under the previous law.  The particular purpose of this provision is to clarify the position in relation to alternative verdicts.</P>
    <P>Sections 13, 14 and 16 introduce the Schedules to the Act which provide for necessary amendments, modifications and repeals which are in the main consequent on the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>I have put particular emphasis in my speech on the powers of arrest which the Bill provides.  I have no doubt these provisions will attract attention both inside and outside the House.  I stress that essentially these provisions restate and clarify the existing law in those areas.  It is certainly true that these powers will relate to a wider range of offences than heretofore by virtue of the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and by the creation of a new category of arrestable offences.  I am satisfied that where the legislature has decided that an offence can be punished by five years imprisonment or by a more serious penalty, that is the most appropriate test to put in place now as the basis for a modern and effective power of arrest.  It is essential that we put in place a clear and comprehensive legislative framework to provide the gardaí with the necessary powers of arrest.  These powers are a vital support to the work that the gardaí must do in investigating and detecting crime. In relation to these and other matters, I <Col N="1278" /> am satisfied that the Bill achieves a balance between the liberty of the individual and the protection of society from crime.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this House will welcome this Bill.  As legislators, we should endeavour to reform the criminal justice code so as to ensure that it has the relevance and immediacy to accommodate the realities of contemporary crime.  This Bill goes a long way to advance that process of modernisation and reform.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice should be congratulated for assembling, after a period of protracted procrastination, a Bill which represents a hitherto unimagined mixture of the unworkable garnished with the unconstitutional.

      <P>No Minister has managed to so comprehensively misunderstand his or her area of responsibility so as to produce a Bill such as this. From its commencement in section 1 to the close of its voluminous Third Schedule it is, in its entirety, an edifice created out of ignorance.</P>
      <P>In the past I have criticised the Minister for failing to introduce legislation where it was needed and for introducing legislation which was a poor copy of Private Members' Bills introduced by Fianna Fáil.  Having seen what she is capable of when left to her own devices, I am forced to the conclusion that having no legislation would be better than what she has introduced.  This ill-considered, half baked jumble which the Minister pleases to call a Bill is proof, if proof were needed, that her policies are capable of leading Ireland triumphantly into the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when the criminal law <Col N="1279" /> needs to be strengthened to deter criminals and assist the gardaí, she has managed to concoct a cocktail that is remarkable, not for its confused and curious inclusions, but for its extraordinary omissions.  The Minister who pioneered the revolving door prison system, to the extent that a clever criminal can now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>Criminal law and procedures cry out for reform, there is unanimity on that issue.  When that is the case, why has the Minister chosen to busy herself, in obscure alterations to the statute law relating to South Australia, infant felons and coinage offences?  This Bill is a crocheted collection of curios behind which the Minister seeks to hide from real issues.  All but the most hardened of criminals will find it extraordinary that the Minister, surfing on the crest of a crime wave, found it expedient to squander her Department's resources contemplating reforms to the Sunday Observance Act, 1964, the Civil Rights of Convicts Act, 1842 and section 700 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1984. Reformists who wish to see the creation of a statutory offence of kidnapping a dog while disguised as a begonia will know that their hour is nigh.  No trivia is too obscure to escape the Minister's detailed consideration in her flight from legislative reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is clearly of the view that when the people of Ireland gather at crossroads and corners, the issues of slave trading, whipping and corrupt practices in public bodies are seldom far from their lips.  These are the matters to <Col N="1280" /> which she has turned her attention.  No doubt the country as a whole will arise and applaud her foresight and vision in bringing about reforms to that more relevant and useful legislation, the Garrotters Act, 1863.  I am forced to ask if this is the end of garrotting as we know it.  The Minister's preoccupation with whipping, garrotting and slave trading in the midst of a crime crisis is commendable.  What would be more commendable would be a similar interest on her part in the issues of bail, court delays and drugs.</P>
    <P>The conscientious criminal must know that in the latter part of the 20th century the Minister's attention is fully focused on white boys rather than white powder.  Had the Minister for Finance walked through the same time warp as the Minister for Justice he would now be contemplating an increase of a farthing on income tax and grappling with the contentious issue of VAT on muskets.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is not to reform the law, it is to feign a veneer or activity behind which the Minister can continue her policy of studied inactivity.  It is consistent with her track record of viewing legislation as an optional extra rather than an essential ingredient of a coherent criminal justice policy.  The Minister continues to be a legislative athlete striving for imperfection and obtaining top marks in the hop, skip and fall contest.  She would be well advised to cease paying hide and seek with the issue of bail.  Since taking office she has alternatively ignored the issue. She announced a referendum, cancelled her announcement, received the report of the Law Reform Commission, produced that report out of a hat on the eve of a debate on Fianna Fáil legislation, considered it, studied it and contemplated it.  That consideration, study and contemplation have been detailed, ongoing, thorough, advanced and very advanced.  The sole theme running through this farce of episodic adjectival evasion has been the absence of action. This Minister has done nothing.  She has <Col N="1281" /> lived up to her political motto &ldquo;expect nothing and I will deliver&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reality is that she has had the Law Reform Commission report long enough to memorise it.</P>

      <P>I believed she was bereft of further adjectives to disguise the monumental sloth which she has brought to bear on this issue until I heard last Sunday of the multifaceted document which she claims to have circulated to the Government.  How many facets does this document have?  Is there a favoured facet?  Is there a Labour facet?  Does Democratic Left have a separate facet or does that party share the Labour facet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In reality, a facet is something the Minister seeks to hide behind when the examination, study, contemplation and consideration have ended.</P>
      <P>We have entered a new phase of prevarication, the facet phase.  The Minister hopes this will lead to the Government doing something.  Last Sunday she stated, &ldquo;I still intend to do something about bail and so do the Government&rdquo;. What is something?  Is &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; one of the facets in the multifaceted document?  Could the Government consider that by doing nothing, it has done something?  The reality is that this Government, 18 months after it entered office, still does not have a policy on bail and never will.  It is paralysed by dissent and the Minister must bear the primary responsibility for this paralysis.  She has failed to bring any coherent proposition to Government and her Cabinet cohorts must also share the blame and shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that Ministers who profess to have an opinion on everything extraneous to their own portfolios invoke the right to silence when the issue of bail arises.  Chief amongst the Trappists of this Government is the <Col N="1282" /> Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  He is the quiet man of the Rainbow, sent out to advance the &ldquo;it's all right, don't worry&rdquo; school of jurisprudence.  In the absence of a policy he pretends that there is no problem.  The sonorous snorings of Rip Van Rabbitte on the issue of criminal law reform have become an anthem in inactivity readily adopted by the Rainbow.  This Marcel Marceau approach to criminal law reform is the best that can be offered by this once angry young man, now retired to comfortable complacency.  Where are the values of the Democratic Left?  The party which the electorate rejected has become the cornerstone of the Government.  To paraphase a well known adage &ldquo;power results in inactivity and absolute power results in absolute inactivity&rdquo;. Deputy Rabbitte no longer stands for action.  He now depicts still life.  Who framed Deputy Rabbitte?</P>
    <P>I invite Deputy Rabbitte to tune in to reality, to walk the streets and meet the people.  Real, not imagined, crime has imprisoned the elderly in their homes. Real, not imaginary, drugs have corrupted and killed.  Real, not imaginary, offences are being committed on a hitherto unprecedented scale.  From inside the darkened windows of State Mercedes, the red band of the Rainbow believes there is no problem.  So be it. Let the people decide.</P>
    <P>Amid the historical irrelevancies and legal obscurities which form the nucleus of this Bill, one provision stands out like a shining beacon.  It is a provision so devoid of constitutional integrity as to beggar belief and flies in the face of over six decades of jurisprudential development of the Irish Constitution. The Minister brings it before this House that it may pause briefly on its way to the Supreme Court and well deserved legislative oblivion.  Does the Minister have the courage of her convictions? Will she resign when section 6 of this Bill is declared unconstitutional?  For a Minister to introduce legislation which seeks, in effect, to amend Article 40.5 of the Constitution is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> The Constitution is clear: &ldquo;The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law&rdquo;.  The manner in which the courts have interpreted that article of the Constitution is also clear. Mr. Justice Walsh in The People v. O'Brien [1965] Irish Reports 142 at page 170 stated:</P>
    <P>In Article 40 of the Constitution, the State has undertaken to defend and vindicate the inviolability of the constitutional rights of the citizen. The defence and vindication of the constitutional rights of the citizen is a duty superior to that of trying such citizen for a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>No stronger declaration of the fact that section 6 of this Bill is unconstitutional could have been made by the Supreme Court.  Section 6 seeks to negate what the Supreme Court termed a &ldquo;superior constitutional right&rdquo;.  The Minister's legislation seeks to set aside the constitutional guarantee given by the people to themselves.  It seeks to bypass a constitutional right by legislation in a manner which will not withstand an inevitable legal challenge.  The Minister would have been well advised to take time to read the judgment of Mr. Justice Barr in Ryan <i>v.</i> O'Callaghan in the High Court on 22 July 1987 where he upheld the constitutionality of the power of search granted by section 42 of the Larceny Act, 1916, because it:</P>
    <P>...contains important elements for the protection of the public... The investigating police officer must swear an information that he has reasonable cause for suspecting that stolen property is to be found at the premises to be searched and he must satisfy a Peace Commissioner who is an independent person unconnected with criminal investigation <i>per se</i> that it is right and proper to issue a warrant.</P>
    <P>The legislation which the Minister has introduced does not refer to any independent person.  It cuts out an essential <Col N="1284" /> element of constitutional guarantee, and transgresses what Mr. Justice Henchy in King v. Attorney General [1981] Irish Reports 233 described as &ldquo;the fundamental norms of the legal order postulated by the Constitution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;in accordance with law&rdquo; as recited in Article 40.5 of the Constitution means far more than merely authorised by statute and courts have again and again made this point clear. The warning sounded by Mr. Justice Lardner on 22 February 1988 in O'Mahony v. Shields to the effect that the Oireachtas might consider it desirable to amend section 8 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, to require more substantive information to be put before a District Court judge who issues a search warrant has been ignored by the Minister in crafting this legislation. Instead of reforming the law, she has chosen to embark on an inevitable path of constitutional challenge and hampered the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>Since 1765 courts in this land have prevented the Executive from claiming a general warrant to look through private premises.  It has been one of the cornerstones of our jurisprudence. Article 7 of the 1922 Constitution contained such a provision and it has continued to the present day.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to circumvent the Constitution by legislation, and for good measure she has thrown in a general power of search.  The best that can be said for this ill-considered section is that it is not out of place in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also seen fit to introduce in criminal law the concept of an &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo;, and in so doing she has brought into being the concept of a &ldquo;non-arrestable offence in respect of which a power of arrest exists&rdquo;.  This lamentable confusion, which is the hallmark of legislation emanating from the Minister's Department, is a tribute to the lack of thought in preparing the Bill. The consequences of this lack of thought will be manifold and the beneficiaries will be criminals.  Once again the Minister has delivered the gift of court confusion to the criminals.  There <Col N="1285" /> is a persistent public perception that criminals get off on technicalities &mdash; the Minister has seen fit to introduce what is in effect a Criminal Technicalities Bill giving a menu of confusion on which bogus defences are the main course.</P>
    <P>The substantive law on arrest as it currently exists is a mess.  The Minister, rather than introducing detailed, thought-out proposals, has &mdash; for the sole purpose of being seen to do something &mdash; compounded that mess.  The proposed confusion starts in the definition section of the Bill.  By defining an arrestable offence as &ldquo;an offence for which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may... be punished by a term of imprisonment of five years or more&rdquo; the Minister has imposed an extraordinary burden on a garda who proposes to make an arrest.</P>
    <P>Under the Minister's proposals, a garda who proposes to arrest a person must first address his mind to whether that person is &ldquo;of full capacity&rdquo;.  What does this vital expression mean?  The definition section of the Bill is unhelpfully silent.  The garda will have to turn his mind to the general body of criminal jurisprudence before deciding whether he can lawfully arrest.  There, full capacity is understood to refer to two factors &mdash; the age of the person and whether he is legally sane.  It is baffling that the Minister introduced an element of mental adjudication into the arrest process at a time when the law relating to insanity is in need of the most urgent attention.  To exclude a power of arrest for all persons who are not of full capacity is folly.  If the Bill is carried, the criminally insane will be exempt from arrest.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously with the instant psychoanalysis required as a prerequisite to arrest under this Bill, an unfortunate garda will have to address his mind to whether the person has been previously convicted of such an offence, his or her age and by extraneous grounds warranting an arrest.  The power of arrest proposed in this Bill could be lawfully exercised only by an athletic, eager <Col N="1286" /> senior counsel who also qualified in psychiatry.  If the Minister intends to pursue this proposal, I suggest that she alter the Garda uniform to striped trousers, white coat and an optional horse hair wig so that members of the public can readily identify such well qualified people on our streets.</P>
    <P>That is only the beginning of the confusion that will be caused by these provisions.  The power of arrest is not vested solely in the Garda or other State officials but, by virtue of section 4 (2) to &ldquo;any person&rdquo;, irrespective of whether &ldquo;any person&rdquo; has seen the offences being committed.  The Minister should give thought &mdash; as she clearly has not done &mdash; to the consequences of this section since groups of tattooed skinheads, Hell's Angels, punk rockers, bizarre do-gooders and parties of four-year-olds visiting the zoo will all be given a general power of arrest in respect of offences they have not seen being committed.</P>

      <P>In all seriousness I advise the Minister to go back to the drawing board and abandon this nonsensical provision which compromises the safety, liberty and bodily integrity of citizens.  It is a Rambo's charter.  The deeper one delves into the provisions of this Bill the thicker the fog becomes. How can it be contended that the provisions of section 8 are an asset to our jurisprudence since they purport to <Col N="1287" /> create a new statutory offence of concealing the commission of an arrestable offence?  This new offence carries a penalty of up to three years imprisonment. It is not in itself an arrestable offence and, remarkably, the Bill does not propose a statutory power of arrest.  It is a new concept of criminal offence &mdash; I presume to be known as an &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo;.  It appears the Minister proposes a new category of offender to be known as &ldquo;the unarrestables&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since taking office the Minister has behaved like a solo entrant in a synchronised swimming contest, thrashing about in a pattern that makes sense to nobody but herself.  This Bill is a leaden lifebelt which will hasten the Minister's inevitable descent into the pool of legislative inactivity.  Very soon only the ripples will remain.</P>

      <P>My party and the Fianna Fáil Party has called consistently for a thorough examination of all aspects of our criminal law to ascertain whether they meet the requirements of a modern criminal justice system and requested reforms in those areas found wanting.  We are all aware of many areas in need of reform.  There are many loopholes in respect of small and large issues would could be amended without costing the Exchequer a lot.  These have been valiantly highlighted by the Opposition over many months.  All the legislative proposals introduced and debated in Private Members' time have been rejected by the Government out of hand.  Many areas in need of reform were highlighted in my party's Private Members' Bill &mdash; the Prosecution of Offences and Punishment of Crimes Bill, 1996 &mdash; introduced earlier this year. Such reforms were dismissed by the Minister as &ldquo;unrealistic&rdquo;, yet they were all reasonable, such as those on bail, prisons and a whole range of procedural reforms which would have righted many of the current inadequacies of our justice system.</P>

    <P>The Minister might be congratulated in principle for eventually bringing forward some legislative measure in this area.  An example is the attempt to tackle one of the most arcane areas in our criminal law, namely, the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, but that distinction was abolished in the United Kingdom almost 30 years ago. Therefore a Bill dealing with this issue has to be welcomed.  It must be acknowledged that all of the distinctions drawn between felonies and misdemeanours were anomalous.  For example, one of the most important distinctions related to powers of arrest &mdash; a person could be arrested for a felony without warrant <Col N="1289" /> but not for a misdemeanour unless it involved a threat of a breach of the peace or of personal injury.</P>
    <P>While this Bill abolishes the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, it proposes to maintain that powers of arrest, without warrant, are available only in respect of more serious offences.  While this distinction is sensible, the method by which the Bill attempts to achieve that aim &mdash; through the concept of an &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo;&mdash; will lead to other anomalies, already outlined by Deputy O'Donoghue.  It is doubtful whether the Bill will achieve any improvement over the existing position in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some of the other measures of this Bill give rise to serious concerns, particularly the new powers of forcible entry. These are supposedly no more than consequential on the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours but in reality are more far-reaching.  For example, power of forcible entry without warrant, to be exercised in the case of arrestable offences by virtue of section 6, had no counterpart in the common law relating to felonies.</P>
    <P>Other reforms, such as the formal abolition of corporal punishment and the obsolete concept of penal servitude, are to be welcomed, as is the rescindment of the Whipping Act of 1820 and the Garrotting Act of 1863.</P>

      <P>While the Bill abolishes the distinction drawn between felonies and misdemeanours, it proposes to resurrect one of the most important distinctions between them, namely, the powers of arrest exercisable, to be achieved by the introduction into Irish law of the concept of &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo;.  In section 4, the powers of arrest without warrant and, in section 6, of forcible entry without warrant will be exercisable only in respect of &ldquo;arrestable offences&rdquo;.  An &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo; effectively is one for which a statute permits or requires a punishment of at least five years imprisonment, whose concept has its origins in the English Act which abolished the distinction between felonies and misdemeanour some 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>Section 4 deals with the power of arrest without warrant.  The current position is that a garda or citizen can arrest, without warrant, in respect of felonies or to prevent personal injury or a breach of the peace.  The abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours means that the powers of arrest formerly exercisable in respect of felonies will also be abolished. Instead the power of arrest without warrant, formerly exercisable in respect of felonies, henceforth will be exercisable in respect of &ldquo;arrestable offences&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P>Since arrestable offences correspond approximately to felonies, the powers of arrest will be nearly similar in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement has to be treated with some caution.  The definition of an arrestable offence will create problems and the worry is that this will simply exchange ancient for new anomalies. The powers of arrest in section 6 go beyond those exercisable in relation to felonies.  Are arrestable offences the same as felonies?  It seems that in the past 30 years only one of the many statutes to create offences described them <Col N="1291" /> as felonies or misdemeanours, &mdash; the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976. If the Oireachtas felt powers of arrest without warrant were desirable, those powers were expressly conferred by the statute rather than by categorising the offence as a felony or misdemeanour. Usually the powers of arrest without warrant were restricted to the Garda or to officers or employees of a body responsible for enforcing the Act in question.  If it was not felt necessary to create a power of arrest without warrant, the Act would be silent on the point, with the result that a warrant was required.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a significant change in direction.  Under the new definition of &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo;, all those statutory offences which carry a sentence of five years or more, but in respect of which the Oireachtas when passing the Act did not feel it necessary to create a power of arrest without warrant will now be arrestable offences and ordinary citizens as well as gardaí will be able to arrest without warrant.  An example is giving false information about the family home contrary to section 15 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  It would seem that even though the relevant statute confined the power of arrest without warrant to the Garda, this Bill will confer it on the ordinary citizen as well if the offence carries a sentence of five years or more. For more than 30 years, the policy of the Oireachtas in creating statutory offences has been to confine the power of arrest to the gardaí or to officers of various bodies responsible for the enforcement of the relevant Act.  The definition of arrestable offences will change all that and confer powers of arrest on citizens.</P>
    <P>Is it really desirable to switch from a society where the Garda Síochána is responsible for law enforcement to the vigilante style model where citizens go about arresting each other?  It is not sufficient to say that it probably will not happen very often.  The beating to death of the suspected drug dealer this week is <Col N="1292" /> an example of how vigilantism can spin dangerously out of control.</P>
    <P>The extension of powers of arrest without warrant whether by a Garda or a citizen is not confined to statutory offences created in the past 30 years. Examples of offences, previously misdemeanours for which there was no power of arrest without warrant which will now become arrestable offences by reason of being punishable under statute by five years imprisonment are, cheating at gaming, contrary to section 11 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, and neglecting to provide food for a servant, contrary to section 26 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. These offences will be the basis also for forcible entry of home without warrant. It should be noted that by confining the definition of arrestable offences to those for which the penalty is statutory, perpetrators of felonies for which there is no statutory penalty will no longer be subject to arrest without warrant but some offenders who previously were not subject to arrest without warrant will now be subject to this form of arrest. The power of arrest without warrant which up to now was associated with certain offences will not survive.  These changes do not seem to be particularly desirable in themselves.  It is suggested that they are unforeseen by-products of the definition of &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo;. The explanation may be that the concept of arrestable offence first appeared in a 1967 Bill &mdash; ultimately withdrawn &mdash; based on an English statute of the same year.  By resurrecting it in the same form in this Bill, the Minister is ignoring the approach to arrest adopted by the Oireachtas in virtually every Act passed in the intervening 30 years.</P>
    <P>The consequences of an arrest by a citizen are quite serious.  If there is to be arrest by a citizen it will have to be clearly defined and perhaps there should be a schedule of offences where it is relevant.  One of the more glaring omissions of the Bill which goes to considerable lengths to revive the concept of the citizen's arrest, is the absence of <Col N="1293" /> any attempt to regulate what is to happen once a citizen has made an arrest. Now that the power to make a citizen's arrest is being put on a statutory basis it would surely be desirable to make statutory provision on the obligations of the citizen who has made such an arrest, for example to transfer the person into Garda custody as soon as practicable. This is not just a technical point.  If a store detective makes a statutory arrest of a suspected shoplifter, it is desirable that he or she be under a statutory obligation to call the Garda Síochána immediately rather than to interrogate the person.  The question then arises as to when and by whom the person is to be charged.  Another problem which arises in respect of a citizen's arrest relates to section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Under that section a person arrested without warrant by a Garda can be detained for 12 hours without charge for questioning in respect of offences to which that section applies, but if the arrest is made by a citizen, as opposed to a member of the force it would seem that section 4 of the 1984 Act has no application, as the power to detain for questioning is specifically confined to arrest by a garda.  While it may seem the solution is simply for the garda to arrest the person, this may not be an acceptable solution.  How can a garda arrest someone who is already under arrest?  I urge the Minister to introduce specific provisions to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a garda may execute a warrant for the arrest of a person or an order of committal without having the warrant or order in his possession.  This provision makes a great deal of sense as there is every chance the garda who spots a wanted person may not be the garda in physical possession of the warrant or order. However, one unsatisfactory aspect of the new power conferred by this section is that even when the garda ultimately receives the warrant, he is not obliged to show it to the arrested person unless that person so demands.  The garda should be required to show the warrant <Col N="1294" /> as soon as possible and without the arrested person having to demand it.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly section 6 is the most controversial section of the Bill.  Effectively it abolishes the requirement to have a warrant to enter and search premises, including a dwelling for the purpose of arresting a person for an arrestable offence.  Despite what the explanatory memorandum says, it is hard to see how this power could be regarded as simply consequential upon the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.  There was never any corresponding power in relation to felonies.  Among the features of this new power are (1) that there is no need for special circumstances of urgency to justify not applying for a warrant; (2) unlike the exceptional powers conferred by the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, the decision to forcibly enter and search does not even require the involvement of a Garda superintendent and the power can be exercised by a person with the rank of garda; (3) it applies to all arrestable offences rather than being confined to specific crimes which has been the norm in all previous cases where statutes have conferred a power to enter and search without warrant; (4) the only restriction on the exercise of this power is that the garda is to have reasonable cause &ldquo;to suspect&rdquo; as opposed to reasonable cause &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; that the person whom he wishes to arrest is on the premises.  This is clearly a very low threshold.  The magnitude of the proposed change in the law becomes even greater when it is read in conjunction with section 9 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976 which provides that:</P>
    <P>Where in the course of exercising any power under this Act or in the course of a search carried out under any other power, a member of the Garda Síochána... finds or comes into possession of anything which he believes to be evidence of an offence or a suspected offence it may be seized and retained for use as evidence in any criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> Thus the effect of section 6 of this Bill and section 9 of the 1976 Act read together is that a garda in any circumstances without involving a garda superintendent merely on suspicion as opposed to belief that a person who has committed an arrestable offence is to be found on certain premises, can forcibly enter the premises without a warrant and search it for evidence of an offence entirely unconnected with the offence for which the person suspected of being on the premises is wanted.  The offence in relation to which evidence is gathered does not have to be an arrestable offence as defined in this Bill.  The potential for the abuse of this power is enormous.  It renders ineffective virtually all the checks and balances in our law.  It is not far short of allowing a garda to enter and search premises at will.  Questions arise as to the constitutionality of this power particularly as it applies to dwellings.  Under Article 40.5 of the Constitution:</P>
    <P>The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>The power to enter forcibly cannot be regarded as being in accordance with law simply because it is conferred by an Act of the Oireachtas.  That is because the words &ldquo;save in accordance with law&rdquo; have been interpreted by the courts as meaning &ldquo;without stooping to methods which ignore the fundamental norms of the legal order postulated by the Constitution&rdquo;.  Some indication of those norms in regard to the forcible entry of a dwelling can be gleaned from the case of Ryan <i>v.</i> O'Callaghan in which the High Court considered whether obtaining a search warrant from a peace commissioner rather than from a judge was unconstitutional.  The court decided it was not because the investigating garda must satisfy a peace commissioner who is an independent person unconnected with the criminal investigation <i>per se</i> that it is right and proper to issue the warrant.  However, <Col N="1296" /> under section 6 the dwelling can be forcibly entered without the involvement of the independent person unconnected with criminal investigation <i>per se</i> referred to by the High Court.  The entering garda does not have to satisfy anyone about anything.  He can simply enter forcibly off his own bat.</P>
    <P>Another issue arises where a forcible entry is made and evidence is found that is relied on to prosecute an offence totally unconnected with the offence in relation to which the entry was made. Under Article 38 (1) of the Constitution, &ldquo;no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.&rdquo;  In considering the constitutionality of the Criminal law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1975, the Supreme Court explained that the phrase &ldquo;due course of law&rdquo; required a fair and just balance between the exercise of individual freedoms and the requirements of an ordered society.  The vast extension of the powers of entry, search and seizure conferred by section 6 of this Bill, in conjunction with section 9 of the 1976 Act, seem to have taken the exercise of individual freedoms out of the balancing exercise.</P>
    <P>In raising these constitutional issues, I do not want it to appear that my party is being pernickety or unsupportive of reasonable measures required to bring the law up-to-date to make it relevant to deal with the critical state of criminality at present.  When this House engages in criminal justice legislation it is imperative in a democracy that the Opposition raises issues which it considers have a crucial effect on the constitutionality of the legislation before it.  If a criminal convicted under new legislation ultimately succeeds in having it quashed because the legislation is unconstitutional, it represents a failure on the part of this House and its legislators.  Getting tough on crime is not about introducing oppressive legislation which could be challenged by those whom it affects and could defeat the intention of the Legislature and the Minister in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> Sections 7 and 8 deal with the consequences of the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, and that is welcome. Section 9, which enables the courts to find an accused guilty of a lesser offence where not all the elements of the offence with which he or she is charged have been proved, is also welcome.  The reforms proposed in section 10 appear to make considerable sense.</P>
    <P>Under section 11, the abolition of the archaic distinction between imprisonment and imprisonment with hard labour and penal servitude is long overdue as is the abolition of corporal punishment under section 12.  It is strange that the current statutory instrument dealing with the management of prisons still makes formal provision for whipping, which perhaps indicates it is in need of attention.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing a Bill with some welcome modifications, but my congratulations must be mooted and severely qualified in light of my party's serious concerns about the sections I outlined.</P>
    <P>Unconstitutional legislation is not an effective weapon in the war against crime.  This legislation is probably unamendable as so many of its sections give cause for concern.  There will be a filleting exercise on Committee Stage from which I hope we will send a Bill to the Seanad which will be substantially amended to meet the concerns expressed here.  If section 6 is struck down, no powers of entry will remain and that would be a strange outcome. I look forward to Committee Stage by which time I hope the Minister will recognise the errors in the Bill and will accept substantial amendments to the offending sections 4 and 6 which represent oppressive legislation that could be struck down by the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation.  It is further proof of the efforts of the Minister for Justice to get to grips with the problem of crime that has escalated because of a lack of effort by a party in the former Government to <Col N="1298" /> address it for many years.  That Opposition party now appears to be very eager to ensure criminal legislation is introduced.  Why could all the legislation that party put forward during Private Members' time not have been introduced during the eight and a half years it was in Government?  The main Opposition spokesperson talked about ignorance, but he appears to be ignorant of the fact that for many years his party had an opportunity to introduce criminal legislation and it failed to do so.  His decision not to oppose this Bill demonstrates that he wants to sit on the fence, which comes naturally to people from his part of the country.  He probably wants to weigh up the pros and cons of the legislation to find fault with it. Although he condemned the Bill he said he would support it.  During her tenure in office the Minister will prove not only that she will have talked about the problem of crime or put forward proposals to tackle it, but will have dealt with it.</P>
      <P>When I campaigned during a famous by-election in Mayo there was a serious crime problem and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was then Minister for Justice.  I do not remember the then Opposition Justice spokesperson claiming that anybody was totally opposed to the policy of the then Minister.  In Opposition we asked her to take measures to address the problem to the best of her ability, but laying the blame for every crime or criminal problem on the Minister, as Deputy O'Donoghue continues to do, is neither logical nor rational.  To use his word, it demonstrates ignorance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the more positive attitude of the Progressive Democrats' spokesperson, Deputy O'Donnell.  She said her party will table amendments to improve the Bill and, at least, she was realistic in her comments.  We have got used to Deputy O'Donoghue's style.  He talked about the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, being aggressive in Opposition.  Deputy O'Donoghue is an active spokesperson for Justice but active in the sense of being totally negative.  The problem of crime is too serious to adopt that attitude towards it.  I remember <Col N="1299" /> canvassing in the Headford area of Galway at 7 o'clock one evening and nobody wanted to open their doors because of their great fear after four people were murdered.  That fear and crime did not arise the day the Minister took office.  It was a reality before then and a problem we must address together.  Using this issue as a political hatchet will not make the elderly or those in remote rural areas, like Deputy O'Donoghue's, feel safe and secure in their houses, it will cause only more unnecessary distress.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly outlined the purpose of the Bill.  The legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil in Government classified fraudulent conversion, obtaining property by false pretences and some sexual offences as misdemeanours.  While farmers were being sent letters telling them they had committed a crime as a result of a technical mistake they made in filling in a form, other people were making millions from tax and other fraud, which taxpayers have had to pay for in recent years.</P>

      <P>It is important that people who commit such offences are arrested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing in illegal drugs, murder, breaking and entering etc. are regarded as serious crimes, yet the offences referred to by the Minister were deemed to be misdemeanours under previous legislation.  This shows the <Col N="1300" /> necessity for amending the law.  The criminal law must be more relevant and responsive in terms of dealing with modern day crime.  When people arrested for committing these so-called misdemeanours are not convicted it is difficult to understand why people can be arrested for not having television licence or not having paid their car tax.</P>
    <P>As there are many eminent barristers and lawyers in the House I do not intend to deal with the technicalities of the Bill.  Rather I will deal with it only as it affects ordinary citizens.  The issue of crime must be dealt with in a much more serious way than has been the case up to now.  Last Monday a young man, whose mother lives in my local village and whose father lives in Clones, was murdered.  Regardless of the problems this young man faced &mdash; and we know he had some problems &mdash; he did not deserve this kind of death.  Nobody can treat such crime lightly and those who were involved in it should not go unpunished.  As has been stated, lashing is no longer used, but these people cannot continue to be handled with kid gloves and allowed to go free for two or three days for whatever reason.  The Garda must be given the necessary powers not only to arrest those people but to deal with them in whatever way is necessary.</P>

      <P>This issue was not dealt with by the parties opposite when they were in Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister is entitled to reasonable criticism &mdash; she is well capable of taking it &mdash; but it is important to point out that she is more than capable of doing her job.  Thankfully the reorganisation of the Garda was carried before the Border in my region had to be closed as a result of the BSE scare.  Under the new structures the Garda are able to take decisions within the region and do not have to seek approval elsewhere.  Having seen how the Border was closed quickly and successfully following the BSE scare, I am sure the Minister will be well able to deal with any other issues which arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that the Border has had to be shut at this time.  Successive Governments have rightly been criticised for their failure to close the Border when murderers were on the loose.  It is important that contacts are kept open between North and South so that people <Col N="1302" /> can be arrested.  Even when Border roads were shut criminals were still able to get from one side to the other across fields.  Many years ago there was a case in Clones involving a man convicted of smuggling.  His brothers promised to pay his bail but during the lunch break they left the court and the brother, who had been convicted of smuggling, jumped into the canal and swam across to the other side.  We do not want the same thing to happen today; rather we want to ensure that criminals are arrested and convicted.  The Bill is a move in this direction and the Minister is making a genuine effort to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>I am glad Fianna Fáil is not opposing the Bill but Deputy O'Donoghue could have been more positive in his comments.  He should remember that his party was in Government for more than eight years and that it did not make much progress on this issue during that time.</P>

      <P>We have a very good record in Government going back to the time Mr. Haughey was Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crawford referred to the victims of crime about whom we can all speak, but one of the most unfortunate decisions ever arrived at was the decision to abolish the payment of compensation for pain and suffering.  I realise that this issue does not strictly arise in this measure, but I appeal to the Minister to look into it again.  It is most unfortunate that the victims of crime cannot receive compensation for pain and suffering, unlike those who fall into corporation drains and are involved in road and industrial accidents.  Even though they can suffer the most grievious disablement as a result of the activities of criminals they find themselves without a penny in compensation other than the payment the Minister can manage to make after a number of years delay for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Minister has not considered the extent to which it will derogate from our own privileges in this House.  Article 15.13 of the Constitution provides that the Members of each House of the Oireachtas shall, except in the case of treason as defined in the Constitution, felony or breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest in going to and returning from and while within the precincts of either House.  It goes on to deal with the question of utterances.</P>
      <P>Since the expression &ldquo;felony&rdquo; is referred to in the Constitution it is very much an open question whether the Minister can introduce a Bill which purports to abolish the entire concept. There is no reference to this subject in the Bill.  Has the Minister sought the advice of the Attorney General?  If not, the President may have to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court and the Minister's preliminary instalment of her grand design of criminal law reform may not be placed on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious question.  I am not particularly anxious to enjoy or exercise the privileges, but since the expression &ldquo;felony&rdquo; is referred to in the Constitution the least this Bill should do is provide for a new definition.  I do not think we are competent to devalue or eliminate that concept from the Constitution entirely, although I accept that when a phrase such as &ldquo;felony&rdquo; is written in its meaning cannot be written in <Col N="1305" /> stone and must be open to some interpretation and development as the decades pass.  There is, however, no evidence on the face of the Bill of any interpretation, clarification or development of the idea of a felony as defined in the Constitution.  That is a matter at which the Minister will have to look and I propose to return to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is a non-contentious measure with which nobody would disagree. Having researched the matter in the Library, I notice that it was prepared by a very fine Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice in 1967.  Its non-contentious aspects have, therefore, remained on a dusty file somewhere in the Department of Justice for 29 years.  The mystery is why it is being introduced after such a long period during which law students and gardaí in the training college have had to learn about the distinction between a felony and misdemeanour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are greater contemporary priorities in the administration of the criminal justice system and the elimination of technicalities. These include the question of the right to silence which has been raised by our sister party in Opposition.  The public generally does not understand how the sophisticated criminal is able to avoid answering questions put by the Garda Síochána, even when he is brought before a judicial officer.  That question has to be examined very seriously. There are major questions, including the question of self-incrimination, but the public believes we have got the balance wrong and have to look at the subject again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> We have raised the question of bail time and again.  It appears that there is an element of political paralysis in this administration and that we will not make any progress on this question, despite the publication of the Law Reform Commission's report, this side of the general election.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues arise.  On the question of capacity, &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo; is defined in section 2 as an offence for which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may be punished.  I do not understand why it is necessary to refer to that phrase when it is contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, in a somewhat different context where a distinction is drawn between the detention of minors and adults.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) goes beyond what is provided for in the law as it stands.  It states:</P>
    <P>Where an arrestable offence has been committed, any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed is that the common law should be restated in statutory form.  Once one restates a common law principle in statutory form it is the statute which prevails and the court may not have regard to the common law in construing it.  The common law goes a little further.  It states that one has to prove that an offence has been committed before an arrest is valid.  A private individual cannot, therefore, arrest another unless they are in a position to prove that an offence has been committed.  That is not what the subsection states and it will have huge implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The position will remain the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see where it states that one will have to show that an offence has been committed.  All it states is that any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom <Col N="1307" /> he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.  If I believe, with reasonable cause, that the Taoiseach has committed an offence, presumably I will now be able to arrest him as he departs from Leinster House. The Minister having already eroded in an unconstitutional manner the privileges of the Oireachtas, that Article of the Constitution is inoperative.  Under this subsection, I can purport to arrest the Taoiseach on the basis that I have reasonable cause to suspect him to be guilty of an offence.  The provision goes rather far.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, there is a great deal of litigation in the State surrounding the operations of security staff.  The subsection as drafted would give such personnel a far wider defence than they have at present; currently they must show an offence has been committed, whereas under the subsection that is no longer required.  That is a considerable development in the law and I am prepared to examine whether it is desirable.  However, it goes beyond the present law even though the subsection was introduced, and is justified in the Explanatory Memorandum, on the basis that it simply restates the current common law position.  I would be obliged if the Minister dealt with that point.</P>

    <P>Section 6, on entry and search of premises, has already been dealt with by Deputy O'Donoghue.  He has outlined the constitutional questions with far <Col N="1308" /> greater elaboration than I would be capable of.  The fundamental reason our spokesman expressed reservations about this Bill is that it is not at the top of our priorities.  It appears this administration is not seriously concerned to advance legislative reform which will eliminate the use of technicalities in the courts, so we will have to continue to introduce Private Members' Bills from week to week to deal with this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to them in a minute.  Deputy O'Donoghue has a serious problem accepting that there will be a certain level of criminal activity irrespective of who is in Government and that there was no greater or lesser criminal activity when his party was in office not so long ago.  I welcome Deputy Lenihan to the House and wish him a fruitful time here but he is mistaken if he thinks the list of Private Members' Bills his party is introducing indicates a new found interest in law and order.  The party was deficient in putting items on the Statute Book to deal with the level of criminal activity which existed for a long time and caused great difficulties for our citizens, not just last year but for many years before.  We should give some thought to an examination of the facts when we resume our debate on this legislation next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is grappling with a difficult problem and is seeking to ensure not only that there is a short-term response with the necessary resources to deal with law <Col N="1309" /> and order problems in our community, but also that the Department of Justice undertakes long standing and necessary reorganisations of the Garda Síochána, the courts, the judicial system and the justice system generally, so that we can deal effectively with criminals.  Some time ago she had difficulty getting across her message that more prison spaces and more gardaí on the beat were needed but she is now succeeding in that.  I was amazed to read in today's newspaper that there are 1,000 fewer gardaí than ten years ago.  Although there were 11,000 gardaí in 1988-89 which fell to 10,700, some 700 to 800 people have been employed in the civilian grades to do clerical and office work in Garda stations which was previously done by officers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's recent Garda reorganisation initiative to devolve power from the centre to the regions and am particularly pleased to report that it is meeting with success in the Garda organisational structures in the south-east.  The regional command structure for the south-east region, which is based in Kilkenny, has been welcomed by the local people.  They have seen &ldquo;Operation South-East&rdquo; in action and have observed a more vigilant force.  There are more gardaí on our roads and streets, operating near areas of undesirable activity as a preventative measure against mobile criminals.</P>
    <P>The Minister has often been unjustifiably criticised by the Opposition for the difficulties the courts have in dealing effectively with criminals.  She has published a number of reforming measures for family and criminal courts, appointed new judges, provided more and better court facilities, and made the necessary increase in prison places to put those people away.  She is also considering an imaginative proposal in respect of petty crime so that those criminals whom we want to see behind bars serve their sentences in full while petty crime can be dealt with under community service orders or similar measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> I am also surprised that Deputy Lenihan says this Criminal Law Bill is low on Fianna Fáil's list of priorities.  It introduces far-reaching measures which will allow members of the Garda to take certain steps to arrest people &mdash; heretofore they have been hampered in their opportunities to do so.  I take on board his comments on section 2 concerning capacity and citizen's arrest.  Those matters should be re-examined because the Minister would not want a citizen's arrest provision to be abused.  The Deputy's point was constructively made and deserves clarification in due course.</P>
    <P>The gardaí have been hampered in their ability to get information from people.  I agree that we should closely examine the right to silence and the Law Reform Commission report on bail.  The Minister is actively seeking proposals to deal with offences committed on bail and I have no doubt that before the year is out we will not only have talked about the matter but will have done something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 15 and 28 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Private Notice Questions on 30 April, 1996 by Deputies O'Rourke and Harney, I detailed the sequence of events leading to the announcement of the closure of Packard in July 1996, including meetings with General Motors and Delphi Packard <Col N="1312" /> management.  On 30 April I sought and was given approval by Government to establish the Tallaght task force which I launched on 1 May 1996.  The task force has been vigorously and energetically pursuing its remit to formulate an action plan in response to the announcement of the closure of the Packard plant by the end of July 1996.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the task force, which is representative of a broad cross section of interests with a very strong local Tallaght dimension, are as follows: to make proposals and to advise the Minister, in response to the situation in Tallaght arising out of the announcement of the closure of Packard, on: replacement industry-industries being located in the area which can utilise the Packard premises and workforce; steps necessary to assist local suppliers and sub-contractors who are facing loss of business; assisting Packard workers in such areas as career change, training, retraining, job search and enterprise; supporting local SMEs to expand, including the possibility of incentives for employment of ex-Packard employees; and such other matters arising out of the closure of Packard and related to the situation of Tallaght as the task force may determine.</P>
    <P>The task force has held four meetings to date and has established two subcommittees to examine urgently issues relating to job skills and training, industry, enterprise and infrastructure.  It envisages the submission of a report prior to the closure of the Packard plant in July next.  This report should address the key issues outlined in the task force's terms of reference, including the upgrading of skills and retraining of workers and the attraction of alternative industry to Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I understand that discussions are continuing between IDA Ireland and Delphi Packard and General Motors on the use of the Tallaght plant and site for alternative industry.  A successful conclusion to these discussions would be a major boost in providing a very valuable infrastructural resource for the attraction of industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> I met last evening with the unions at Packard at their request to hear the outcome of two meetings that have taken place to date between the company and unions.  The unions expressed their frustration that there has been no improvement in communications and that the orderly resolution of the present situation presumes that relevant information will be made available.  I would expect that discussions between the parties will commence under the aegis of the LRC next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister of State went into some detail in reply to the Private Notice Question about contacts and meetings.  However, I am asking him to do me the courtesy of repeating the detail because one loses track of many matters in the heat of a Private Notice Question.  In particular, will the Minister of State detail who from his office, or that of the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton &mdash; both elected politicians and officials &mdash; was at the meeting with the Taoiseach?  I understand the management met with the Taoiseach on the day of that hasty, damaging and dramatic leak.  In answering that, will the Minister of State tell me if he and his officials acquiesced to the decision to announce the plans on the Wednesday or Thursday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The attendance at the meeting with the Taoiseach included myself, senior officials in my Department and senior personnel from the IDA, including the deputy chief executive of the IDA &mdash; the chief executive was in the Far East with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  The question of our acquiescing to the announcement was not an issue.  Mr. Battenberg, the president of the company, had already informed me at the meeting prior to the meeting with the Taoiseach that the company had made this irrevocable decision and that he and his entourage were flying to Germany that evening directly from the meeting with the Taoiseach.  One presumes that was to talk to the European management in Germany <Col N="1314" /> and that they would, from there, set up a meeting with the trade unions at the plant to advise them of their decision and their response to the case we made to him at 10 a.m. on the Thursday.  Our acquiescence was not sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a response to the question I asked.  I asked if the Minister of State acquiesced with the way it was agreed.  In other words, was it agreed or stated at that meeting how the company proposed to make the announcement of the closure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We urged in the strongest possible terms that the communication to the workforce of the very disturbing news which the company had imparted to us ought not to be delayed. We urged that it should be communicated as speedily as possible.  We did this, very conscious of the fact that we were heading into another holiday weekend.  Serious announcements in respect of the future of this plant over the past couple of years have almost invariably been made on such weekends.  The company's response was that they had to go to Germany for their own internal discussions, and the soonest that could be arranged for was 10 a.m. on the Thursday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this, as the record of the House will show, in reply to Private Notice Questions on 1 May.  I am quite satisfied that did not happen. It is clear that, along with the workers, <Col N="1315" /> the other loser in the manner of its communication was the Government.  I made clear on the last occasion that the way such a far reaching decision for the livelihoods of 800 people and their families was communicated was reprehensible.</P>

The system gives advance warning of difficulties in companies and allows the agencies and my Department to co-ordinate an appropriate response and to initiate any necessary action to help firms to address their problems.</P>
      <P>The process works effectively because companies can be assured that their problems will be dealt with confidentially.  The Deputy can take it there are rarely circumstances where a closure announcement is made without some advance warning of difficulties in the firms in question.  Though the agencies or my Department were aware of difficulties in the recent cases, it does not follow that we would be apprised of a corporate decision to close a factory prior to that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> The quality of the information available to the early warning system is, very much dependent on the will of companies in difficulties to make information available.  I cannot predict the decisions that will be taken by individual companies in the future.  In the final analysis corporate decisions with an impact on employment are matters for the companies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the company to which the Deputy refers, I am aware of reports that the parent company has been considering the future of each of its plants in Europe.  It is looking at the comparative cost-base of each of those plants. The IDA has contacted the company and I recently met the senior management of the Irish company and representatives of a major trade union concerned.  The Deputy will appreciate that my discussions and those of the IDA are commercially sensitive and it would not be appropriate to disclose confidential details.  The Deputy may be assured that I, my Department and the IDA will continue to keep in contact with the company and every effort will be made to achieve the best possible outcome for the future of employment at the Irish plant.</P>

      <P>The role of the employment protection unit is to deal with such early warning cases and to bring in the various services of the Department and its agencies to support companies experiencing difficulties.  The difficulties can range over a wide area and can relate to banks, labour relations and industrial relations.  We anticipate how they can best be coped with and assist the company.  Many companies have had positive experiences of the protection unit.  It is a credit to the officers involved, some with long experience, dating back to when Fóir Teo was in existence.  They are bringing a vast <Col N="1317" /> amount of experience to bear in assisting companies that are experiencing difficulties.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree with the rural meaning of the saying: &ldquo;a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush&rdquo;?  There often appears to be a chase after the glamour of new announcements without attention to the grind of keeping the jobs we have.  The way in which the loss of jobs at Keytronics and the announcement by the Minister today are being managed is chillingly manipulative.

      <P>I do not accept that. We attempt to deal with any company facing difficulties in the best possible fashion.  The IDA has worked with Keytronics for a lengthy period in trying to overcome the difficulties to which the Deputy referred.  Unfortunately, the very difficult competitive environment in which the company found itself did not make it possible for those efforts to succeed.</P>
      <P>If taxpayer's funds were used to support a company that no longer had a viable future the Deputy would suggest they were being used unwisely.  We cannot support companies that get into irretrievable difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, for towns like Dundalk, we must ensure that the excellent resources, infrastructure and skills of the workforce are used to the best advantage.  This often means finding new opportunities for employment for those who have lost their jobs.  I see nothing reprehensible in seeking out <Col N="1318" /> opportunities for people, especially those in Dundalk where there has been a rise in unemployment.  It has been an area in considerable need for priority.  I am glad we are able to respond to this priority, which is recognised on both sides of the House.</P>

There is a lack of emphasis on protecting the jobs we have rather than chasing after what often proves to be illusions in terms of job creation.  I urge that the activities of the employment protection unit and the other special units be more forthright in advance of bad news.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the high taxes on work and the high cost of employment, vis-à-vis the United Kingdom, were the reason for Ireland's failure to secure the investment of Korean company, Lucky Goldstar, with a potential for the creation of 4,000 manufacturing jobs.</Quest>

      <P>While I am aware of <Col N="1319" /> press reports on the project in question, I understand that a formal announcement as to the location of the project has not yet been made.  During my recent visit to Korea with the chief executive of IDA Ireland, I met senior officials of the Lucky Goldstar Group.  I can assure the Deputy that I took this opportunity to support IDA's efforts to promote Ireland as a location for the company's overseas investments and also to endorse the benefits of the Government's ongoing pro business policies.  However, the Deputy should appreciate that contacts between IDA Ireland and the promoters of potential projects are conducted on a confidential basis and, as such, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any aspects of negotiations with the company.</P>
      <P>A variety of factors come into play in the decisions of foreign companies as to where to locate projects.  Incentive packages, the quality of the labour force, particularly in the electronics area, access to markets and the location of sub-suppliers are some of the many factors which influence this choice in addition to tax and labour cost issues.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis decisions as to where to locate overseas manufacturing operations rest with the owners of companies and are beyond the control of IDA Ireland.  The attraction of inward investment is a very competitive business.  Ireland has been extremely successful in attracting new projects.  In 1995, a total of 22 electronic-software projects, with an employment potential of almost 7,000 jobs, were approved by IDA Ireland.  I am confident Ireland remains competitive and will continue to win high tech projects against very strong competition from many sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The company has not yet taken a formal decision.  Ireland would be more competitive than others for certain parts of a project.  This project spans a number of elements.</P>
      <P>In some areas it would have disadvantages in terms of sources of raw materials.  The issue for Lucky Goldstar is whether it would consider Ireland's benefits, particularly for part of the project, whether it would perhaps deal with parts of the project in one location and parts in another.  My information from the IDA is that the position has not changed since we met the company, that a final decision has not been made by the company and is not expected for some weeks.</P>

I understand the company made a decision not to <Col N="1321" /> locate in Ireland, but obviously the Minister knows better than I do.  Has the Department done research, or what is the Minister's view on the attractiveness of Ireland for foreign investment? Will he accept that in the case of manufacturing industry and financial services, the 10 per cent manufacturing tax and tax on financial services profits is the key factor rather than grant aid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On electronic projects the key factor is the availability of qualified people, whether there are sufficient qualified engineers available to ensure the company gets a quick ramping up into production so that its product goes to market on time.  This is a very fast moving business and the key is to move in time with the product development cycle and get to market when profits are high from a new product.  Naturally the profitability of a product declines in time and if a company hits the cycle late it will not be effective.  Other factors are also taken into account such as our tax regime, which is attractive to companies.  The primary factor at present is the availability of skilled people at competitive labour costs compared to other parts of Europe in particular.  The Deputy will be aware that in recent times Scotland has been successful, as has Ireland, in attracting very significant electronic projects.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the prospects for a new national agreement to succeed the Programme for Competitiveness and Work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9943/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that there has been much speculation as to the possibility of agreeing a further programme to succeed the current <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The Government is committed to attempting to achieve an acceptable successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> To this end and by way of preparation, the Taoiseach has requested the National Economic and Social Council to prepare a strategy report which, as in the case of previous programmes, will inform the negotiations on any new national programme.  In addition, the NESF is also being invited to prepare a report on the elements and consultative process of a new national programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreement on a new national programme would, in my view, be desirable.  I am encouraged in this view by the dramatic economic and social progress that we have achieved in the course of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the two previous programmes.  It cannot be refuted that the national programmes experience has been to the benefit of all sectors of our society.  It was only possible for the three national programmes to be agreed and implemented because all the parties to the programmes were prepared to look beyond short-term interests and to concentrate more on achieving increases in take home pay and in the numbers at work.  It is important to reflect on the net take home pay benefits of the partnership approach of the recent past.  Comparing the situation now with that which obtained before the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> net take home pay at the average industrial wage has increased for single people by 25 per cent in real terms.  For a single-earner married couple with two children, real net income has increased by over 18 per cent.  Between 1993 and last <Col N="1323" /> year, net real pay for a similar couple increased by 5.4 per cent.  For a similar family, on three-quarters of the average industrial wage, the increase was 9.8 per cent.  The substantial, real net increases demonstrate the value of tripartite consensus approaches with the Government as an active, responsible partner.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful, given goodwill from all parties, that it will be possible to agree on a successor programme to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> that will be fair and just and that will enable us, as a nation, to continue our economic and social progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Having had a considerable input into agreements in the past, we on this side of the House welcome the Minister's statement that a new agreement is desirable.  Such an agreement should, however, be different from past agreements, particularly in the areas of long-term unemployment and taxation.  Will the Minister give a commitment that, in negotiating an agreement, the unemployed will have a seat at the table?  The INOU has made such a request and the Taoiseach will meet representatives of that organisation on 28 May next.  Will the Minister give a commitment that he supports such a measure and will he indicate that there will be considerable emphasis on taxation in a new agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach informed the House, part of the process of putting together a new programme will involve consultation with representatives of the unemployed.  The INOU is represented on the NESF and the NESC which are preparing documentation that will be a precursor to the programme.  The Government fully recognises that the issue of tax reform and the tax wedge is a very important ingredient in any future programme.  My Department, in dealing with the challenge we face in tackling unemployment and providing fair returns for people at work, has highlighted the need for <Col N="1324" /> change in that area.  That will be very much the core of consideration in the new programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>What timescale has the Government in mind for concluding negotiations on a new agreement?  I put this question in the context that Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union in the latter half of this year and Ministers will be deflected from many national issues during that period. I am concerned at the progress to date. There appears to be a stand-off in the current wave of disputes, particularly in the CPSU, although I appreciate that some progress has been made in that regard.  Am I right in saying that the negotiations could last until next year's budget and that part of the concluding strategy of the Government will be giveaway taxation measures in that budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the details of next year's budget, but I assure the Deputy we will be very conscious of the need to provide good planning in advance of a new programme. Meetings have taken place already to prepare the ground.  The terms of the present programme do not end in the private sector until the end of this year, the construction sector in March 1997 and the public service in June 1997.  The ground rules will be set and discussions started in advance of that.  I assure the Deputy the Government is starting the pre-planning phase early and hopes to be in a position to deal with the matter effectively in combination with our duties under the Presidency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance spoke about increasing take home pay through tax reform.  In his strategic plan published recently he stated that the focus of Labour policy for the future would be to increase take home pay through tax reform.  Is it the Minister's view that that will be the approach taken by the Government in the context of negotiating the successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work?</i><Col N="1325" /> In other words we will be talking about after tax income and the Minister will not be going for nominal wage increases but rather using the tax system to increase take-home pay?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that previous agreements have been successful because of a willingness by people to accept moderation in headline rates.  As I indicated in my reply, low inflation and tax improvements have meant that take-home pay has increased considerably.  That should be the approach to any successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> because such an approach has resulted in success in recent years, including a strong growth in employment and low interest rates, a factor in improving disposable income for many people who might otherwise face high mortgage costs.</P>

However, will the Minister tell us when he envisages the framework negotiations dealing with issues in relation to nurses, teachers and the CPSU coming to a conclusion?

No effort will be spared on the Government side to use this new procedure effectively to deal with these disputes which are a cause of concern.</P>

      <P>The motor insurance market is showing consistent underwriting loses.  This week FBD reported increased losses on their cars largely due to uninsured interests.  I want to quote from the financial page of today's edition of <i>The Examiner</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The substantial losses were in the region of £25 million &mdash; £26 per car insured compared to the UK figures which show an underwriting <Col N="1328" /> loss of only £4 per car insured.  In view of the perceived low risk, undercutting by established companies and the cherry picking by new companies, what steps does the Minister intend to take to protect established companies from such cherry picking?</P>

      <P>It has been a feature of the insurance business for many years that the underwriting losses to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred occur.  It is the other side of the coin of the normal questions one is asked about insurance, why it is so difficult for a young driver to get insurance at a reasonable rate. The fact is that the claims profile is such that it has produced this problem in Ireland.  I do not believe the new means of marketing to which the Deputy referred in his question will do anything but improve that position.  It has brought greater competition into the marketplace.  For example, we are particularly suited to adapting telemarketing techniques.  The total segment of the motor insurance market accounted for in this type of personal lines of business is approximately 10 per cent.  I understand in the United Kingdom the figure is approximately 40 per cent and it is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that it will increase.  I am concerned with ensuring that the solvency requirements and the general supervisory role of my Department is complied with, and all the information available to me suggests that it is.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the Cabinet requirements on all new entrants to the business?  In the 1980s the PMPA crisis was signalled well in advance by brokers and others, yet successive Governments continued to renew its licence.  Since that time we have witnessed the débâcle involving the Insurance Corporation of Ireland for which many banks had to pay.  There is a precedent for this and I want to know if the Minister is satisfied that new entrants to the market are secure as there is concern in the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A users' charter has recently been published by my Department.  The charter sets out standards of service on which every member of the public dealing with the Department is entitled to rely.  At present, a group responsible for quality service in my Department is being established which will oversee the ongoing implementation of the charter.  The task of the group will include consulting with staff on the charter and its delivery, the drafting of guidelines for use by staff and ensuring that staff are adequately trained in the process.  This will be carried out in the coming months.  The group will also monitor the charter on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to meet the requirements of our customers.  While the users' charter will be applicable throughout the whole Department, it may be augmented in particular areas, for example by setting out specific targets for customer service levels.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that the charter is not an end in itself, but a means of ensuring that a high quality of service continues to be provided by my Department.  The Companies Registration Office is in the process of setting up a users' council, representative of the principal organisations who are customers of the office, under the chairmanship of the Registrar.  In addition, I have written to the chairpersons of State bodies under the aegis of my Department requesting that a users' charter also be developed for their organisation, if one is not already in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a copy of the charter.  We all welcome its statement that people should be kind, courteous, efficient and so on.  Will the Minister accept that the greatest assistance his Department could give to the users, potential entrepreneurs or existing entrepreneurs would be to reduce the level of bureaucracy and red tape which many complain about frequently?  What are the Minister and his Department doing to ensure that red tape and bureaucracy is minimised throughout <Col N="1331" /> his Department and in the agencies for which he has responsibility?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the function of the charter will be to address issues such as information and access to service and to ensure promptness in dealing with queries.  A freephone service is in existence to help people setting up a business to get access to information as speedily as possible.  The county enterprise boards are establishing first stop shops to assist people at county level to access information quickly.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of bureaucracy for small business, that is an issue that was raised in many discussions of the problems of small business.  Naturally compliance costs will always be proportionately more expensive for a small business.  A review is under way to identify areas where we can introduce changes in the bureaucratic approach to minimise unnecessary bureaucracy and to deal effectively with queries and needs of small business.  At this stage it would be premature for me to suggest exactly the lines of change that will be introduced.  If the Deputy wishes to discuss the matter on another occasion I will be happy to discuss the possibilities.</P>

It is often completely circumscribed by regulations as to whom it may speak with.  I was pleased to read in the charter that names and positions of individuals in the Department will be freely given.</P>

I share the Deputy's general comments that we have a tradition of courtesy in the public service.  We need more openness and to monitor our effectiveness in this area. We need a good complaints procedure so that if people have difficulties they are dealt with quickly and we need to ensure a speedy response.  The document clearly indicates the people who are responsible in the different areas and provides the access numbers.  It will open up the Department to users.  The charter is the start of a process and over time it will develop as a vehicle for ensuring quality service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I am at present examining proposals for a differentiated apportionment between the 35 county enterprise boards of the funding provided for the overall initiative.  A final decision on the allocation for each board in 1996 will be communicated to the boards as soon as possible.  I am satisfied that the budgetary provision of £19.736 million for county enterprise boards in 1996 will enable them to achieve the broad targets set for the initiative in the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99, under which the boards are supported by EU funding.  The planned investment by both the State and the EU under the Operational Programme for this initiative amounts to over IR£81 million for the period 1995 to 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the need for a balanced programme of grant approval activity to be undertaken by boards throughout the course of the year, I have allocated provisional grant approval capacity of £180,000 to every board for the first six months of this year.  Approval of grants is now a matter of day-to-day responsibility for each county enterprise board and the phasing of the grant assistance they can make available over the course of the calendar year is a sensible means of scheduling their activity and prioritising projects in accordance with their enterprise plans. In this context, the boards were advised, as in previous years, to prioritise projects in accordance with their enterprise plans.  A balance must be struck between addressing the pressing claims <Col N="1334" /> of projects already on hands and retaining some flexibility to cope with anticipated demand at later stages in the year.</P>
    <P>The funding which will be provided to the boards in 1996 will ensure that they can continue to promote small business development and job creation with the commitment which they have displayed thus far.  However, there will always be more projects than there are public funds available to support them.  Boards will have to priorities their choices, selecting only those development projects which but for this initiative would not otherwise have been able to get off the ground and using their limited resources to leverage additional funding from other sources, including the private sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that when the county enterprise boards were set up under the National Development Plan they were given clear enterprise and job creation functions for areas not covered by the IDA and other industrial development agencies?  Does he agree that while they have proved successful, they are seriously curtailed due to a lack of funding?  Some counties will not have enough money to deal with applications this year.  If an entrepreneur has a business idea and his or her application for funding is not considered for nine months, the idea will be lost.  Lack of funding is retarding the work of enterprise boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that enterprise boards have made an impact.  They have issued grant approvals of £36 million which represents approximately 6,000 full time and 1,500 part time jobs and they are making good progress in turning those approvals into jobs.  As in any State agency dealing with taxpayers money, there is not a bottomless pit of money available.  The boards must identify the most important projects and use funding in the most effective manner. By and large, that is happening.  Like any Government, we must control public spending and are doing so by <Col N="1335" /> allowing boards to grant a reasonable level of approvals.  Much of the added value of county enterprise boards is not achieved by giving out grants, but by mentoring and introducing networks for businesses to support one another.  The Deputy's county has been successful in developing the loan fund initiative which is partly funded by the IFI. County enterprise boards are adding value to the operation of their counties in many ways other than through the allocation of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that substantial funding has been made available to Border regions under IFI, INTERREG and the operational programme and that they are administered by a large number of bodies and eight Government Departments?  Does he also agree that funds should be transferred from areas where the take up is poor?  Under ten headings in the IFI report there was only a meagre take up of funds in 1995.  The funds not taken up could be used for job creation projects by county enterprise boards.  The eight Government Departments, including the Department of the Taoiseach, involved in administering funds to Border regions should consider how such funds could be transferred to county enterprise boards for job creation purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the unused moneys to which the Deputy referred, but I will follow up the matter. County enterprise boards are not directly funded by the IFI under the European Operational Fund for Local and Rural Development.  However, in many cases they administer a loan fund which is partly funded by the IFI.  That fund has been a success and I will investigate if it contains additional resources that could be tapped.  The matter would have to be resolved interdepartmentally.  Money could be assigned to projects that are slow to take off, but there may still be a commitment to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to unused money.  A number of counties did not use the funding allocated to them under a number of IFI headings. There are two counties, in particular, which need funding from their enterprise boards but did not take up the funding allocated to them under the IFI.  It should be possible to transfer that funding to their county enterprise boards.</P>

While the county enterprise board in Donegal is attracting projects and creating jobs, 27 projects have been approved for 1996 and we are not yet half way through the year.

      <NameTxt>Cecelia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>How will £90,000 per quarter cover the backlog?  Projects are deselected after 12 months if they are not taken up.  We do not have funding to deal with the projects left over from last year not to mention the 27 that have been submitted this year.  How does the Minister propose we fund those projects?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate there are constraints on funding when large numbers of projects are involved.  Under the operational programme a budget of £81 million has been allocated over five years.  This year we are allocating approximately £20 million which is in accord with the programme we expect to be able to fund over the period in <Col N="1337" /> question.  We must live within the available resources for the programme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked if the flat amount which has been allocated to date to all counties, irrespective of size or need, is a fair way to approach the matter.  We need to examine the possibility of introducing an element of differentiation that would take account of need, capability of producing quality projects and performance.  I am currently examining the best way to do this and hope to be in a position to introduce an element of differentiation for counties with a high need, project capability and proven performance.  I do not know the precise position in Donegal but from listening to the Deputy, it appears it would benefit under such an approach.</P>

      <P>I support my constituency colleague, Deputy Leonard, in his efforts to link cross-Border funding to ensure we get the best value for money. Deputy O'Hanlon referred on numerous occasions to the small number of foreign industries we have attracted to Border regions.  The county enterprise boards must act as a one-stop-shop in providing funding for people trying to get businesses off the ground.  Therefore, they must be properly funded and organised.  I hope the Minister will take account of the difficulties being experienced and I have brought individual cases to his attention.  It is difficult to get the different funding sectors to work together.</P>

      <P>We are committed to conducting an evaluation of the county enterprise programme, and one of the issues that will be assessed is the extent to which it has been successful in delivering net new jobs that survive into the long-term.  The county enterprise boards work within a rule that requires them to consider the issue of displacement, and many of the boards are turning away applications precisely because of the displacement problem.  They have evaluation committees which carry out detailed evaluative work that ensures they are not creating a new project that simply puts someone else out of business.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to county enterprise boards in the Border area working with the IFI, but would he accept that there is still a lack of co-ordination among the agencies that can assist entrepreneurs, particularly in the Border area?  Two new agencies were established recently to administer the Delors package, the peace initiative money.  What initiatives has the Minister taken to ensure good co-ordination, because there are still many people with worthwhile projects who have to go from one agency to another to ensure that their applications are processed by one of the various agencies that have money to distribute?</P>

      <P>I accept that there can be user confusion, but in the case of most county enterprise boards &mdash; I cannot confirm whether it is so in the case of Cavan &mdash; first stop shops have been set up to enable people get clear information at one location about what is available in the county and the appropriate agency to assist them.  The Taoiseach's Department has established county enterprise teams representative of all the key agencies involved in support for enterprise.  This ensures that there is no overlapping or waste of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> There will, obviously, be some confusion while a new devolved initiative of this sort takes hold.  Each of those initiatives is adding value and that is reflected in some of the comments.  We must work through an effective system, provide good first stop shop access and avoid waste.  That is being delivered.</P>
    <P>Let me confirm for Deputy O'Rourke that, since 1 January, county enterprise boards must submit details of what is being approved, but they do not require approval from the Department for their activities.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that matters relating to project approvals by county enterprise boards and jobs created in CEB-assisted projects fall within the day-to-day responsibility of each board and are not matters in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>From the establishment of the CEBs until the end of 1995, 4,339 projects were approved by the boards.  During the same period, 4,663 full-time and 1,078 part-time jobs were created in CEB-assisted enterprises, according to figures supplied by the boards.  Those jobs are in place.  The figure I quoted earlier related to the number of jobs approved; 6,000 full-time jobs have been approved and 4,600 of those are in place.</P>

Will he accept that one of the main recommendations of the Culliton report related to the need to streamline the number of agencies involved in job creation?  Will he further accept that the State does not create jobs and that over the past ten years in this economy the number of full-time jobs increased by 48,000, that is 4,800 per year?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that we need to reduce rather than expand the number of agencies dealing with job creation nationwide?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this question refers to county enterprise boards, I presume the Deputy is asking whether they should be closed down.  I do not think that would be a wise decision since they are now taking root and providing a service in their respective areas. Early indications suggest that there is not a high level of displacement and that, as indicated, there are 4,500-plus full-time jobs in projects they have supported.  The cost per job is low, in other words, cost-effective.  They are responding to a need expressed by many Members that, while such agencies were effective at a national level in the case of large projects, small, start-up enterprises did not have the sort of support to see them effectively through their start-up phase, that we had a very high level of business failure in that phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county enterprise boards have put a great deal of work into supporting start-ups, with mentoring services and other network supports, to ensure they get through the start-up phase effectively but, like any element of public expenditure, they must be subject to scrutiny.  My Department is committed to carrying out a proper evaluation of their effectiveness in due course to assess whether they are delivering value for State money.  However, there is no indication at this time that they are not adding significant value for the expenditure allocated to them, which is in <Col N="1342" /> accord with many locally-based initiatives, in enterprise and in other areas, which have proven their worth in providing solutions to locally-based problems, with the participation of local people.  They have often been particularly effective and achieved something that could not have been done from Kildare Street, Merrion Street or indeed Wilton House.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the overlap between the various agencies in many counties which has and continues to lead to intense rivalry between sections of agencies, particularly IDA-Ireland, in its reincarnation, comprised of IDA-Ireland, Forbairt and Forfás &mdash; often descending into almost comic relief with constant rows about who should take telephone calls, inquiries or deal with another agency or member of its personnel?  What is the Minister's opinion on my Government's division of the former IDA?  Does he think it is working?  I do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably recall that at the time I was not a great fan of the idea but I have to say that, as a result, there is now a much clearer focus on the needs of indigenous business&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but they are all minding their own patch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While that may be a problem which needs to be addressed, there is a clear recognition that there is a huge difference between the needs of indigenous business and those of overseas investors.  By and large, overseas investors have very strong management functions, are strong in areas like research and development &mdash; not all of which is located in Ireland &mdash; very strong on human resource development, management skills within the company and on product development generally. In contrast, Irish companies tend to be weak in research and development, innovation and product design and in their commitment to training and <Col N="1343" /> human resource management.  Much of the work needed in indigenous companies falls within the arena of company development and requires a different approach.</P>
      <P>The argument has been advanced that those two very different tasks were not effectively carried out under the former Industrial Development Authority.  At this stage &mdash; with the segregation of that agency by the former Government &mdash; it would be most unhelpful to revert.  The task ahead is to ensure that the policies delivered by these agencies &mdash; which now have separate focuses &mdash; are effective.  If Deputy O'Rourke has concerns, based on her local experience, of how that resource is not being effectively used, I would be very pleased to hear them and I will endeavour to address them.  We are at present reviewing enterprise strategy in my Department, a large element of which is to ensure the effective delivery of services by indigenous enterprise.  Therefore, I would be more than interested to hear her criticisms and-or suggestions in this area.</P>

      <P>In replying to the preceding question the Minister spoke of reviewing the system of funding and so on.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the general approach adopted nationwide.  What we shall establish more over time is the cost per job created &mdash; in which respect Cavan would rank as quite effective &mdash; but also the long-term survivorship of <Col N="1344" /> such jobs, ensuring that approvals are translated into jobs that survive the acid test of successful selection procedures by county enterprise boards.  However, it will be some time before we have sufficient information to build that into a process of allocating future funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taken aback by the Minister's comment that his view on county enterprise boards when first established has changed.  I understand there is a total of some 80 job creation agencies nationwide.  When I look at towns where such offices have been established I am of the firm belief that, if they all moved simultaneously to the centres toward which they lean, they would create a traffic jam.  I am thinking of Cork city and other large towns in the region where such offices have been established.  While they may help to reduce numbers on the live register temporarily, they do not create sustainable jobs.  It is ridiculous to have that number of job creation agencies.  When spokesperson for his party in Opposition the Minister constantly reminded us about cost-effectiveness and the general conduct of business; now that he is in the driving seat, is it not time he examined this realistically and adopted a sensible rational approach to job creation on the part of such agencies?</P>

      <P>This has been a very useful discussion.  It is a good exercise for all of us to question structures and departmental functions, especially since, collectively, we have not adequately dealt with job creation.  My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, sought the Minister's views on the fragmentation of the Industrial Development Authority. Within the context of this discussion on the need to provide jobs and get the mechanism right, does the Minister agree that the experiment of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government of abolishing the Department of Labour and converting it into the new Department of Enterprise and Employment failed? Does he agree there is now need to think seriously about the restoration of a Department of Labour, with a separate one to be known either as the Department of Industry and Commerce or Enterprise and Employment?  This fundamental question is at the heart of this debate.  Despite what the Minister said, the Department is not working and the unemployment figures speak for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not produced any evidence to suggest that the fundamental problem is the merger of the Labour and Enterprise portfolios in one Department.  Training is the key to success in the creation of employment and industrial development and it does not make sense to separate it from the other aspects of industrial support. The merger has been beneficial and the <Col N="1346" /> Department is delivering effective services.  It is seeking in its SMI process to focus these services more clearly.</P>
      <P>It is important not to divorce labour law and training from the industrial, employment and enterprise milieu where they achieve their ultimate goals. The merger makes much sense in that there is a unified approach to issues.  As Culliton underlined, employment is not a one dimensional issue; it spans many issues and the enterprise approach also needs to span these.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments.  There are many problems with the county enterprise boards and much confusion. Many business people who are confused about to whom they should apply have told me they have applied to all the organisations in case they are left out. Have criteria been established within Department and given to the county enterprise boards to help and guide them on the kind of projects they should grant aid?  When I met recently with the association which represents private nursing homes it informed me that some county enterprise boards grant aid the expansion of nursing homes while others do not.  It said that this lack of uniformity had led to much annoyance among its members.  This is happening also in other sectors &mdash; it has been brought to my attention in at least one other case.  Will the Minister say if there are guidelines and uniformity and, if not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines deal with issues such as displacement and the need to ensure that projects have a viable commercial basis.  They ensure that projects are sound, will not affect someone else and could not get off the ground without the assistance of the county enterprise boards.  We deliberately encourage boards to look at the strengths of their county and to skew their support towards the areas they want to see developed.  For example, some boards may wish to lay emphasis on tourism and as a result their custom <Col N="1347" /> and practice in terms of the projects they grant aid will differ from those of other boards.  We do not tell them they must grant aid nursing homes; rather we allow them to make those decisions. They make their decisions on the basis of the other projects seeking aid and what they regard as a priority.  There is not uniformity and it would be senseless to delegate authority and to then insist on uniformity.  We give the boards discretion and they make their decisions on the basis of their resources and the most important and rewarding projects in job terms.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think from the statements made by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, Deputy <Col N="1423" /> O'Donoghue, that this was the first time crime was a problem.  I have checked the statistics on crime and Deputy O'Donoghue would do well to refresh his memory on the level of indictable crime and the record of his party in office in dealing head on with this problem.  The statistics on the major increase in crime in the Dublin metropolitan area and other areas from 1987-94 do not make happy reading.</P>
      <P>The responses by previous Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice, Commissioner Flynn, and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn by way of minor amendments to the criminal justice system did not get to the heart of dealing with vicious crime, particularly that perpetrated in the past year or two.  The Minister is dealing with vicious crime which is a cause of great concern and which must be dealt with firmly.  Offenders who commit vicious crimes must be punished by a penalty that fits the crime.  I want the strongest possible action taken to deal with such offenders.</P>
      <P>There is a recognition that the balance between the liberty of the individual <i>vis-à-vis</i> the punishment handed down by the courts over the years has been tipped substantially in favour of the liberty of the individual in the type of legislation enacted and in our attitude which demonstrates that the liberty of the individual is considered more seriously than is the attack made by the State, the Garda and the courts system on the criminal.  The Minister for Justice published a package of criminal justice measures on 30 January last and announced them in various statements before then.  They take serious account of the viciousness that has crept into crime and I hope they will deal effectively with drug barons and other criminals that feed off the State and the underprivileged in communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the drug trafficking Bill will ensure a firm line is taken to deal with the owners of pubs, discos, hotels and places of entertainment where drugs are <Col N="1424" /> distributed, as well as those who distribute them to ensure that such offenders are put away once and for all.</P>
    <P>Regarding the operational management of the Garda Síochána I cannot understand why if people are certain of the criminal nature of people who distribute drugs in communities, swift action cannot be taken to prosecute them.  I hope the additional powers to arrest offenders on suspicion of illegal activity will assist the Garda Síochána to remove them from society.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is taking seriously the viciousness in crime in the past number of years.  This Bill as well as other criminal legislation in the pipeline will go a long way towards allaying fears in the community and will contribute to developing a proper legislative structure to deal with such offenders.  In addition, the reorganisation of the courts and the Garda Síochána to enable them deal effectively with crime is important.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Donoghue advocates measures to be taken on various issues, he should note that his party's record in this area is abysmal.  Major legislation had to be introduced by the Minister for the Environment when ordinary people felt they were prisoners in their homes because of rather harsh amendments made by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, to the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  People in rural Ireland did not feel they could go to their local pubs for a drink because of the fear of losing their driving licences.  If that is the type of unbalanced criminal justice system Deputy O'Donoghue advocates, I am delighted to oppose him.  It is unworthy of him to admonish the Minister for Justice who is making every effort to tackle vicious crime and then to rather limply support the legislation before the House.  We should have more balance in our statements.  We are all here to ensure that vicious criminals are put out of society. I hope the additional powers of arrest under the Bill will help the Garda to meet the challenges that face them in every community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Bill.  Considering that the Minister has seen fit to come before the House to introduce a criminal law Bill, I am surprised she has not taken the opportunity to address the serious fears that occupy people's minds at present.  I am also disappointed she has not taken the opportunity to present proposals which would practically and realistically address the problem of curbing serious crime.  While no one will object to the repeal of certain sections of the Whipping Act or amendment of the Slave Trade Act, a requirement which I am sure was requested by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, and considered by him to be a grave necessity, the time of this House would be better spent introducing measures which would allow women to walk the streets at night or during the day without fear, or elderly people to sleep soundly in their beds before the light of dawn announces they have survived another night.  Worthy though these measures may be and as necessary as it is to differentiate between felonies and misdemeanours, the Minister has not yet realised the despair and anguish outside the confines of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister read the reports of senior gardaí which must have been piling up on her desk during the past year?  Does she read the newspapers and absorb the now almost daily reports of murder and unlawful killings which litter the media headlines?  I realise the Minister cannot prevent every murder or catch the culprits after their foul deeds, but she is the Minister for Justice, charged with responsibility for ensuring a climate exists that will indicate to those who consider committing severe crimes against the person that their crime will be speedily detected and the full rigours of the law will apply to those convicted.  That is not the case at present.  While I congratulate the gardaí on their swift and effective solution of many of the recent murders, I question if they have all the necessary resources for tackling the gangland killings and the murder for hire contractors who <Col N="1426" /> seem to be escaping the net.  Is the Minister sending out our Garda force not fully equipped in manpower, equipment or financial resources to cover overtime?  This is important if we are to address our major crime problem.</P>
    <P>If the penny-pinching of the Minister for Social Welfare in his treatment of students is any guideline to the approach of the Government to the funding of necessary works and schemes, then the Minister for Justice may as well throw in the towel at this stage, as her record of alerting her Cabinet colleagues to her financial requirements and enlisting their support is dismal.</P>
    <P>I question whether the Minister has done well by the gardaí who served her, the Department and this State since she took over her present responsibilities.  I can think of a great many improvements in legislation, conditions and the provision of resources which would improve the general public's perception of the state of law and order in this State today.  To put it in modern parlance, the Minister should get a life and wake up to the reality that this country is falling apart around her and the rest of her Cabinet colleagues.  The paltry proposals before us today could best be described as rearranging the deckchairs on the <i>Titantic</i> as this inept Government of fiddlers plays &ldquo;Abide With Me&rdquo; softly in the background, as the ship of State slips slowly under the waves.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us needs some backbone, some positive proposals which will reassure our people that there is a Legislature aware of their needs and the crises which is quietly rocking this country and that it is willing and able to do something about it.  Nothing they have seen from this Administration in the area of law and order would give them confidence.  There have not been any far-sighted measures, dynamic action, cohesive plan or clear explanations of those operations approved by the Government which went sadly wrong. This Government is made up of men and women in mohair suits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> One far-reaching proposal I commend to the Minister is the greater use of DNA testing and the creation of a bank of files which would quickly and reliably assist in the detection of major crimes against the person.  I query whether the Minister can realistically take on board such a proposal as she would need all her clout at Cabinet to see it past her colleagues who would regard it as an erosion of civil liberties.  I will return to that aspect of the proposal shortly but first I will outline some of the benefits of DNA testing.  Having made the recent breakthrough of introducing the use of tape recorders for the taking of depositions in legal matters, will the Minister go for broke and, in one daring measure, reduce to minuscule proportions the time it takes to detect serious violent crime and dramatically increase the detection rate, thereby reducing the incidence of repeat crime?</P>
    <P>The use of DNA technology here is in its infancy but I submit that the procedure holds the key to keeping the serious crime wave in check in the foreseeable future.  I have no doubt that there would be widespread and overwhelming support for it from the people in the street as they are the ones who have to live with the constant threat of violent crime, and have lived in the climate of fear which has pervaded this country for several years and which is regularly reinforced by the content of horrific news bulletins.  They have no time for the niceties of civil liberties or the splitting of hairs on the right to remain silent.  All they want is that murderers, rapists and other violent people be taken out of circulation at the earliest possible moment and kept there until it is safe to let them back on the streets.  That can be done more readily by the extensive use of DNA profiling and I call on the Minister to initiate such a programme forthwith.  This relatively new science has found favour in many jurisdictions already, serving them well, and does not seem to have adversely affected their civil liberties to an <Col N="1428" /> appreciable extent.  For instance, in Northern Ireland powers were extended 12 months ago to allow the RUC greater use of DNA profiling.  I have not heard adverse reports on this new measure from that source.  That move brought Northern Ireland into line with the British regime which has been making use of this detection tool for some time.  The serial killer or rapist may be tracked very easily if this relatively simple method is made available to the Garda Síochána.  There is a recorded case in the UK of a rapist who has struck several times and had been terrorising the neighbourhood.  The police sought and received the co-operation of 150 men on a housing estate who supplied saliva samples for matching with semen samples taken from the rapist's victims and were able quickly to identify and apprehend the offender, thereby ending his reign of terror.  Can we justify not using this resource to the fullest? Will the public forgive us if we do not move decisively immediately?</P>
    <P>Reports were carried in last Sunday's newspapers that we did not have the available expertise to carry out the large number of tests that were necessary in apprehending the killer of the late Imelda Riney and that we had to draft in help from the RUC to make reasonable progress.  Will the Minister tell us if this is true and why it should be so?  Do we not have enough staff?  Are we once more dependent on help from outside the jurisdiction to do what we should be capable of doing ourselves?  Are our citizens not worthy of the fullest protection, the best service our police force can offer in the light of the technology and expertise available today?  Will the Minister explain why we are lagging behind in this area?  Is it due to a shortage of money, a lack of will or co-operation on the part of the Minister or her Cabinet colleagues which denies us this invaluable aid?</P>
    <P>I believe that DNA testing of huge numbers of people to exclude them from police inquiries or to narrow the list of suspects will be taking place in the future and that it will be seen not only <Col N="1429" /> as desirable but a very necessary tool in maintaining law and order.  The next logical step in the progression is to remove the random nature of the testing and eventually to have a complete file of DNA profiles for the whole population.  That would mean the compulsory taking of samples from everyone and the best time to do that is at birth, thereby we will have on file and almost instantly available through computer programmes, the necessary information to identify the perpetrator of a serious crime where a DNA sample would be available.</P>
    <P>A thief or other criminal may be able to leave the scene of a crime without having left fingerprints but a rapist by his very nature will leave behind sufficient DNA samples to be able to identify him through his genetic fingerprints. Likewise a killer may leave behind traces of skin under the finger nails of his victim which would readily identify him, saving the public further risk and the police innumerable hours of investigation.  I think we would be grossly negligent not to investigate with the utmost speed and determination what this system has to offer.  I have no doubt that the demand for such an information bank will be deafening from a public weary of needless crime.</P>
    <P>We have come to rely heavily &mdash; almost fully on fingerprints and we hold few reservations that there may be a miscarriage of justice as a result of their use.  The possibility of two people carrying the same DNA profile are, we are assured, 30 million to one.  In practical terms this means that there may be two people in the whole of Britain and Ireland whose profile may match with others.  There is a very slim chance that such duplication, with a resultant incorrect accusation, would be successful as other evidence such as alibi would be able to establish a person's innocence. Few methods of detection are foolproof but few are as safe as the one I propose. In other jurisdictions which are properly equipped to use such a system all males, when the known location of a suspect has been narrowed down, may be asked <Col N="1430" /> to give samples for DNA testing.  It is a voluntary act but those who refuse to co-operate are subject to investigation. In view of the fact that without DNA profiling all of those people would have had to be thoroughly investigated, I would find no difficulty with the system. Equally, the principle that if one is innocent one has no need to fear is applicable, although I know that some people have a difficulty in accepting this reasoning and stand on principle in their objection.</P>
    <P>Much of the success of the system would, of course, depend on the level of anonymity accorded those whose &ldquo;genetic fingerprints&rdquo; are on record.  This would be a vital element, though in the light of the discovery this week of important State packets thrown near a railway line far from their origin and destination, I doubt the capacity of this Government to operate any secure and confidential service.  Liberty, a civil right group in England does not oppose the use of genetic fingerprinting though it does sound this note of caution: &ldquo;We believe that DNA sampling can be a very useful tool in the fight against crime.  However, the police must ensure that information from suspects is destroyed if they are eliminated from the inquiries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is hardly feasible if the data bank is to be maintained, but a rigorous protection of the information would, of course, be vital.  There is no trauma involved in giving a sample of DNA which can be taken as easily from blood, saliva or one strand of hair as from any other source.  There would be no risk to anybody and I have been assured that it is possible to successfully take and process the sample at birth.</P>
    <P>The proof of its acceptability to the public and its understanding of its necessity is supported in the percentage of people who readily co-operate with the police.  There is a public perception that genetic fingerprinting has more uses and advantages than drawbacks and not all the cases in which the system is used are murder, rape and assault. Sometimes it is used merely to identify <Col N="1431" /> conclusively the parentage of a child and of course was used in identification in the X case.  There is ample precedent at present to show that this form of new technology has many advantages for the public at large and at the risk of repeating myself and I am prepared to state fairly conclusively from my own inquiries that the public would welcome this breakthrough in making and keeping our streets safe.</P>
    <P>In recommending this radical measure I caution the Minister against rushing into such a scheme without proper detailed study.  I am happy to support it in principle but rigorous safeguards must be built into the system and stringent guidelines defined which will see such a register used only in serious cases of violence.</P>
    <P>At their annual conference this week the Garda Representative Association called for a register of serious crimes to be set up which would prevent people who have been convicted of sexual offences being employed in sensitive positions.  That is only logical and any reasonable person would not see in this proposal an erosion of civil rights or liberties.</P>

      <P>I am more than a little tired of hearing civil liberties groups whining about civil rights when there is a suggestion of a curtailment of those rights of people either convicted of serious crime or where there is bona fides evidence of serious crime having been committed.  I prefer to concentrate on the most basic civil right of all, the right to life, the right to walk the streets unmolested and the right of people to safety and a feeling of security in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to ask the families of murder victims, the victims of serious assault or rape about civil liberties I am <Col N="1432" /> sure we would get a different perspective.  Reports of murders and manslaughter have become commonplace. There are many deep-seated reasons why the incidence of killing has become all too frequent and many measures the Minister or her colleagues could implement to enhance the public perception of the value of life and eliminate the view that life is cheap and that it is easy to get away with killing.</P>
    <P>There are many measures the Minister could implement to make our television screens more suitable for youthful viewing, but that would mean abandoning some of her liberal agenda which, as we know, would not go down well with her colleagues from the minority colours of the rainbow.</P>

      <P>My criticism of this legislation is not so much that I am against the measures it contains, that it carries flaws or is misdirected, but rather that it is the wrong legislation for the Minister to be pursuing in these dangerous, fear-laden times. While it may be a humane act to remove the whipping provisions from the Statute Book and one with which we, as legislators, would agree, would the public who have borne the brunt of robberies, violence and a litany of other crimes agree that it is for this the Minister should be using her valuable parliamentary time?</P>
      <P>She should take back this Bill and return with much needed criminal justice legislation which will tackle the real issues, not the petty whims of a cloud-nine Government.  Otherwise, we will be the whipping boys and girls of a disgruntled and angry public.</P>

      <P>The Opposition does not talk about what is needed to solve crime.  I have heard nothing for a long time from any member of the Opposition about the requirement, if we are to solve crime and deal with the crime wave, that the Garda Síochána has to collect enough evidence that will stand up in court to secure a conviction.  The same is true of members of the Garda Síochána when they get together in their associations.  There is a need for clarity and fairness in the law in order to do this.  That is what that Bill seeks to bring about in one part.  I cannot honestly see why Fianna Fáil is getting into such a sweat about it.</P>
      <P>Another requirement is that the functioning of the courts should be sensible and transparent.  I do not accuse them of being anything else, but there are times when it is difficult for the ordinary lay person to understand what is going on. This Bill addresses a certain number of items which will make the functioning of the courts and their decisions more sensible and transparent.  That will prove useful.</P>
      <P>What Deputies opposite have chosen to highlight are the funny bits of the Bill.  Deputy O'Donoghue amused himself by referring to garrotters, but he did not read the Bill.  What they have forgotten to notice about what they call its funny bits is that the various repeals and abolitions which they find so amusing and, apparently, irrelevant, are, simply, incidental to and consequent on its principal and central provision, the abolition of the distinction between misdemeanours and felonies.  If they find that funny, that is their privilege, but they should not take up the time of the House with their schoolboy jokes and infantile attention to this detail.  They do themselves a great disservice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Kenneally and have what would be an unofficial record of the remarks of Deputy O'Donoghue, the spokeman on Justice of the principal party in Opposition.  Who, in God's name, writes this rubbish?  The pages of his speech are littered with atrocious puns and self-indulgent rococo <Col N="1434" /> language.  I will not quote him as I feel I would have to wash out my mouth afterwards.</P>
    <P>It is a piece of knockabout comedy in which he does not, except in one respect, deal with a substantial provision of the Bill.  It is the most frivolous speech I have ever heard on any serious issue in this Dáil.  I am afraid he has clearly indicated and proved, when it comes to talking about our system of law and justice, that Fianna Fáil is utterly bankrupt.  He has cast himself down into the pit of absolute irrelevance.</P>
    <P>He is one of the people who appeared to agree with a pronunciamento &mdash; a most outrageous statement &mdash; made some time ago by the Lord Mayor of Cork whose contribution to the debate on law and order was that savage crimes deserve savage punishment.  All the yahoos on the Fianna Fáil benches jumped up and down shouting, &ldquo;hurray, let us have more of it&rdquo;.  However, when a Bill is brought before the House that seeks to make a serious attempt to deal with one part of the law in relation to the definition of offences for the purpose of their prosecution, these gung-ho savages who want to impose savage punishments for savage crimes turn around and say &ldquo;we cannot have that&rdquo; and back away.  They want firm action on law and order until they have to legislate.  They want, as Deputy O'Donoghue said, to talk about everything except what the Minister is proposing to do.  They do not want us to ask them to make a decision or take responsibility for anything.</P>
    <P>I want the Deputy to think about one matter.  I wish to refer to two cases &mdash; I will not use any names, but the Deputies opposite know what I am talking about &mdash; involving road traffic offences.  In one the person concerned was under the influence of alcohol and in the other a different drug.  In both instances, although they had killed other people, they managed to get home, drink and have themselves signed into hospital to avoid being accused or brought before <Col N="1435" /> the courts to answer the charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or a narcotic drug.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to deal with that matter.  I would like the Deputy and his colleagues to say that they are happy that we should continue to allow people to drive while drunk, time to get home and drink a glass of whiskey to avoid the charge that should be properly laid against them of driving while under the influence of alcohol thereby avoiding the full punishment for the crime they have committed.  If the Deputy means what he said, he wants this situation to continue.  I want him to say this in plain terms so that the people will know what he means.  I find it disgraceful that the party which has shouted so much about law and order, particularly since the Minister took office, should take that view.</P>
    <P>Having been Minister for Justice, I will tell the Deputy what it is like not to be Minister for Justice &mdash; I am not sure that he will ever have that experience or share it with me.  Suddenly, it is no longer a case of bad news 24 hours a day, seven days a week or getting telephone calls at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. to the effect that somebody has committed suicide or that there has been a robbery or murder.</P>
    <P>Those are not the words of the Minister who will not have and does not deserve to have the experience of being an ex-Minister for Justice for a long time to come.  Nor are they my words as a former Minister for Justice, although I can vouch for them.  They are not the words of a Minister who has been in office at a time which Deputy O'Donoghue and his colleagues characterise as &ldquo;the black night of crime&rdquo;, a Minister who, in the Deputy's lurid language, is &ldquo;surfing on a crime wave&rdquo;.  They are the words of a Minister who was in office in what the Deputy and his colleagues must regard as the golden age, when there were no murders, unsolved crime, rapes, muggings or robberies; they are the words of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, a former Minister for Justice.  Those <Col N="1436" /> exact sentiments would be shared by any person who has ever been or ever will be Minister for Justice because that is how life is for those Ministers.  Even if the level of crime were half what it is now or what it was when Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was Minister for Justice, Ministers in that Department would still feel this way.  For Deputy O'Donoghue and his colleagues to pretend that the rate of crime depends on who is Minister for Justice is dishonest. It is another aspect of the bankruptcy which has led him to say nothing about the substance of the Bill and regale us, if that is the word, with the worst kind of smart-alec drivel produced by whichever yob in Fianna Fáil who writes these speeches.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue must be feeling a bit hurt because, for some extraordinary reason, a substantial part of his contribution was devoted to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has nothing directly to do with this Bill. Obviously the Minister of State hurt him by telling the truth &mdash; he said Deputy O'Donoghue was lying to the people by pretending there were bodies in every ditch, muggings on every train and all sorts of dreadful things happening every time he drove from his home or Leinster House.  Deputy O'Donoghue does nothing to improve the detection of crime or reduce the number of offences by this rubbish.  He also said the current Minister for Justice pioneered the &ldquo;revolving-door&rdquo; system but she did not, no more than Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, Deputy Noonan or I did.  There are perfectly good reasons for that, as the Deputy would know if he took the time to think about it, and there are serious problems which lead to a small part of it.</P>
    <P>This Bill puts before us a series of new provisions to which Deputy O'Donoghue did not refer.  If he had taken the time to read it with any attention he would have welcomed it.  The bland bombshell, Deputy O'Donnell is another of those who pretends we are drowning in a wave of crime but at least she had the honesty to see what was <Col N="1437" /> provided for in the Bill and to welcome it.  The first new provision is in section 2 (1) &mdash; Deputy O'Donoghue should make a note of that because it would do him no harm to read it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection creates a new class of offences and abolishes the distinction between a misdemeanour and a felony.  There is another new provision concerning the power of a garda to arrest on foot of a warrant or an order of committal even when it does not have the warrant or the order in his possession &mdash; he can be required to produce it as soon as practicable.  The Deputy could have asked about that provision; perhaps if he gives it some thought and the blood stops rushing to his head between now and Committee Stage, he will debate that section because an interesting argument can be made about it.</P>
      <P>The central provision of this Bill states that a member of the Garda Síochána may enter and search any place where a person whom he suspects of having committed a crime is to be found.  Deputy O'Donoghue suspects this may be unconstitutional and either he or his speechwriter has gone to the trouble of reading Article 40.5 of the Constitution which states that the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has rightly drawn attention to that because it is important to all of us.  However, where does this leave the cases I mentioned earlier, where the inviolability of the dwelling has become a means of people to escape answering the full extent of charges which should be laid against them for offences they have committed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to discuss previous Supreme Court decisions on this matter, beginning with People <i>v.</i> O'Brien in 1965.  In that case, the court came to the conclusion it did because there is no <Col N="1438" /> provision in law which provides otherwise than in Article 40.5.  He then cited O'Mahoney <i>v.</i> Shields in 1988, which said that the Oireachtas might consider it desirable to amend section 8 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, to require more substantive information to be put before a District Court judge who has been asked to produce a search warrant.  For the Deputy to introduce that in the context of section 6 of this Bill is utter frivolity.  Section 8 of the 1926 Act is the provision allowing inspectors to discover whether people possess an unlicensed radio or television set.  This is not easily detectable from outside so there naturally must be a hesitation about allowing people to enter.  I am not sure what view the courts take about the reliability of detection vans.  Most of us in this House have had the experience of canvassing after dark in winter and finding that some people will not open their doors because they think it is the television inspector.  To compare that to section 6 of this Bill shows the relevance of Fianna Fáil's thought processes to the matters dealt with in this legislation.  I hope our newly elected barrister, who is most welcome to the House and appearently wishes to interrupt, will reflect on that before he speaks, because if he does not give that more consideration than his solicitor colleague, my faith in the legal profession within Fianna Fáil will be reduced to zero.</P>
    <P>There are several other new provisions which Deputy O'Donoghue has not mentioned.  Under section 7, which deals with penalities for existing offenders, there is a new offence to replace the common law offence of being an accessory after the fact to a felony.  If the Deputy read the section he would discover that this makes it possible to prosecute people for things which have not been offences up to now.  If he went on to read section 8, dealing with penalities for concealing offences, he would discover new provisions which will also help to bring to justice people who assist in or cover up various offences relating to selling <Col N="1439" /> drugs.  Most people will think this a useful provision but Deputy O'Donoghue did not see fit to refer to it &ldquo;good, bad or indifferent&rdquo;, as the late Deputy Lenihan would have said.  That is a shame, because if the main Opposition party cannot address the real issues the obligation on the Government side is even greater, but we will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>Section 9 introduces another interesting new provision.  I will quote the explanatory memorandum because I would not like to tax Deputy O'Donoghue by making him listen to the section &mdash; I would hate to tire him out in case he missed a few more bodies in ditches on his way home:</P>
    <P>[Section 9 (4)] contains the general rule ... under which it will be possible for a person to be found guilty of a less serious offence than the one with which he or she is charged.</P>
    <P>That measure is no mere bagatelle. Deputy Lenihan, who probably has more experience in court than Deputy O'Donoghue, will know that frequently there are difficulties when it emerges as a case is proceeding that the court will not find enough evidence to convict a person of the offence with which he has been charged but would have serious difficulty convicting him of a lesser offence, even if it is quite clear that he has committed such an offence.  The provisions in this Bill are very sensible and do not leave that matter to chance in quite the same way.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes clear, explicit, legislative provision for that.  We will find that very useful over a wide range of motoring offences and, perhaps, even more importantly, over a wide range of offences to do with trafficking in drugs. I wonder why the main intellectural tyro of an Opposition spokesperson on justice did not spot that and find it worth his while to comment on.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should read the explanatory memorandum to the Bill as it is very useful.  It states, on section 9, that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> Subsection (5) provides that for the purposes of subsection (4) any allegation of an indictable offence shall be taken as including an allegation of attempting to commit that offence, so that a person charged with having committed an indictable offence may, as at present, be convicted of the attempt.  The subsection also provides that, if a person is charged on indictment with attempting to commit an offence or with an assault or other act preliminary to an offence, he or she may be convicted of the offence charged notwithstanding that he or she is shown to be guilty of the completed offence.</P>
    <P>That is a very useful provision in clarifying the law.  If I am any judge of what I hear from the Garda and legal practitioners, that will turn out to be a very useful section.  It will deal with many cases where, as Deputy O'Donoghue may be aware, the Garda feel hampered and sometimes let down by the courts in dealing with the different levels of an offence in the full context of a charge brought before the court.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (3) gives a court a general power to fine an offender convicted on indictment.  That has not been clear up to now and is also a very useful provision.</P>
    <P>In referring to the Schedules, Deputy O'Donoghue was really scraping the bottom of the barrel to find a target for some knockabout comedy.  If the Deputy could get his head around the idea that the repeals and so on are incidental to, and consequent upon, the main provision of the Bill, he would find out that the only provision which needs to be laughed at is his innocence in falling into the trap laid for him by the genius who wrote the rubbish he delivered here today.</P>

      <P>The Bill is two pronged: it simplifies procedure with regard to search warrants and arrests, and it repeals some of the outdated laws on our Statute Book.  At a time of spiralling crime rates, there is a need to draw a very sensitive balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of society.  In this regard, I am particularly concerned about a case which came to my notice today.  It appears that a case involving an alleged heroin dealer was thrown out of court because industrial action in the Chief State Solicitor's office meant that while the book of evidence was ready, it could not be served. That is incredible.</P>

      <P>The drug diamorphine should be made available to the medical profession for its various benefits, especially in hospice care.  Raising this matter on the Adjournment is, at least, providing an opportunity to debate an issue which should have been dealt with a long time ago.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter in October 1995 in a parliamentary question and the written reply I received from the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consultations with the Irish Association of Palliative Care, I am satisfied that available drugs for the control of pain in patients suffering from terminal illnesses are satisfactory. <Col N="1442" /> I am not aware of any demand that diamorphine, or heroin as it is commonly known, be legalised in this State.</P>
    <P>He further stated there are currently arrangements in place whereby patients travelling to this State from Northern Ireland or Great Britain may bring diamorphine with them for their own use.</P>
    <P>The final part of the reply brings me to the reason for my request that the drug should be legalised for use here.  It is the drug of choice in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  In Donegal I have been closely associated with hospice care since it was set up in association with the Foyle Hospice, which is the flagship of hospice care in this island, with its coordinator, Dr. Tom McGinley.  It caters for many patients in Derry, Tyrone and Donegal.  Many of my patients who are treated in the Foyle residential hospice are likely to be treated at home by hospice nurses afterwards.  Consequently, if they were to continue with the treatment they had commenced in Derry, they would be breaking the law here.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has to rely in these matters in accordance with the professional advice available to him. However, perhaps he would allow me to add the benefit of my experience.  For various reasons the use of diamorphine &mdash; heroin &mdash; has not yet been legalised here and, consequently, in most parts of the State people have not have any experience of its use.  Therefore, I am not surprised there has not been widespread demand for its legalisation. However, the situation in the Donegal-Derry area is probably unique.  I assure the Minister that once a patient has got used to being treated with this drug, he or she would not generally wish that treatment to be discontinued.  To put it in its most simple terms, the facts about the drugs are as follows.  Diamorphine is six times more soluble than morphine. It can also be administered subcutaneously that is, underneath the skin &mdash; a patient of mine who died last week was literally skin and bone &mdash; whereas morphine has to be injected into the muscle. <Col N="1443" /> This is virtually impossible in many terminal cases.  In cases of extreme pain, large doses are necessary and this can be administered in much smaller volumes.  In the patient's home the hospice nurse connects up a syringe driver, which with diamorphine can last for 24 to 36 hours before needing to be removed, whereas the other substance requires removal three times per day.</P>
    <P>It is true that another form of morphine, namely hydromorphine, is also available.  However, it is only half as soluble as diamorphine.  It could also be argued that diamorphine breaks down into morphine but it only breaks down into that eventually.</P>
    <P>As the Minister's reply last October stated, patients travelling from Britain or the North to this State can bring diamorphine with them for their own use.  This is a highly undesirable practice as far as any drug is concerned, particularly diamorphine.  Surely the sensible thing is to allow the medical profession to use its discretion in the matter, rather than have lay people in possession of a drug which is illegal here and which would make a doctor or nurse liable to prosecution if they administered it in this State?  I hope the Minister of State will see the logic in this argument.</P>
    <P>The Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin, volume 24 No. 23 of November 1986 commented on heart attacks, the other common cause of distress.  It stated with regard to the immediate primary care of a suspected heart attack patient approximately half the patients who suffered from cardiac malfunction died within a month, many within hours, many of them from acute left ventricular failure.  It also stated that pain relief is necessary immediately, that a strong analgesic, diamorphine 5.10 mg., preferably by slow intravenous injection, is the drug of choice and that acute left ventricular failure should be treated with diamorphine.</P>
    <P>Should the Minister ever require diamorphine, or should I have a heart attack, I hope it will be available to us.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of clarifying the position in regard to this matter and I thank the Deputy for raising the topic. I will refer the issues he has raised to the Chief Medical Officer.  This matter has been raised on previous occasions and I am glad to be able to reiterate my Department's position in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a party to the various UN conventions on narcotic drugs and the various recommendations and resolutions adopted by the competent UN bodies on this question of diamorphine. The current international policy on diamorphine, which has been in place since 1954, urges all governments to prohibit the manufacture, import and export of diamorphine except for such small amounts as may be necessary for scientific purposes only.  This international policy is based on the belief that there are sufficient other drugs available for the treatment and control of pain.</P>
      <P>My Department held consultations with the Irish Association of Palliative Care on the use of diamorphine.  As a result of these consultations, I am satisfied that patients suffering from terminal illnesses have available to them an adequate range of drugs to control pain.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Health has made the development of cancer services, including palliative care for cancer patients a particular priority since taking office.  I am not aware of a significant demand for making diamorphine available in this State.  I trust this explanation will be sufficient to allay the Deputy's concerns on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of country houses and restaurants throughout the country under the aegis <Col N="1445" /> of the Irish Country Houses and Restaurants Association who do good work for the tourism industry and the community in presenting excellent cuisine. However, a number of them have a problem in recruiting experienced staff.</P>
      <P>The association has been concerned for many years with the difficulties encountered by the hotel and restaurant industry in obtaining the services of sometimes full-time but mainly part-time casual labour, especially married women.  The industry could take a good number of married women off the Live Register and give them gainful employment.  However, time and again they encounter great difficulty in doing so due to the lack of incentives, including imposition of taxes and levies.</P>
      <P>My case is more relevant to the Department of Finance, but perhaps the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, may refer the matter to that Department.  Given that he is so involved in tourism development and promotion, he possibly understands my concern.</P>
      <P>In certain cases the welfare of the women could be helped enormously.  If women who depend on support from husbands drawing unemployment assistance or in receipt of other State benefits are employed, their husbands will lose benefits.  In the overall context of the various grants, allowances or other funding given to industry, it is unjustifiable that we cannot do something to help these married women obtain employment which would, in a majority of cases, give them pride in themselves and some form of independent financial support.  All that is needed is that a proper, worthwhile allowance be given to them on a weekly basis.  In the overall context of the tax system, a weekly working wife's allowance of £120 per week &mdash; with no PAYE or PRSI contribution required &mdash; would not materially affect the Government's financial returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the association, who provide considerable employment in this country, are aggrieved that they cannot employ married women, either on a full-time or a part-time basis, in <Col N="1446" /> what would be mostly menial jobs.  Each year sizeable lobby groups make successful proposals to the Department of Finance to have various allowances and grants made to them.  Regrettably the position of women is weak, therefore, no group has helped them in what can only be regarded as a draconian situation.  There is nothing to take people out of the black economy and officially give them proper employment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister and the Department of Finance give this matter serious consideration?  If necessary, he should meet a deputation to discuss the problems of the association.  In my constituency there are a number of the association's establishments, including the famous Heron's Cove Restaurant and Longueville House, which is owned by the O'Callaghan family who have given long and distinguished service in this area.  They are very famous and have an entry in the Blue Book, which is valuable around the world in bringing tourism to this country and advertising the excellent cuisine we can provide.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister has our tourism industry and our restaurants at heart.  However, there is an anomaly regarding the availability of labour which is a high cost factor for the industry.  Given that the industry is such an important growth area, I appeal to him to accept my suggestions and help the association on this issue.  If he does not have enough information on which to act he might arrange a meeting with the association, perhaps with the Minister for Finance.  Given that the Government is so concerned about high taxation levels, this may be the first reform it will introduce.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The Deputy's comments may be more relevant to the Department of Finance.  I will address this later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> In recent years the tourism industry has seen unprecedented growth in terms of its infrastructure, product development and job creation.  The developments, initially triggered by the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-93, have been given a fresh impetus under the current operational programme.  From a base of 67,000 in 1988, jobs in tourism reached a level of 91,000 by 1993, while the current operational programme projects an additional 17,250 direct tourism jobs by 1999, 11,750 in indirect and induced employment and a further 6,000 in construction and associated capital works.  Direct tourism jobs are thus targeted to be 40,000 greater by 1999 than in 1993.</P>
    <P>This unprecedented level of growth in employment has presented the tourism industry with a significant challenge in meeting the increased levels of recruitment required.  In addition, the substantially improved performance of the economy generally places the tourism industry in a particularly competitive job market <i>vis-à-vis</i> other sectors of the economy, particularly those in service industries.  Furthermore, the formalisation of the transition year within the second level education system is estimated to dilute the school-leaver population in the current academic year by 10,000 persons, while the falling birth rate will impact at school-leaver age by the turn of the century.  Faced with these significant challenges CERT has expanded its extensive recruitment programme in 1996 and the indications are that CERT will maintain 1995 levels of trainees in 1996.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on numerous occasions, both here in the House and at various other gatherings, the tourism industry must take an increasing share of responsibility for its own development.  With regard to recruitment, the tourism industry needs to be particularly innovative in the job and career packages it markets at potential entrants to the industry, whether from the school-leaver or adult populations. In addition, negative perceptions, such <Col N="1448" /> as the lack of career progression for employees, low pay and long hours of work, which may divert aspiring tourism workers from the industry must be addressed.  I cannot emphasise this too strongly.</P>
    <P>The CERT research report on successful recruitment and staff retention in tourism, launched by me last month, sets out clearly the factors which need to be considered by tourism businesses in their approach to designing an attractive job and career package that leads to successful recruitment and retention of staff.  While the report highlights factors that need to be addressed, it is encouraging that many positive perceptions are held by both employers and employees in the industry.  While this report helps to chart the way forward for the industry, it is encouraging that the industry representative associations, such as the Irish Hotel's Federation, the Irish Hotel and Catering Institute, the Irish Country Houses' and Restaurants' Association and individual businesses in tourism are already conscious of the increasingly competitive staff recruitment environment in which the industry finds itself.  There is an acceptance that more needs to be done and it is heartening that the industry recognises it is ultimately responsible for securing and retaining the highly motivated and trained workforce it requires.</P>
    <P>The Government is firmly committed to the development of the tourism industry as evidenced by the projected investment of IR£652 million in the Operational Programme for Tourism (1994-1999), of which IR£110 million has been allocated to tourism training by CERT and the Department of Education.  Over the six year period, some 20,000 first time job-seekers will move from skilled programmes into jobs in tourism, while a further 9,000 graduates from adult programmes will be available for employment.  In addition, a further 36,000 persons working in industry will <Col N="1449" /> be trained on formal training programmes or on flexible short-term training programmes.</P>
    <P>Members of the Irish Country Houses' and Restaurants' Association can avail of CERT's services and training programmes in the same way as other organisations and businesses in the tourism industry.  CERT seeks placement for its students through the various tourism industry representative organisations, including the Irish Country Houses' and Restaurants' Association.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the specific issue of local employees, particularly married women.  He mentioned a number of very fine establishments, including Longueville House which is referred to in the Blue Book.  I commend that restaurant on its inclusion in such a specific category.  It is of a very high standard and quality.  It is known internationally and is good for the perception of Ireland internationally.  I will take up with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, the specific issue of married women and will communicate with the Deputy in due course.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Beef Industry.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise the issue of the continuing crisis in the beef industry, particularly the compensation package announced the day before yesterday, which does not compensate those hardest hit &mdash; it must be the first time such a step was taken, even in Irish politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef industry, particularly beef farmers, suffered a series of hammer blows in recent months.  Yesterday's sudden cancellation by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry of his planned trip to Libya to assist sales of Irish beef underlines the political inadequacy and impotence of the response from the Government to the problems facing a beef sector in crisis.  At the beginning of April the Libyans <Col N="1450" /> announced that they intended to purchase 140,000 head of cattle.  Despite being pleaded with to personally go to that country to pitch for the sale of Irish beef, the Minister has stood back.  It seems ministerial complacency has again cost the beef industry dearly.</P>
    <P>This episode of the last 24 hours is the latest instalment in a series of inept mistakes.  Last autumn and winter the Minister was warned by all quarters, including Members on the Opposition benches, that repeated and drastic cuts in export refunds would undermine the price of beef.  Not only did he ignore those warnings, he sought to contend it would have no effect on the price of cattle.  He repeatedly went on the record to assure farmers that prices would not be affected.  Those promises proved baseless, and the price of beef is tumbling.</P>
    <P>In addition to severe problems caused by cuts in export refunds there is the BSE crisis.  The Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, is responsible for a fatally delayed and flawed response in that regard.  After the announcement of 20 March in the House of Commons I set out in a debate in this House a coherent position that should have been adopted.  To this day the only markets the Minister has visited are Italy and Spain, markets which were not closed and account for only a tiny portion of Irish beef sales.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, visited Sweden, but the amount of beef we sell to that country is not even included in Bord Bia statistics.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not been prepared to risk one iota of his precious political capital for the beef industry.  Only safe photo opportunities and guaranteed good news could lure him into the real world.  In the meantime, Ireland's traditional markets for beef, our largest industry, have been allowed to wither. When the Fianna Fáil delegation went to Iran a great effort was made here by <Col N="1451" /> the usual anonymous spokespersons to rubbish that visit.  We were told that there were only technical problems which would be dealt with by the Minister in a matter of a few days.  As of today I can confirm that the 6,250 tonnes of beef for which we got political clearance is only now being disembarked in Iran and nothing has been done about the 4,000 tonnes of beef in Irish cold stores &mdash; we also got political clearance for that to be shipped out. The Minister still has not visited Iran, where we received an excellent welcome.  The Iranians understand that we have a problem and are anxious to deal with it at political level.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response at EU level has been equally inept.  The plan announced this week is completely unfocused and unsatisfactory.  Those farmers most affected, winter fatteners, will not benefit.  The proposed increase in the suckler premium by £24 and in the special beef premium by £20 will be of no benefit to the 12,000 farmers in the specialised job of winter fattening. The slaughter premium, which was a negotiating objective and stated as such by the Minister as he went into the negotiations in the Council of Ministers, could have been substantially increased. There is no assistance for winter fatteners who, it is recognised by everybody in farming circles, are hardest hit, with losses of up to £150 per head.</P>
    <P>Tuesday's EU package is further proof, if proof were needed, that the Minister is totally out of touch with the scale and nature of the crisis.  I appeal to the Government, whose political composition renders it totally uninterested in matters agricultural, including a £1.5 billion industry, with renderers about to confirm next Tuesday that they will take no further offal and meat factories about to close down once again, to initiate a concerted political campaign at Government level to reopen lost markets.  We have seen the <Col N="1452" /> capacity of the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Trade and Tourism, and even the Tánaiste, to visit Spain to find the soles of shoes for Dubarry and to visit America to ensure that Digital and others reinvest here when hundreds of jobs were at stake.  I accept those visits were necessary, but in a £1.5 billion industry, where the livelihood of 70,000 beef farmers, 6,000 people working in meat processing industries and 3,000 people working in secondary linked industries are at risk, the Minister has yet to come forward with a coherent response.  Farmers in every county despair at the total lack of response and the havoc that results from the maladministration of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>A concerted political campaign to reopen lost markets and make them fully functional as soon as possible must be undertaken as a matter of priority. A potentially huge contract for the live trade, the one area where we can dispose of the overhang in the medium term, was lost this week due to lack of action by the Minister and the Government.  That is unforgiveable.</P>
    <P>EU compensation must be targeted at those who have suffered most in this crisis.  Surely the Minister is aware that should be the objective criteria upon which any compensation package can be based.  The present EU proposals are the equivalent of throwing around snuff at a wake.  If compensation is to be meaningful it must be targeted at producers of winter finishers through a substantial increase in the slaughter premium.</P>
    <P>The Minister should go back to Brussels and represent those farmers who have been hardest hit.  That is not only his political duty but his constitutional duty.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge Deputy Cowen's understanding of the absence of the Minister for Agriculture, Food <Col N="1453" /> and Forestry this evening.  I intend to reply on his behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>With as much passion as is necessary.  The Minister fully acknowledges that beef producers in Ireland have gone through a very difficult period since the beginning of this year, first, as a result of the various reductions in export refunds last autumn and, more recently, because of the BSE crisis following the announcement by the British Minister for Health on 20 March in the House of Commons of the possible link between BSE and CJD. The difficulties being experienced by our producers are evidenced by the substantial fall in cattle prices since the beginning of the year, which has resulted in income losses for many producers.  The Minister's objectives through this crisis have been, first, to ensure that the market was adequately supported through the introduction of emergency intervention measures and, second, to secure compensation for the income losses arising form the BSE crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any reasonable commentator would acknowledge that the Minister has been very successful in achieving these objectives.  As regards intervention, the emergency arrangements for April abolished the carcase weight limit and extended intervention purchasing to grade 04, a quality of animal not normally eligible for intervention.  The arrangements for May reintroduced a weight limit at a relatively high weight and covered 70 per cent of our steer production.  These arrangements have worked well to date and have succeeded in disposing of most of the backlog of cattle which had built up on farms in the immediate aftermath of the House of Commons announcement.  The Minister is satisfied that the emergency intervention measures <Col N="1454" /> prevented a total collapse in the market, not just in Ireland but across Europe.</P>
    <P>The Commission has also increased export refunds by 12 per cent to improve the competitiveness of our exporters on third country markets and to boost cattle prices within the European Union.  This increase took effect from 9 May and, along with the intervention measures, should ensure a degree of stability on the market over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Minister was always conscious that the emergency intervention measures would be insufficient to support cattle prices at reasonable levels. For this reason, he insisted both at the Emergency BSE Council on 1 to 3 April, and again at the normal meeting of the Agricultural Council on 29 to 30 April that provision should be made for compensation to be paid to beef producers who suffered income losses because of the crisis.  The Minister is pleased, therefore, to be given the opportunity today to outline the compensation package which the European Commission adopted yesterday.  This package is a substantial response to the conclusions of the two Councils held in April.  In summary, the compensation package consists of an increase £24.88 in the suckler cow premium and £20.71 in both instalments of the special beef premium.  The Minister understands the intention is that the increased premium payments will be based on applications submitted in 1995, with provision for adjustments to be made where producers had fewer animals in 1996 than in 1995 and for the savings on this to be used to compensate those producers who had more animals in 1996.</P>
    <P>This package is worth about £60 million to Irish beef producers.  In global terms, it will go a long way towards alleviating the income difficulties of Irish producers.  The Minister acknowledges, however, that the package as currently constructed is not sufficiently targeted at those winter fattener producers <Col N="1455" /> who have borne the brunt of this crisis. He intends to seek to have the package amended so as to provide for compensation to be paid also to these producers through the deseasonalisation slaughter premium.  The Minister does not want to underestimate the extent of the difficulties he faces in persuading the Commission and other member states in agreeing to this approach.  Nevertheless, this will be an extremely important objective for him in the negotiations ahead on the Commission's proposals.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Minister is very pleased that the Commission has now adopted the compensation package and he intends to ensure that, first, it is targeted at those producers most affected by the crisis, and, second, that the compensation is paid out as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to speak on a topic I consider to be very important.  The Minister, Deputy Kenny, is not the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, but as he comes from the west I have no doubt he appreciates that many people there are in dire straits, with the exception of Mayo people.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the closure of a meat processing plant in Dromod, County Leitrim.  Last Friday the factory's licence to slaughter was withdrawn by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The factory slaughtered approximately 1,000 pigs, 700 sows and some cattle per week. Most of the products were exported to Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom; the factory enjoyed an excellent pork trade with Japan and the United Kingdom divided roughly 50:50. A total of 85 people were employed in the factory which is the equivalent of the loss of a factory in Dublin employing approximately 9,000 workers,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> The area, which covers south Leitrim, north Longford and north Roscommon, is the most depressed in the country from an unemployment and emigration point of view.  Approximately six months ago there was great jubilation when it was announced that a wood pulp processing plant was to be set up giving employment to approximately 300 people.  Six months later, a factory employing 85 people is to close and those workers are facing life on the dole.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to put pressure on the Department to reinstate the factory's licence to slaughter.  If that is not done those 85 workers will be left sitting at home in despair.  Some of them will look for work which they may or may not find; others will set their sights on other areas of the country or on England.  That is not a bright prospect for any worker.</P>
    <P>Of the 85 people working in the factory approximately 60 are married.  With two children per family, that leaves 240 people dependent solely on the income from the factory &mdash; 265 if one includes the 25 single employees &mdash; not forgetting the financial spin-off to shops, pubs, restaurants and garages in the area. That has come to an end.</P>
    <P>The markets and the raw materials still exist and the workers who are unemployed are still in the vicinity.  All that is missing is the licence to slaughter. Perhaps the Department would see fit to reinstate the licence for a period of six months while the owners sort out any legal problems they may have and also refurbish the factory as required under EU law.</P>
    <P>The factory is about 100 years old. Many people would say that to refurbish such a plant is a waste of money, that it should be closed down, a preservation order put on it and a new plant built. Needless to say that would cost some money but so be it.  The Masonite plant will cost approximately £90 million and it will employ just 300 people.  This plant which employs 85 persons has an <Col N="1457" /> unlimited raw material supply and so far the markets appear to be unlimited.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to put pressure on the Department to reinstate the licence to slaughter so that those 85 workers can work as they have done for the past ten to 15 years, bearing in mind that the factory has been in existence for 98 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I thank Deputy Tom Foxe for raising the matter.  I fully understand the implications of the Deputy's comments in relation to the west and I hope the announcement being made today by the Taoiseach in respect of the entire western region will bear fruit over the coming years for many of the people to whom the Deputy has referred.</P>
      <P>This matter refers to the withdrawal of the slaughter licence from the Dromod factory in County Leitrim with the consequent loss of 85 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Western Meat Producers Limited is an approved pig slaughtering and cutting plant in Dromod, County Leitrim, and is registered under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930.  For some time now the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been in correspondence with the management of this plant with regard to structural and maintenance deficiencies existing at the premises.  Numerous inspections have been undertaken by veterinary officials from the Department and despite management being made aware of the findings of these inspections, all requests to management to rectify matters at the plant have been met by inadequate attempts at improvement or, more often than not, no action towards improvement.  The company did invest money in making improvements to its premises in the period 1993 to 1995 but despite that the premises still does not come up to EU standards.  It did not pass an inspection by EU veterinary officers which was carried out in August <Col N="1458" /> 1995 and this was in addition to having failed a similar inspection two years earlier in 1993 by EU veterinary officers.</P>
    <P>Despite continuous correspondence over the past number of years, matters came to a head in January 1996 when the Department wrote to the management of the Dromod plant saying that the premises would be removed from the EU export approved list unless the long standing deficiencies were addressed and rectified in a reasonable timescale.</P>
    <P>Following this the management requested a meeting with Department officials to discuss the position.  At a meeting held on 16 January 1996, management of the Dromod plant agreed to take action to have remedial work commenced.  A further meeting was held in Dromod on 25 January 1996 with veterinary officers of the Department and management of the Dromod plant.  At this latter meeting the Dromod management were again made fully aware of the deficiencies needing attention, and on 8 February 1996 a letter was received from the Dromod plant management enclosing a schedule of work prepared by their architects outlining a timetable for completion of a programme of work, which was contained in plans which the company had submitted in the latter part of 1995 and which had been approved by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department replied to the Dromod management on 16 February 1996 stating that the timetable was acceptable but pointed out that it must be strictly adhered to.  On 12 April 1996 a further inspection of the Dromod plant by a Department veterinary officer took place and it was found that no work have been carried out at the Dromod plant.  The Department wrote to management on 26 April 1996 informing it that the licence would be withdrawn within 14 days from that date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> Following numerous written and verbal contacts with the Department, management of the Dromod plant agreed in a letter dated 10 May 1996 to voluntarily cease slaughtering at the Dromod plant from 13 May 1996, but requested time to dispose of stocks before delisting takes place.  The Department has responded by agreeing not to withdraw the licence for the Dromod plant for a period of one month from 13 May 1996 on the understanding that slaughtering or cutting does not take place at the premises after 13 May 1996.</P>
    <P>Management was advised on 10 May <Col N="1460" /> 1996 that consideration would be given by the Department to allowing cutting to take place on the premises if the boning hall and associated facilities were brought up to the required standards.</P>
    <P>To date management has not responded to the Department's offer. As of now the position is that the licence for the premises will be withdrawn one month from 13 May 1996 if no action is taken in the meantime by the management of the Dromod plant to rectify the deficiencies at the plant.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 May 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The important work which Positively Irish Action on AIDS carries out, in addressing the needs of Irish people affected by HIV and AIDS in Britain in a caring and culturally sensitive way, has for a number of years received funding from the annual DÍON allocation, which is provided by the Irish Government through my Department to assist voluntary organisations in Britain working with the Irish emigrant community who experience difficulties in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> Positively Irish Action on AIDS is recognised by the DÍON Committee as one of the most professional of the voluntary organisations which it supports.  I would like to reassure the Deputy that DÍON support, at a small increase over its 1995 grant level within the tight budgetary constraints which obtain on the DÍON allocations, can be made available as a continuing contribution towards its staffing cost in 1996. However, the overall prospects of Positively Irish Action on AIDS continuing operations are in the final analysis dependent on funding from UK statutory and other sources and any increase from the DÍON budget will not in itself resolve the organisation's present financial position which I understand remains very difficult.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, when the Irish Embassy in London became aware of the Inner London HIV Health Commissioners Group's decision to withdraw contracts from Positively Irish Action on AIDS, and thereby effectively end funding, the Ambassador conveyed the Government's concerns to the British Department of Health and the chairman of the DÍON Committee, who is an officer of my Department on secondment to the Embassy, conveyed similar concerns to the relevant health bodies.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity at the Industry Council of 28 March to raise the Irish Government's concerns directly with my British counterpart who undertook to convey these to his ministerial colleague.</P>
    <P>I understand that while Positively Irish Action on AIDS has subsequently been offered short-term transitional funding from one of the health authorities represented on the Health Commissioners Group, the present position remains very difficult and the organisation remains fundamentally de-stabilised.  I am advised that Positively Irish Action on AIDS's management committee will take a final decision on its future on 10 June 1996 based on a further review of its financial position at that date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> The Government through the DÍON Committee is continuing to monitor Positively Irish Action on AIDS position and it will provide any further practical assistance it can to the organisation.</P>

No extra staff, consultancies and/or companies have been employed for the duration of the Presidency.  It is foreseeable that for certain specific events being organised in Ireland during the Presidency, conference organisers or other professional services may have to be engaged to provide, for example, translation, interpretation, catering, transport, etc., but as no firm commitments have yet been entered into I am not in a position to give any such details at this stage.

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to European Union Council Directive 93/104/EC <Col N="1350" /> concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time which must be implemented by all member states by November 1996.</P>
      <P>In an opinion delivered on 12 March last, the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice concluded that the application by the UK for the annulment of this directive &mdash; on the main grounds that it was adopted by the Council on a defective legal basis &mdash; should be dismissed in its entirely.  I understand that the final judgment of the court is expected in the next few weeks.  If the court endorses its Advocate General's opinion, the directive will be confirmed.</P>
      <P>The directive provides, amongst other things, for a maximum working week of 48 hours for all employees.  Certain sectors may be exempted such as work at sea, the transport sector and the activities of doctors in training.  The directive applies to all other employments regardless of size.  An organisation of working time Bill is in the course of preparation to transpose the directive into Irish law.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware I officially opened the new headquarters of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs on 13 May at 4-5 Harcourt Road to coincide with the entry into force of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.  It is planned to open new public offices in Dublin and Cork shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director's principal function under the Act are: to seek redress in the courts for breaches of the legislation; to direct lenders to withdraw or modify credit advertisements; to provide <Col N="1351" /> advice, guidance and information to consumers on their rights under, and on the workings of the Consumer Credit Act; to license moneylenders; to authorise persons to act as credit intermediaries or mortgage intermediaries; to investigate information given on the credit status of consumers and to curtail and regulate bank customer charges.</P>
    <P>In order to advise consumers of their rights and entitlements, the Director has produced a booklet entitled a &ldquo;Rough Guide&rdquo; to the Act which containes two help-line numbers, within the new office.

I am aware that the company is proposing changes in the roles and responsibilities of the staff of its sales force, but that is entirely a matter for the company and not one in which Government has any standing.</P>

    <P>The responsibility for the resolution of this dispute is ultimately a matter for the parties directly involved.

    <P>I do not consider it appropriate for me to intervene directly in disputes such as this.  The services of the dispute settling agencies of the State remain available to the parties.</P>
    <P>They were established by Government to assist parties to resolve their differences.  As intervention by Government could only undermine their role, deputies should be of one mind with me in recommending that parties use the services of the LRC and the Labour Court to resolve differences.</P>

    </table>
    <P>The figures quoted are the ILO measure of unemployment rates as this is the only way of getting a meaningful cross-national comparison.</P>
    <P>The problem of unemployment is receiving priority treatment from the Government.  In particular, the long-term unemployed have been targeted for special measures.  I have outlined on several occasions in this House the initiatives involved.  These include the development of more friendly taxation and social welfare regimes and the introduction in this year's budget of a series of precisely targeted employment measures: the splitting of the Community Employment (CE) programme into two distinct options (a) a part-time integration option and (b) a part-time jobs option and the better targeting of the programme at the long-term unemployed; introduction of a new pilot whole-time jobs option; introduction of a new recruitment subsidy scheme called &ldquo;Jobstart&rdquo;; introduction of a new work experience programme called &ldquo;Work-Place&rdquo;; introduction of special measures for 18-19 year olds; the extension of the back to work allowance scheme and the introduction of retention of certain benefits for those returning to work.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the local employment service represents an important component of the Government's response to tackling long-term unemployment.  The distinctive additional elements of this service, in providing an individually tailored progression path towards employment for its clients and in ensuring that there is a well co-ordinated employment delivery service at local level, should yield real <Col N="1354" /> benefits in terms of securing employment for long-term unemployed persons, as the service develops.  This innovative approach is being launched initially in 14 key areas, including the major unemployment &ldquo;black-spots&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, targeted where it is most crucially needed.</P>
    <P>My plans for 1996 are that the service will be consolidated in the 14 areas and subject to an evaluation later this year, before consideration is given to extending the service on a planned basis to other areas.</P>
    <P>There is a strong link between low levels of education and long-term unemployment.  Consequently, training is another important component in measures to assist the unemployed.  This area will be part of the White Paper on Training which my Department is currently drawing up.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the on-going work of IDA Ireland, Forbairt and the county enterprise boards in attracting jobs to the region.</P>
    <P>In this regard I was pleased to announce, on Tuesday last a major expansion by Gateway 2000.  This will create 1,200 new jobs for Dublin's Northside and will bring total employment by the company in Ireland to 2,300.  This is remarkable given the fact that their Irish operation was only established in 1993.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to IDA Ireland for its efforts and success in attracting Gateway 2000 to Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the Director of Consumer Affairs intends to open an office in Cork during <Col N="1355" /> the second half of the year.  I have succeeded in securing funding for the office in my Department's Estimate for 1996.</P>
      <P>The office shall be located in a ground floor of a premises on the South Mail.  A lease for the premises was agreed between the Office of Public Works, which is acting on behalf of the Director, and the landlord two weeks ago.

      <P>The Director's main functions under the Act which entered into force on 13 May are: to regulate and to monitor the activities of all persons offering consumer credit or arranging such credit; to seek redress in the courts for breaches of the legislation; to direct lenders to withdraw or modify credit advertisements; to provide advice, guidance and information to consumers on their rights under, and on the workings of the Consumer Credit Act; to license moneylenders; to authorise persons to act as credit intermediaries or mortgage intermediaries; to investigate information given on the credit status of consumers; and to curtail and regulate bank customer charges.</P>

      <P>The start-up of the local employment service network has been proceeding at a satisfactory and realistic pace given the complexity of the task involved, the innovative nature of the approach being adopted and the detailed preparatory work needed in getting the service organised and operational.</P>
      <P>A range of issues had to be addressed in the start-up phase &mdash; in particular: the need, in each of the chosen areas, to secure agreement between a wide range of interest groups to comprehensive proposals which require a greater degree of co-operation than heretofore among all the service providers; the fact that partnerships were undergoing boundary changes, new partnership boards were being appointed and Area Action Plans for 1995-1999 were also being prepared during the same period; and difficulties in obtaining suitable premises for delivery of the service in some areas.</P>
      <P>There was considerable work involved for the areas and my Department in preparing and finalising detailed plans.  This was followed by preparatory work for the areas on the ground, staff recruitment etc.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that preparations for the LES in the 14 areas are well advanced.  Plans have been approved for 11 of the partnership areas.  The three remaining plans should be considered by the interdepartmental advisory group during May.</P>
      <P>My intention for 1996 is that the LES should be consolidated in the 14 key areas and an evaluation of the service will be undertaken later this year, before we consider undertaking further expansion.  What we have learned to date in the current phase will be of benefit in considering expansion of the service countrywide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 11 areas for which plans have been approved, there is now a total of 19 local employment centres open for <Col N="1357" /> business or at an advanced stage of preparation.  Over half of the total staff requirements have been appointed and the remaining vacancies will be filled over the coming months.</P>
    <P>In regard to the training of the specialist mediator staff, as soon as staff are appointed and available for training, this is provided.  To date, all of the appointed mediator staff have been trained.</P>
    <P>To ensure that there are common standards and a level of overall consistency in the management and delivery of the service, the Department of Enterprise and Employment will be issuing an operational manual to all LES areas by end-June.  This will contain comprehensive information on financial procedures and reporting systems, job descriptions for LES personnel, quality standards, etc.  The content of the manual is subject to prior consultation with partnerships and LES co-ordinators to ensure its relevance and practical usefulness.</P>
    <P>The manual will also contain impact indicators for the LES.  These are currently being developed by a consultant engaged by my Department, who is consulting LES service providers in the process.</P>

      <P>The cost of producing and publishing the strategy paper on the labour market &ldquo;Growing and Sharing our Employment&rdquo; is estimated at approximately £16,000.  This amount covers the cost of editing, design, printing and the launch of the strategy paper and also includes an external review by the Economic and Social Research Institute at a cost of £1,500.</P>
      <P>I am circulating, in tabular format, the names of consultants currently employed by my Department, the costs of engaging the consultants and a description of the work they are completing.</P>
      <P>Consultants are usually employed where there is a lack of expertise available from within my Department and where outside advice is considered necessary.  In some instances, due to pressure on existing resources, or the size of a contract, or a combination of both, consultants may be engaged to carry-out a particular task.  In other cases, such as the evaluation of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-1999 to which I have referred in the list, the engagement of external consultants are a specific requirement of the European Commission.</P>

      <P>The report of the Small Business Task Force, which was published in March 1994, made 121 recommendations for changes and new initiatives in relation to small business. To-date, 25 recommendations have been fully implemented and a further 16 have been partially implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of implementing the recommendations has been assigned to the small business and services division of my Department, which has the stated objective of improving the operating <Col N="1360" /> environment for small business and service firms.  The systematic implementation of the remaining recommendations is being pursued by the division which has assessed all of the recommendations and is actively pursuing their implementation.  Special attention is being given in 1996 to the areas of prompt payment of business debts and administrative simplification which were identified by the task force as being of considerable importance to small business.  In regard to prompt payment, I am pressing ahead with the introduction of prompt payment legislation for the public sector which I plan to publish later this year.  In relation to administrative simplification, a programme is currently being developed by my Department to relieve the compliance burden on small business, which will be of particular relevance to a large number of recommendations.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment to small business is set down in our policy <Col N="1361" /> document, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> Much has been achieved, but much more needs to be done to provide the right kind of assistance and help to small business here.  It is for this reason that I plan to publish policy statements, in relation to both enterprise strategy and services, which will have significant implications for improving the business environment and which are nearing completion in my Department.</P>

      <P>The following is the position in relation to task forces which have been established by my Department since its establishment in January 1993.  In February of 1993 the <Col N="1362" /> Galway Task Force was established with the objective of redressing the employment situation in Galway following the announcement by Digital Equipment Corporation to close their hardware manufacturing facility.  The group reported in March 1994 to the then Minister having secured substantial investment and jobs for the region.</P>
      <P>The Enterprise Development Task Force on Dublin Airport was established in July 1993 in order to identify new employment opportunities based around Dublin Airport and within the Aer Lingus structure in response to the difficulties in Team Aer Lingus at the time.</P>
      <P>Its report was presented to me in April 1995 and it is scheduled for publication this week.  The Task Force on Small Business reported in March 1994 on a comprehensive agenda for improving the operating environment for small business.</P>
      <P>A report has been received in my Department on the recommendations of the Cobh and Harbour Area Response Group which was set up to propose measures that would offset the economic and employment effects on the area of the restructuring of Irish Steel announced in July 1994.  I expect to make an announcement shortly about the matter.  In May 1995, the Government established a task force, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Travers, chief executive officer of Forfás, to examine the recommendations of the Science Technology and Innovation Advisory Council, STIAC.  The Travers Task Force reported in November 1995.  The Government response to the STIAC report, based on the views of the task force, is expected to be published in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Task Force for Industry Adjustment was established in March 1995 and its primary purpose was to identify areas of business at risk from competitive forces and to propose competitive strategies.  In December 1995, the task force approved a change management programme which is designed to facilitate companies in implementing initiatives <Col N="1363" /> to increase their competitiveness.  The enterprise development agencies will be responsible for administering this programme.  The work of the task force is ongoing.</P>
    <P>In March 1996, an Expert Advisory Group on Beef Products was established to advise consumers, Government and the trade arising from the EU export ban on products derived from cattle slaughtered in the UK and to make such recommendations, if any, as they conclude are necessary.  In March 1996, the terms of reference and composition of a Task Force on Enterprise and the Environment were announced. Broadly the aim of the task force will be to identify the challenges which industry will face arising from environmental concerns and to identify opportunities for business in providing environmental services and responding to the growing environmental consciousness of consumers.  The first meeting of the task force was held on 13 May.</P>
    <P>A Task Force for Tallaght was established in April 1996 to make proposals in response to the situation in Tallaght arising out of the announcement of the closure of Packard Electric Limited. The work of this task force is ongoing.</P>
    <P>In all nine task forces or implementing bodies have been established and reports were published or submitted to my office in respect of five of these.  The foregoing list does not include action groups or task forces established by agencies under my Department or the various review groups which are convened periodically to inform and advise my Department on matters of policy in areas such as company law, enterprise strategy and the information society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 24 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the National Economic and Social Forums Opinion No. 3 on Long-Term Unemployment Initiatives, as a further input to ongoing policy development in relation to dealing with the problem of long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>I note that the forum welcomes the Government's recent decisions as a step in the right direction to tackling long-term unemployment more effectively and on a more coherent and integrated basis.  These decisions, according to the NESF, represent important progress and advances in a number of areas such as the more focused and targeted approach to ensuring that the long-term unemployed get the maximum benefit from the community employment programme; the retention of medical cards for three years after taking up employment by those who have been unemployed for at least one year; and the modifications and improvements announced in the family income supplement, in the assessment of earnings from employment for unemployment assistance purposes, the increased number of places on the back-to-work allowance scheme and the retention of the full rate child dependant allowances for the first 13 weeks of employment by the long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically, with regard to community employment, the forum supports the changes which came into effect on 15 April last.  Many of the further <Col N="1365" /> recommendations will be incorporated into community employment as it evolves.</P>
    <P>The forum has again raised the issue of the &ldquo;going weekly remuneration&rdquo; for CE participants.  The Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment examined this issue in detail and recommended continuing the &ldquo;benefits plus&rdquo; arrangements for CE pending a full evaluation of the &ldquo;going rate&rdquo; approach being piloted in the CORI part-time job opportunities programme.  It is worth noting that the task force found that the effective rate for CE participants compares favourably with rates for similar part-time employment in the open labour market and often exceeds it in the case of persons with dependants.</P>
    <P>The forum has expressed a strong view that the new provision, which allows eligible participants for community employment to swap places with their dependent spouses, should not be proceeded with.  Instead they suggest that dependent spouses should be eligible in their own right.  While I see some merit in this recommendation, it would have significant cost implications, as acknowledged by the forum itself, and would result in the cutback of places for other groups.  Accordingly, I intend to retain the &ldquo;swapping arrangement&rdquo; and to continue the Government's policy of targeting resources on those registered as long-term unemployed.  I will however keep the matter under review in the light of the implementation of the revised targeting arrangements.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new Jobstart recruitment subsidy programme, I welcome the forum's comments.  The programme will be heavily promoted by FÁS and the local employment service in co-operation with IBEC, ICTU and the INOU.  The detailed terms of the programme have been agreed with IBEC, ICTU and the INOU and agreed monitoring procedures have been put in place to ensure that any abuses that may arise will be quickly dealt with.  The programme will come into operation on 1 June 1996.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> The forum raises concerns about the perceived compulsory element in the youth progression programme which will come into effect in October.  While I understand this concern, my aim is that this programme, rather than being punitive, will enable us to develop a proper register of those 18-19 year olds most likely to drift into a lifetime of long-term unemployment and to ensure an appropriate policy response to prevent such drifts.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at length in this House with the state of play in relation to the establishment of the local employment service.  I am satisfied that every effort is being made to have the service fully up and running in the 14 areas designated by the middle of this year.  I am pleased that the forum accepts the Government view that the service should be fully established and properly evaluated in these areas before extending nationwide.  The further recommendations from the forum are a useful input to the development of the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1995 the EU Commission issued a communication on worker information and consultation.  The purpose of the communication is to put forward options for discussion in an effort to achieve progress on a number of Commission proposals which have been blocked in the Council of Ministers for some considerable time.  These blocked proposals include draft Council regulations on the European Company, Co-operative, Association and Mutual and four associated Draft Directives on employee involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> Commission consultations on the Communication are in progress with the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the social partners at European level. The Communication does not represent Commission proposals as such, rather its purpose is to elicit views from those consulted in order to enable the Commission to decide on the nature of any formal proposals it might make to the Council regarding information and consultation of workers in an effort to resolve the difficulties in the Council about the employee involvement draft directives.</P>
    <P>As the Commission's consultations are still under way it is not possible at this stage to indicate whether or not formal proposals will emerge.  It is clear, however, that the process of identifying proposals which would be likely to be acceptable to members states is complex and difficult, not least because of the differing employee involvement traditions as between member states.</P>
    <P>To date, Ireland has sought to facilitate the ongoing debate and in particular has expressed concern that the forcing of early conclusions on the Commission's ideas may simply polarise the positions of the member states and thus prevent the development of acceptable proposals.</P>
    <P>My concern is that any proposals which emerge from the ongoing consultation process should take due account of employment concerns and the differing employment relations traditions as between member states.  It is only on that basis that agreement is likely to emerge.</P>
    <P>As regards the transposition into Irish Law of Council Directive 94/45 EC on the transnational information and consultation of employees in larger firms established in two or more member states, I can tell the Deputy that drafting work is now well advanced.</P>

      <P>The Employment Agency Act, 1971 provides that anybody carrying on the business of an employment agency, whether for reward or otherwise, must obtain an employment agency licence from my Department.  Licences are issued for a period of one year and must be renewed annually if the employment agency wishes to continue in business.  In 1995, 221 employment agency licences were issued.  This compares with 242 licences issued in 1994.</P>
      <P>The Employment Agency Act does not control or specify the manner in which an employment agency should be run, but rather sets out the conditions under which a licence may be granted. Briefly, these conditions relate mainly to the fitness of the applicant to carry on such a business and the suitability of the proposed premises.  Where complaints are received regarding employment agencies, they are investigated by my Department.  Action, as provided for in the employment agency legislation, is taken, if necessary.</P>

      <P>Previous statements by me in this House and in particular my reply to a relevant question on 17 April 1996 (columns 119-122) made it clear that the investigation recently undertaken by the Director of <Col N="1369" /> Consumer Affairs related solely to the prices of magazines imported from the UK.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology published the report of the director on 22 April.  The principal findings of the report was that: 1.  The importation and distribution of magazines in Ireland are controlled by Easons and Newspread.  2.  The prices of UK magazines are different from most other imported goods of UK origin because the sterling price is readily visible to Irish consumers.  3.  Both importers operate a system of forward buying of sterling four times a year at or about the same time.  4.  As magazines are subject to value added tax at the rate of 21 per cent in Ireland, whereas they are zero rated in the UK, the Irish cover price will always exceed the indicated UK price, unless there is to be an extraordinary depreciation of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish pound.  5.  Whilst the benefit of the Irish pound's appreciation against sterling has been passed onto consumers, it was not possible to establish, in the time available, the speed at which the reluctantly favourable price reductions occurred.  6.  In order to cover the costs associated with distribution throughout Ireland, the importers take a margin, additional to the normal importers' margin, known as an &ldquo;uplift&rdquo; which was agreed with the National Prices Commission in 1983 at 5 per cent and is now almost 10 per cent.  7.  The most disturbing aspect of the complex pricing arrangements operated by the importers derive from the practice of distributing ready reckoners to newsagents which give the same Irish retail price for the same UK cover price, a situation the director comments could not happen by accident.</P>
      <P>Thus in the director's view the matter justifies an investigation by the Director of Competition Enforcement to be appointed under the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology felt it important that the wholesalers and retailers should be given the <Col N="1370" /> opportunity to offer their views on the director's findings.  Accordingly the Minister for commerce, science and technology discussed the findings of the director's report with representatives of Newspread on 3 May 1996, Easons on 10 May 1996, and National Federations of Retail Newsagents on 14 May 1996.</P>
    <P>The Minister also plans to hold discussions with the Irish Retail Newsagents Association on 20 May 1996. Both Easons and Newspread contended that, in addition to the imposition of VAT at 21 per cent here compared with zero in the UK, magazine prices were more expensive here because of the costly nationwide distribution system arising from the large number of small newsagents, the population spread and density.  In some instances, they say that both supply the same shops with same magazines.  They emphasised that their aim was to achieve price uniformity, a situation which is common in other European countries.  The issue of the ready reckoner facilitated the achievement of price uniformity.  They also stated that they compete aggressively against each other in the efficiency and nature of service provided to retailers, including financial arrangements for magazine returns.  Each of them in their turn, claimed that their monetary margin were declining in recent years and that the benefit of the appreciation of the pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling was being passed onto consumers.</P>
    <P>For their part the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, referred to the imposition by the importers of a weekly service charge which has seriously eroded their margins and were not being reflected in increased magazine prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister is yet to be satisfied that the present distribution and pricing arrangement serve the best interests of consumers.  However, since the Minister has not yet concluded the round of discussions with the interested parties, it would be inappropriate to indicate at this stage what further action will be taken.</P>

      <P>Community Employment (CE) is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  Its objective is to provide such persons with temporary work experience opportunities together with an element of training that would enhance their prospects of mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>Under the CE programme, public sector and voluntary organisations are grant-aided by FÁS in respect of sponsoring a CE project and they in turn benefit in a secondary way by being able to carry out worthwhile work which they could not otherwise undertake. Suitable projects would be those that can be shown to respond to a clearly identified community need and which also develop the work skills of participants, thereby enhancing their prospect of mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>As such the programme is designed primarily to meet the needs of those who are long-term unemployed and was never meant to provide ongoing core funding for the Arts which may be funded by other Exchequer or private sources.</P>
      <P>The changes to CE are being introduced in order to better target the programme at the long-term unemployed so that they may share in the benefits of economic growth along with other sectors of society.  You will appreciate that, despite the success of the Government's overall economic and employment startegy in creating jobs, recent statistics indicate that such persons are often bypassed in job selection.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland supported a resolution at the UN General Assembly last November calling for the end of the US embargo on Cuba.</P>
      <P>The recent enactment of the Helms-Burton Act, following the shooting down by Cuba of two US civilian aircraft, has widened the scope of the embargo.  Together with our partners in the European Union we have expressed deep concern to the US in regard to this legislation which has implications for world trade.</P>
      <P>The EU believes that a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba can best be achieved through dialogue and economic development.  The EU is prepared to provide material and political support to this end.  However, the recent measures taken by the Cuban Government to prevent the holding of a conference by the pro-human rights coalition &ldquo;Concilio Cubano&rdquo; do not encourage optimism about prospects for political reform.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the factors she takes into account in initiating the process for the appointment of a peace commissioner; whether this is solely on the basis of the Garda authorities in the area indicating the necessity of the appointment of the peace commissioner for that area; the other factors taken account of, such as, representations other than from the Garda Síochána; the reason she initiates the process of appointment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 empowers the Minister for Justice to appoint from time to time such and so many fit and proper persons as the Minister considers expedient to perform the duties of peace commissioners and there are no other legislative requirements governing the appointment of peace commissioners.  That is to say that there is no specific statutory appointment procedure.</P>
      <P>In practice it is open to any person to apply for appointment as a peace commissioner and in effect the receipt of such an application, either from the individual concerned or from others, including public representatives, acting on his or her behalf, initiates the appointment procedure.  Factors taken into account include the requirements of the Garda Síochána and the applicant's suitability but in the final analysis the decision to make an appointment is one for the Minister's discretion.  This is the practice which has been followed by successive Ministers.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the post of peace commissioner is an honorary appointment and it exists to facilitate members of the public in addition to meeting Garda needs.</P>

Some appreciation of the frequency of certain disallowances can be obtained from the following statistics collected on the various types of appeal by the Social Welfare appeals office.

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as to certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  Persons in receipt of invalidity pension are eligible as well as their spouses when accompanying the passholder.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Currently, about 470,000 people qualify for free travel at an estimated annual cost this year of some £32.7 million.</P>
      <P>The extension of the free travel scheme to the spouses, in their own right, of those recipients of disability benefit and invalidity pension who are receiving an increase in respect of an adult dependant would involve an estimated additional cost of the order of £1.5 million per annum for approximately 21,000 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The special grant of £500 in respect of twins is payable to a person who, in accordance with the relevant domestic legal provisions, is a qualified person for child benefit purposes, i.e. the person with whom a qualified child normally resides.  A qualified child is defined to mean a child who is under the age of 16, or aged between 16 and 19 if in full-time education or if physically or mentally disabled and who is ordinarily resident in the State and not detained in reformatory, industrial school or legal custody.</P>
      <P>The EU regulations on social security provide for co-ordination between the social security systems of the various member states.  The primary purpose of these regulations is to ensure that people who have lived and worked in more than one country are adequately covered for social protection purposes. The regulations also provide clarity as to which country's national legislation applies &mdash; a basic principle is to ensure that the legislation of only one member state will apply at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with these EU regulations, where a person receives an <Col N="1387" /> insurance-based pension under the legislation of one member state, family benefits in respect of the children of such a person are paid by that State. The purpose of such provisions is to prevent the overlapping of benefits.</P>
    <P>In the case which the Deputy has raised, the person in question is in receipt of a British, insurance-based, disability pension.  Consequently, she is paid British child benefit in respect of her children.  An amendment to the Irish regulations would not, therefore, have the effect of extending entitlement to the grant payable in respect of twins in a case such as this.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, although there are no additional elements akin to the Irish twins grant, British child benefit rates are somewhat better than ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I share the Deputy's concern at the high cost of soft drinks sold in public houses I would like to point out that the retail price of soft drinks was not the subject of price control even when the National Prices Commission was in operation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Retail Prices (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1976, requires all vendors of alcoholic beverages and soft drinks for consumption on their premises to display prominently within their premises the retail prices charged for the principal drinks.  This legislation is rigorously enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs, sometimes resulting in prosecution for non-compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My primary concern is to ensure that <Col N="1388" /> competition works effectively in the provision of goods and services on the Irish market and that competition is fair and resounds to the benefit of consumers by providing greater choice, improved quality and lower prices in particular.  In this connection, I should say that I am not satisfied that existing competition law is operating to the best effect.  In my view, it is not geared to tackling anti-competitive activity, because of the lack of public enforcement and inadequate penalties for breaches of the law.  I would add that, in line with the Policy Agreement for Government, I propose to strengthen competition law, through the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and by enabling the courts to impose stiff fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition.  I intend to seek to have the Bill, which has completed Committee Stage in the Dáil, enacted at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four county enterprise boards in the greater Dublin area, viz. Dublin City Enterprise Board, Fingal (Dublin North) County Enterprise Board, South Dublin County Enterprise Board and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Enterprise Board.</P>
      <P>The boards have each completed a three-year enterprise plan and are extremely active in the promotion of new small business in their areas of operation.  By the end of 1995, almost 400 projects worth over £4 million in grants had been approved by the four Dublin city and county enterprise boards.  By the end of 1995, grants worth almost £2.5 million had been drawn down by the four boards and over 650 jobs had been created, according to figusers supplied by the boards.  The strong performance of the Dublin boards continues with a further 43 projects approved for grant assistance of almost £450,000 to date in 1996.</P>
      <P>The Dublin county enterprise boards are also active in the promotion of indirect enterprise supports, including the provision of advice, information and mentoring.  Among the initiatives being supported is the Plato programme in south Dublin, primarily a business training and networking project whereby local owner-managers are encouraged to learn from one another and from the advice of local large enterprises, which act as the facilitators of small working groups.  The boards are also actively involved in the provision of management training in small businesses and micro-enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also decided in <Col N="1402" /> principle to locate a science and technology park at the Citywest site in Dublin.  A detailed feasibility study of the project between the developer, the universities and an expert group, chaired by Forfás, indicated that a science park project at Citywest is feasible subject to a workable detailed project proposal.  A proposal has been put to the universities and Citywest outlining a broad framework under which proposals from Citywest and the universities could be advanced.</P>
    <P>The software industry is expected to grow to 20,000 employees by the year 2000.  Most of these companies are based in the Dublin area and Forbairt is working closely with them to help them develop their full potential to contribute to employment creation in Dublin.  In February I announced the creation of 1,084 jobs in 80 new and expanding Irish international service companies.  Over 50 of these companies are based in Dublin and together they will create almost 600 new jobs in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is fully committed to a programme of regional development and has built this into its own operating structures.  It has set up a new office in Dublin to concentrate specifically on the region.  The organisation works closely with all other agencies, local groups, enterprise associations, community development organisations etc. and has committed substantial time and resources to supporting these groups.  In addition, in the Dublin region, Forbairt has appointed two area managers &mdash; north and south &mdash; specifically to coordinate the organisation's support for community development activities.</P>
    <P>Dublin based companies are also fully involved in initiatives by Forbairt to support Irish companies to develop international business partnerships. These partnerships offer unique opportunities for Irish companies to increase their sales, build their capability and push into new export markets.  The establishment of good business partnership and ongoing development of similar links has been a key factor in the growth of many successful companies. <Col N="1403" /> Forbairt operates a technology transfer and partnership programme to support companies in developing these partnerships and is also involved in a number of specific initiatives to promote business partnerships between Irish and North American companies.</P>
    <P>The third-level sector is a source of significant scientific and industrial knowledge and potential industrial projects.  In the Dublin region, Forbairt works closely with the sector through funding schemes for postgraduate students and support for scientific research projects.  Forbairt operates a scheme to develop centres of excellence in the colleges, notably the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The organisation has also introduced a new initiative, the campus companies programme, to assist individuals interested in commercialising research and development on the college campus.</P>
    <P>The national linkage programme which is aimed at increasing the level of business linkages and networks between Irish and overseas companies in Ireland and with developing the scale and capability of the Irish sub-supply sector is also operated on a more localised regional basis, specifically to address the needs of small supply companies at regional level.  In Dublin, resources have been allocated to work with companies in the region which can benefit from this business and an executive has been appointed with exclusive responsibility to focus on promoting increased business linkages for Dublin companies.</P>
    <P>The Dublin area has received significant investment from IDA Ireland's activities for many years.  The results of this activity can be seen from the direct employment numbers in IDA client companies located in Dublin, and the exceptional growth of these businesses over the past five years: in 1990, there were 299 IDA assisted overseas companies employing a total workforce of 17,900; in 1995 there were 422 IDA assisted overseas companies employing <Col N="1404" /> 23,500 people.  During that five year period, a considerable number of jobs were created in service and supply businesses in the Dublin area, stimulated by the rapid increase in IDA client company requirements.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of this year, another 2,475 jobs have been announced in IDA supported projects for the Dublin area.  These jobs will be spread across the area in a wide variety of businesses in both new inward investments and existing businesses.  Deputies will be aware of the very welcome recent announcement that Gateway 2000, the American computer company, is to create 1,200 jobs in north Dublin over the next three years.</P>
    <P>To continue to attract growth and development, the IDA has some 200 acres of developed sites in a selection of locations across the area and the private sector and local authorities have also significant land resources.  However, the take up of this landbank is growing rapidly and considerable expense and effort must be maintained to ensure an ongoing supply for future needs.</P>
    <P>In addition, several advance factories are available and others are in the course of construction in the area.  As with the landbank, the IDA seeks to ensure that approximately 100,000 &mdash; 200,000 sq ft of space is continuously available to facilitate new investment at all times.</P>

      <P>I have received a request from Astronomy Ireland to help meet the cost of a public observatory. <Col N="1405" /> According to the promoters, they have acquired a building to house the observatory, but require some assistance with the cost of materials, a suitable telescope and related services.  This request is one of a number of such proposals which the promoters believe will improve public awareness of science and technology.  I have also from time to time received requests for support for substantial proposals of a capital or infrastructural nature and have had to make it clear that I am not in a position to offer financial assistance.</P>
      <P>I am on record as stating that a poor perception of science and technology issues, particularly among decision makers in the public and private sectors, is a fundamental weakness in the Irish science and technology system.  I have asked Forfás to prepare proposals for a dedicated campaign to improve the perception of science and technology and a variety of specific actions are under consideration in that regard.  I have asked Forfás to examine the proposal from Astronomy Ireland in that light.</P>
      <P>Other similar ventures have also sought public funding support through the programmes of other Departments and this aspect has also to be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 which came into effect on 13 May 1996, mortgage lenders are now required to state the APR in all advertisements in which a rate of interest is mentioned.  Furthermore all housing loan agreements must include on their front page a breakdown of the capital advanced, the period of agreement, the <Col N="1406" /> number and amount of each repayment instalment, the cost of the credit and the APR.  This ensures that before entering into the agreement borrowers are fully alive to the extent of their financial obligations.</P>
      <P>Building societies are required by law to inform borrowers of a change in interest rates.  It is also the practice now by both building societies and banks to advertise in the national daily newspapers advising their customers of any changes in interest rates, together with the new rates and the applicable APR.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 to 66, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>All the measures referred to are new initiatives and the following arrangements apply in regard to their implementation.</P>
      <P>The planned start up date for Workplace and Jobstart is the end of May 1996.  Both programmes will be heavily promoted by FÁS and the new local employment services and I am confident that they will have a considerable impact on improving the employment prospects of unemployed people.  Five thousand places or people will ultimately be provided for on an ongoing basis under each of these programmes. The projected up-take on Workplace by the end of the year is some 2,000 while the up-take on Jobstart is projected at between 1,200-1,500.</P>
      <P>On-going discussions are taking place between my Department, FÁS and the Department of Social Welfare regarding the implementation of the special measures for 18 and 19 year olds which will provide opportunities for 500 young unemployed people at any one time.  It is intended that the programme will apply for those 18 and 19 year olds who are six months on the live register.  I would see this initiative becoming operative during the autumn of this year. The measures will include a youth progression programme for each individual designed to encourage young people into the labour market and to prevent them from drifting into prolonged dependence on the live register.</P>
      <P>The pilot whole time jobs option will come into operation in July and will provide 1,000 additional appointments for long-term unemployed people in areas of high unemployment in the cities of Cork, Limerick and Dublin.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of payments made in 1995 in respect of the counties of Limerick, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Tipperary and Clare from European Union funds; the number of beneficiaries per county during this period; and the expected payments in respect of each of these counties from such funds for 1996 in respect of disadvantaged areas payments, beef premium payments, suckler cow premia payments, sheep premia payments, REP scheme payments, installation aid payments, control of farmyard pollution grants, farm retirement scheme payments and forestry programme payments.</Quest>

      <P>The following <Col N="1412" /> tables set out the 1995 position for the schemes specified by the Deputy.  It is not possible to predict the 1996 out-turn for the counties concerned.  Payments will depend on the number and content of the applications submitted and processed satisfactorily and, in the case of investment schemes, the level of works completed to the Department's specifications.</P>

      <P>The following tabular statement sets out the number <Col N="1416" /> of applicants paid, the number of animals paid for and the amount paid under the 1995 special beef premium scheme, suckler cow scheme, ewe premium scheme and slaughter premium scheme.  Under the special beef premium scheme farmers may apply on three occasions of their own choosing throughout the year under both ten and 22 months' age categories.  The 1995 extensification premium payments are due to commence within the next week and it is estimated that a further £60 million will be paid under that scheme.</P>

These payments account for the great bulk of CAP payments to farmers. Payments in respect of other schemes are not readily classifiable according to size or, where such classification is possible, cannot be related to the payments made in respect of headage, premia and arable aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. S. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by anglers in gaining access to Ballintines Pier at Brickeen on Lough Arrow.  The North-Western Fisheries Board, which has been working to resolve the access difficulties, has advised that a public right of way cannot be proven.</P>
      <P>Section 39 of the Fisheries Act, 1980 provides that the central or a regional fisheries board may apply to the Minister for an Order to be made creating a right of way by a particular route over any land to enable a board to perform statutory functions under the Act or to enable fishermen to gain access to fishing waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-Western Board however has advised that it has decided not to apply for a section 39 order to be made in this instance.  The board's assessment is that Ballintines Pier is not a suitable access point for anglers generally although it is still willing to help negotiate an agreement with the landowner for limited access for existing users to <Col N="1421" /> the pier.  Overall the board is looking strategically at the question of access for anglers to Lough Arrow and is actively pursuing an alternative and more suitable access point as well as options for improved access to the northern end of the lake from existing access points on the eastern shore.</P>
