      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution Review Group furnished me with provisional reports on a number of constitutional issues.  The Government agreed to publish the reports and I arranged to have copies placed in the Oireachtas Library on the relevant dates of publication &mdash; 22 January and 6 February 1996.</P>
      <P>The group has indicated that its work is well advanced, that it expects to finish its study by the end of May and that its report, embodying the provisional reports, will be furnished to me shortly afterwards.  I will arrange to have the report published and copies placed in the Oireachtas Library in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Given recent experience of referenda, would the Taoiseach agree that constitutional change based on the reports published to date should be limited to what is essential?  Would <Col N="546" /> he accept the view of the committee examining the reports that in general the Constitution is constructively adapted and reinterpreted by the Judiciary to meet new needs and conditions in a way that makes constant amendment of the Constitution unnecessary and, probably, undesirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are interesting points which could usefully be considered by the all-party committee which the Government hopes to establish to consider all of these reports, including the final report from the Constitution Review Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it envisaged setting up a constitutional committee? From past experience, such a committee would fall at the end of the Dáil.  As this Dáil has, at most, a little over a year to run, the committee may only work from this autumn until spring next year.  I do not see how it could carry out much work in that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal for the establishment of the committee is at an advanced stage.  Detailed proposals were furnished to Deputies Ahern and Harney on 10 April.  We hope to hear from the Deputies shortly so that we can quickly proceed to establish the committee.  The committee will obviously set itself a priority work programme, indicating the areas where work is of the highest priority, and come to its conclusions on those matters perhaps earlier than it would on other more general matters.  Until the committee actually meets it would be best to refrain from too detailed a speculation on the work programme the committee might set itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the answer he has just given pre-empts the activities of this committee completely?  First, it suggests that there are priority issues to which this committee is supposed to address itself, which suggests that it is not <Col N="547" /> engaged in a general review of the Constitution. Second, would the Taoiseach agree that it would be very unfortunate if issues which in many people's minds are priorities &mdash; Cabinet confidentiality, the right to bail, votes for emigrants and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution &mdash; were taken off the agenda as far as this committee is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those issues are the subject of separate consideration, as was made very clear when this exercise was commenced a year ago.  They remain matters for separate consideration.  The work programme of the committee is a matter for itself.  My response was simply directed to the common-sense point that the committee itself will want to make the best use of its time, and that, I presume, will involve some form of prioritisation of its work.  That is and will be a matter for the committee to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's intention that the constitutional committee will continue to work at the same time as the all-party committee?  It is my understanding that the constitutional committee has many more months of work to do.  To come back to my earlier point, is it not the case that we will not have an all party committee until near the end of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed on two points.  The Constitution Review Group will conclude its work by the end of May.  The all-party committee will be commenced before that and will continue with its work thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach explain to the House why it is that an all-party committee representative of all the views in this House should not address the issues I listed a moment ago?  Why is it that the Government's view on those matters is preferable to an all-party view?  Can the Taoiseach explain to the House why, if those were <Col N="548" /> priority issues that did not need to be examined by the constitution review group or an all-party committee, nothing has happened in respect of any of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to find myself in disagreement with Deputy Michael McDowell as to the facts.  On the matter of Cabinet confidentiality, the Government has decided on the lines of an amendment which is at present being drafted.  The matter of votes for emigrants is at present being considered by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, as no doubt Deputy McDowell is aware, on the basis of a paper circulated by the Government.  The matter of bail is currently engaging the Government's attention.  Deputy McDowell will recognise that the matter of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and their amendment is one that would be far more appropriately dealt with in all-party negotiations involving Northern Ireland as well as the Republic rather than simply dealt with separately by a committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether the matters of Cabinet confidentiality and votes for emigrants will be precluded from discussion by the all-party group?  Presumably they will still be able to discuss these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sent the Deputy the proposed terms of reference of the committee which he can study and on which he can present any views he wishes.  Work on most of the matters referred to is well advanced.  I have already indicated the stage of work in regard to each in response to Deputy Michael McDowell.  The Government is advancing its proposals on these various matters, which will come to the House in due course where they will be the subject of all-party consideration.</P>

      <Quest>the composition of the Government's negotiating team for the forthcoming all-party negotiations commencing on 10 June, 1996.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8113/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>A decision on the composition of the Government's delegation for the all-party negotiations commencing on 10 June will be taken in due course.</P>
      <P>The Government is satisfied that these negotiations provide an unrivalled opportunity for an historical political compromise.  This opportunity is provided by the comprehensive and balanced ground rules for the talks which this Government agreed with the British Government.  All the key principles to ensure a successful outcome are in place and overall, the ground rules paper for these talks is a significant advance on the basis for the 1991-92 talks.  Never before did any Government get a fixed date for fully inclusive all-party negotiations on such a comprehensive basis.</P>
      <P>Regarding the future role of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, this is a matter for the participants to determine by agreement.  The Forum remains in being, but its chairperson has concluded, in line with the preponderant view among the 12 participating delegations, that its meetings should be deferred.  This decision by its chairperson was consistent with the basis on which the Forum was set up, namely the existence of an IRA ceasefire and the fact that its terms of reference specify that all differences be resolved by exclusively peaceful and democratic means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairperson, in her consultations with delegations, also noted a strong wish among all those participating to see those conditions restored.  I share this wish and hope.  While the primary axis of progress is now the all-party talks commencing on 10 June, the Government remains open to any role for the <Col N="550" /> Forum that might be seen to be appropriate in the light of the evolving situation.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the outstanding contribution to the peace process made by Judge Catherine McGuinness through her skilful and inclusive chairing of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I too pay tribute to Judge Catherine McGuinness on the tremendous work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  While I am aware of its terms of reference, would the Taoiseach agree that we could find ourselves in the absurd position in which a new forum would be established in the North, framed on the basis of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation held in Dublin Castle, in which Sinn Féin can participate?  Regardless of what decision the IRA may take, whether or not its ceasefire is reinstated, it can participate in that new forum whereas the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation cannot meet under any condition.</P>
      <P>Apart from the views of any participants in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, would the Taoiseach agree that, in the absence of other initiatives, there is a strong case for it to meet in extraordinary session, having already engaged in some very useful discussions over the past 18 months or so, to ascertain whether it can do anything to assist and advance the peace process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor was very clear in his decision not to establish a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation involving Sinn Féin until there was in place a complete cessation of IRA violence. That was the basis on which the Forum was established by him, with my agreement as then Leader of the Opposition. Its terms of reference, which may not be changed without the agreement of all its participants, are absolutely clear &mdash; that differences should not be resolved by the methods used at Canary Wharf, that there ought to be a complete cessation of IRA violence.  It is <Col N="551" /> important that we in this House should be very clear on this matter.  There is no halfway house between peace and violence; there is no halfway house between democracy and coercion.  It is very important that the message going from this House should be a simple one &mdash;&ldquo;We want you in the forum; we want you in the talks; please restore the ceasefire&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My party believes that, until such time as the IRA ceasefire is restored, there is no point in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation meeting since it was established to provide a democratic platform for Sinn Féin once the ceasefire had been announced. Since the ceasefire has not been restored, I do not believe its reinstatement would be worthwhile.  Having said that, will the Taoiseach say if, in relation to the composition of the Government team, all three parties in Government will be represented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions have not been taken on that matter and the Government operates collectively in regard to this policy area.  It would be my expectation, on the basis of Members' contributions, that all of the parties in Government would be represented but no firm or final decision thereon has yet been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned at the contradiction between the terms of reference of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the new forum proposed by the British Government in that Sinn Féin can participate in the latter without the IRA having restored its ceasefire whereas it cannot participate in the former?  Has he expressed such concerns to the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the basis on which the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was established &mdash; which was an unambiguous one &mdash; was the best basis for its establishment.  The <Col N="552" /> Deputy's question is about that Forum. I do not believe my predecessor was wrong in insisting, with the agreement of all the parties in this House, that its terms of reference should include a clear statement that all differences about self-determination and other matters should be resolved by exclusively peaceful and democratic means.  I regret to say that I do not include the activities at Canary Wharf or subsequent ones on the part of the IRA as consistent with the terms of reference of that forum.  I want to see conditions prevail in which the IRA ceasefire is restored.  Once that happens, I believe not only will Sinn Féin be able to take its rightful place in the all-party talks, but that we will then be in a position to resume the full working of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation so that it too can complete its work.  That is what is important at this stage.</P>
      <P>As far as the forum being established by the British Government in Northern Ireland is concerned, my priority is to begin all-party negotiations on 10 June next; that is what has now been achieved, a fixed date for all-party talks. No such fixed date was obtained before. Deputy Ahern will recollect that there were substantial delays in starting the 1991-92 talks because a fixed date had not been set, whereas there is now a fixed date for the opening of such negotiations. I want everyone there.  I want to see Sinn Féin there.  I want the IRA to restore its ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the comments of Dr. Ian Paisley to the effect that his party will not participate in all-party negotiations unless the Northern Ireland forum meets first, is it the Taoiseach's understanding that that forum will meet in advance of all party negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British and Irish Governments have agreed that negotiations will start on 10 June next.  That is a clear engagement between the Government to which Dr. Paisley gives loyalty and this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> The two Governments have agreed that talks will start on 10 June and they will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer my question.  Does he think the forum should meet in advance of those talks?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In regard to outward visits the position, as of now, is as follows.  From 24 &mdash; 26 April I will pay an official visit to Poland during which I will have meetings with the President and Prime Minister of Poland and with other political figures.  On 4 June I will visit Bonn for a meeting with Chancellor Kohl.  On 21 and 22 June I will attend the European Council in Florence.</P>
      <P>Prior to Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, I am scheduled as of now to meet in Dublin shortly the following Heads of State and Government:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> Prime Minister Simitis of Greece, whom I will meet tomorrow;</P>
    <P>President Ahtissari and Prime Minister Lipponen of Finland;</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Dehaene of Belgium;</P>
    <P>President Delamuraz of the Swiss Confederation;</P>
    <P>Chancellor Vranitsky of Austria; and President Havel of the Czech Republic.</P>
    <P>I will meet the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer at the end of May when he visits Dublin. I also expect to meet Mr. Santer early in June in Brussels.  All these meetings will afford the opportunity to have a discussion on the current European Union agenda and on the Irish Presidency of the Union.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Taoiseach is playing a central role in the planning and preparation for the Irish Presidency. In pursuit of this role it provides the secretariat for the Ministers and Secretaries Group on the EU Presidency and the Intergovernment Conference which I chair.  The role of this group is to oversee the co-ordination of the Irish Presidency of the EU from both a policy and an administrative viewpoint and to oversee the co-ordination of Ireland's negotiating position at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group of officials chaired by an official from my Department has been established to assist the work of the Ministers and Secretaries group.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is represented on other Interdepartmental Committees at official level charged with policy and administrative preparations for the Presidency.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be glad to hear that my Department is also overseeing the organisation of a special cultural event on 1 July next in Temple Bar area to celebrate the opening of the Irish Presidency. My Department will also be responsible for hosting a conference on local development during the Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House wish the Government well during the Presidency.  I tabled a question about the Ministers and Secretaries group to which the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, replied that the first meeting would take place shortly.</P>
      <P>Is the Ministers and Secretaries group working on the same basis as during Ireland's Presidency in 1990?  How many meetings have taken place?  Does the Taoiseach intend to continue those meetings during the Presidency?</P>
      <P>Prior to Ireland's Presidency will the Taoiseach set out in the House his priorities for Ireland's Presidency?  On three occasions the Taoiseach gave some details, but it would be useful to have a debate on the issues before the Taoiseach has the honour of being the President of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministers and Secretaries group met twice and will meet again next week.  It will meet more frequently during Ireland's Presidency. It is working very well and on the same basis as it operated during previous Presidencies.</P>
      <P>It would be useful to have a debate on the Presidency close to its commencement &mdash; some time in June would be best for such a debate.  Because of the nature of EU work, one is not absolutely certain of the items remaining on the agenda of various Councils until close to the commencement of the Presidency.  Some matters may be dealt with during the Italian Presidency which we would not have expected to have been dealt with, but others may be deferred until the Irish Presidency. From the point of view of giving the House the most comprehensive and up to date information on the content and priorities of the Irish Presidency, it would be best to wait until closer to the commencement date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being critical of the Italian Presidency &mdash; everybody understands their difficulties &mdash; but is the Taoiseach concerned that four months work of the Intergovernmental <Col N="556" /> Conference seems to have been lost during the Italian Presidency and because of another major event namely BSE and the beef crisis, very little work was done at the Turin meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference.  Will the Taoiseach indicate what is happening to try to rectify what effectively has been a four month delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be accurate to suggest the Italian Presidency contributed to a four month delay. Prime Minister Dini and Foreign Minister Agnelli and the other Italian Ministers did their work very well during the Presidency and a number of items on the agenda have been advanced.  There have been frequent intensive meetings during the Italian Presidency.  Notwithstanding its difficulties, the Italian Presidency has worked exceptionally well and will provide a good basis for the Irish Presidency to continue its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach does not want to debate the issues until closer to the Irish Presidency but what are his objectives for the Presidency? The Taoiseach may recall that during our Presidency six years ago, the then Taoiseach adopted the environment as its theme and it was known as the Green Presidency.  Does the Taoiseach have any such objectives in mind for our Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered some questions on that and I would prefer to set the priorities closer to the date of our Presidency.  However, I would like to see an advance on justice and home affairs, pillar III, with particular emphasis on the fight against international crime and the drugs menace both in terms of demand, supply and consumption of drugs.  Obviously a very important part of the work of our Presidency will be to advance the Intergovernmental Conference and deal with all the issues that have to be dealt with in terms of the efficient working of the Community and the issues that were left over from the Maastricht agreement <Col N="557" /> which need to be dealt with by this Intergovernmental Conference.  We will have to deal with international events which it is not possible to foresee at this time and time and resources will have to be available for unexpected eventualities. As of now &mdash; and I will make a fuller statement later &mdash; our priorities are to focus on dealing at European level with problems of immediate concern to Europe's citizens, in particular crime and drugs and to advance the Intergovernmental Conference so that the working methods of the European Union are visible and win as much support as possible from the citizens of Europe.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said he would meet Mr. Santer.  Does he agree the Irish Government's relationship with the Commission is not as good as the relationship enjoyed by the previous Government with Mr. Jacques Delors? Does the Taoiseach intend using his meeting with Mr. Santer to correct the perception in the Commission that Irish Ministers are continually undermining the Commissioners?  I have in mind issues such as light rail, Mutton Island treatment plant, the beef industry fine and of course the mobile phone licence which members of the Commission are discussing with Irish Ministers?  Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to try to stop these unseemly rows in public?</P>

      <P>The co-ordinating group of secretaries under the strategic management initiative &mdash; SMI &mdash; has now completed its report setting out a comprehensive framework of change for the Civil Service and its extension to the wider public service.  The recommendations in the report have been <Col N="560" /> endorsed by Government.  The Government will announce on 2 May, a major programme of change which sets out the strategic direction for the Irish civil and public service of the future.</P>
      <P>Leaders of the Opposition parties and trade unions will be briefed on the programme in advance of the announcements on 2 May.  Civil and public servants at all levels will be consulted and will participate in the development and implementation of the changes to be undertaken.  At the level of individual organisations, all Departments and offices will publish a statement of strategy before the end of this year.  Local authorities have also been asked to prepare statements by the end of March next year.  Extension of the SMI process to the other public service organisations will be completed during 1996.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe so.  The preparation of this initiative has been under way for a long time and has been the subject of extensive consultations with the unions representing staff.  It is important to recognise that the staff are the key to the success of any initiative of this kind and their co-operation is being sought in every way possible.  The strategic management initiative, when in place, will make work in the Civil Service more rewarding and interesting for the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a timescale to which a series of working groups will work.  Obviously, this is a consultative process in which one is seeking to concert a wide number of people into agreements about new practices and new ways of working.  Therefore, one will not put anybody in the position of being forced to work to rigid or artificial <Col N="561" /> deadlines.  However, there will be a clear sense of purpose and a clear target in terms of implementing the steps involved in the strategic management initiative.</P>

      <P>I support this process, as the Taoiseach knows.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to delay the reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act pending the SMI work being undertaken or will the work that was already commenced on the Act, which is now about 72 years old, continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will.  One of the working groups established to carry forward the strategic management initiative, following the Government announcement on 2 May, specifically deals with the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  It is important to make whatever changes are necessary in the legislative framework of the Civil Service in tandem with the introduction of changes in practice within the service.  These two should work parallel with each other rather than otherwise.  One could not make changes in the Ministers and Secretaries Act independently of the strategic management initiative either because one must reflect what is happening in the initiative in the changes in the Act.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded by this question to put my comments in their proper context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both I and my predecessor, in response to similar parliamentary questions on 30 March 1994 and 22 November 1995, have indicated that the Government has encouraged and will continue to encourage Aer Lingus to develop appropriate strategic alliances with other airlines as part of its overall development strategy.  This approach is consistent with the document on Irish <Col N="565" /> aviation policy published in February 1994.</P>
    <P>My recent comments were made in answer to a journalist's question at the press conference announcing the World-wide Partnership agreement between Aer Lingus and Delta Airlines.  I said I believed the way forward was for Aer Lingus to associate and align itself with major international players in the aviation sector.  This is an integral part of the way in which development takes place in this industry and Aer Lingus has been quite active in the forging of such alliances in recent times.</P>
    <P>The announcement of the agreement with Delta Airlines was the most significant of these partnerships to date.  It brings major benefits to travellers between Ireland and the United States and significantly strengthens the position of Aer Lingus in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's question about the sale of a substantial minority stake in Aer Lingus as part of a strategic alliance, there is no such proposal before my Department at present, nor did I say there was.</P>
    <P>Any such proposals would be a matter in the first instance for consideration by the management and board of Aer Lingus.  In the event that such proposals were brought to my Department, I confirm that they would be looked at seriously on their merits in order to determine whether they were in the best interests of the airline and the economic development of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the transcript of the tape of the RTE interview.  Is the Minister aware that he indicated an alliance with the big players in the aviation sector must be looked at seriously?  If he is telling us that is consistent with what was said all along? Will he explain why two Cabinet Ministers immediately telephoned RTE about this matter?  I will not outline how they described the Minister, but they effectively dissociated themselves totally from what he said during that interview. In referring to a strategic alliance, <Col N="566" /> is the Minister talking in terms of selling off a percentage share of Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speculate on the Deputy's hearsay about any of those comments.  I have dealt with much hearsay in recent times.  This is another instance of it with which I will not deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and his party have a difficulty in understanding what is involved in a strategic alliance arrangement.  There are many forms of strategic alliance and they do not necessarily have to be equity based.  The alliances we requested Aer Lingus to forge, in which it has been particularly successful, relate to co-operation and agreements to the mutual advantage of Aer Lingus and the airline with which it associates.</P>
      <P>The Deputy does not appear to understand what his party negotiated when in Government.  An extract from the Irish Aviation Policy Report published in February 1994 under the direction of my predecessor, the former Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Cowen, states:</P>

    <P>With the progressive liberalisation of the airline industry world-wide many airlines with relatively small domestic markets have sought alliances with stronger carriers or groups of carriers.  In some cases these involve cross-shareholdings while in other cases alliances are confined to marketing arrangements.  In so far as Aer Lingus is concerned, while the proposed form of such an alliance is a matter in the first instance for the board of Aer Lingus, the Government as the major shareholder will seriously consider on their merits all proposals from Aer Lingus on such alliances.  Those could include cross-shareholding agreements and additional equity investments.  If these are judged to be in the best interests of the company and the economic <Col N="567" /> development of the country, the Government will encourage Aer Lingus to develop appropriate strategic alliances.</P>
    <P>That extract indicates that any discussions that have taken place with Aer Lingus have been to the benefit of the company and the type of alliances that have come to fruition relate to associations with other airlines to give access to hub centres, human resource skills and, in particular, code sharing and marketing expertise with other airlines.</P>

      <P>The Minister must accept that some of his Cabinet Ministers do not share his view and were afraid on that occasion that the Minister was shooting off his mouth without having discussed a matter of vital national importance with them.  Has the Minister, as a matter of courtesy, discussed a possible strategic alliance with the Congress of Trade Unions, the unions involved in Aer Lingus or its management?</P>

      <P>As I stated, any strategic alliance, irrespective of its form, is in the first instance a matter for the board and management of Aer Lingus.  The Government would only become involved if such a proposal were put forward. I can confirm that such discussions have not taken place with me. Apart from the recent announcement of an agreement with Delta Airlines, Aer Lingus has formed a number of strategic alliances.  Other alliances include code sharing agreements with KLM and Hamburg Airlines, code sharing and block space agreement with Sabena Airlines, joint marketing initiatives with TWA and United Airlines and a world-wide cargo agreement with British Airways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I should clarify for the Deputy that the bid process has not closed.  Two preliminary bids have been received and evaluated, in accordance with predetermined criteria, by representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance, Telecom Éireann and the advisers in the strategic alliance process.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this evaluation, the Government has decided that both of these proposals should be admitted to the second stage of the process which has already commenced and which involves detailed negotiations with both bidders and any other parties who may join them in a consortium.  This process will ultimately lead to the submission of final binding bids.</P>
      <P>In relation to employee shareholding the Government in its mandate for the strategic alliance stated its willingness to consider setting aside up to 5 per cent of the share capital of the company for this purpose.  Preliminary work is under way within Telecom Éireann and my Department on the establishment of such a scheme in the context of the restructuring of the company.</P>
      <P>It makes sense that the employees of Telecom are given the opportunity to partake in the company's future prosperity. However, the implementation and success of any such scheme will depend on the extent to which agreement and consensus can be reached on the way forward for Telecom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that eight out of the ten players who expressed an interest in a strategic alliance with Telecom Éireann have withdrawn their names and that the Minister is on record as valuing the 35 per cent stake in the region of £500 million, will he confirm that the best offer on the table is less than £300 million?  Will he, therefore, <Col N="570" /> agree that the time involved in putting the alliance together &mdash; he has had almost two years in which to do so &mdash; has been prolonged and used unproductively, which is not in the best interests of Telecom Éireann, with the result that we are left with two suitors who would be regarded as regional rather than top class international interests?</P>

      <P>The Deputy should be aware that it is not possible for me to negotiate publicly on any aspect of it, but I can inform him that we have moved from phase 1 to phase 2.  The purpose of phase 1 was to identify parties which would head-up consortia and which made preliminary proposals that would qualify them to move to phase 2. The purpose of phase 2, now under way, is to choose one of these parties after a process of negotiation and final binding bids.</P>
      <P>The alliance process timetable is running to schedule and my objective is to conclude it before the summer recess. We are entering, perhaps, the busiest period of the critical path.  We have entered what is, essentially, the nitty gritty stage of the process.  For the month of May there is not one day without scheduled meetings involving the company, the Department and potential partners.</P>

It is concerned about the mismanagement of the issue by the Minister.  When he entered office he was full of vim but, he unfortunately lost the wind from his sails very early on.  Is he concerned that we have lost the major international players who in the intervening two-year period have involved themselves in other strategic alliances?

I will not speculate on which individuals were or were not considered for positions in the Irish Aviation Authority and neither will I comment on press speculation on those appointments. However, I can confirm that only two appointments have been made to the board of the Irish Aviation Authority since April 1995.  Those were Mr. Aidan O'Brien, who was reappointed, and Mr. James T. Barton who was a new appointee on 26 March 1996.  The air navigation services division of my Department did not, at any stage, prepare, issue and withdraw a warrant in respect of any individual.  As the Deputy is aware, when vacancies arise on State bodies many people offer themselves <Col N="575" /> for the positions.  A number of people are requested to consider allowing their names to go forward.  It may happen from time to time that names come into the public domain but, at the end of the day, it is a matter for the Minister and the Government to make what they consider to be the most suitable and appropriate appointment at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 25, 26, 142 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), an international and well respected group of experts in the area of non-ionising radiation, has this month published a detailed review of the health issues relating to mobile phones and base transmitters.  This was done in response to concerns expressed about the risks to health from non-ionising radiation produced by base station towers and to questions concerning the adequacy of current safe exposure limits.</P>
      <P>This report endorses the limits set out by International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) in 1988.  These limits are those which are adhered to by telecommunications transmission systems in this country.  The review also states there is no substantive evidence that adverse health effects can occur in people exposed to levels of non-ionising radiation at or below the IRPA's 1988 limits.  The levels in this country are well within these limits.  The report has been issued in the last month.</P>
      <P>The review is welcomed as an objective and expert contribution on the ongoing debate on electromagnetic fields and their possible health risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident the findings of the review will provide reassurance to those who have concerns over the health implications of communications masts. It supports the position taken by the regulatory authorities in Ireland that the amount of electromagnetic energy from masts to which the general public is <Col N="579" /> exposed is over a thousand times less than those energy levels considered to be safely tolerated 24 hours per day.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I see no reason to commission a further scientific study of the issue.  My Department, however, will continue to monitor all future developments in the area to ensure that the most up to date international standards are being employed.</P>
    <P>Advice to planning authorities is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  I am aware, however, that his Department has issued draft guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures.  These guidelines which are to be published in their finalised form later this month require, <i>inter alia,</i> that telecommunications operators furnish a statement of compliance with the IRPA guidelines or other relevant international standards.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have recently, in collaboration with my colleagues the Ministers for the Environment and Health set up an interdepartmental working group to examine what action if any should be taken on telecommunications masts and to consider whether it is necessary to have ongoing monitoring and measurement and, if so, by whom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider his decision not to establish a statutory body to advise on and control the emission of non-ionising radiation particularly in view of the planned erection of 1,200 masts for the proposed expansion of the mobile phone system? At least that number will be required and probably more in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very few guidelines with regard to the levels of tolerable emissions. The Minister referred to the IRPA.  The guidelines from the Department of the Environment do not lay down what these levels are but refer only to the IRPA.  What authority adjudicates on the levels of emissions? What requirements are there on applicants for permission to erect masts which will contain instruments from <Col N="580" /> which there will be non-ionising emissions? Is there a requirement that the levels of emissions must be stated before planning permission is granted? Has it not been the case that permission has been granted for the erection of masts for one purpose but that subsequently numerous other electromagnetic instruments have been erected on them without any planning permission?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be mixing up the IRPA with the RPII.  These abbreviations sometimes confuse me as well.  Planning permission is a matter for local authorities and the guidelines for such permission is a matter for another Minister.  The IRPA has set down clear guidelines within which our telecommunications systems must operate.  The amount of non-ionising radiation emitting from our systems is a thousand times less than the amount allowable under long established international guidelines.  The most recent report by international experts in this area, which was published this month, says that the standards laid down in 1988 are adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister familiar with the report by Professor Henshaw of Bristol University on the dangers of electromagnetic emissions?  Is he prepared to admit that there are differing scientific opinions expressed by people such as Professor Henshaw on the possibility of such dangers?  Does the Minister accept that ordinary members of the public are concerned when they see masts being erected close to their houses?  In one case a mast can be touched from a window of a private dwelling.  Surely the Minister cannot continue to stand over this kind of situation. It is not good enough for him to glibly state that planning is a matter for the Department of the Environment. Surely that Department and the planning authorities have a responsibility to ensure that the Department of Energy does not authorise erections if they are a danger to the public because of close proximity to dwelling houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department and I are aware of 11,000 reports on this issue and I am sure Professor Henshaw's report is among them.  The International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, an internationally respected body of experts, examined these reports from all angles and issued a report this month which submits that the levels of non-ionising radiation laid down in 1988 are not harmful to human beings.  In this context I do not see any need for me to further examine the matter.  The 11,000 studies which have been carried out amount to a colossal amount of research.</P>
      <P>There is continuing uncertainty in that if something is examined and it is not proved that it does something else, the wrong aspect may have been examined and another aspect should be examined.  Therefore, there is ongoing research at international level and we have established an interdepartmental working group to examine how best the matter should be dealt with in Ireland. Forbairt has taken measurements from a number of locations throughout the country and the results are in agreement with data recently published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  Proximity to instruments does not give rise to higher dosage.</P>

      <P>No, Forbairt.  Deputies on the other side of the House should know what Forbairt is.  They set it up when they were in Government.  There is legislation which allows for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to be given specific responsibility for this but this would be premature in the context of the review by the working group consisting of representatives of the Department of the Environment, the Department of Health and my Department of all matters relating to this.  If the group advises me that the RPII should be given responsibility, I will support that proposal.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister establish a non-ionising radiation board as there is confusion here and among the public on this issue?  There are hundreds of applications for the erection of these masts and local authorities are ignorant as to what they can and cannot do. Many people are asking about the health risks of these masts.  I understand that the functions of the RPII could be extended by ministerial order to cover non-ionising radiation.  People could then ask this body for advice and an expert view.  The Department is preparing proposals but these have not yet been published.  Local authorities are ignorant about what they can do with regard to the health aspects of these masts.  There is a great deal of concern and confusion about this issue and this is part and parcel of the problem.  There should be one body to which people can put questions and obtain answers.</P>

He will be aware that 11,000 studies have been carried out by international experts who reported no later than this month to all the participant bodies, including Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister look at the guidelines issued to local authorities because there is a view that they are too vague?  With a cluster of six masts in one area, as there will be adjacent to Cork airport, would the Minister be fearful of the multiplier effect?  The view of the public is that local authorities are not in a position, because of the vagueness of the preamble, to give the levels of emissions from those masts.  Will the Minister consider this matter, particularly as it applies to Cork airport.  There are three masts in that area for which planning permission was not needed, planning permission was received for two and is likely to be given for a further one. There will, therefore, be six masts in one area.  If the Minister lived in that area he would certainly be concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for an entirely reasonable question.  The guidelines are in draft form at present and the final guidelines will issue from the Department of the Environment to local authorities within a month.  It is not my business to look at the draft guidelines but that of the Minister for the Environment and I am sure he will do so.  Deputies' comments on the draft guidelines will be brought to the attention of the Minister.  I am not an expert in this area and I do not know whether a grouping of aerials would have a multiplier effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but, without cutting across the responsibilities of my colleague, groupings of masts have a very <Col N="586" /> bad visual effect.  I hope the guidelines, when finalised and issued to local authorities, will take on board the points made by Deputies and will insist on everybody using the one mast so that there is not a series of masts in the one area.  People want modern communications, including mobile phones &mdash; people from all walks of life use mobile phones &mdash; and masts must be erected to communicate the signals, just as pylons are necessary for electricity and windmills for clean energy.  In all these areas there is a negative as well as a positive aspect and if there is demand for a service the negative aspect must be considered and minimised in so far as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be aware that those who are asking questions are not questioning the acceptance of modern developments and new technologies but questioning the lack of monitoring of the facilities being established. Planning permission is being granted for the erection of masts to contain the instruments which emit radiation and there is no obligation on the operators to continuously monitor those facilities.  Is the Minister aware that there is no monitoring body with statutory responsibility to check the emissions from masts?  There is no statutory authority with responsibility for non-ionising radiation.  Is it not the case that under section 9 of the Radiological Protection Act the Minister has power to extend the provisions of that Act to cover non-ionising radiation?  That point has been raised by me and by members of my party on a number of occasions in this House and further questioning today indicates that the Minister is still not prepared to accept the wide public concern that there is no statutory authority with responsibility to monitor emissions from masts.</P>

      <P>I understand that British enforcement authorities step up road checks and other enforcement procedures from time to time on all road freight vehicles operating within their territory.  However, I am not aware that there are particular problems being encountered by Irish hauliers in Britain <Col N="588" /> over and above hauliers from Britain itself, any other member state of the European Union or any third country.  I am satisfied that where the vehicle, the load being carried and the necessary documentation are in order, Irish hauliers, together with all other hauliers operating in or in transit through Britain, experience no difficulties in their dealings with the enforcement authorities there.</P>

      <P>I received such complaints when I was Minister and I received complaints again recently from road hauliers who say that for minor technical offences such as a blown bulb their lorries are parked up and they may be confined to police barracks overnight or for two nights until the condition of the lorry is up to the standard required in the country involved.  These people are discriminated against and the time has come for the Minister to take up the matter with the European Commission. The key proposal in the Single European Act is to ensure the free access of goods, people and services across the Community.  If there is not fair treatment for our hauliers the economy may be under threat.</P>

The laws in Britain are much more stringent than ours but there are proposals to bring our laws into line with the generally more stringent regulations in Britain.  I do not have any evidence that Irish hauliers are <Col N="589" /> being treated unfairly but they are subject to the law.

      <P>Iarnród Éireann's road freight division operates less than 2 per cent of the overall national licensed road haulage fleet.  I have been assured by CIE that it competes in an open market on a stand-alone, fully commercial basis without the benefit of Exchequer subvention.  It is Government policy that it should continue to operate on a commercial basis.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of the public service contracts regime, which I intend to introduce next year in place of the current CIE subvention arrangements, is to provide for a greater degree of transparency in the State's financial relationship with CIE.  An important element of the new arrangements will be the ring-fencing of CIE's commercial activities, including the road freight division as well as other areas such as catering, Rosslare Harbour and Bus Éireann's Expressway services.  These activities, which are not subvented, and are not intended to be subvented, will function as stand-alone, separate cost, revenue and profit centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>To address that concern, which is unfounded, I propose to provide public service contracts which will replace the existing lump sum subvention to the general group from 1997 onwards.  Those contracts will cover a five year period and they will clearly set out the services CIE will provide and the amount the State in turn will pay to support socially necessary non-commercial services.  We will also specify the quantity and quality of services to be provided.  We will include in that contract performance targets for the quantity and quality of services to be provided and allow for performance measurement, the result of which will be published.  When those contracts are in place, users of public transport will be able to see, for the first time, the service standards that have been set for CIE and how it performs against those standards which will have been set in advance.  CIE management and staff are seeking a clear mandate from the Government and that will be included as part of these contracts.  Taxpayers will be able to see the way their taxes are being used to support socially necessary transport services.  My Department is currently in discussion with CIE, the Department of Finance and all concerned in the company on the details of these contracts.  While there are some complex issues to be addressed, it will be some months before all the details are finalised.  There is a strong commitment on both sides to the basic concepts <Col N="591" /> and a significant measure of agreement in principle on most of the main objectives that should be achieved during the discussions</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the elaboration on his earlier reply.  I will study carefully the content of his replies.  I am most interested in the initiative he has announced and I am sure further questions will be asked about it.  Can I take it from what the Minister said that he hopes to have these new arrangements in place in four or five months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing. Significant progress has been made to date because of the level of agreement reached and the general acceptance in CIE that this is necessary for the future. I am aware that some sections of the road haulage industry are expressing concern about CIE's involvement in that industry.  It is important that there is no evidence to suggest that Iarnród Éireann is abusing its position in the road freight market.  As I indicated earlier, Iarnród Éireann's road haulage fleet accounts for less than 2 per cent of the total national licensed fleet, while its overall market share is estimated to be a maximum of 5 per cent.  It is therefore difficult to accept that CIE has anything approaching a dominant position, let alone a monopoly, in the road freight sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that CIE as a whole is in receipt of an annual Exchequer subvention in the region of £110 million per year but that goes to other sections of the company.  Hauliers in the private sector might be concerned that some of these Exchequer funds are used to shore up CIE's road freight business but the Exchequer subvention paid to CIE is strictly applied in accordance with European Union regulations.  I have been assured that no part of these funds is being used to support the road haulage element of CIE's operation.  CIE realises that the survival of this activity will depend on the extent to which it <Col N="592" /> makes a real contribution to the group's overall financial performance.  In other words, the road freight division of Iarnród Éireann must operate successfully on a fully commercial basis without subsidisation from within the group or elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann road haulage divisions often share the same location and on occasions when they are on the same site, buildings and perhaps garage mechanics may be jointly in use.  How can the Minister be confident there is not a carry-over from one enterprise to the other under the group heading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>That concern has been conveyed through the road hauliers association.  The national subvention to CIE is subject to strict European Union guidelines and I have been assured by the company that those guidelines are correctly enforced, in other words there is no cross-subsidisation of this particular activity.  It is a commercial operation. It has been successful in the past and it is currently making approximately £630,000 profit per year.  It is envisaged that in 1995 that profit will increase to approximately £700,000.  It is a successful stand-alone commercial operation which commands only 5 per cent of the business.  For that reason I am happy to support the activity and I understand from CIE it is expected to continue to trade profitably into the future.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>the implications, if any, of the recent derailment of a chemical train from Asahi in County Offaly; and the steps, if any, he will take in the interests of public safety.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1000/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>At 07.50 hours approximately on Saturday, 6 January 1996, the <Col N="593" /> 02.50 freight train from Ballina to North Wall became derailed at Tullamore station.  The train included nine empty chemical tanks en route from Ballina to North Wall port.  One of the empty chemical tanks became dislodged from the train during the derailment.  While some external damage was caused, there was never any danger to the public, staff or the environment.  These tanks are designed and built to stringent international standards to withstand impact and did so on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The accident was the subject of a formal inquiry by Iarnród Éireann, the purpose of which was to determine its cause and recommend any necessary remedial action.  The inquiry has determined that the primary cause of the derailment was a weld failure in a wagon suspension system.  Stringent measures to detect and prevent a recurrence of this problem have therefore been introduced by Iarnród Éireann. The report of the board of inquiry is also being examined by the railway inspecting officer of my Department who may recommend additional safety measures in due course.  I should stress that the accident did not result in any danger whatsoever to the public.  A further positive aspect was that the emergency plans which have been drawn up to deal with such accidents worked well and I take this opportunity to convey my appreciation to the personnel involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of rail operations is of course a matter for the board and management of CIE and Iarnród Éireann who have extensive procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of railway services at all times.  I have been assured by CIE that safety is the priority consideration in the operation of the railway and will not be compromised.  I should also point out that for more than 19 years, Iarnród Éireann has safely conveyed chemicals by rail from Dublin to Ballina, and by road from Ballina to Killala.  The methods employed in handling the traffic are in full accordance with international regulations and standards. The rolling stock used is built to <Col N="594" /> International Union of Railways standards and the road vehicles are equipped to meet current stringent regulations for vehicles carrying such substances.</P>
    <P>A scheme for the co-ordination of the emergency services and other organisations in the event of an incident or accident involving toxic chemicals or dangerous substances in transit by rail has been prepared by a committee operating under the aegis of my Department. The committee is representative of relevant Government Departments and agencies and of certain manufacturers using dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>The scheme which covers areas through which dangerous substances are carried by rail, provides a framework for the co-ordination of the actions of the various emergency services.  It also provides for the identification of substances, raising the alarm and rendering the site of an accident safe.  Under the direction of my Department, exercises are held from time to time to test the operational capability of the scheme. Plans are then reviewed in the light of the experience gained from these exercises.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by CIE that the current arrangements for the transport of these substances by rail are safe, having regard to the special equipment and procedures in use and the emergency plans which exist to deal with any incident involving these operations.  They will, however, be kept under regular review in the light of experience, including the findings of the inquiry into the Tullamore accident.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that there can never be any room for complacency where safety of the public is concerned. Major investment in new equipment, rolling stock and permanent way infrastructure has taken place and will continue in the coming years.  This in itself improves and enhances safety.  In parallel with new investment, however, there must be a constant emphasis on such matters as procedures, training, supervision and accountability &mdash; the human factor which is central to safety and <Col N="595" /> which is always the focus of attention when any accident or incident occurs.  It is clearly essential that concerted attention should constantly be focused on achieving the highest standards in this area.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the culture of safety is as important for the railway as its physical equipment and infrastructure. In that context I have, since coming into office, requested the chairman of CIE to give the issue of rail safety his personal attention, support and encouragement. I also asked that a non-executive director with special responsibility for safety issues and direct access to the CIE chairman be appointed to the board of Iarnród Éireann at the earliest possible opportunity.  I am happy to say that this has now been done.  The person concerned is also a member of the CIE main board and also chairs a CIE board committee on safety in the group as a whole.  In the circumstances, I am confident that the improvement of the safety environment and culture within Iarnród Éireann will remain a priority objective of the company.</P>

      <P>The national emergency plan for nuclear accidents was finalised in 1991.  It is of considerable importance to me and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that exercises of the national emergency plans are carried out regularly.  These are required to ensure that it will function in an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major Irish exercise of the plan, called Saferay, was carried out in 1992. Many lessons were learnt during this exercise and were addressed in a further <Col N="596" /> exercise held in 1993.  This exercise known as INEX 1 was organised by the Nuclear Energy Agency, NEA, of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  Based on the experience of INEX 1, an expert group on emergency exercises recommended the organisation of a second international exercise, INEX 2, to be carried out in 1995 or later, taking into account aspects of co-ordination with national programmes in the field of emergency exercises.</P>
    <P>INEX 2 is being developed by a programme committee and the NEA was not in a position to organise the first meeting of the programme committee for INEX 2 until October, 1995.  Ireland was represented at that meeting and has agreed to participate in INEX 2 along with more than 27 countries, the European Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>INEX 2 will comprise a series of exercises to take place in 1996 and 1997.  The first of these exercises in which Ireland will be a participant is scheduled to take place towards the end of this year.  It will provide an important test of our emergency arrangements.</P>
    <P>While no full scale test has occurred of the emergency plan since 1993 the vital co-operative emergency arrangements with our EU partners are tested every six to eight weeks.  At least one of these every year includes the transfer of simulated radiological data between EU member states.  The last test of the communication system established under the IAEA convention on early notification of a nuclear accident took place in September 1995.  Ireland participates in all of these tests and the experiences gained to date have lead to improvements in the international arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>the implications, if any, for the ESB and the Irish economy in view of the proposals in the draft EU Internal Energy Market Directive in its current format.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8147/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised draft electricity directive circulated by the Commission in February 1994 provided for a <Col N="598" /> relatively modest degree of liberalisation of the single electricity market. The main proposal was that customers with an annual electricity consumption of 100 Gigo Watt hours per year or greater be given the right to contract directly for electricity with independent power producers.  Since 1994, and particularly with the advent of the three new member states, there has been a considerable shift of opinion among member states in favour of a much greater degree of liberalisation of the market.</P>
      <P>The latest compromise proposal by the Italian presidency reflects this shift but a number of member states consider that it does not move sufficiently quickly towards liberalisation and one or two favour a more gradual approach. The proposal is therefore not the final word and may be modified again before the meeting of the Energy Council on 7 May 1996.</P>
      <P>However, if the proposed draft Directive is implemented as it stands it would mean a substantial immediate degree of liberalisation of the Irish market with a progressive widening of the number of customers who will be eligible to contract directly with independent power producers.  My Department estimates that 25 per cent of ESB's customers would immediately qualify as eligible customers if the proposal becomes law. This will represent a significant opportunity for customers and present a challenge for the ESB.  I expect that the introduction of significant levels of competition will bring considerable downward pressure on electricity prices.  I am also confident that the ESB is taking the necessary steps to prepare for the challenges that competition will bring.  I see no reason why the ESB should not prosper in a new open more liberalised market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, there are sufficient protections in the Directive to assure the Irish consumer of a secure supply of reasonably priced electricity.  There are specific protections for the important public service aspects of electricity such as ensuring that tariffs for the franchise <Col N="599" /> market will be uniform throughout the country.</P>

      <P>In view of all the speculation and comments made outside the House regarding the second mobile phone licence, as well as the fact that our questions have been ruled out of order and we have failed to get a debate on the matter, can the Taoiseach, in the interests of clarity and fairness, arrange for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to make a comprehensive statement to the House on all aspects of the affair?  The Minister made a brief statement last week for which we thank him, but it has not covered all the issues that have been referred to outside the House.  There have been many allegations, accusations and much innuendo.  It would be helpful for the House and for the Minister if he could make a comprehensive statement about all these matters.  If we cannot get a question and answer session we will sit and listen without posing questions.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Front Bench finds offensive those who say the matter is squeaky clean because a politician is not involved.  I am sure the Minister's handling of this matter has been squeaky clean but many people, for business or other reasons, are saying all kinds of things and seeking all kinds of meetings. We should put an end to it.  I ask the Taoiseach to agree a time this week for the Minister to make a comprehensive statement to the House.</P>

      <P>I will consider what the Deputy said.  However, those commenting on the matter have not referred to the fact that the ground rules for the competition involved a confidentiality clause.  Every participant agreed that there would be confidentiality in regard to all submissions.  It now transpires that people who agreed to a confidentiality clause when they were bidding want matters disclosed which they earlier agreed would be confidential.  The confidentiality clause places a proper constraint on what the Minister can say on the matter in the House.  He indicated to the Opposition that he has already answered comprehensively the questions put to him on the matter and the Ceann Comhairle vindicated that in so far as he indicated that the further questions tabled are repeats of questions already answered.</P>

My party supported the Government's efforts on Northern Ireland and if we are to consolidate the process we must focus on areas on which there is agreement in the House.  Will the Taoiseach agree to take questions on relevant matters so that we can be as relevant as the House of Commons?  I am sure he will agree that as the Tánaiste answers questions only every five weeks it is not satisfactory that since the Easter recess questions on Northern Ireland requiring detailed replies have been transferred to the Tánaiste.</P>

I am sure if the Deputy had particular queries about the document she would have put them to me.  In regard to more detailed answers about the specifics of the ground rules document, the document was negotiated on behalf of the Irish Government by the Tánaiste. It is an excellent document and represents a significant advance on the ground rules that applied to the 1991-92 talks.  The Tánaiste will answer questions on this matter in the House very soon and will be able to give first hand information to the Deputy on these matters.

I answer questions, as did my predecessors, for one and a half hours. Much less time is allocated to questions to the Prime Minister in the House of Commons and, to give credit to the Opposition here, is a noisier and less informative procedure than Question Time to the Taoiseach in this House.

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1996. - Report of Task Force on Travelling Community: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the subject of the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.</P>
      <P>I see this report as an opportunity fundamentally to change the lives of Irish travellers in a similar manner to the first report of the Commission on the Status of Women, which was published in the 1970s and which was responsible for securing changes in the lives of Irish women in the years that followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report and the follow up action which will be taken on foot of it will fundamentally change the lives of Irish travellers for the better, as well as benefiting the whole country.  It is also my hope that it will usher in a new era of <Col N="704" /> better relations between the settled community and travellers in this country. The decisive action taken by Government on foot of this report will lay the foundations for a solution to the social problems that have attended this issue, will enable the necessary services to be provided and will foster a new and more harmonious co-existence between travellers and the settled community.  I have no illusions as to how difficult this might be but we must make a start.</P>
    <P>The report deals in a comprehensive manner with a major social issue.  The report examines and makes recommendations on a wide range of matters that impact on the travelling community. In particular it deals with the high level of social exclusion and disadvantage which travellers experience in the Ireland of today and on the hostility in many members of the settled community to travellers.  Consideration of the report at this point is most appropriate because of the amount of attention which commentators have given, of late, to traveller-related issues.  Some media comment, unfortunately, does little to encourage a positive approach to relations between the traveller and settled communities.  I was dismayed at the nature of the intemperate statement made recently by a local councillor when referring to travellers.  I am pleased that he has since withdrawn these remarks.  It is my earnest hope that the views expressed by Members over the next two days will assist in redressing the balance and will serve as encouragement to those dedicated people who strive to improve the lot of travellers and to bring about a better relationship between the travellers and the settled communities.</P>
    <P>Membership of the task force comprised people from very disparate backgrounds representing a range of diverse interests.  These included travellers, representatives of traveller organisations, of Government Departments and of local authority management.  Representatives of five political parties also served on the task force and contributed to its deliberations.  A number of these <Col N="705" /> were local councillors who were in a position to contribute particular insights from the perspective of the local representative into the nature of the interaction between both communities and their contributions had particular relevance in the context of understanding the relationships between those communities. I pay tribute to those who gave so generously of their time, energy and expertise, notwithstanding their many other pressing commitments, without which the report could not have been completed so expeditiously.  I pay a particular tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Liz McManus, who initially chaired the task force and to Senator Mary Kelly, who subsequently became the chairperson and whose drive and commitment was crucial to the excellence of the report.</P>
    <P>This report is the first comprehensive review of the needs of the traveller community since 1983.  The task force acknowledges that in its deliberations it was informed by and benefited from the experience of its predecessors, together with the report of the Commission on Itinerancy, 1963 and the report of the Travelling People Review Body, 1983.</P>
    <P>The task force also benefited from the submissions, both oral and written, made by concerned members of the public including members of both the travellers and settled communities, and organisations representing a wide range of views and opinions.  In order to fill knowledge gaps a number of research papers were commissioned on topics which included items as diverse as accommodation, health, education, traveller culture etc.  All of this information was processed under eleven headings which ranged from &ldquo;Relationship between the Traveller and the Settled Communities&rdquo; to &ldquo;Sports and other recreation, Culture and the Arts&rdquo;.  It was an essential ingredient in the range of recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    <P>Considering the level of consultation, it was a major achievement for the task force to produce its report in a two-year period.  The interim report produced in <Col N="706" /> January 1994, six months after the task force was set up, was of particular benefit to me in the context of the work ongoing in my Department on equal status legislation.</P>
    <P>The task force was mandated by me, <i>inter alia:</i> 1; to make recommendations with regard to the appropriate planning at national and local level in the areas of housing, health, education, employment and other key areas, in relation to the travelling community; 2; to make recommendations to ensure that adequate services are provided for travellers in all local authority areas and to report on the implementation of measures to meet the Government target of providing permanent serviced caravan site accommodation for all travellers who need it by the year 2000; 3; to draw up a strategy to delineate the roles and functions of statutory bodies catering for the needs of travellers; and 4; to explore the possibilities for developing machanisms to enable travellers to participate and contribute to decisions affecting their lifestyle and environment.</P>
    <P>In fulfilling its mandate the task force considered and reported on the issues dealing with the travelling community in a realistic and forthright manner.  In its report it stresses the high level of social exclusion and disadvantage which is the daily experience of a high proportion of travellers and points out that;</P>
    <P>Minimal contact between both communities contributes to barriers of prejudice based on fear and ignorance on both sides.  In addition, it often contributes to the creation of phobias, intolerance, misconceptions, hostility and aggression.</P>
    <P>The report highlights very clearly the very poor living conditions and other social problems being experienced by a large numbers of travellers, conditions which are unacceptable in the Ireland of the 1990s.  I am pleased at the clarity with which these matters are presented in the report.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, however, the report, also illustrates that actions by <Col N="707" /> some travellers are responsible for some of the hostility to them in the local settled population.  These include: illegal occupation of public open space land for living purposes without due consideration for the use of that land by the local residents; using land in a manner that alienates the local residents &mdash; rubbish, scrap cars, grazing horses &mdash; and damages the local environment; incidents of harassment and intimidation of passersby, causing fear in local people, particularly for their children; and unruly behaviour from time to time of large numbers of travellers on special occasions which tend to create fears among the settled community that this type of activity will be a regular occurrence in every proposed halting site.</P>
    <P>Referring to traveller accommodation, perhaps the single greatest cause of dissension between the communities, the task force describes it as insufficient and very inadequate.  The report states, that of a total of approximately 4,000 traveller households, 1,085 are residing on the roadside and another 257 families are on temporary sites.  Many of these temporary sites are without the basic services taken for granted by the vast majority of people in the settled community.  It says that the conditions under which some travellers live contributes towards &mdash; infant and adult mortality rates for travellers that are over twice those of the settled community &mdash; lower participation by travellers in education than members of the settled community, this is particularly true in relation to second and third level education; and a very low level of traveller participation in the mainstream labour force and, of course, a very high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The traveller economy, which as the report points out is often invisible to the external observer, is encountering great difficulties, and travellers experience direct and indirect discrimination almost on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>These issues form the basis for the main elements of the recommendations put forward by the task force, which <Col N="708" /> include: the need to provide 3,100 units of additional accommodation by the year 2000, with supporting administrative and legislative changes: the introduction of measures to improve the health status of the traveller community and to remove the obstacles to traveller access to the health services; the reorganisation and development of the education services in order to provide for increased participation levels by travellers; the encouragement and undertaking of new initiatives to support the development of the traveller economy and increased levels of traveller participation in the mainstream labour force; the adoption of measures which address the problem of discrimination faced by the traveller community; the introduction and, where necessary, the improvement of mechanisms in order to ensure that statutory agencies which provide services that impact on travellers do so in a co-ordinated manner; and the need to increase participation by travellers and traveller organisations in the decision making process in areas which affect travellers' lifestyle and environment.</P>
    <P>The report, which also examines mechanisms for facilitating improved relationships between the travellers and settled communities, particularly at local level, makes recommendations with a view to reducing conflict and strengthening mutual respect and understanding.  This it hopes would merge into what the task force calls a strategy for reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force places great emphasis on the need for bridge building and the strengthening of mutual respect and understanding between travellers and the settled population through various initiatives.  As we have witnessed so often in the past, without improved relations between travellers and settled people many initiatives undertaken by statutory bodies to improve the welfare of the traveller population, particularly in relation to the provision of suitable and adequate accommodation, will not be successful.</P>
    <P>A nation might be compared to a <Col N="709" /> cloth of different strands each interwoven with the other to make a whole. The travelling community in Ireland has made up one of those strands for many centuries.  Travellers are part of the pattern of Irish life, they always have been. The settled community should acknowledge their essential Irishness and allow travellers to live life in their own way, as law-abiding citizens, side by side with their settled neighbours.</P>
    <P>When I received the report of the task force, which impacts on a range of policy areas which are the responsibility of a number of Government Departments, it was necessary for me to have it considered by Government with a view to determining what action should be taken in relation to its contents and recommendations.  An inter-departmental working group of officials, chaired by my Department, was established to consider the implementation of the report.</P>
    <P>The report of the inter-departmental working group was considered by Government on 26 March last and a range of follow up actions to the report were decided on.  These actions include the introduction of a national strategy for traveller accommodation.  The strategy is designed to meet the accommodation needs of travellers as assessed in the report of the Task Force and accepts the broad thrust of that report in terms of the extent and nature of accommodation required.  The follow-up action will include: (1) a five-year national strategy for traveller accommodation; (2) agreement in principle to the construction of 3,100 units of accommodation for the travelling community; (3) the introduction of new legislation to provide a framework for the provision of traveller accommodation, including amendment of the housing, planning and local management Acts, and (4) the establishment of a special unit in the Department of the Environment to monitor the national strategy as well as a national traveller accommodation consultative group.</P>
    <P>The number of traveller families has continued to increase significantly leading to problems for local authorities in <Col N="710" /> providing accommodation for them. This is sometimes compounded by an undue concentration of traveller families in particular areas.  There has, however, been considerable progress by local authorities in providing accommodation for traveller families in recent years, but a substantial backlog of families remains on the roadside and their needs for accommodation must be met.</P>
    <P>The major bar to providing accommodation for traveller families is the level of opposition from local residents to the location of traveller accommodation, particularly halting sites, in their areas. This opposition has frequently manifested itself in legal proceedings which have either delayed or rejected proposals for traveller accommodation in particular areas.  The Government recognises that these issues need to be faced and will provide for necessary legislative amendments to facilitate a determined effort to achieve the targets set in the task force report.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy McManus, in her contribution to the debate, will outline in greater detail the Government's response to the task force recommendations on traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Government's response also encompassed a commitment to strengthen health and education services for travellers. With regard to health the Department of Health strategy, launched by the Minister for Health in April 1994, undertook to implement a special programme to address the particular health needs of the travelling community.  It proposed a joint study, with the proposed Task Force on the Travelling Community, on travellers' health and this has been carried out.  It stated that following the report of the task force the Minister would publish a policy on travellers' health which would take account of the recommendations of the task force.</P>
    <P>One of its recommendations is that a traveller health advisory committee be set up in the Department of Health.  The <Col N="711" /> committee is to be drawn from the various divisions in that Department, representatives of the traveller community, from health boards and national traveller organisations.  One of the functions of this committee will be to draw up the policy on travellers' health.</P>
    <P>A consultative process is taking place within the Department of Health and with the health boards in relation to the implementation of the recommendations of the task force.  It is proposed also to consult the relevant organisations representing travellers.  The end result of this process will be a draft policy document on travellers' health which would then be submitted to the Department's traveller health advisory committee for its consideration before it is finalised.</P>
    <P>The joint study commissioned by the task force &mdash; and previous studies &mdash; have established that life expectancy and general health status among the travelling community are considerably lower than the general population.  The Minister for Health is anxious that this situation be improved and to this end will be actively pursuing courses of action which will improve the level of access by travellers to the health services. The Minister sees the task force as providing useful guidelines in formulating appropriate initiatives to achieve this objective.  These initiatives will be set out in the proposed policy document on travellers' health which will provide a blueprint for action by the health boards and other service providers.</P>
    <P>The discussion document Developing a Policy for Women's Health considers traveller women specifically and states that the policy document on travellers' health promised in the health strategy would address the health needs of traveller women &mdash; in particular access to ante and post-natal care, family planning and genetic counselling.</P>
    <P>A number of positive initiatives in relation to travellers' health have already been taken in some health boards, such as the mobile clinic which <Col N="712" /> the Eastern Health Board has been operating for a number of years, the appointment of public health nurses with specific responsibility for travellers, various measures in Dublin to combat the problem of child begging and pilot projects in peer led services.  An inventory of existing services for travellers being provided by the health boards is currently being carried out as part of the consultative process on the recommendations of the task force.</P>
    <P>With regard to education, my colleague the Minister for Education has set out in the Education White Paper <i>Charting our Education Future</i> the Government's policy in relation to traveller education.  The White Paper recognised that travellers are a community whose culture has deep historical roots within Irish society.  That as a distinct group they have the right to participate fully in its educational system and to have its traditions respected.  The White Paper also states that the placement of traveller children in special schools and classes will be done only on the basis of special education need.  If they need extra help, this will be given, as it is to other children with learning difficulties, through withdrawal from the ordinary class for a limited period, or through support teaching within the ordinary class.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out the following objectives; that all traveller children of primary school age be enrolled and participate fully in primary education according to their ability and potential, within five years; within ten years, all traveller children of second level, school-going age will complete junior cycle education and 50 per cent will complete the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>These objectives will be supported by: the inclusion in schools' plans of an admission policy in relation to travellers, in accordance with national and regional guidelines; the education boards putting in place induction programmes involving the family, the primary school where the student is enrolled, and the second level school to which he or she is about to transfer; the <Col N="713" /> provision of modules on travellers and traveller culture in pre-service and in-career development programmes; the continuing development by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment of appropriate curriculum and assessment procedures to meet the special needs of traveller children, including the provison of appropriate texts and materials; the continuing development of the visiting teacher service; comprehensive and regularly updated quantitative and qualitative survey of traveller education; the monitoring of school attendance patterns.</P>
    <P>Where additional resources are required to fund any of these initiatives it is the intention of the Minister for Education to seek the approval of the Minister for Finance for them to be introduced on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the high level of social exclusion being experienced by travellers, on a daily basis. This was addressed in considerable detail by the task force, and regard is being had in my Department to its recommendations in the preparation of employment equality and equal status legislation.</P>
    <P>Employment equality legislation will include membership of the travelling community among the categories being protected.  The task force report points out the serious difficulties which travellers face in entering the mainstream workforce.  It is my hope that the forthcoming employment equality legislation will play a considerable part in assisting the position of travellers in this regard. Under the terms of this legislation travellers could not be discriminated against in applying for jobs or in advancement in their employment.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of travellers in the categories covered by this legislation will help to increase the employment potential of many travellers and to ensure that they are not discriminated against when applying for jobs or when seeking advancement in jobs they already hold. I intend to publish this Bill during the current Dáil session</P>
    <P>The task force in its report, while <Col N="714" /> dealing with the inequalities and discrimination experienced by traveller women, both as women and as travellers, highlights the central contribution which women make to the well-being of the traveller community which is largely unrecognised.  It speaks about the significant leadership roles they have played both in their own community and in representing that community.  In this regard I note with interest the recommendations made by the task force in relation to the role, needs and concerns of traveller women and I am glad that the National Traveller Women's Forum received financial assistance from my Department towards the participation of a member at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in September 1995.  I hope that this was a useful experience that will contribute to advance the position of traveller women, children and families in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The report of the Task Force in highlighting the discrimination experienced by travellers, stresses the need for equal status legislation to give travellers a legal means of redress.  I quote a key section from paragraph 2.1, section C of the task force report:</P>
    <P>While legislation alone will not put an end to the discrimination faced by the traveller community, it will make an essential contribution to this task.  It will provide a catalyst for changing the context within which conflicts and stereotypes are generated. It will be a statement of significant weight from Government of the travellers' status in Irish society and of the unacceptability of discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds, including membership of the travelling community.  It will apply to areas such as education, provision of goods and services and the disposal of property and accommodation.  Services will be defined broadly to include access to public places, banking and insurance services, entertainment, facilities for <Col N="715" /> refreshment and transport.  The basic principle underlying the equal status legislation is that people should be judged on their merits as individuals rather than by reference to irrelevant characteristics.  There must be a sufficient reason to justify any difference in treatment.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the proposed equal status legislation has generated some controversy and apprehension, particularly among publicans.  While it would not be appropriate for me at this stage to go into detail about specific provisions of the Bill, there are a few points I wish to emphasise.  The Bill will only apply to discrimination on clearly specified grounds, including membership of the travelling community. Refusal of service for another and genuine reason, such as misbehaviour, will be unaffected.  It will not oblige a publican, retailer or supplier of goods to give reasons for refusal to the customer at the time of refusal.  Also, we are looking at ways to ensure that any reason given by service providers, for example in proceedings under the legislation, would be privileged and could not be used as grounds to sue for defamation.</P>
    <P>The Bill draws on legislation which has worked well for many years in other countries including the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The experience of similar legislation elsewhere demonstrates that the fears expressed about the proposed legislation are not valid.  The enactment of equal status legislation is necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination of 1965 and to lift all our reservations to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women of 1977. Ireland has the doubtful distinction of being the only EU member state which has yet to ratify the Convention on Racial Discrimination.  The Equal Status Bill is currently being drafted and will be published later this year.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in the report of the <Col N="716" /> task force is an integrated package. Without the provision of adequate accommodation, improvements in the provision of health and education will be more difficult to undertake.  Likewise following on to the implementation of aspects of the report, travellers will be able to participate more fully in economic development both through the growth of the traveller economy and in the mainstream labour force, so that the natural talent of travellers to be self-reliant and resourceful will be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I hope this report will encourage all of us to take the first steps in harmonising the relationship between travellers and settled people.  This is an important issue, not just for Irish travellers, but for the population of Ireland generally.  The task force report presents us with an opportunity we must not miss.  I will do all in my power to ensure that it gets the support it deserves.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil and Labour <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993 to 1997</i> decided to establish a task force on the travelling community.  It was established in July 1993.  The decision to establish the task force with its wide terms of reference was an enlightened and good decision by a good Government.  That Government would still be in office implementing its excellent programme but for the stupidity of the Labour Party which sought heads for matters long forgotten by people who still cannot understand why that Government broke up and who are at present punishing the Labour Party at the polls because of the break up and for many other reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute the the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, who was the first chairperson of the task force.  She was succeeded in that position by Senator Mary Kelly to whom I also extend my congratulations.  The members of the task force and the support staff deserve our appreciation for an excellent report that seeks to identify all the issues affecting the travelling community at this time.  It makes recommendations <Col N="717" /> and seeks to set a timescale for their implementation.</P>
    <P>To understand today's travellers and their needs, culture and fears it is helpful to set out the history of their origins. Unfortunately, there is little written information on the topic.  That travellers were called &ldquo;tinkers&rdquo; suggests a link with the Irish word &ldquo;tinceard&rdquo; which suggests working with metal.  The word &ldquo;tinceard&rdquo; appears in written form as far back as the 12th century.  Since that time reference to tinkers appears many times in written documentation which indicates the existence of a group of crafts people who travelled around the country playing an important role in the economy.</P>
    <P>Certain scholars suggest that today's travellers are the descendants of native Irish people who were put off their lands in the 17th century and were compelled to take to the roads by the planters. McNeill, writing in 1919, claims they were pre-Celtic descendants of the Semin Ringe or rivet makers who were menders of weapons for warriors.  Their select language Shelta or Gammon could confirm that they are of ancient origin.</P>
    <P>George Gmelch, who was an American anthropologist and lived among Irish travellers, believes their origins go back to pre-Christian times when they operated as itinerant tinsmiths travelling around the countryside making ornaments, weapons and horse trappings in exchange for food and lodgings. Members might be surprised to note they were recorded as a distinct cultural group in the census carried out by the Norsemen in the 10th century.  By 1175 the word &ldquo;tinker&rdquo; began to appear in written records as a trade name for those working with tin.</P>
    <P>The current view is that today's travellers descend from the thousands of Irish peasants who were forced off the land through eviction, hunger and poverty from the 17th century on.  They were probably too poor to buy their passage to another country and therefore took to the roads to earn their living. The people who remained on the <Col N="718" /> roads gradually established their own ethnic identity as travellers.  At first they lived on the sides of the road with little or no shelter.  Later they started to live in tents and wagons on the roadside and this completed their isolation from the settled community.</P>
    <P>Most travellers until the 1950s and 1960s earned their living as tinsmiths, pedlars, chimney cleaners, basket and sieve makers, collectors and scavengers, musicians and fortune tellers.  At fairs and race meetings they played card tricks, played the dice and gave tips for horses.  The women made and sold flowers and told fortunes.  Along the way some travellers acquired skills in repairing broken china, crockery, clocks and umbrellas, in other words, they acquired useful skills which were appropriate to the times in which they lived.</P>
    <P>As pedlars they sold linoleum, carpets, glassware, clothes pegs and straw brooms.  Travellers also acquired good skills as horse dealers which arose from their nomadic experience and the use of horses to pull their wagons and carts. They also worked as seasonal labourers for farmers, bringing in the harvest, cutting turf and so forth.  Travellers also provided up to date news and information as they travelled from one area to another and this was a valuable service since, in those times, there were no radios or telephones.</P>
    <P>From 1870 onwards, a huge change took place in the lives of travellers because of the advent of the horse drawn caravan.  Horse drawn caravans were first acquired by the more affluent horse dealers among the travellers and by 1930 most travellers used them.  This meant they were truly set apart from the settled community and no longer needed to obtain shelter from them.</P>
    <P>The first recorded instances of conflict between travellers and the settled community seem to have taken place in the west of Ireland where the travellers grazed their horses, donkeys and goats on the side of the road, much to the annoyance of the settled community who objected to them coming into the area.  The barren and rocky nature of <Col N="719" /> the land meant that roadside grazing was important to local people and often they competed with the travellers for such grazing.  Settled people often instilled a fear of travellers in their children from an early age which in adulthood accentuated their distrust of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>The old livelihoods of the travelling community are now largely a thing of the past.  The plastic bucket has long since replaced the tin can and farm machinery has dispensed with the need for horses and casual labour.  Those former occupations have been replaced by scrap dealing, car dismantling, etc.  That type of economic activity can realistically survive only in more built up areas. Consequently, many travellers, like many rural settled people, were forced to gravitate to the larger towns and cities in search of a livelihood.  Because the State ignored and failed to provide for the social and accommodation needs of travellers who gravitated to towns and cities conflict with the settled community was inevitable.  Invariably travellers were confined to the poorer sections of the growing towns and cities and that aggravated conflict and prejudice against them.  Since their traditional economic activity and way of life has largely disappeared, they have been increasingly compelled to depend on State social welfare payments.  Such State dependency runs contrary to their traditional way of life which tended to be one of self-sufficiency, meagre and all that may have been.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s this State invested heavily in the expansion of education facilities and opportunities, industrial training and retraining and various economic developments for the settled community.  That was intended to deal with the effects of the transition from a sheltered economy protected by import tariffs and duties to an open one as part of the European Economic Community.  In all that resurgence, investment, training and growth in a rapidly changing economic environment <Col N="720" /> the travelling community and its changing economic and social needs were largely ignored.  Our changing society, including its developing new economic needs and requirements of the 1950s to the 1970s quickly wiped out the economic way of life of the travelling community which had served that community generation after generation.  A realistic attempt was not made by the State to provide alternative economic activity to enable travellers to economically provide for their traditional way of life without bringing them into conflict with the settled community.  In that neglect lies the seeds for the unjustifiable conflict between the settled community and travellers which, in many cases, is the norm today.</P>
    <P>We have much catching up to do to meet the full legitimate needs, entitlements and aspirations of our travelling community.  The full and speedy implementation of all the recommendations of the task force report will wipe off our landscape a sorry chapter in our social history regarding the manner in which we have dealt with the travelling community. In reality we should be ashamed of our inactivity and lack of commitment to an important minority group in our society.</P>
    <P>The stereotyping of our travelling community gives rise to extreme forms of prejudice against it making it difficult to develop equal co-existence between travellers and the settled community.  It is said that travellers do not want to settle and yet it is becoming increasingly obvious that to provide education for their children they need a stable place to live, whether in standard or group housing or properly serviced halting sites.</P>
    <P>It is also said that travellers are dirty but the absence of basic facilities which we, in the settled community, take for granted, such as hot and cold running water, proper sanitation and refuse collection, makes it extremely difficult for travellers to comply with the day to day living conditions as demanded and expected by most of the settled community. I need hardly remind Members <Col N="721" /> that on occasions when the refuse collection service was not available to the settled community severe problems of litter and illegal refuse disposal became quickly apparent.</P>
    <P>Regarding the alleged high crime rate among travellers compared to the settled community, it tends to be the problem that where one traveller is caught for any crime the whole travelling community is unfairly branded and singled out, as happened in recent times. In areas where travellers are located sometimes professional thieves and law breakers operate in those areas in the belief that travellers will be the first to be suspected and blamed for crime.  The majority of travellers, and their representatives, condemn criminal behaviour from whatever quarter.  As one elderly traveller put it, &ldquo;Travellers are like the wild geese, when we fly everyone can see us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform Deputy Taylor, promised the introduction of an equal status Bill, but it appears it will not be brought forward until the end of this year.  From the point of view of the travelling community, I am disappointed at the continuing delay in introducing this important legislation, the intention of which is to prohibit discrimination on various grounds, including membership of the travelling community.  This legislation needs to be introduced and enacted without delay to protect that community.  An equal status Bill has long been sought by the travellers and their representatives.  I call on the Minister to introduce the legislation soon to ensure that it can be fully enacted before the end of the Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>Ireland has yet to pass anti-discrimination legislation and has not yet ratified the UN Convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination.  For that reason travellers and other minority ethnic groups and groups identified on the basis of skin colour have no legal redress for the racism they suffer in our society.  The report under discussion sets out all the <Col N="722" /> issues concerning the travelling community which need to be confronted and dealt with if we are to make a meaningful attempt to meet their legitimate needs and entitlements.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the more important aspects of that report.  There is no doubt there is an urgent need to improve relationships between travellers and the settled community.  This can best be done by improving contacts at every level locally between the two sides.  I welcome the widespread establishment of travellers' support groups. Their establishment will give the travelling and settled communities an opportunity to come into more meaningful contact with the absence and alleviation of conflict being the objective.  It also gives an opportunity for the statutory sector to respond to organised support groups in a more positive way than perhaps was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I pay special tribute to the Dublin Travellers Education and Development Group, now renamed Pavee Point, and the Irish Travellers Movement for their excellent work to date.  The poor resourcing of travellers' support groups requires urgent attention.  The invaluable work of those groups is often unheralded, yet their resourcing is fragmented and uncommitted.  That matter needs to be addressed urgently by one funding agency to ensure that all travellers' support groups are properly funded and resourced.</P>
    <P>Media reporting of travellers issues must be more evenly balanced.  The recent decision of the National Union of Journalists to address that issue is a welcome initiative.</P>
    <P>Section D of the task force report deals extensively with the provision of accommodation needs of the travelling community.  Unfortunately, that has been an area of acute conflict with the settled community.  It is estimated that a total of 3,100 additional units of accommodation will be needed by the year 2000 if all travellers requiring accommodation are to be facilitated.  At present there are approximately 1,125 families <Col N="723" /> on the side of the road and approximately 325 on temporary sites.  To cater for the expected natural increase in demand for units of accommodation a further 650 units and 1,000 transient units are required.  This is a formidable challange for local authorities.</P>
    <P>The national strategy for traveller accommodation as announced by the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, on 27 March sets out the Government's proposals for the next five years.  Fianna Fáil fully supports this strategy and welcomes the establishment of a national traveller accommodation consultative group on a statutory basis to &ldquo;monitor the preparation/adequacy and implementation of Local Traveller Accommodation Plans&rdquo;.  It is essential that all local authorities fully commit themselves to the strategy as if they do not live up to their responsibilities the accommodation strategy will collapse.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the accommodation referred to, at 1994 prices, is estimated by the task force to be £154 million.  If the accommodation strategy is to be successfully implemented, it is essential that all existing sites, especially group housing and halting sites, be properly serviced and maintained by local authorities. The travellers occupying these sites must also play their part by ensuring that they fully comply with all the terms and conditions laid down by the local authority for their proper management.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to amend the housing, management and planning Acts to speed up the provision of traveller accommodation is welcomed. Precise details of the amendments are awaited, but it is hoped that no delays will occur which would have the effect of undermining the accommodation strategy.</P>
    <P>The following statistics in a travellers' health status study carried out in 1987 for the Health Research Board make startling reading: the stillbirth rate for travellers was 19.5 per 1,000 births compared to the national figure of 6.9; the infant mortality rate for travellers was <Col N="724" /> 18.1 per 1,000 births compared to the national figure of 7.4; at birth male travellers can expect to live 9.9 years less than settled males and life expectancy for female travellers is 11.9 years less than settled females.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has given a commitment in the national health strategy announced in 1994 to address the particular health needs of the traveller community.  Bearing in mind that the report of the task force was published in July 1995, we are very disappointed that the Minister has not yet published his promised policy statement on travellers' health.  This needs to be done as quickly as possible so that the many health recommendations of the task force can be implemented.  Fianna Fáil strongly supports the establishment of a traveller health advisory committee in the Department of Health as recommended by the task force.  We also support the establishment within each health board of a traveller health unit and call for full traveller representation on both bodies.</P>
    <P>It is becoming increasingly recognised, especially by traveller women, that education is a must for their children. Without proper accommodation it is very difficult for traveller children to attend school on a regular basis.  There are approximately 5,000 traveller children of primary school-going age in Ireland.  It is estimated that approximately 4,600 of these attend either pre-school or primary school.  Of the almost 4,000 attending primary school about half are in full-time primary classes while the remaining 2,000 are in approximately 160 special classes or one of the four special schools for the children of travellers.  There are no definite details available on the number of traveller children in second-level schools, but it appears that only a small number attend these schools.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force recommends, in FR13, that a traveller education service be established in the Department of Education whose brief would include not alone monitoring the curriculum for travellers, but also ensuring greater integration and coherence <Col N="725" /> between all the key personnel and organisations involved in traveller education. We are not yet aware if the Minister for Education intends to accept this and the other education recommendations of the report of the task force and we on this side of the House regret the Minister's continued delay in clarifying her position.</P>
    <P>As the recommendations of the report of the task force on education show, there are huge barriers to proper and decent education placed before traveller children from their pre-school years through primary school and which continue until most of the children fall out of the formal education system. Without doubt there is a need for the education system to respect the growing cultural diversity within the community because, as well as the travellers, we have substantial numbers of minority groups, such as the Vietnamese, Muslims and Bosnians.  Consequently, recommendations FR19 to FR24 are vitally important and need to be implemented as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>We are disappointed that so little progress has been made by the Minister for Education in implementing the recommendations of the Department of Education working group on post-primary education for traveller children which reported in 1992.  If these recommendations were implemented, a far greater number of traveller children would attend second level school.  We agree with the report of the task force which calls for action in this matter in recommendation FR88.</P>
    <P>Recommendation FR15, dealing with the role of the visiting teacher, is very important and we call on the Minister for Education to rapidly expand this service as it facilitates entry to school by the child and assists school authorities.</P>
    <P>If real progress is to be made to empower travellers to develop self-sufficiency, it is important that recommendations GR1 to GR41 be implemented.  Recycling for example, is an increasingly valuable economic activity and travellers are uniquely <Col N="726" /> placed to participate fully and productively in this activity.  The purpose of the local urban and rural development programme is to provide opportunities, resources and stimulus for social and economic development at local level. Travellers should be fully included in the development programmes mentioned. To allow travellers access to these economic activities it will be essential for the Department of the Environment, the Department of Enterprise and Employment and local authorities to work closely together in a co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>The role of traveller women within their own community has traditionally been a very important one.  Section H of the report deals with issues affecting them.  To date there has been no comprehensive survey and study of their health.  In general, their health needs are seen almost exclusively in the context of child-bearing.  A special study of their health should be carried out.</P>
    <P>Traveller women tend to be the driving force within their own community in terms of better education, improved accommodation and health matters. They must be supported in their efforts and the development of traveller women's group should be high on the agenda.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force has been widely welcomed by the travelling community, their representative organisations, those who work with them and all those interested in their welfare.  It is recognised that considerable resources will have to be made available if all the recommendations are to be implemented.  To oversee the monitoring and full implementation of the recommendations on an approved timescale, a national body will need to be established on a statutory basis to carry out this work.  It should produce an annual report on progress made which should be laid before the House.  Its membership should include members of the travelling community and representatives of organisations working on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I can best conclude my contribution <Col N="727" /> by quoting the introduction to chapter 3 of the publication by the Dublin Travellers Education and Development Group &mdash; now known as Pavee Point &mdash; the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Irish Traveller Movement entitled Anti Racist Law on the Travellers, written by Tom Cooney.</P>
    <P>To be a Traveller in our society can be a distressing and disabling experience. This is not because Travellers belong to an intrinsically impoverished community.  They do not.  It is because the Settled Community has imposed unfair deprivations on Travellers who pursue their traditional nomadic way of life.</P>
    <P>The Settled Community has failed to understand the Traveller Community. These failures to understand the Travellers are not simply the result of cold indifference.  They owe as much to deliberate ignorance about Travellers' culture and humanity and a deeply rooted hostility, sometimes viciously expressed, to their ways, prospective plans of life, their needs, values and rights.</P>
    <P>Attitudes fixed in the baseless assumptions and shocking unreason of social prejudice not only underpin an embittering history of political, social and legal neglect of Travellers' repeated calls for social justice, but also sustain at individual and institutional level routine unquestioned practices of discrimination against Travellers which deny them the basic right essential to a self-governing life of self-worth.</P>
    <P>For decades now Travellers have been and still remain a disadvantaged and oppressed minority.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing this Government &mdash; and indeed the next &mdash; is the speedy implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  A willingness on the part of the Government to accept that no further reports are required is called <Col N="728" /> for now.  A sustained period of activity and resource provision is essential to ensure that the basic needs of the travelling community can be met before the end of the century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that we have been given time to discuss this very important report.  The problems of the travelling community are rarely out of the news.  As we have already heard, the issue achieved prominence recently because of the intemperate remarks made by a councillor from Waterford who spoke of &ldquo;running these people out of the country with shotguns&rdquo;, remarks for which he was rightly brought to book by his party leader and which, fortunately, he subsequently withdrew.  It is indicative of the undercurrents in society.  The position of the travelling community is clearly unacceptable. Despite what many of us think from time to time, Ireland is one of the wealthiest economies in the world yet people live on the side of the road in squalid conditions, often without basic essential services such as running water, electricity and so on as the report rightly identifies.</P>
      <P>Children suffer most of all, being denied most of the things that other children take for granted &mdash; a comfortable home and a good education.  They are condemned to a life of disadvantage almost as soon as they are born.  We all agree there is urgent need to remedy this.  The report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community is a starting point in this process and I welcome its publication.  I congratulate its members on their work, Deputy McManus and subsequently Senator Mary Kelly on their chairing of the task force and the many dedicated members for their conviction and commitment to the production of the report.  I congratulate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on his response to and support for the task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of the travelling community are complex.  Careful analysis is required before we set about implementing solutions identified in the <Col N="729" /> report.  We recently saw two different sides of the problem highlighted in the media.  The first related to a young traveller couple trying to find a hotel to handle their wedding reception.  Their story was told in the newspapers last week.  Most people would be very saddened to hear that the couple were turned down by 30 different establishments because they were travellers.  The story evoked considerable public sympathy for the travelling community and rightly so.</P>
    <P>The second relates to an incident that took place in County Sligo before Christmas.  In that case a traveller family including the children, perpetrated a most violent, vicious and prolonged assault upon a defenceless elderly person who was living alone, a crime which has since been dealt with by the courts. That story evoked considerable public antipathy towards the travelling community. Stories and events such as the second one live longest in the public memory and ultimately serve to define the Irish attitude towards travellers which is hostile.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated he had no illusions on how difficult it might be to foster a new and more harmonious co-existence between travellers and the settled community.  We might use politically correct language to hide the problem. Expressions such as &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; are rarely used in ordinary conversation but whether we like it or not most people want nothing to do with travellers and most certainly do not want to live near them.  That sad truth will be confirmed by those in the House who serve or have served on local authorities and try to win approval for halting sites for travellers from settled local communities. There is a perception that travellers are dirty, do not work, know how to play the welfare system to their advantage and, most disturbing of all, are involved in wholesale crime.  That prejudice is reinforced by media hype which at times in the past few months seemed to blame travellers for every crime committed outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>We must break down prejudices and <Col N="730" /> hostility and the first step is to understand the nature of the problem as the report sets out to do.  Central to that is the question of traveller culture.  The task force assumes there is a distinct traveller culture and Deputy Flood gave us an historical analysis which confirms that distinction.  The report is rightly premised on the need to respect, protect and perhaps foster that culture.  It highlights the fact that traveller culture is dynamic, complex and changing.  There are many positive aspects to it.  The strong sense of family loyalty and community among travellers is something that could well be observed by the settled community.  However, some practices by members of the travelling community are not accepted as part of a culture by the settled community.  The Minister alluded to some of them, for example, children begging.  There is clear evidence that some parents systematically exploit their children by forcing them to beg, a practice which is surely the equivalent of living off immoral earnings.  Settled people perceive travellers as being too quick to resort to violence as a means of resolving disputes.  The Minister underpinned the difficulty of damage to their own environment.  We are all familiar with this particularly when we talk about trying to settle travellers within communities. The immediate reaction is that house prices will drop and the environment will be damaged.</P>
    <P>Settled people have little or no concept of what traveller culture means.  In the main they think of it in negative terms and it conjures up stereotype images of violence, drinking and antisocial behaviour.  Even if travellers are occasionally guilty of violence, there can never be any excuse for the use of violence against them.  I find particularly disturbing the claim made yesterday in Skibbereen District Court by a man convicted of a serious attack on travellers in Bantry that he was regularly hired by Dublin County Council to shift travellers.  It is disturbing to read headlines such as &ldquo;£4,000 offered for vigilante assault on traveller site&rdquo;.  Travellers <Col N="731" /> were terrorised in their homes by a man acting on behalf of people in the community. He was convicted in court as a result of this.  I call on the local authorities in Dublin to confirm whether they have had any relationship with this individual and whether they are satisfied that no strong arm tactics have been used against travellers.  The inability of local authorities to come to grips with the problem of providing proper accommodation facilities for travellers has given rise to this type of situation.</P>
    <P>If we want to promote a tolerant attitude to travellers, they themselves must recognise that elements of their way of life contribute to their non-acceptance within society.  One of the defining aspects of traveller culture is nomadism. In years gone by there was an economic rationale for the nomadic lifestyle favoured by travellers.  In order to ply their trade as tinkers they needed to move around the country.  Today the economic justification for this lifestyle has all but vanished, it is this lifestyle which is responsible for a great deal of the hostility towards the travelling community and for many of the problems it endures.  By adhering to this lifestyle, travellers disadvantage themselves to a large degree.  Nomadism cuts them off to a significant extent from health services and education opportunities and it rules out any possibility of travellers moving into stable employment in the formal economy.  There is evidence that travellers may be moving away from this lifestyle.  The question arises whether we should encourage this trend or seek to facilitate travellers who want to continue to pursue this nomadic existence. It is important that travellers are free to make their own choices.</P>
    <P>A break with this lifestyle would have many beneficial consequences for traveller children.  At present travellers can effectively deny their children educational opportunities by adhering to a peripatetic way of life.  Children have no continuity in their schooling and it is not <Col N="732" /> surprising that they underachieve.  Educational services for travellers have improved considerably in recent years but there are enormous problems.  The task force cites teachers' estimates that traveller children are on average three years behind their settled counterparts in core subjects.  The problems for education caused by nomadic life are compounded by the decision of many traveller parents to withdraw young children from school.  This creates a vicious circle whereby the younger generation is condemned, through lack of education, to the status of second class citizenship and the whole cycle of deprivation and disadvantage is continued.</P>
    <P>We need an immediate and urgent three-pronged attack on the problems of deprivation and disadvantage which affect travellers.  The task force research highlights significant deficiencies in accommodation in a number of areas, even though it acknowledges the contribution and commitment of councillors and officials.  The reality, as every member of a local authority will confirm, is that it is a battle to have a halting site established.  Any of us who have supported accommodation for travellers must acknowledge this and always insist that it be challenged.</P>
    <P>I totally take on board the five-year national strategy on accommodation for travellers.  However, I sound a note of caution with regard to it.  It is absolutely critical that people in local communities be informed and consulted.  In Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council we had enormous difficulty in establishing a halting site because people felt it was being imposed on them and all the usual myths and prejudices about travellers came into play.  The people in the community had something forced on them rather than being consulted about it.  In another instance families which were to be accommodated in a halting site were from the area in question and were known by people in the locality. There was not a single objection to this site because people were consulted and they met the travellers who were to be part of their community.  This helped to <Col N="733" /> disarm them to a great extent and to inform them of the type of people who would be living in their community.  The fears of the unknown, which so many people have, did not come into play in this case.</P>
    <P>When we are trying to implement the strategy on accommodation, it is important that stereotypes are challenged and that people meet face to face with travellers so that the latter are not spoken about as statistics but as human beings who deserve to be accommodated in our society.  When most people meet travellers and are faced with the reality of the living conditions they have to endure, they are far more willing to accept them in their communities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the protection and education of traveller children, it is important that the existing laws on school attendance be enforced.  There is a big problem with regard to attendance, whether it is by children of travellers or children from the settled community. We must ensure there is appropriate early intervention by way of pre-school facilities and that all traveller children receive not just primary education but also secondary education.  In this context I agree with the remarks made earlier by Deputy Flood.  I agree with the task force recommendation on the establishment of a traveller education service under the aegis of the Department of Education.  This would mean that there would be somebody in the Department with responsibility for the provision of education for travellers. It is essential that there is a last port of call and that the buck stops with somebody.</P>
    <P>With regard to the promotion of enterprise within the traveller culture, travellers have specific skills which are identified in the report, such as trading, recycling and horse dealing.  They should be given every encouragement to use these skills for the benefit of their own communities.  As an environmental strategy, travellers could be given a key role in recycling.  There is great scope for progress in integrating travellers more into the formal economy.  The task <Col N="734" /> force points out that the traveller economy could play a significant role in enabling increased numbers of the travelling community to achieve financial independence and, importantly, it challenges the myth that there is a lack of work ethic within that community.  This must be constantly reinforced.  Particular effort should be devoted to bringing within the formal economy the substantial amount of activity which currently takes place in the black economy.  In the meantime we need to provide the supports necessary to allow this transition to take place.  The community employment scheme could be tailored to meet the particular needs of travellers.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of our policy on the travelling community should be based on inclusion and integration, not exclusion and separation.  This requires changes in attitudes and legislation.  I refer particularly to the proposed equal status Bill.  One of the most vocal minorities pressing for this Bill has been the travelling community.  It knows that legislation does not necessarily change attitudes but it believes it is entitled to the protection of the law and the same right enjoyed by every other citizen.</P>
    <P>On equal status legislation the report states:</P>
    <P>While legislation alone will not put an end to the discrimination faced by the Traveller community, it will make an essential contribution to this task. It will provide a catalyst for changing the context within which conflicts and stereotypes are generated.  It will give Travellers a legal means of redress against discrimination.  It will be a statement of significant weight from Government of the Travellers' status in Irish society and of the unacceptability of discrimination.  In the Irish context, it is important that Equal Status legislation in specifying its protection of ethnic groups would also specifically name the Traveller community as being protected.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to overstate the importance the travelling community puts on the <Col N="735" /> implementation of equal status legislation. The delay in bringing forward that legislation has led to questioning by members of the travelling community of the degree of Government commitment to the issue.  Travellers perceive themselves as particularly vulnerable to scapegoating where there is a series of violent crimes such as those witnessed in recent months.  The hysterical and ill-informed media speculation did not help the traveller cause &mdash; the good name of the whole travelling community was severely tainted by the way in which the media treated the issue.  According to a letter I received from Pavee Point, the long and painstaking work of improving inter-community relations that has taken years may have been wiped out in a matter of weeks by some members of the media acting in an irresponsible manner.</P>
    <P>Many minority groups are baffled by the slow pace of progress on the equal status legislation, and none more so than the travelling community which puts so much emphasis on protection within society.  The frustration felt by a number of minority groups resulted last month in the launching of the campaign for equality.  It is difficult to overstate the importance of this legislation in the eyes of the travelling community.  I agree with Deputy Flood it is very disappointing that we will not see that Bill until the end of this year.  I urge the Minister to bring it forward as quickly as possible.  There is a perceived standoff between the licensed vintners on the one hand and the travelling community on the other, and that is unhelpful to vintners, travellers and other minority groups interested in the equal status legislation.  Where there is a legislative vacuum such as this, the way is wide open for speculation, which is not helpful. There is a belief among travellers that the Government is not concerned enough to bring forward legislation to protect them.  Considering the amount of work that has been done by the task force, that is a shame.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> The report of the task force, which is very commendable, appears to place a great deal of responsibility for the resolution of the difficulties experienced by travellers at the door of society at large, and there is a danger in that.  It is important that travellers are not seen as passive onlookers, that they are not sidelined and their abilities and efforts are taken into account.  Travellers should be part of the whole dynamic so that their right to participate in society is not only acknowledged by the settled community but embraced by all, particularly the travellers.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the members of the task force on the production of this excellent report which will greatly aid understanding of the difficulties experienced by travellers.  The report provides us with a blueprint for dealing with a range of problems that confronts travellers, such as education, health, accommodation, access to the jobs market and the role of women, which is rightly identified as critical.  The report should be translated into action.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly drew a parallel between this report and the first report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  One lesson that should have been learned from that report is that progress in the implementation of its recommendations is very slow.  It is very important to put a timescale on the implementation of recommendations. There should be a monitoring committee such as that established to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  We are all too familiar with task force reports and so on which are left to gather dust on shelves.</P>
    <P>Some of the recommendations in the report have been taken on board and I wish the Minister.  Deputy McManus, the very best in her endeavours in regard to accommodation.  That is a critical element in improving the lot of travellers.  It is essential in the whole area of education that there be a impetus to implement the recommendations in the report.  I am glad of the <Col N="737" /> opportunity to speak on this important report, but in the last analysis what is needed is urgent action to improve the lot of people who have for too long been discarded.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Many changes have occurred in society in recent years. There has been a move towards greater social and political inclusiveness and tolerance, and a readiness to face up to previously hidden facets of life. However, meeting the needs of the travelling community is still a difficult and painful process.  Too often the relationship between traveller and settled community has been noted for its conflict rather than by its consensus, for anger and fear rather than acceptance and understanding.  We need to change the fundamental nature of that relationship, and this is a political challenge as much as a social one.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Taylor for his work in this regard.  I also acknowledge the generous approach of Deputy Flood and Deputy Keogh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For my part I am determined to realise the national strategy on accommodation as effectively as I can because accommodation is the key to meeting many of the needs of this most marginalized group in our society.  Providing accommodation is not the end of the story when it comes to true equality between our communities, but without accommodation the story cannot begin. I was privileged to have been chairperson of the Task Force on the Travelling Community established in 1993 by the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Government. It had a broad remit to examine and make recommendations on a range of issues affecting travellers.  I relinquished the position on my appointment as Minister of State in the Department of the Environment in January 1995. Senator Mary Kelly who was a member of the task force replaced me and guided it through to the presentation of the final report to the Minister for <Col N="738" /> Equality and Law Reform in July 1995. The report of the subsequent interdepartmental committee on the recommendations of the task force was presented to Government, which, on 26 March 1996, approved a range of proposals to address issues of concern to travellers.</P>
    <P>Central to the Government's comprehensive response is the development of a national strategy for traveller accommodation, with the necessary financial and legislative support to provide a framework within which the accommodation needs of travellers can be met. The strategy is a multi-faceted package of measures designed to achieve the accommodation targets &mdash; 3,100 units of accommodation &mdash; set out by the task force.  The strategy is based on the key principles that local authorities must uphold their responsibilities in providing traveller accommodation, that all authorities must play their part and that traveller interests are to be consulted and involved.</P>
    <P>Many interested observers will recall that the task force recommended the establishment of a traveller accommodation agency.  I looked carefully at this option.  However, certain important considerations determined that an alternative approach was necessary.  A new central body as proposed would have conflicted with Government policy on devolving functions to local authorities as outlined in the Government's programme. A Government of Renewal.</P>
    <P>The strategy, which I will describe in some detail, secures the local authority role in planning for and providing suitable accommodation for travellers as authorities do for other sections of society who cannot themselves provide suitable accommodation.  There will be an obligation imposed by statute on local authorities to draw up plans for the provision of traveller accommodation. In the event of a default in adopting local plans, managers will be empowered formally to make the plan and to secure its implementation as an executive function.  Local representatives will have the right to make <Col N="739" /> decisions, as is proper, but if they choose not to make them, progress will be made as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>These are the central principles of the strategy and ones that I believe will deliver the necessary accommodation objectives.  Elected members of local authorities must be willing to take seriously their responsibilities to all sectors of the community and to act responsibly in carrying out their duties. I would hope that, with goodwill all round, use of the last resort powers would arise infrequently but it is imperative to have such a provision.</P>
    <P>An important principle of the strategy, to which I would draw attention at this stage, is its recognition that equivalent, co-ordinated progress must be made by all local authorities in advancing local traveller accommodation programmes. In the past, some authorities have been more responsive and responsible in relation to traveller accommodation than others.  This will no longer be the case.  The strategy will provide a nationally coherent balanced programme of suitable accommodation throughout the country.  All authorities must do their share.</P>
    <P>Traveller interests must be a part of the strategy.  They must be consulted in its implementation and must assume responsibility along with the other key players in making it work.  The strategy provides a channel for consultation at both local and national level.  It will have an important role in improving relations between travellers and the community of which they are a part.</P>
    <P>Despite progress made by many local authorities in providing accommodation for traveller families, approximately 1,100 families remain on the roadside. In addition, the natural increase in traveller family population and the needs for halting sites for transient families must be taken into account.  At historic and current levels of providing accommodation the number of families on the roadside will at best remain stable but more likely increase unless determined action is taken now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> I shall now outline the main elements of the strategy.  Each major local authority, that is each county borough and county council and, possibly, some larger urban councils, will be required to prepare and adopt a five year plan for the provision of traveller accommodation in their area.  There will be a specified time limit on this.  The plans would be subject to periodic review by the authorities in the light of progress and developments otherwise, including changes in the local traveller population.</P>
    <P>Many factors influence the type and location of traveller accommodation.  A variety of housing possibilities is open to local authorities in providing for travellers' needs.  While some local authorities have met their responsibility to provide accommodation for traveller families, others have not.  There are various reasons for this, the principal one being the level of opposition from local settled residents to the location of traveller accommodation in their areas.  This applies particularly in the case of halting sites.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that many traveller families have expressed an interest in the concept of group housing to accommodate an extended family. The experience of group housing is generally good.  A number of local authorities have been active in providing group housing schemes and this approach has been gaining ground.  The task force's interim progress report recommended that separate funding, that is funding separate from the standard local authority housing programme, be provided for group housing and my Department has done this since January 1995.</P>
    <P>The strategy provides that the local plans will be co-ordinated by a special unit in my Department, with the assistance of a national traveller accommodation consultative group, into a national plan to deliver the 3,100 units of accommodation set out in the report of the task force.  I can assure Deputy Keogh I am already in the process of <Col N="741" /> establishing this special unit in my Department.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the strategy will be expensive.  The task force estimated that £158 million would be needed at 1994 prices to construct the accommodation required, whether housing for travellers, permanent halting sites or transient halting sites.  The Government has decided in principle that the necessary accommodation be provided over the period of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Funding has never been a constraint on the provision of halting sites or indeed on any other accommodation for travellers.  The cost to local authorities of constructing accommodation for travellers has been met in full by the Exchequer.  Successive Ministers have assured local authorities over the years that any funds required will be provided. Most recently, this was reaffirmed in the policy document, Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead.  This policy will continue to prevail.</P>
    <P>The special unit in my Department will also service the national traveller accommodation consultative group which will be established on a statutory basis to monitor preparation, adequacy and implementation of the local accommodation programmes and to advise the Minister as necessary.  The group will consist of seven members nominated by the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, and relevant national traveller organisations.</P>
    <P>I see this consultative group as having a vital role in channelling travellers' points of view and concerns into the preparation of the accommodation programme at national and local level. Traveller accommodation committees, representative of local authority elected members and officials and of travellers, will be established in each local authority area to facilitate consultation and assist in the development and implementation of local plans.</P>
    <P>An important support for local authorities in devising local programmes and in managing traveller accommodation <Col N="742" /> generally will be the improved legislative flexibility proposed in the strategy. Many authorities have been faced with litigation instigated by both the traveller and the settled community.  These actions have seriously impeded progress.</P>
    <P>The housing Acts and the management Acts will, therefore, be amended to impose on local authorities the obligation to prepare and adopt their plans by a specified deadline.  The legislation will provide that, in the event of the elected members not adopting a plan within the time allowed, the manager would then be empowered and required to formally make the plan.  When a plan had been made the authority would be required to take the necessary steps to secure its implementation.</P>
    <P>The planning Acts will be amended to put an effective planning framework in place which will facilitate implementation of the traveller accommodation plans.  These amendments would be comprehensive, dealing with a range of planning considerations, for example, development plan, zoning, consultation process, etc.  Again, a power for the manager to act independently of the council would be provided to ensure, for example, that the development plan includes the necessary provision for zoning etc. for halting sites.</P>
    <P>Wider legislative powers will be given to local authorities to deal with illegal, indiscriminate and unauthorised parking by travellers and related matters. Consideration will be given to prohibiting parking of caravans and temporary dwellings within a specified distance, say, one mile of traveller accommodation.  This is a balanced package of legal measures to improve the situation for local authorities, travellers and the settled community.</P>
    <P>The strategy also provides for improvement in the management and maintenance of traveller accommodation by local authorities.  The task force report recommended that 75 per cent of such expenditure by local authorities should be met by the State and <Col N="743" /> estimated this State funding at £7.5 million per year over the six years 1995-2000.</P>
    <P>The measures I have described are designed to be effective in securing the provision of accommodation for travellers. In spite of the best efforts of many people, the present situation remains unacceptable.  What is required is a fundamental change of attitude &mdash; an acceptance that we have an obligation to accommodate travellers and that shirking that obligation is no longer acceptable.  This is the nub of the strategy.</P>
    <P>The strategy represents a focused, coherent and balanced policy designed to achieve real solutions to the difficult problems of traveller accommodation.  It is a breakthrough in our approach to the accommodation of travellers.  It reflects my desire and that of the Government to act decisively in favour of one of the most marginalised groups in our society. It is a commitment to deliver on the recommendations of the task force that 3,100 units of accommodation be provided for travelling families in the shortest practicable period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the task force report on the travelling community which is welcome.  I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy McManus, on her role as the first chairperson of the task force and Senator Mary Kelly who took over after Deputy McManus's appointment as Minister of State.  The report is comprehensive and deals with a whole range of issues appertaining to the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the education element of the report.  Before dealing with that area, I should say it is extremely important that we provide, in tandem with the task force, an implementation strategy and that we commit the necessary resources right across the board to ensure fairly rapid implementation of many of the recommendations <Col N="744" /> of the report.  While the report is comprehensive, all the recommendations will not be implemented overnight or even in a year or two; it will probably take a five-year strategy effectively to implement many of them.</P>
    <P>In this debate we should concentrate on the positive aspects and the successes in terms of our response to the needs of the travelling community.  The negative side of various episodes tends to gain greater publicity than the successes. Successes unfortunately, do not make good news stories.  We have had our share of successes.  I know from my perspective in Cork Corporation that we have strived in a bona fide way to meet the accommodation needs of travellers through the provision of halting sites in various areas of the city and endeavoured to integrate the settled community with the travelling community. In my own area in Mahon in Cork there has been a welcome development in terms of participation by the travelling community in the local halting site with the local community association and there is a sense of shared commitment in terms of the action plan developed there; for example, in the recycling initiative there is shared participation by the travelling community and the settled community.  There is an understanding and a recognition that there can be an enrichment of each other's perspective, particularly for the children of the area in sharing their experiences and different cultural traditions and heritage.</P>
    <P>In terms of education policy I am concerned that we have not had any meaningful response to the recommendations of the task force.  The central recommendation which involves the establishment of a traveller education unit in the Department of Education, under the direction of an assistant secretary, should be implemented without delay. That is a worthwhile initiative that should be supported.  The advisory committee, which would advise the education unit on traveller education, should also be appointed without delay. We like to prescribe what we think is best for various committees, groups and <Col N="745" /> organisations and likewise with the travelling community.  There is a danger that we fall into that trap of trying to lay down what should happen.</P>
    <P>The development of a traveller education unit within the Department would facilitate a better consultative and communicative process with the travelling community in order to develop a proper education service which responds to their needs, their culture and way of life.  The Department of Education has a pre-school education service for the travelling community.  If one compares the resources allocated to the travellers' pre-school service with those allocated to the early start programme one will see that considerably more is allocated to the latter.  In her paper on pre-school education in Ireland and on the need to develop a national policy on pre-school education, Noreen Hayes refers to this basic anomaly in how we approach such issues.  We have had for a number of years a pre-school service for travellers' children. Then we developed a new initiative, early start, which is laudable in itself and is extremely well resourced in specific schools, much better resourced than the service available to children of the travelling community.  That disparity is not acceptable.  It is not right, fair or just.  If we develop initiatives for the primary system or the pre-school system the same amount of resources should be allocated for services for children of the travelling community.  This relates also to child care assistants and participation by travelling parents in the pre-school provision.</P>
    <P>As the report illustrates we need a national policy on pre-school education. This issue, on which there is considerable disagreement among the providers, is relevant to that travelling community. In my contributions on pre-school education in this House I have called for the establishment of a national forum on pre-school education.  That forum should comprise representatives from all providers of pre-school services, including the IPPA, an reamhscoilíochta who provide services to the naonraí, the <Col N="746" /> INTO, the Montessori movement and the travelling community.</P>
    <P>Early intervention is critical in the life cycle of any child, be it a child of the travelling community or of the settled community.  We can never put enough resources into pre-schooling and early education.  It is an accepted fact that children learn more in their first three years than they will learn in the rest of their lives.  They learn at a faster rate and they observe much more.</P>
    <P>Properly resourced pre-school education is essential for the development of children of the travelling community. It is essential that proper stimuli and challenges are provided in order to make an effective contribution to the growth and development of the child. We can do more in terms of the pre-school education service being provided for children of the travelling community. There is a sense of political correctness about all of this.  We produce a task force report, make all the recommendations, speak the right language in terms of doing this, that and the other for various communities but when it comes to pounds, shillings and pence we allocate more to the well off in society. That is the reality and the experience on a day-to-day basis.  There are about 5,000 traveller children of primary school age.  As an extension of the pre-school system, it is critical that we get it right at primary level.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the truancy report published in 1994.  I do not like the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo;, a term which is being dispensed with.  I respectfully suggest that the term &ldquo;school attendance&rdquo; should also be dispensed with.  I agree that the implementation of the recommendations of the task force report must be done sensitively and in the context of the rights of children to an education. It is ludicrous to have the Garda in liaison with school attendance officers trying to enforce the attendance of a child at school.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the family or community environment of a child who does not want to go to school.  It is not <Col N="747" /> something that can be resolved by legislation or by people endeavouring to force such children into school.  These children are entitled to an education and there is an obligation on society to devise the most appropriate way to provide that education.</P>
    <P>I do not like terms such as &ldquo;compulsory school attendance&rdquo; or &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; which are irrelevant in this day and age, particularly in the context of educating children of the travelling community. We cannot force children to learn in accordance with the traditions of the past when a garda or school attendance officer called to the door or to the halting site and threatened legal action under the School Attendance Act.  That is not a progressive way of dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>The visiting teacher service is a more effective route towards establishing liaison and communication with travelling families.  It is the best way to develop their participation in education.  We want children to participate in the education process, we do not want them sitting at their school desks in protest, hating every minute of it and waiting to dash out at the earliest moment.  That is not fulfilling anyone's aspirations and it is not helping the children or their teachers.  We should be sensitive to that.</P>
    <P>That is the challenge facing us in the Dáil and in Government.  People have a right to education and responding to that right demands a different approach and strategy.  It is clear that the strategies we have employed to date have failed.  Judging by analyses of the literacy and numeracy performances of travelling community children, to which the task force refers, we must acknowledge that there has been a degree of failure.</P>
    <P>I am not apportioning blame to any one sector or individual, but we all have to change our approach and learn from the past.  If our objective in education is to develop well-rounded individuals with certain competencies and basic skills including literacy and numeracy, who are able to think for themselves, develop their own ideas and be creative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> I am not too sure that the primary school curriculum as it is now structured, and as it applies to the travelling community, has been a success.</P>
    <P>The National Curriculum Assessment Council should be asked to look at the curriculum in terms of how it relates to children of the travelling community and asked to develop a report on a more appropriate curriculum which might be relevant to their life experiences and needs.  To date, the National Curriculum Assessment Council has been innovative in its work across a wide range of areas.  I am sure it would be equally interested in developing thoughts and ideas on a curriculum for the travelling community's children.</P>
    <P>We are concerned at the lack of progress to second level, and we have articulated our concerns about early school leaving generally, which is too high.  A recent report by the evaluation unit of the Department of Enterprise and Employment on the application of European Social and Structural Funds, calculated that approximately 20,000 people leave school early without appropriate qualifications.  That also relates to children of the travelling community who leave school even earlier than conventional early school leavers.</P>
    <P>When people leave school early without the necessary skills, it impairs their capacity to secure employment, income, advancement and a better quality of life. In addition to curricular reform which may be more suited to children of the travelling community, we must look seriously at second level retention rates and at how we can best improve participation rates there to bring children to Junior Certificate level and, hopefully, onwards to the Leaving Certificate and eventually third level education.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we often stereotype everybody into the strait-jacket system we have devised for the general populace. We are slowly opening up to the idea that one should not require six honours to attend university.  Some univerities are developing special quotas and reserving places for students from economically disadvantaged areas. <Col N="749" /> Similar programmes could be extended to the travelling community.  More importantly, universities and other third level institutions should develop their own research into this area.  They have not been particularly strong in developing understanding of, or in sponsoring or undertaking research into, the travelling community, or in providing opportunities at third level for travelling communities.</P>
    <P>Third level institutions have a responsibility in that regard.  If we can understand the needs, culture, origins and development of the travelling community, we may be in a position to provide certain courses at third level which would be relevant to their experience and to what they want to do with their lives in terms of their skills and the economy in which they work.  Third level institutions would be well advised to pursue that area.</P>
    <P>Teachers should be provided with proper in-service training to make them more aware of the travelling community's needs, and to equip them to deal better with children of the travelling community &mdash; an important point that was referred to by the task force.</P>
    <P>As part of the course modules they provide to would-be teachers, teacher training colleges should include sections dealing with the travelling community, using the basic research and experience that has been gathered to date about how they perform in the classroom. There should be a more proactive approach at the level of teacher training.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to match the aspirations and recommendations of this report with resources.  Sadly the axe fell last June on the visiting teacher service which was to have been significantly expanded this year.  Special schools were also subject to cutbacks as well as the loss of 1,000 places in VTOS for the unemployed who want to return to education.  These areas were singled out for cutbacks in the Education budget in a year in which we allocated £40 million for the abolition of undergraduate third level fees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> Is all this about political correctness, or is there some sincerity about implementing these recommendations? No Labour Minister for Education should prioritise cutbacks for travellers' children or the VTOS because these services are already under-funded, as acknowledged by all parties in the House.  All-party agreement on areas that should be exempt from budgetary cutbacks would be beneficial.  If we are sincere about promoting this report and implementing its recommendations we should support the expansion of the visiting teacher service and not introduce cutbacks.  This service does not absorb a significant amount of the overall £2.2 million budget.  Under the early start programme more money was provided for resources in conventional schools than for travelling children who attend pre-schools.  While I do not wish to be over critical, there is an element of the double standard in our approach to the travelling community.  One wonders if this relates to that group's lack of electoral power, that when push comes to shove the vested interests, through trade unions, employer federations and so on, carry much more weight than those who speak on behalf of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>I hope I am proved wrong and that this report will usher in a new era of commitment to the travelling community across a wide range of issues.  I hope our aspirations and the report's fine recommendations will be matched with action, pro-active implementation and allocation of resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the task force for publishing a comprehensive report on the travelling community, but it will remain a report until at least some of its recommendations are implemented.  I do not claim to have the answers to the problems associated with the travelling community.  Like other Members I have many traveller friends and as a local representative come into contact with them on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there have been changes for the better in recent years, there are one <Col N="751" /> or two matters about which I am concerned. Some years ago travellers and mental patients were viewed in a jaundiced fashion, in a manner that one would not wish any section of society to view another.  St. Brigid's Mental Hospital is located in Ballinasloe and before people began to have a better understanding of mental disease the locals were afraid of those who attended that hospital.  Fortunately, that barrier was broken down in the past ten or 15 years.  There was no objection when planning permission was sought a few years' ago for a mental health centre in Mount Bellew.  If the barriers in regard to mental illness can be broken down, there is no reason the same cannot happen with the travelling community. Some years ago people's views on mental patients were as deep as those now held about the travelling community. With the advent of better television and radio communications, it is a matter of grave concern that there should be such a gulf between the travelling and settled communities and the gulf is too wide to paper over the cracks.</P>
    <P>We must strike a balance on this matter. When local representatives try to make a case for, say, a hard-stand for the travelling community they are always asked if they would live beside members of that community.  If we do not wish to live beside them it is difficult to expect others to do so.  It is a question of imposing on others what we are not doing ourselves.</P>
    <P>We should start by integrating young children into the school system and this should not be a token measure.  Many young people from both communities find it difficult to keep up at school, particularly if they are not helped by their parents.  Children of the travelling community are less likely to be helped at home because of the lack of education in that fraternity and this will be evident in schools.  One does not have to be a member of the travelling community to know that if a child is not able to keep up with the rest of the class he or she will become disinterested, get <Col N="752" /> involved in devilment and before long become disruptive.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the report's recommendations will involve more resources and additional cost.  I am not opposed to spending large sums of money to ensure that traveller children get a proper chance in life.  It is not necessary to waste the House's time illustrating the importance of integrating traveller children into the school system. While health and housing matters are also important, it will not be possible to achieve the integration we would all like if we do not start at that level. Children of four or five years of age do not have preconceived ideas, they would be happy anywhere provided they are treated equally and that everyone is progressing at a similar level. However, this is not always the case and because of a few dangerous trends we must ensure that such integration takes place.</P>
    <P>The task force received submissions from a wide range of people, all of whom I compliment.  It is important that people give of their time and expertise and that their views are incorporated in the report.  No family should be left on the side of the road.  I have some trouble with the policy of providing hard-stands. In the absence of housing, they are believed to be a halfway house where certain facilities are provided that are provided for the settled community &mdash; water is laid on and power points are provided for the caravans.  The next phase, it is hoped, would be a house.  I can only speak about east Gawlay where we have a number of fine hard-stands. I know many of the people who use them by name and I have known some of them for many years.  Everything may be fine, for five, ten or 15 years until the children become young adults and get married.  There is no strategic local planning for them and, all of a sudden, on the perimeter of the hard-stand caravans appear, bringing the social problems right across the board. Before we know where we are, sitting on the fences and the walls of the hard-stands will be able-bodied young men <Col N="753" /> and women, not well educated, who have no jobs, and they can become very angry and bored.  However, members of the settled community shrug their shoulders and ask why those people are not working.  Most of them would work if somebody would employ them.  It is a wide area which I will not go into in the time available except to say that it is necessary to adopt an integrated approach.  Four thousand traveller households equals the number of houses in Ballinasloe.  By any standard that is a huge population to house.  It is incumbent on us to do that no matter what the numbers, and that 4,000 includes 1,100 families on the roadside.  We should hang our heads in shame and hope that over the five years of this plan this problem at least will be settled.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I know a number of families who, irrespectivce of where they are housed, will go on the road when the sun shines.  Regardless of what sociologists say, the people I know will be in their vans and on the road, and we will not see them until next October.  No Minister or TD or anybody under the sun will break that practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are having a good time at the Galway races as well.</P>
      <P>In rural areas we do not need to have the housing densities of the cities, although we have managed to turn some council and corporation estates into ghettos by building too many corporation and council houses together on one estate when we literally had thousands of acres at our disposal.  There was no need to pack families in, but we did it anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A policy that has worked in some of our towns and villages is to house one or two traveller families to every ten or 12 settled families at the same time. That prevents settled families from trying to make sure when they are housed no travellers will be housed in their estate.  In a number of instances local <Col N="754" /> people were very co-operative, the traveller children went to school and did the same as the settled children.  However, when the traveller children reached 15 or 16 years of age the trouble started. They just did not have the necessary sense of direction or foundation that other young people had.  Everyone goes wild at some stage, but somehow or another, the young travellers fell in with bad company, particularly when they went to some of the bigger cities in England.  That is part of the growing up process, and we do not have the answer to it.</P>
    <P>One thing that greatly unsettles the settled community is what I call the transient circus of very well heeled travellers although I would not call them travellers in the strict sense.  When I was young we used to call them gypsies. They have become very well off, owning 1996 registered vans, etc.  On one side there are little four and five year old traveller children whom I want to see integrated into the community through education, etc.  On the other side, when settled people see 20 or so huge silver caravans appearing in a town and nothing but affluence, it is difficult to accept it, particularly if the owners are abusive, camped in the wrong place or show general disregard for law and order.  These are removed from 99 per cent of the travelling community that I know, and it is only right and proper that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare should take more than an in-depth look at them.  Most of the people on PAYE and the self-employed say they are laden down with all sorts of taxes while that group pays nothing and has no regard for anybody.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill on which the Minister is working contains many fine points.  My point does not relate strictly to the travelling community but impacts on it.  It is very important that legislation on the right of entry to premises is drafted in a balanced way.  I have to take note of the many representations made to me.  If I were a hotel <Col N="755" /> owner or had my life savings invested in a public house I would like to have some control over who came into my premises, whether they were people who had been to a rugby match and are having a night out, hooligans or travellers. We must get the balance right.  I sincerely hope that by the time the legislation is published that will be achieved.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I would like to say if I had the time.  I will do what I can, at whatever level I can, to ensure that the aspirations in this plan will one day become a reality, but if we do not start at the bottom we have no hope.</P>

      <P>I move: That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>(1)  condemns the lack of respect shown for the Dáil by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications when he misled the House in relation to the plans for the Dublin light rail system by withholding information on an EU investigation in both debates and in responses to parliamentary questions on 14 December 1995 and on the following dates in 1996, amongst others: 31 January, 5 March, 6 March, 26 March and 28 March;</P>
      <P>(2)  calls on Minister Lowry to explain why he proceeded to announce the light rail lines for Dundrum and Tallaght on 12 December 1995 given that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  on 29 November 1995, according to the EU Regional Affairs spokesperson, his Department had agreed to a postponement pending the further investigation which represented a full study of the entire light rail plan; and (b) a serious question mark was hanging over the line, the <Col N="756" /> phasing and the £114 million in EU funding;</P>
    <P>(3)  calls on the Minister, in the interests of openness and accountability, to lay before the Dáil all correspondence between him and the European Commission in relation to the Dublin light rail system; and</P>
    <P>(4)  condemns the Government for overseeing a serious deterioration in relations between Ireland and the European Commission with this controversy involving Minister Lowry following on other serious ones involving Ministers Howlin and Yates.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Cullen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is satisfactory and agreed.  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first occasion within the short tenure of office of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications that a Private Members' motion has been tabled criticising his handling of matters within his portfolio.  Last year the public life of the country was convulsed for months by the controversy created by the Minister and his army of advisers in relation to anonymous letters.  That affair resulted in a Private Members' motion being tabled condemning the Minister.  To have had one Private Members' motion of such a serious nature tabled might be seen as unfortunate but to have two within such a short space of time can only be seen as carelessness. Obviously the Minister has not learned from the anonymous letters affair he himself created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout all these controversies the Minister somehow thinks he deserves pity.  He seeks to generate public sympathy by claiming that he is being targeted and that he is innocent.  Last week in this House he complained of &ldquo;the welter of abuse and allegations&rdquo; against him.  He might well recognise <Col N="757" /> how others feel on the basis of that statement.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is the author of his own difficulties and has only himself to blame for his political judgment again being called into question.  He has managed single handedly to botch almost every issue that has come before him. As has already been said, this accident-prone Minister has managed to get in the way of his own agenda.</P>
    <P>The controversies that have arisen involving this Minister raise the most serious questions about his attitude to office.  This is particularly obvious in the motion I have just moved.  The Minister has sought to make light of the whole affair.  As far as he is concerned, there is nothing wrong with withholding information from the Dáil, Seanad or the public.  The Minister's concealment of information in relation to the European Union investigation into the Dublin light rail system did not stop merely at the Dáil, Seanad and the public; it appears it also extended to the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Business Post</i> has reported that the decision on the two lines was taken without the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications letting his Government colleagues know that the phasing of the project was under the microscope.  This demonstrates the Minister's cavalier approach to Government office; he appears to believe that Cabinet is some kind of a Ballymagash town council meeting where he can say anything and get away with it.  One would expect that the Minister's colleagues would be on their guard when this inexperienced Minister is in the spotlight at Cabinet.  Given his record to date, they should be exercising extra caution during his presentations to Government.  Anybody who has made such a bags of so many things, who has been a lightning rod for controversy, should not be let out in public until the fine print has been checked.</P>
    <P>That does not appear to have happened because, if it had, one would have <Col N="758" /> expected the Minister for Social Welfare to have raised some queries with the Minister, Deputy Lowry, about the light rail line to Ballymun.  Had the Minister for Social Welfare kept his eye on the ball he would have had to be informed by the Minister of the EU investigation.</P>
    <P>Given the level of concealment by the Minister, one must also question the Taoiseach's robust defence of him in the House last week.  Is this the type of behaviour the Taoiseach is willing to accept on the part of his Ministers?  Is this what he claims <i>A Government of Renewal</i> is all about?</P>
    <P>The information concealed by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications about the European Union investigation was of no small importance.  As <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> both said in editorials, the citizens of Dublin deserve precise information regarding the status of the light rail project.  <i>The Irish Times,</i> in its editorial on light rail, noted that, despite a four-page statement by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on 16 April, he still had some explaining to do.  That editorial said: &ldquo;his statement last night does not satisfactorily answer the many questions raised&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That newspaper also acknowledged the legitimacy of the Fianna Fáil claim that the Minister has engaged in a gross deception of both Houses of the Oireachtas over the Dublin light rail plan.  By withholding information on the European Union investigation, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has yet again raised questions about the Government's respect for the Dáil, its relationship with the European Union in Brussels and its commitment to a much vaunted promise of openness, transparency and accountability.</P>
    <P>Most serious of all is the threat posed to Dublin light rail by this controversy. In a speech to the Dublin City Centre Business Association on 28 March last the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications warned:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> There is a fixed timescale for the EU funding which underpins the project and there is no guarantee that this money will be obtained unless the timetable is adhered to.</P>
    <P>Where stands that timetable now?  The Minister and the Taoiseach have maintained it is not in jeopardy.  That may be wishful thinking.  The Dublin light rail project is now 18 months behind schedule and cannnot afford to lose any more time if it is to meet the deadline for spending European Union money before funding expires in the year 2000. There is a very real threat posed by this additional delay, given that this time next year there is to be a medium-term review of the operational programme for transport.</P>
    <P>What happens if the European Union changes the phasing of its funding for light rail?  There is the real likelihood that, by the time of the mid-term review, no cable for light rail will have been installed, that the project could still be at the planning stage.  If that is the case, the European Union could decide to allocate those funds elsewhere. Portugal already has two light rail projects ready to go once funding is found.</P>
    <P>Dublin badly needs the light rail project. Whereas at one time traffic jams in the capital were confined to peak hours in the mornings and evenings, traffic jams now continue throughout the day. Only radical measures such as the installation of a light rail system will alleviate the problem.  That is why this controversy is so serious, why the Fianna Fáil Party has pursued the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications for answers.</P>
    <P>Since this controversy erupted the Minister has defended himself with a series of half truths.  No matter what he now endeavours to argue, there is no doubt that on 12 December last, when he was badly in need of some good news to distract attention from his difficulties, he announced in a blaze of publicity the light rail lines to Dundrum and Tallaght <Col N="760" /> and expressed regret that the Government had decided not to proceed with a third proposed route to Ballymun until after the year 2000.  In his six-page speech announcing the lines, the Minister made no reference to the European Union investigation questioning this phasing which stipulated that the funding for those two lines was conditional. It is incomprehensible that the Minister decided to announce those two lines while a question mark hung over the project and some £114 million in European Union funding.</P>
    <P>It was even more incomprehensible if one examines the events of 29 November last because on that date, two weeks before the announcement of the two lines to which I have just referred, officials of the Minister's Department met their European Union counterparts about the Dublin light rail plan.  It was agreed at that meeting &mdash; and this has been confirmed by officials of the European Union &mdash; that a final decision would not be taken on the Dublin light rail lines pending a cost benefit analysis. It appears the European Union had not been told at that meeting that on 12 December the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication, Deputy Lowry, would flout the agreement and make an announcement on the lines to Tallaght and Dundrum.  The European Union believed an announcement about the lines had been put on hold and postponement was effectively agreed.  Certainly any announcement was expected to be conditional.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now trying to reinvent history.  He claimed in a press release on 16 April that last December he launched a public consultation process and that, in effect, he did not make an announcement on the two lines.  He suggested this was a public consultation process about a general plan for the city of Dublin rather than for specific light rail routes.  It was abundantly clear on 12 December that his announcement related to the two lines and the public consultation process related only to those two lines.  This is borne out also by the fact that the only consultation by <Col N="761" /> the light rail team has been on the Tallaght-Dundrum routes and Ballymun has not featured.  The focus on the Dundrum and Tallaght lines is recorded also in the Official Report, Volume 462, column 1178, of 5 March 196.  At Question Time on that day the Minister in responding to a question said:</P>
    <P>I launched CIE's public consultation programme on the planned light rail links to Tallaght and Dundrum on 12 December 1995...</P>
    <P>That is a direct contradiction of what the Minister sought to suggest is the case as per his press release on 16 April. Further on in column 1181 of the same day when responding to supplementary questions, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The routes have been announced. They will be made known to the public, the people who wish to comment on how a route might affect them or how it could be best placed or changed to accommodate the concerns of local people will be listened to during the public consultation stage and also at the public inquiry.</P>
    <P>That is pretty clear.  That was the information available to this House on 5 March 1996 in spite of the fact that on 12 December 1995 a whole new process had started <i>ab initio</i> at the behest of the European Union.  In a desperate attempt to try to wriggle out of the controversy the Minister in his press release quotes from a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Shatter in January 1996.  The Minister is selective in quoting from the reply.  All he gives of the reply in his press release is:</P>
    <P>No final decision will be taken on the precise routes until the public consultation process is completed, a public inquiry has been held later this year and EU approval procedures have been completed.</P>
    <P>However, in column 1919, volume 460 of the Official Report of 31 January 1996, the full paragraph is as follows:</P>
    <P>I launched a public consultation programme on the planned light rail <Col N="762" /> links to Dundrum and Tallaght on 12 December 1995 following the conclusion of detailed work undertaken by the project team to identify the preferred technical route alignments for both links.  No final decision will be taken on the precise routes until the public consultation is completed, a public inquiry has been held later this year and EU approval procedures have been completed.</P>
    <P>We raise that point to make it quite clear that all that is in question is the Tallaght and Dundrum lines and nothing else.  It is not mentioned that two weeks before the Minister announced the two lines he had agreed to an investigation by the European Union into the light rail plan and the phasing of the project.  These are not isolated examples of this Minister withholding information.  He did so in public statements on 12 December 1995 and on 7 and 28 March 1996 and in parliamentary questions on 31 January 1996 and on 5, 6, 26 and 28 March 1996 and in the Official Report on 14 December 1995 and 14 February 1996.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to claim, since the controversy blew up again, that he had referred to the EU investigation in statements and in his replies to parliamentary questions.  The Minister included a throw away reference to the European Union only when he was talking about technical procedures.  This could hardly be said to reflect the scale of the investigation launched by the Commission.  The Minister also tried to convey in his press release and in his statement to the House last Wednesday that the EU investigation is some kind of a routine procedure.  It clearly is not. The seriousness of it was evident when the EU regional affairs spokesperson was interviewed last week.  Tommy Gorman, the RTE correspondent, put the following points: &ldquo;But the Irish Government has already announced what it intends to do; it is going to build a line to Dundrum and another to Tallaght and the one for Ballymun is going to be put on hold.  So now you are saying that <Col N="763" /> the Government had in November agreed to postpone this until another study is done.&rdquo; The spokesperson responded as follows: &ldquo;That is our information. That is what we have agreed with the Irish Government &mdash; to ask an independent consultant to take an analysis of all three options and then decide&rdquo;.  This was the first confirmation of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> story of 14 April 1996 which revealed that the European Union had ordered an investigation into the light rail project.  Up to then, nobody &mdash; not even most of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues &mdash; had got wind of this development which had occurred on 29 November last year.  On the occasions following this decision Deputy Lowry did not refer to such an important outstanding issue.  In fact, in the Seanad on 14 February the Minister said we cannot afford the luxury of more studies to re-examine the fundamental basis of the DTI strategy which we recently adopted.  The Minister it appears made a mistake in thinking that having adopted the DTI strategy the European Union would have no say over the lines.  On 28 March 1996, on one of the very few occasions when the Minister, Deputy Lowry, referred to the European Union, he gave the impression that the European Union had signed off from the process.  In his statement to the House on light rail on 17 April 1996 the Minister deliberately distorted the facts.  He claims the European Union investigation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, in retrospect I think you will consider that the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; ought not to have been used.  To say that the Minister deliberately misled the House is tantamount to saying that he told a deliberate lie.  Let us not make accusations.  Does the Deputy agree in retrospect that he ought not to have said &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In his statement to the House on 17 April about the light rail the Minister distorted the facts.  He <Col N="764" /> claims the EU investigation was inevitable. That is not the case.  When the EU Commissioner for Regional Affairs ordered an investigation into Mutton Island she had to point out to Deputy Lowry's colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, that she had such an entitlement.  Based on the Commissioner's letter it appears Deputy Howlin argued that such an investigation was very unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement in the Dáil on 17 April, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, failed to give the true position on the studies done by the Government. I understand a socio economic cost benefit analysis which is required for projects attracting over £20 million in EU funding was done by Ireland and submitted to the European Union as part of a multi criteria analysis.  I understand also that Ireland was doing another independent cost benefit analysis at the time the Irish officials met the Commission on 29 November 1995.  The first socio economic cost benefit analysis appears to have been dismissed by the European Union as insufficient and not detailed enough.  The second cost benefit analysis was not completed at the time of the 29 November meeting and does not appear to have been acceptable to the European Union.  The fresh independent investigation demanded by the European Union at the 29 November meeting was sought under a little used provision in the Community Support Framework where it is noted that &ldquo;the Commission reserves the right to make its own assessments particularly if the information supplied by the member state is inadequate&rdquo;.  I am not questioning the European Union's right to have such an investigation.  It is obliged to ensure that Community money is being spent properly.  I am questioning why the investigation was not disclosed by the Minister, Deputy Lowry, five months ago.  The Minister has sought to justify his non-disclosure by pointing to statements made by the last Government. He should remember that it was he who announced the lines, to a fanfare <Col N="765" /> of publicity, even though the European Union had ordered an investigation.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from this controversy and others that there has been a rapid decline in relations between the Irish Government and the European Union. Why has there been such a deterioration and souring of relations?  This is the third instance of the European Union requiring Ireland to jump every hurdle and go through every hoop.  The first two involved the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and the attitudes of those two gentlemen to the European Union appears to have copperfastened the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in the mobile telephones controversy have also raised the spectre that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications may have misled the Dáil on this matter during Question Time on 22 November 1995.  The handling of the strategic alliance for Telecom Éireann is also of major public concern.  Indeed, the Minister has overseen the disappearance of most of the main bidders.  Some of the best seem to have disappeared due to the controversy over the telephone licence.  The Minister, however, has refused to give a full account to the Dáil of the options now open to Bord Telecom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In our motion we have called on the Minister, Deputy Lowry, to lay before the Oireachtas all correspondence between himself and the European Commission about the project. His colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, did this in relation to Mutton Island and we urge the Minister to follow this precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister, Deputy Lowry, to answer the many questions that have been raised about the light rail project and we can assess his performance in <Col N="766" /> the light of the Government's claims of openness, transparency and accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the view of the greater Dublin region, the frustrating point about this project is the protracted delay and the risks inherent in that delay.  It defies logic that when the national plan was being completed the studies mentioned by Deputy Cowen had not been submitted, agreed or negotiated or the socio-economic benefit analysis of what was necessary had not been foreseen by the Minister and his Department.  As the national plan comes up for mid-term review it is a disgrace to think that there will be no work done on the scheme.</P>
      <P>The dogs in the street are barking about the Chamber of Commerce's concerns about the scheme.  Industries, small businesses and those in Brussels and Dublin endeavouring to co-operate with what should be a major improvement in public transport appear to be getting into a terrible tangle.  Looking at the two lines announced by the Minister, the Tallaght and Dundrum lines, and the potential of the Ballymun-Dublin Airport link, one cannot help coming to the conclusion that, given the spatial development, particularly of Tallaght, and the potential customer base for the light rail both here and in Dundrum and comparing it with the Ballymun and airport line, the greater customer base, movement of passengers and potential usage of the Dublin light rail scheme probably will be on the Ballymun and airport line.  There are settled populations in the other two communities and the potential passenger usage of the two southside lines is easily measured.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, in his representation of the northside of Dublin, defies logic. The potential passenger projections calculated by the Department and the recent announcements by Aer Rianta of the projected number of airline passengers should demonstrate that the northside line would be the most desirable and would stand the test of any economic or socio-economic study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> However, this country appears to have its projects paved by studies, reports, consultants' views and so forth which seem to take forever to compile.  Unfortunately, Dublin is the victim of these protracted delays in this and other areas of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the attitude of the Chamber of Commerce speaking on behalf of those who are directly affected by the project.  This morning on the Pat Kenny Show we heard that a small business operation in old Kilmainham has retained a consultant to offer a logical and intelligent conclusion as to what impact the light rail system might have on that part of Dublin.  The consultant concluded that the operator will not be able to continue his builders' provides business.  I am in no position to judge whether that is fact or fiction.  However, that is the type of protracted debate that is emerging about something that has already been announced.  Everybody is trying to see how it will work.  Consultation is only being embarked upon in the aftermath of the announcement.</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin assumed that work would commence following the launch.  That does not seem to be the case.  In his comments the Minister gave the impression that work can commence but a protracted, detailed and potentially delaying debate is arising before any work can commence.  It is most unfortunate tha this project should have to be the subject of studies and reports and be sent to Brussels for adjudication before work on it can commence.</P>
    <P>Was this financial cloth cut to measure, possibly by successive Governments? Was it the case that the third line should have been part of the scheme but, because of the Government's contribution to the financial package that was likely to be available from Brussels, we decided to go ahead with only two lines even though, given its desirability and correctness, the third line should have been an integral part of the original launch?  What happens if Brussels says that the three lines should proceed, given the benefits of having a <Col N="768" /> northside line and, particularly, a connection to the airport?</P>
    <P>There will be a substantial shortfall in the financial structure on which the national plan is based and that will have to be met by the Government.  It is unfortunate that a most desirable project which would be of great advantage to the greater Dublin region should get bogged down in studies.  The Minister, his Department and the Commission should have synchronised their plans in a more cohesive way so that the work could have commenced at the first available opportunity.</P>
    <P>I do not know what are the rights of individual companies or what are the intentions of the Chamber of Commerce regarding the companies it fears will be adversely affected by the light rail system.  There is a vague figure for potential compensation.  The Minister, who must look after the taxpayers' money, is concerned not to make an early judgment.  What about the right of access to the courts and the delay it causes?  On the southside the completion of the southern cross route has been bogged down for years because of court challenges.  I hope that will not be the case with the light rail system and that the Department will find its way through the many objections that appear to be looming.</P>
    <P>I have watched the growth of the satellite towns in County Dublin and am aware of the traffic problems associated with such towns.  In assessing the need for a form of light rail transport, one cannot help but come to the conclusion that it is difficult to project passenger numbers.  The northern part of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg's, constituency adjoins Dublin west.  The road infrastructure there, which was built at great cost, is severely congested and some form of light rail or bus lane arrangement is urgently needed.  The national primary road network cannot cope adequately with morning and evening traffic flows when cars are bumper to bumper on most round-abouts and junctions.  My area is not considered under the plans to extend <Col N="769" /> the light rail system.  Having regard to the growth of Tallaght and the potential movement of passengers to and from that area, the light rail line to Tallaght will probably be a complex and marginal financial operation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the canal area a case has been made for the provision of an underground rail system, but the Department has opted for a service above ground, the cost involved was probably the determining factor.  Unless cars in the city are banned, many are concerned that cars, trucks and the light rail service will compete for narrow road space along the designated light rail routes.  That will pose problems for the success of LUAS, traders and those who wish to use their own transport.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can deal with the studies and meet the necessary requirements to ensure that the greater Dublin area is serviced by what has been decided will be the main public transport option for the future and that the provision of the two lines will proceed. I hope the study will recommend extension of the service to the northside, particularly to take advantage of the potential offered by the airport.</P>

      <P>When an opportunity arises to speak in the House, particularly on the areas of transport, energy and communications, it appears that since the Government took office it has been embroiled in controversy led by the Minister.  In the almost ten years I have been a Member I do not recall a Minister who has sustained the level of controversy sustained by this Minister on practically every issue in which he has been involved.  That leads one to wonder if the manner in which the Minister operates is akin to his left hand not knowing what his right hand is doing. At best he has been economical with the truth in dealing with issues in this House.  His <i>modus operandi</i> appears to have arisen out of the manner in which he put this tripartite Government together, as if he is some type of overlord who can walk on water, treat this House in a manner he and his Cabinet <Col N="770" /> colleagues see fit, as we have learned in the recent past.  His arrogance knows no bounds because he has also adopted that attitude towards the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The Minister's suggestion that the Commission's investigation into the light rail proposal is common practice is not true.  Many of us on this side of the House have dealt with officials in Brussels on various matters and we have some knowledge of the approaches taken, particularly during the implementation of the national plan.  At the end of 1995, in a blaze of publicity, the Minister announced the provision of light rail lines for Tallaght and Dundrum and suggested that the service would be extended to Ballymun in the next millenium when he knew and had been told by officials in Europe that they were not satisfied with his approach and wanted to carry out a further independent investigation into the proposal.  It was extraordinary that he ignored that request and treated those officials with disdain by the manner in which he made the announcement.</P>
      <P>The Minister's track record since he took office is in keeping with the manner in which he approached most issues in the semi-State sector.  He is regarded throughout that sector as somewhat of a lame duck Minister because of his attitude and the manner in which he has dealt with practically every arm of that sector.</P>
      <P>Young travellers, in particular, confirm that Dublin is one of the most popular capital cities in Europe.  In the past Paris and London were the most popular.  The fact that Dublin is one of the most popular highlights the urgent need to deal with its traffic problems. Does part of the agenda from Brussels place a question mark over the system chosen for Dublin?  Irrespective of the cost implications and accepting that one must work within a budget, if the wrong decision is made having regard to the budget, the selected system must be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> As the Minister may be aware I have some experience of the transport area.  I do not put myself forward as an expert, but I am familiar with a number of light rail systems in Europe.  I am concerned that a straight line light rail service is not conducive to serving the population spread of Dublin, which is suburban based rather than a large infilled circular populated city.  Has that question been raised by officials in the EU in the context of questioning the extension of the proposed service to Ballymun?  A professor from Birmingham polytechnic, speaking on transport, said that light rail systems will be to the 1990s what high rise buildings were in the 1960s.  The ability of such light rail systems to sustain high levels of capacity to break even is considerable.  They need in excess of 70 per cent capacity and must operate 23 out of every 24 hours to break even.  Achieving that level of service is not considered possible in a straight line system.  There is some chance of achieving it in a circular system serving a mobile population, which is not the case in Dublin.  That may not be the most appropriate question for a Deputy representing a constituency outside Dublin to raise, but I put it to the Minister having some knowledge of the transport area.  An underground system would be more suitable and if it could not be provided in two or three years, it should be the starting point for a development that might take place over ten years.  In the long-term development of this city such a system would better serve future generations.</P>
    <P>The Minister's handling of this project has damaged the Government's relationship with the Commission.  We are nearing the mid-term review in 1997, some parts of it will be dealt with during this year.  Our ability to secure the additional resources to which we are entitled before the mid-term review has been severely damaged by the manner in which the Minister and his ministerial colleagues, Deputies Howlin and Yates, have approached officials in the Commission. That is no way to do business. <Col N="772" /> Over many years the Fianna Fáil Party, in particular, gained the highest respect for the proposals, propositions and development plans it presented to officials in the Commission.  It is incumbent on the Minister to repair with some urgency whatever damage he has caused.  When dealing with matters in this House, whether answering questions or making statements, he should give the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  This is something he has not done on a range of issues since taking office.</P>

      <P>(3)  welcomes the commitment in the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-1999, to provide substantial European Union funding for light rail and in particular the tangible demonstration of that commitment in the form of the £3 million already paid to CIE for preparatory work on the project;</P>

      <P>Could anything be clearer? The EU regulations require a study for all Structural Fund supported infrastructure projects costing more than £20 million.  The light rail project will cost more than £200 million, well in excess of the EU minimum threshold <Col N="778" /> for studies.  These experienced former Ministers, now in Opposition, were in office when these requirements were agreed.  They should be well aware of the requirement for studies.</P>
      <P>Requests from the Commission for independent studies on major projects are not unusual.  The Regional Affairs Commissioner was quoted in last Thursday's <i>The Irish Times</i> as making this very point.  In my Department, one was sought in respect of the peat power station and another will be sought for the biomass project.  In addition, the Commission can and does seek independent consultancy advice on particular projects &mdash; this happened in relation to the gas pipeline project and on a number of mainline and suburban rail projects. The external evaluator for the operational programme for transport, an independent consultant reporting to the programme monitoring committee, also reviews individual projects from time to time.  For example, under the 1989 to 1993 programme there was a review of the Dublin to Belfast rail project before the original EU assistance for it was approved.  Rigorous evaluation by the Commission is part of the EU funding process.  It is a routine part of the work which must be done to secure funding for projects.  It is part of the day to day work of my officials.  No reasonable person in the private or public sector expects finance to be provided for a major project simply because the developer thinks it is a good idea.  All the partners must be satisfied as to its merits.  In the case of light rail that includes the European Commission which will provide a large part of the funding.  It is also in the interest of the Irish taxpayer that there should be a full and proper evaluation.</P>
      <P>I call on the Opposition to say here and now whether it supports full and exhaustive evaluation of the project in the interests of both the Irish and the European taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed study is a comparative evaluation of the Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum routes.  It is not a fundamental re-evaluation of light rail. <Col N="779" /> There is a commitment in the Operational Programme for Transport to provide EU funding for light rail.  The European Commission has already agreed to provide assistance for the preparatory work and £3 million has been spent to date by CIE.  This clearly knows in a practical way that the Commission supports the light rail project and rubbishes the suggestion in the Opposition motion that a serious question mark hangs over EU funding.</P>

The core light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative provides for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely and Ballymun at an estimated cost of £300 million in 1993 prices.  The Operational Programme for Transport provides for a total expenditure of £200 million on light rail in the programme period.  The DTI final report endorsed this expenditure as about the limit of what could be physically implemented in the period.</P>
      <P>I notice that no Member of the Opposition referred to the fact that the three core line had to be reduced to two lines as a result of its failure when in Government to bring home the billions it promised. Deputies will recall the shrinking billions.</P>

      <P>A high level project team comprising CIE personnel and consultants analysed a range of possible two line combinations from the core light rail network which could be implemented within the £200 million allocation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>These options were examined against a number of criteria including their contribution to DTI objectives, financial performance, congestion alleviation, environmental impact and ease of construction.  The provisional finding of the CIE project team and its consultants was that priority should be given to the construction of the Tallaght and Dundrum routes.  This was noted and approved by the previous Government in October 1994.  I want the House to be crystal clear as to what the previous Government decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 October 1994 it noted and approved the provisional finding of the CIE project team that light rail links to Tallaght and Dundrum should be constructed during the period of the national plan with the remaining links to be constructed thereafter.  I ask the House to take note of the words &ldquo;provisional finding&rdquo; which puts it beyond a shred of doubt that the previous Government was aware this was not a final decision on route priorities. Deputy Bertie Ahern is guilty of the very thing of which he wrongfully accused me.  When he announced the construction of the Tallaght and Dundrum lines in his speech to Dublin Chamber of Commerce on 20 October <Col N="782" /> 1994 he conveniently neglected to mention that the decision to route priorities was not final.  I will quote his press release: &ldquo;Two of the three LRT lines will be constructed at a cost of £200 million, bringing a clean efficient transport system to Leopardstown via Dundrum, and to Ireland's third biggest urban population in Tallaght.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is everything he said lest I be accused of quoting him selectively. It was not mentioned that this was a provisional decision or that it was subject to the EU approval procedures he negotiated.  He suggested it would go to Leopardstown when the Government decided it would go to Dundrum.  He did not refer to statutory procedures or public consultation and he among other former Ministers has the cheek to stand up in this House and accuse me of misleading people.  Irrespective of how embarrassing it was for the Opposition I put the record straight shortly after I came into office.  In answer to a parliamentary question on 31 January 1995, I stated the factual position as follows:</P>
      <P>The provisional finding arising from this work is that links to Tallaght and Dundrum should be constructed during the period of the operational programme and this position was noted and approved by the Government in October 1994.</P>
      <P>On foot of the Government's provisional decision of October 1994 the CIE project team went ahead with detailed planning on the Tallaght to Dundrum line, through the city centre. When it had identified the preferred technical route alignment, the public consultation process got under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was put before the public last December was the clear but provisional view of successive Governments, the <Col N="783" /> CIE project team and international consultants that Tallaght and Dundrum should be built first, to be followed by the rest of the core network.  Others, both nationally and at EU level, have a right to challenge that view.  I have openly recognised that right.  We have a lengthy public consultation programme, a mandatory public inquiry and an EU approval process which provide a more than adequate opportunity to debate the issue.</P>
    <P>I did not launch the construction of the light rail project last December.  I launched an extensive public consultation programme on the project.  To be absolutely clear I will quote the headline on my press release of 12 December.  It said: &ldquo;Decision Making Process on New Dublin Transport System Gives Public a Full Say&rdquo;.  Will somebody please tell me what is misleading about that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows what that means.  It had to do with the local effects on the ground where the lines were to be laid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>On that day I said:</P>
      <P>What we are launching here today is not the construction of the LRT.  It is the start of a public consultation process with the people of Dublin that I see as an essential part of the preparation for the project.</P>
      <P>What is misleading about that?  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, repeaeted this position in a Dáil Adjournment debate two days later.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Barely two months ago, replying to a Seanad motion on 14 February, I made it clear that the proposed statutory public inquiry into all aspects of the proposed light rail network would:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> ...enable people who believe that light rail is not the appropriate solution to Dublin's transport problems or that other routes should be given priority to put forward their views and challenge the DTI recommendations and the detailed planning work of CIÉ's project team.</P>
    <P>I repeated that in reply to a parliamentary question on 28 March and went on to state:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the stated policy position on light rail, I, as the responsible Minister will be obliged by the legislation to fully and objectively consider the inspector's report on the public inquiry and the submissions made by interested parties before making a final decision on CIÉ's application for the statutory powers to construct light rail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made a clear but provisional policy choice.  That choice will be fully examined at both national and EU level and only then can definitive decisions be taken.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that some people, especially Deputies opposite, assumed that the national and EU consultation and approval procedures were a mere formality.  I was never under such an illusion and that is why the EU request for a comparative evaluation did not cause me or any of my officials any alarm.  Unfortunately, Fianna Fáil seems to have a much more cavalier attitude to these processes.  Their approach seems to be to decide first and consult afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the factors which influenced the Government's provisional choice of the Tallaght to Dundrum option was the fact that the bulk of the city centre to Dundrum section would use the old <Col N="785" /> Harcourt Street railway alignment.  By contrast, all the Ballymun line would be on-street with a consequent higher level of disruption during construction.  There is also a real doubt about the wisdom of closing Drumcondra Road, which is the main artery to the North, to build the light rail before the port tunnel has been built as it could act as a relief road during construction.  Another factor is that the Dundrum line would get more people out of their cars than a line to Ballymun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>This would better contribute to reduced congestion, which is essential to protecting the city's economy and creating the jobs people throughout the city need.  All these issues will be fully addressed in the planned comparative evaluation.</P>
      <P>However, the Government remains committed to the construction of the full core light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative &mdash; that is the three lines to Ballymun, Cabinteely and Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak briefly about the background to the proposed study.  On 29 November my Department and the CIE project team made a detailed presentation on the light rail project to Commission officials, including an outline of the basis for the provisional decision taken by Fianna Fáil in Government in October 1994.  The Commission suggested that a comparative socio-economic evaluation of the Tallaght-Dundrum and Tallaght-Ballymun lines should be carried out.  My Department agreed in principle and said it would suggest terms of reference for such an evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ballymun issue would have been addressed whether or not the Commission had sought a study.  It has arisen during the public consultation and will no doubt be raised at the statutory public inquiry.  The CIE project team will have to convince the inquiry, and me as Minister acting in a quasi-judicial <Col N="786" /> capacity, that the previous Government's provisional choice of the Tallaght-Dundrum line was the correct one.</P>
    <P>On 19 January my Department wrote to the Commission suggesting draft terms of reference and a methodology for the study.  During February and March there was further correspondence and detailed discussions on these issues and on the list of consultants to be invited to tender for the study. Agreement on the final issues was reached on 29 March.  On 4 April a number of consultants were invited to submit proposals by a deadline of 3 May.  An appointment will be made shortly in agreement with the Commission. I do not propose to publish the correspondence between the Commission and the Department as it would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It might bring us closer to the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, however, be happy to provide Deputies with copies of the terms of reference agreed for the study, which was the end product of the correspondence and discussions with the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the intervening period, while the discussions with the Commission were under way, the CIE project team carried out a substantial amount of preparatory work for the study.  This will be passed over to the consultants immediately after they are appointed.  While the study is in progress, the public consultation programme will continue in parallel with it, legislation will be introduced in the Oireachtas and the CIE project team will continue its detailed preparations for the statutory public inquiry.  In short, every possible effort is being made to keep to the implementation timetable by proceeding with a range of activities in parallel.  It is my firm objective to have the new legislation in place by the summer recess, to have the statutory procedures completed in time to let construction start as early as possible next year and to have light rail in operation in Dublin <Col N="787" /> during 2000.  I invite the House to give me its full support in pursuit of this objective.</P>
    <P>The drafting of legislation to provide the statutory basis for light rail has been completed.  Consultations with other Departments are more or less finalised and I will submit the Bill to the Government for approval over the next few days.  The Bill proposes to vest the power to construct, maintain and operate light rail in the board of CIÉ.  Those powers will be procured for individual projects through a light rail order made by the Minister.  Before any such order is made, people will be able to make written submissions to the Minister and there will be a mandatory public inquiry in each case to allow people put forward their views.</P>
    <P>The final issue I wish to address is our relationship with the Commission.  I reject the implication in the Fianna Fáil motion that we have a poor and deteriorating relationship with the Commission. That is simply not true.  The Commission has always been a friend to Ireland and we in turn have been broadly supportive of its position on many issues.  The strength of any friendship is the ability to disagree occasionally. We do not always agree but we have a good working relationship at official and ministerial level which allows us deal with difficult issues in a rational, non-confrontational, low key way.  The best description of my Department's relationship with the Commission is, business as usual.  We each recognise that the other has a job to do and that we may have differing positions from time to time but we always aim to find a solution which is mutually acceptable.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I invite the House to reject the Fianna Fáil motion for what it is &mdash; a blustering attempt to make cheap political capital out of a vital infrastructural project for the city of Dublin and an inept attempt to damage relationships between the Government and the Commission for base political motives.  I call on the Opposition to put the <Col N="788" /> national interest first by supporting my actions in pursuit of the firm objective of having light rail in operation during the year 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at what I heard from the Minister.  It is sad that when he has come to the House to make speeches on important issues, he has been on the defensive.  He has been so again tonight by trawling through various press statements issued by representatives of my party.  We support the light rail system for Dublin and it is disingenuous of the Minister to imply otherwise.</P>
      <P>On two occasions recently he demonstrated a total lack of understanding of the relationship between the Commission and the Government.  In awarding of a second mobile telephone licence, and his decision to cap the licence fee at £15 million, the Minister claimed the Commission was involved all the way.  There are many similarities with this issue.  However, an EU official, Mr. Willie Heelan, said he was astonished to see copies of two letters from the Department to representatives of Persona, the unsuccessful bidder, in which it was suggested that the EU had caused delays in the licence process and that the Commission and the Department fixed a £15 million extrance fee for the new operator and a corresponding £10 million fee for Eircell, Telecom Éireann's mobile telephone division.</P>
      <P>The Minister told the Dáil he took advice from the Attorney General with regard to the GSM licence and that his Department entered discussions with the Commission which led to a cap of £15 million being put on the licence fee. However, last week a spokesman for the Commission said they do not set a price like that, it is none of their business and it not up to them to fix entrance fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final part of our motion we condemn the Government for overseeing a serious deterioration in the relationship between Ireland and the Commission.  The Minister has not satisfied us with regard to that relationship. The mobile telephone licence is directly <Col N="789" /> related to this issue because it reflects the same incompetence.  Who is telling the truth about the second mobile telephone licence and the capping of the fee, the Minister or the Commission? The Minister should make available to the House all the documentation and correspondence involving his Department and the Commission on this matter. The serious discrepancies between his version of events and that of the Commission need to be clarified.  The Minister, as our party leader said, should make a statement on this matter. He has shown a remarkable degree of incompetence and created a lot of confusion among the business community and the general public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown a total lack of competence in his dealings with the European Commission in relation to the Dublin light rail system; I heave heard nothing here tonight to convince me otherwise.  The Minister should have cleared his lines with the European Commission before he launched his plans for the Dublin light rail system in a blaze of publicity last December.  Only last week a glossy brochure was delivered to my home and to others in my constituency; I have a copy with me tonight.  It has a colour photograph of the Minister on the front page and extols the light rail system.  It also refers to the huge benefits the light rail system will bring to Dundrum.  I look forward to the benefits it will bring to Dundrum, but it is remarkable that the Minister proceeded with his launch of the system last December while knowingly withholding critical information on the EU investigation into the exclusion of the Ballymun line from the first phase of the development.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about Fianna Fáil knowing about the socio-economic analysis; we know all about it.  However, we mentioned in our motion that further studies were required; that is the crucial point which the Minister does not seem to comprehend.  Further studies were required by the European Commission and the Minister glossed <Col N="790" /> over that issue here tonight.  The Minister's attempt to ride roughshod over the European Commission has backfired. It has led to chaos and confusion among the public and business community in the greater Dublin area and the Minister's glossy brochure, which is still being circulated throughout the city and county, is a major embarrassment to him and his Government colleagues. He has also shown a complete disregard for the EU Regional Affairs Commissioner in particular.</P>
    <P>I omitted to say that I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Ceann Comhairle An Leas-Ceann Comhairle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House strongly support the light rail system for the greater Dublin area.  As public representatives for the Dublin area, it is time we ended this practice of drawing a line between north and south of Dublin.  The Ballymun line should be given the same priority as the Dundrum and Tallaght lines, and the Minister has given us some comfort in his statement on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the European Commission will have my full support if they decide to proceed with the three lines as quickly as possible, ideally simultaneously, because the whole idea of proceeding with two lines and not proceeding with the other is not in the interests of the greater Dublin area.  If the Minister worked closely with the Commission, as he should be doing, he could end up with the best option, but sadly that is not the case.  The Commission has, rightly, taken a close interest in this matter and as we have seen from various articles by commentators and journalists, the European Commisison is showing its genuine involvement and interest in issues of this nature, which have a socio-economic dimension.  The Minister has not understood that special relationship which, if put to good use by him, would benefit <Col N="791" /> all the people of Dublin, north and south.</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement among political parties, the business sector and the public in my constituency that the Dundrum line must be extended to the Sandyford Industrial Estate.  I urge the Government to make the necessary changes and allow for this extension in the interests of common sense and the proper infrastructural and environmental development of south Dublin.  If the light rail line ends at Dundrum this will merely result in additional traffic chaos and congestion in the village and surrounding area.  The three lines should get the same priority, and it would be a waste of time for whatever Government deals with this &mdash; it will clearly be the next Government &mdash; to bring a line to Dundrum and end it there.  That is the view of every political representative from the area, including those form the Minister's own party and that of the business community.</P>
    <P>This line must go to Sandyford Industrial Estate as it would not involve any great additional cost.  There is a huge workforce in that area, adequate space for car parking and whatever is required for this major infrastructural development. I make that point in a constructive manner.  We are in huge danger of losing the whole project to some other country, perhaps Portugal, if we do not proceed with speed.</P>
    <P>In relation to two key socio-economic issues, the mobile phone licence which I mentioned earlier, and the issue of the light rail, the Minister has shown a remarkable degree of incompetence.  He has lost his credibility as a Minister with responsibility for many semi-State companies. He has lost the confidence of that sector and the trade union movement, representing thousands of workers.  I make that point as somebody who has, since the change of Government, been my party spokesperson for Labour affairs.  The time has come for the Minister, who has presided over one disaster after another, to pack his bags <Col N="792" /> and take the last train to Thurles before he does any more damage.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of listening to the Minister come into this House with well-crafted speeches which are defensive from the word go.  When the Minister is defending, he is losing.  That is the nature of his speech tonight.  I have no doubt that my colleagues will analyse his speech word for word tomorrow night, but in the one chance he had to redeem himself he said he does not propose to publish the correspondence between the European Commission and his Department as it would serve no useful purpose.  Why did the Minister not follow the example of his colleague in Government, Deputy Howlin, in relation to his problems with the Commission, and produce the necessary correspondence?</P>
    <P>Irreparable damage has been done by the Minister to the excellent reputation which successive Irish Governments have enjoyed in their dealings with the European Commission, thanks to the commitment and dedication shown at ministerial and official level.  There is no criticism on my part at the official level because I have had some experience as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs with the kind of work that has been done and continues to be done by our officials in dealing with the European Commission.  They have done excellent work over the years but unfortunately irreparable damage has been done by this Minister and I ask him now to do the honourable thing.  This incompetent Minister must go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Dubliner I welcomed the Government's decision last <Col N="793" /> December to make a commitment to light rail, although there was great disappointment about the way the north side line had been excluded.  It had been rumoured for some time that we would not get a northside line, but when the decision was made we were simply told the Government was going ahead with the two southside lines that it would look again at the northside line in phase two, if there is ever a phase two, in the next century.  We were not given any hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of the DTI for a couple of years and attended endless meetings at the local authority committee and the steering committee on which I gladly served as one of two public representatives. I had followed with interest the whole light rail saga and hoped and expected that the three lines would get the go-ahead.  I know what the Minister said in October or November 1994 but no statement of Government policy was made at that stage.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, was trying to push a Government decision in a certain direction and I heard the Minister's quote from Deputy Bertie Ahern's speech at the time.  Leopardstown and Tallaght could have been included in one line, which was a possibility at one stage.  The Minister said the final decision was nearly made in October 1994.  Why then did it take another 14 months?  I had hoped that with the northside Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, our interests would have been represented.  There were leaks and snippets in the newspapers over the weekend that Minister X and Minister Y raised this matter and pushed it strongly at Cabinet but were overruled by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Most of those snippets had the Minister for Social Welfare's name behind them; he must have been calling in some favours from the media.  That is no way to operate. If that Minister had a strong point of view on the matter, he should have <Col N="794" /> said it at the time and not tried to latch on to a decision that went against him.</P>
    <P>The promise by the Government, when it made its final decision, to examine the possibility of having a LRT line for the northside in the next century was too vague.  What the northside people wanted was a commitment at least to start preparatory work on the line and that this proposal would be in the pipeline as soon as construction of the other two lines began.</P>
    <P>There was further nervousness in the northside when the Government made its announcement last December.  At the time, reference was made to having a second airport for the city at Baldonnel. Thankfully, that proposal is no longer being considered.  However, some northside people sensed a message behind it.  The proposed LRT line to Tallaght would be close to Baldonnel while the northside, with Dublin Airport which had 8 million passengers coming through it last year, would not get the nod for a LRT line.  I hope the Government's decision has ended the possibility of any reduction in status of Dublin Airport.  Dublin city is divided between the northside and southside. However, any fair or logical assessment would suggest that if the EU provided funds for two LRT lines, there should be one northside and one southside line.</P>
    <P>Some people refer to the proposed northside line as the Ballymun line.  The proposed northside line would cater for more than Ballymun.  It would serve Dorset Street, Drumcondra, Whitehall, Dublin City University, Ballymun and, hopefully, Dublin Airport.  Building the line as far as Ballymun and not extending it to the airport would be lunacy.  Some 8 million passengers came through Dublin Airport last year.  We must be the only EU capital or major European city without a rapid transit system from its airport to its city centre. I am not an engineer, but perhaps we could construct a mile of the line through the countryside between Ballymun and the airport for the same cost as 100 metres through Drumcondra Road or O'Connell Street.  It would be <Col N="795" /> scandalous and stupid to bring the line as far as Ballymun but not to the airport.</P>
    <P>While I accept the Government decision was in line with the technical assessment carried out by the CIE and departmental officials, this depends on what they were asked to do and the criteria set down.  We get a lot of funding from the EU and we must conform to its criteria.  The word &ldquo;criteria&rdquo; is continually cropping up, whether it is in relation to LRT lines, mobile phone licences, etc.  We have asked about this at various committees.  The criteria against which the decision was reached have never been made public.  Perhaps if we knew what they were we might be a little wiser and decide whether they were right or wrong.  In many cases, the criteria are laid down and that is the end of it.  Nobody knows what they are or from where this came.  However, we are told that everything flows on from them and we cannot veer away from them.</P>
    <P>If the primary criterion, as some officials have told us, was which line would take the most cars off the road, then Dundrum would be the better option because it has a far higher usage of cars than Ballymun.  Obviously it would be different if the airport had to be taken into account.  Another criterion may be which line would make the most profit or at least break even. However, if the EU gives £114 million and said that social integration must be taken into account, it is obvious that the Ballymun line would score much higher on that scale.  While CIE officials said they will release this information, I would like to see all the criteria against which that professional assessment was made.</P>
    <P>I fear we may end up losing EU funding for this project.  I do not know how long this socio-economic study will take, but what if it takes a number of months and the EU says that the northside line must return to phase 1?  That is fine, but will we be too late?  While I am northside and I support an LRT line there, there is no point in the northside and <Col N="796" /> the southside arguing with each other if it ends up with a hollow victory for the northside &mdash; it would be like winning 6p in a court case &mdash; only to be told that we are too, late and the money is no longer available.</P>
    <P>A mid-term review will take place next year and I am concerned that this country will end up looking very foolish. I hope a solution or compromise can be found and that the Minister and the Department get the EU back on board. The Minister should mend his bridges with the EU because he has rubbed it up the wrong way.  We need a compromise which will allow the two existing proposals to go ahead but will put the northside line back on the agenda and begin the detailed technical and routine work as soon as possible.  While the other two lines should be constructed, the northside line should come rapidly on their heels.  I do not know how this can be done.  Maybe there is scope for transferring funds within the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications or from the roads programme to the LRT line.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the delay in the process.  I asked the Taoiseach about this last December and he told me the legislation would be in place in March. Last week he said it would be introduced in July.  However, the Minister said this evening that he hoped it will be passed in July.  We are running into big problems.  We must go through the process of having an environmental impact statement and public inquiry.  Will we decide to introduce regulations granting construction without having to get planning permission?  Will we have the same argument with the Department as with the mobile phone masts when certain set procedures were set aside?  We are months behind schedule.  I am concerned that we seem to be behind on every major project &mdash; the Dublin Port tunnel, the convention centre and the LRT; I am concerned that some of the money will be withdrawn at the mid-term review next year and that all these matters will gang up on us.  If something like that is going to happen, is there any <Col N="797" /> merit in a huge northside-southside row?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, knew of the need for this cost-benefit analysis back in 1994.  Of course he did.  He signed it; he knew about it.  I presume he would have expected that when the announcement took 14 months and the statement was made, all that had been completed.  I accept that the Minister made some good points about Drumcondra Road but one could make that argument for any route.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Dea gave me notice of his intention to raise the following matter: the unsatisfactory situation which pertains as a result of the detention of people who are adjudged guilty but insane, and the consequent danger to which the public may be exposed.  Before calling on Deputy O'Dea, I consider it important to remind Members that a matter which relates to the issue under discussion is currently the subject of proceedings for a judicial review in the High Court.  I deem it imperative in view of the <i>sub judice</i> rule that no reference whatsoever be made to that particular case.  Our comments this evening must be confined to the general matter under discussion. I feel sure Deputy O'Dea and other Members will appreciate that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important matter and I appreciate the point of view you have expressed.</P>
      <P>Recent events have highlighted the grossly inadequate and confused nature of the law relating to criminal insanity. The Irish law on this subject is still based largely on the McNaghten Rules which were laid down by the British courts in the middle of the 19th century. Broadly, these rules state that a person is legally insane if, but only if, either (a) he does not understand the nature and quality of his act or its wrongfulness or (b) he does understand but cannot refrain from committing the act because of a defect in reason caused by mental illness.  This definition is extremely narrow and ignores developments in psychiatric medicine for the past 150 years.  For example, it does not encompass such conditions as personality disorders, psychopathy or sociopathy.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom amended their law in this area in 1957.  The UK legislation introduced the defence of diminished responsibility to take account of mental deficiency which falls short of insanity as defined under the McNaghten Rules.  A similar change was recommended here in 1978 by the Henchy committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons but, to date, no action has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right of a person who has been adjudged guilty but insane after having committed a horrific crime, or perhaps a series of crimes, to be readmitted into society is uncertain.  That uncertainty has caused great public disquiet.  If any such person were to be released, then it is safe to assume that no Irish jury will ever again find that a person is guilty but insane, particularly in a murder case.  The reason for this is obvious. Legal history shows that mistakes have been made in the past in this area, often with devastating consequences.  In one celebrated case in the UK in the early 1960s, a person who, by his own admission, poisoned quite a few people was adjudged guilty but insane and spent <Col N="799" /> considerable time in a hospital for the criminally insane.  On his discharge an eminent psychiatrist not only pronounced him &ldquo;recovered&rdquo; but gave him a letter of recommendation for employment. The psychiatrist's professional opinion was that he had made an &ldquo;extremely full recovery&rdquo;.  A few years later the person who had made that &ldquo;extremely full recovery&rdquo; was found guilty of poisoning two other people and attempting to poison two more.</P>
    <P>This State has an obligation to give legal recognition to categories of mental illness which falls short of our very narrow definition of insanity.  That change will have to be accompanied by clear, definitive and transparent provisions for dealing with those people, particularly in cases where they seek subsequently to be released on the grounds that they have now become sane.  Rumours that these reforms were imminent have proved for many years to be greatly exaggerated.  The genuine and widely felt public concern to which this matter has given rise dictates that the matter must now be given the most urgent priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. There is no dispute about the fact that we have needed for some time to look at the law relating to criminal insanity and, as the Deputy will be aware, successive Administrations in recent years have committed themselves to suitable and appropriate reform.</P>
      <P>Most legislative provisions dealing with criminal insanity date back to the last century, as Deputy O'Dea has said, and it is clearly time for change to take account of changing circumstances, new knowledge and concepts of mental illness and new methods of dealing with old problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware proposals for the amendment of the law relating to criminal insanity have been under examination in my Department for some time.  I am sure Deputy O'Dea, as a former Minister of State at the <Col N="800" /> Department, will know that.  While it would not be appropriate for me to give specific details of the proposals, I have already indicated the general areas which will be addressed in the legislation. These include the question of fitness to plead at a criminal trial, the definition of criminal insanity, the possible change of the guilty but insane verdict, the question of appeals from such verdicts and from findings of unfitness to plead, the introduction of a new verdict of guilty but with diminished responsibility, and the procedures governing the detention and release of persons found guilty but insane.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the concept of diminished responsibility will be of special interest.  It provides for the intermediate situation where a person is not legally insane but is nevertheless suffering from a mental disorder which reduces his or her culpability.  When applied in the case of murder &mdash; which carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment &mdash; the effect of a successful plea of diminished responsibility would be a conviction for manslaughter with the sentence, at the discretion of the court, being any term of imprisonment up to life.</P>
    <P>These are all complex matters requiring careful consideration and research. A number of committees of experts both here and in the neighbouring jurisdiction have been examining this whole area and have given their views and recommendations, and their reports are being considered and taken into account by my Department in the formulation of the proposals which I will bring to Government.  The Third Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons, commonly referred to as the Henchy committee, made recommendations in 1978 on all the issues I have mentioned and special account will be taken of their views.  Account must also be taken of various relevant decisions of our courts and also of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in regard to the rights of persons detained in various circumstances, particularly their <Col N="801" /> right to a review of the reasons for their continued detention by a court or other quasi-judicial body independent of the Executive.</P>
    <P>Because of pressing priorities in other areas, progress in bringing forward reform of the law in this area has not perhaps been as fast as we would want. However, a great deal of work has been done and, while some further examination is required, I hope to be in a position to present a Bill to the Oireachtas at the latest by early next year.</P>
    <P>As regards the position under the present law, the powers of the Minister for Justice in relation to the detention of persons found guilty but insane are contained in the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883.  This legislation has been operated by successive Administrations in relation to such cases.  Indeed, new legislation in this area would not affect the circumstances of those currently detained having been found guilty but insane.  They would continue to be dealt with under the terms of the legislation under which they are detained.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court in 1991 held that such a person may apply to the Executive &ldquo;for his release on the grounds that he is not suffering from a mental disorder warranting his continued detention in the public and private interests, then the Executive, in the person of the Government or the Minister for Justice, as may be, must inquire into all of the relevant circumstances.  In doing so, it must use fair and constitutional procedures&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To help the Minister in the consideration of such cases, the then Government decided, in September 1991, to establish an independent advisory committee to advise on applications for release from the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum of persons in this category.  This committee comprises a senior counsel as chairman, a consultant psychiatrist and a general practitioner.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of this committee are as follows:</P>
    <P>To advise the Minister for Justice as to whether or not the applicant is <Col N="802" /> suffering from any mental disorder warranting his continued detention in the public and private interests &mdash; including the question of whether he would be a potential danger to any member of the public if released &mdash; having regard to any relevant information, material or submissions as may be tendered to or come to the notice of the committee, including any information, material or submissions tendered by or on behalf of the applicant.</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that this committee is purely advisory and the ultimate responsibility for the detention of such persons lies with the Minister for Justice in accordance with the provisions of section 2 (2) of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1833, as adapted and lest there be any doubt, new legislation in this area would not affect the circumstances of those currently detained having been found guilty but insane.  They would continue to be dealt with under the terms of the legislation under which they are detained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to immediately take an interest in the serious industrial dispute at Irish Life.  Unless the Minister intervenes a major strike could develop at this former State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 30 staff at Irish Life currently find themselves in the situation where their jobs are being abolished and they are being demoted.  This is not because of anything they have done wrong; in fact, the company has been making record profits over the past number of years.  However, staff in Irish Life have been facing new and pernicious industrial relations regime since the company was privatised.  Before it went on the stock market staff were assured their <Col N="803" /> interests would be protected and commitments were given by Irish Life management and by politicians.</P>
    <P>Staff are now being forced to accept radically different work practices but the Government is disclaiming any interest in the matter.  The Minister for Finance issued a statement on 12 April saying that, even though he holds a golden share in Irish Life, he could not intervene in staff matters.  I accept the bottom line but surely there is a moral obligation on a Government holding a golden share to at least ensure that matters are proceeded with in a civil way.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is interpreting his reponsibilities to Irish Life staff on a very narrow basis.  The golden share was one of the keys to the staff accepting privatisation as they believed it guaranteed their interests would be protected.  By disowning Irish Life staff, the Government has put in jeopardy any hope of workers' support in future privatisations.</P>
    <P>Change is possible, and indeed necessary, in all sorts of companies.  However, change is one thing but if unilateral decisions are taken and there is insufficient consultation, the hope of achieving change disappears.  Both sides in the Irish Life dispute should step back and think about it anew.</P>
    <P>Last week talks involving MSD members at the Labour Relations Commission broke up.  There is now an ultimatum from Irish Life to the effect that if the necessary arrangements are not in place by 1 May, it will go ahead and put them in place anyway.  Irish Life staff have given loyal service and have worked hard for the company but they are now being told unilaterally to accept altered circumstances at work and to submit to them forthwith.</P>
    <P>In a recent Sunday newspaper there was a good précis of the particular executive who has come to take over Irish Life and in so doing has brought many of the methods used in UK privatisations.  In the article she announced rather proudly, charmingly or disarmingly, that she cycles to work <Col N="804" /> each day.  While we would all applaud her healthy view of getting to work, somebody told me that on Fridays she takes the plane back to the UK: talk about Norman Tebbit's phrase &ldquo;On your bike&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Irish Life staff have been treated disgracefully in this instance.  I call on management to treat people in a civil and proper way.  If that is done they will get the results they want.  It is not too much to expect that employers who have given long service should be allowed to have matters sorted out in a democratic and civil way.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Martin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for allowing me to contribute to this debate.  I want to place on record my support for the staff at Irish Life and my sympathy and empathy with their grievance over the manner in which they are being treated by the company's management and chief executive in relation to the implementation of changes and the unilateral downgrading of staff who have given life long service to the company.  Their outstanding contribution to the company's profits has made Irish Life the success it is today. If the company is not careful, staff could be lost thus harming Irish Life's future prospects.</P>
      <P>In Cork, a number of staff are being badly affected by the dispute and by the manner in which management is approaching it.  They are deeply concerned about their own future positions and they are also upset that a company to which they had great loyalty and allegiance is treating them in a shabby manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy O'Rourke's concerns that, whether we like it or not, this has serious implications for future privatisations and the sale of equity or shares in other State firms.  Employees in other State companies will be looking at the experience in Irish Life and will make their own judgments.  What happens in this case will inform their future <Col N="805" /> decisions and the Government should take a keen interest in it.</P>
    <P>I am upset by the manner in which the Government seems to be distancing itself from the plight of Irish Life workers.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, should bring the full force of the Government's moral and political pressure to bear on this.  He should ensure that the spirit of our industrial relations machinery is adhered to.</P>
    <P>When executives from outside our environs come here to manage and operate companies, they should endeavour to fit in and apply themselves to the context of sophisticated industrial relations machinery that we have established over many years.  They should share in the sense of social partnership that has driven our economic performance both in the semi-State and private sectors for so many years.</P>

      <P>The dispute in Irish Life arises as a result of proposals by the company to revise and reorganise the role and responsibilities of certain grades of its existing sales staff.  I do not propose to second guess Deputy O'Rourke's or Deputy Martin's assessment of the dispute.  What has been said about the loyalty and commitment of the staff is true.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for resolving industrial disputes lies primarily with the parties concerned.  In those instances where parties require assistance to help them to resolve their differences, the services of the State's dispute settling agencies &mdash; the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court &mdash; are available to them free of charge.  I do not, therefore, consider it appropriate for me to intervene directly in everyday industrial disputes.  This is not a novel position but is a policy adhered to by my predecessors and is calculated not to undermine the labour relations machinery which has a proven track record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this particular dispute, I understand the Labour Relations <Col N="806" /> Commission, as part of a series of conciliation conferences, recently convened a two day conference with the parties. Unfortunately, it was not possible to reach agreement at that conference.  I understand the parties are currently considering their positions in relation to the dispute.  I join Deputy O'Rourke in urging them to continue to negotiate to try to resolve their differences.  In this regard, the services of the Labour Relations Commission and, if necessary, the Labour Court, continue to remain available to assist them.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to review the Copyright Act, 1963, as a matter of urgency.  I want him to amend the Act to ensure the right of schools to organise their annual concerts with parents in attendance without having to pay a fee to the Irish Music Rights Organisation. This amendment is necessary because of the attempts being made by IMRO to oblige schools to apply for a licence and pay a fee of £94.55 plus VAT.  This figure is arrived at because of the need for IMRO to deal individually with each school board of management in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IMRO has circulated schools with its interpretation of the present legislation and an application form for schools to fill out.  It is argued that any performance by schoolchildren of any copyright music in the presence of any persons other than their teachers or peers constitutes a &ldquo;public performance&rdquo;.  Consequently, if parents or guardians of the children are invited to the school to hear the children perform the songs and music they have learned as a part of their school curriculum, IMRO insists <Col N="807" /> that the school must have taken out a licence.</P>
    <P>Sister Eileen Randles of the Catholic Primary School Managers Association has written to the Department and the officials have been co-operative and sympathetic to the plight in which schools now find themselves.  Sister Eileen argues that having children perform what they have learned in school for their parents or guardians should not be considered a public performance. Such events should be explicitly excluded from the revised legislation.  I support this view and ask the Minister to give it legislative effect.  The CPSMA has studied the UK Copyright Designs and Patents Act, 1988, and has made a number of proposals to the Department. These suggestions are sensible and should be incorporated in any new Irish copyright law.</P>
    <P>In particular, the concept of parents being regarded as an integral part of the school community should be enshrined in such law.  The White Paper on Education recognises in the strongest possible terms the role of parents in the education process.  The Minister for Education will give an explicit statutory basis to the role of parents in education in the forthcoming education Bill &mdash; a move which will have all-party support. Further amendments have been suggested by the CPSMA which should meet with the Minister's approval.</P>
    <P>Primary schools are hard pressed by inadequte funding and can do without such an additional financial burden. Such costs would be prohibitive and would act as a disincentive to the promotion of music in our schools. We should all do our utmost, IMRO included, to ensure music is given every encouragement in our schools.  Obstacles should not be put in the way of the pursuit of this noble objective.  Irish copyright law should be seen to positively promote music in schools.</P>
    <P>It is a special event in the life of a young child to perform for the first time in a school concert for his or her parents <Col N="808" /> or guardians.  It is a valuable educational experience for the child, helping to develop self-confidence, discipline, teamwork and co-operation.  It is also a joyful experience for parents.  Why interfere by trying to put a price on it? It is a sad reflection on society that a child singing in a school concert is to be subject to a licence fee.  I am reminded of W. B. Yeats's famous lines from &ldquo;September 1913&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>What need you being come to sense</P>
    <P>But fumble in a greasy till and</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Martin for raising this matter.  I support his arguments. In my nine years as a TD I cannot think of any measure which has angered me more than IMRO's decision to extract royalty payments from primary school children and their parents.  It is as naked a display of greed as I have ever seen.  I appeal to IMRO to consider carefully the long-term effects of its proposal.  The pupils of today are the audiences of tomorrow.  If we decimate the audiences of tomorrow, the artistes whose welfare IMRO purports to protect will be the first to suffer.</P>
      <P>As we live in challenging times, we ought to encourage more creativity, music and arts in schools.  We should not take mean-minded measures such as this.  I ask the Minister of State to use his influence to get IMRO to use common sense, decency and good judgment and to give an exemption to schools.  If it will not do so, I ask the Minister of State to amend the legislation to require IMRO to do the decent thing.  This measure will have to be stopped.</P>

      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the relevant section covering the use of copyright material for education <Col N="809" /> purposes is section 53 of the 1963 Copyright Act.  It states:</P>
      <P>53.  &mdash;(1)  Where copyright subsists in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, the copyright shall not be taken to be infringed by reason only that the work is reproduced, or an adaptation of the work is made or reproduced&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the course of instruction, whether at a school or elsewhere, where the reproduction or adaptation is made by a teacher or pupil, otherwise than by the use of a duplicating process, or</P>
      <P>(b)  as part of the questions to be answered in an examination, or in an answer to such a question.</P>
      <P>(2)  Nothing in the preceding subsection of this section shall apply to the publication of a work; and, for the purposes of section 11 of this Act, the fact that to a person's knowledge the making of an article would have constituted an infringement of copyright but for the preceding subsection of this section shall have the like effect as if, to his knowledge, the making of it had constituted such an infringement.</P>
      <P>(3)  For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that, where a literary, dramatic or musical work&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is performed in class, or otherwise in the presence of an audience, and</P>
      <P>(b)  is so performed in the course of the activities of a school, by a person who is a teacher in, or a pupil in attendance at, the school,</P>
      <P>the performance shall not be taken for the purposes of this Act to be a performance in public if the audience is limited to persons who are teachers in, or pupils in attendance at, the school, or are otherwise directly connected with the activities of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> (4)  For the purposes of the last preceding subsection of this section a person shall not be taken to be directly connected with the activities of the school by reason only that he is a parent or guardian of a pupil in attendance at the school.</P>
    <P>From reading even this extract from the relevant section the Deputy will appreciate that the whole area of copyright law is complex.  For this reason in 1993 my predecessor initiated a comprehensive review of Irish copyright law and to this end he established in the Department the intellectual property unit, whose function it was to conduct the review and propose suitable amendments to Irish copyright law, bearing in mind our EU and internationl obligations.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Martin has acknowledged, the House is aware from answers to a number of queries on this subject that my Department afforded interested parties an opportunity to make written submissions on the issue of copyright law and met with most of these parties to afford them the opportunity to add orally to the written submissions they had made.  The Deputy will be pleased to know that the Department has now commenced the onerous task of preparing draft heads of legislation on this subject. I have also met IMRO and indicated to its representatives my general support for what it has set out to do, that is, to act on behalf of the creative community and collect the rewards to which artistes are entitled in respect of commercial success of their work.</P>
    <P>In the context of the review the Department also received representations from the Department of Education and the Catholic Primary Managers Association on the subject of the use of music for educational purposes and both bodies have suggested a change to the law along the lines proposed tonight.  The arguments put forward mirror exactly the points raised by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Department has also received representations from the Irish Music <Col N="811" /> Rights' Organisation on this question. IMRO has argued that the authors of copyright works should not be the ones to indirectly fund the education system. Do the artistes on whose behalf IMRO collects agree with the hard line in relation to their property rights?  IMRO has also argued that Ireland's international obligations in the copyright field under Articles 9 and 10 of the Berne Convention do not allow Ireland to introduce any amendment to our legislation which would conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.</P>
    <P>I accept the legal position; however, I also have to ask as a citizen if IMRO is serious in what it is reportedly attempting.  If it is serious, one wonders what members of the creative community who have given their allegience to IMRO think.  I ask the likes of Bono, the Cranberries and the Chieftains if they ever intended, when IMRO was set up and they gave it their backing, that the organisation would hit our primary schools in the manner reported.  Do they approve of schools, the children and their parents being faced with this demand in relation to the use of their music in school concerts, minor fund raising events, children's discos and the like?</P>
    <P>There is another side to the issue. This Government and its predecessor have pursued a policy that very much favours, supports and encourages the creative community in Ireland.  We have a Department of Arts, Culture and the <Col N="812" /> Gaeltacht with the Minister of full Cabinet rank.  We have a policy of grant aiding and supporting by means of tax relief the work of this creative community. For example, this year the music industry has been given its own version of BES tax relief.  No one objects to artistes achieving their just rewards and the fruits of success but, as Deputy Quill said, that should not mean common sense going out the window.</P>
    <P>Given our existing international commitments in the copyright arena, in particular Articles 9 and 10 of the Berne Convention, I do not believe the law offers great possibilities for achieving a practical and equitable solution to this problem.  However, I believe that, given good will on both sides, a negotiated solution to this problem is feasible and I strongly urge the parties to redouble their efforts in this respect.  It is undoubtedly true that international law and national law in all countries that are a party to the Berne Convention give the authors exclusive rights over all public performances and a remuneration right.  Although we cannot change that, we cannot believe it is really their intent to demand payment of fees for such performances in schools.  I ask the owners of rights in Ireland to ensure that a civilised solution is arrived at which recognises the special position of schools.</P>
    <P>As has been requested, I will take this matter up with IMRO because it would be incredible if its undeniable legal rights were exercised in an unreasonable way in relation to schools.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 24 April 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <Col N="600" /> Deputy will be aware that on 12 April this year, Carlisle Crown Court fined British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., £25,000 plus costs for serious and significant safety failures.  This court case related to an incident at the Sellafield complex on 27 June 1994 when a contract worker carrying out maintance work on a ventilation duct became contaminated with plutonium-239.  The does received by the worker did not exceed the statutory dose limit.  However, he was sent home in his contaminated clothes.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant UK nuclear incident procedures, the operators, British Nuclear Fuels, notified the relevant regulatory authorities.  In accordance with existing bilateral reporting arrangements, my Department was, accordingly, notified of the incident by the UK Department of the Environment.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was immediately contacted to assess the radiological and health implications of the incident for Ireland, if any.</P>
      <P>Based on the information received, the RPII advised me that the incident had no radiological or health implications for Ireland and there was no abnormal release of radioactivity in the external environment.  I should add that the incident was formally rated as a level one on the international nuclear events scale (INES), i.e., an anomaly.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting in my office with the British Ambassador, Ms Veronica Sutherland, I expressed my grave concern about the number of incidents which had occurred in the recent past at Sellafield and other aspects of the British nuclear industry including in particular the ongoing pollution of the Irish Sea which is unacceptable; the NIREX proposals for an underground nuclear dump near the Sellafield complex; the continued existence of Magnox reactors which are past their sell-by date and ought to be decommissioned; and my concerns about the safety implications of privatising the British Nuclear Industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stressed that the Government was <Col N="601" /> firmly opposed to any expansion of the nuclear industry in Britain and in that context I repeated my welcome for the recent decision not to proceed with the commissioning of two new nuclear reactors. I sincerely hope that that decision signifies the beginning of the end of the nuclear industry in Britain.  I am realistic enough to know that the nuclear industry will not close down overnight.  It plays a significant role in Britain in terms of power generation and employment.</P>
    <P>However, the time is now ripe for the British authorities to turn their attention to developing an energy strategy for the future that excludes nuclear power.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have arranged to have the matter raised at the next meeting of the Ireland-UK contact meeting on nuclear safety matters.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the United Kingdom's Health and Safety Executive proceeded with this recent prosecution. The penalty imposed and the publicity associated with the case exposes the UK nuclear industry to further public scrutiny. This can only strengthen the hand of the Irish Government in pressurising the UK authorities on nuclear safety generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the years 1990 to 1995 the number of prospecting licences issued under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940-1995, for various minerals (excluding oil and gas) and in force on 31 December was <Col N="602" /> as follows: 1990, 425; 1991, 364; 1992, 326; 1993, 313; 1994, 380; 1995, 251.</P>
      <P>At present there are 421 licences in force.</P>
      <P>Details of the minerals covered by all prospecting licences in force are contained in the statutory twice yearly reports which were presented to Dáil and Seanad Éireann under the Acts and which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The purpose of a prospecting licence is to allow the licensee and the Minister evaluate the mineral potential within the licence area.  In order to obtain a licence the applicant has to submit an acceptable technical work programme and show me that he has both the technical and financial ability to carry it through.  It is also necessary for the applicant to have adequate public liability insurance cover.  The licence conditions require that the licensee adhere to the strict and detailed guidelines which cover the prospecting industry.</P>
      <P>The guidelines for good environmental practice in mineral exploration are contained in a comprehensive document issued by my Department and I have arranged for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.  In summary it follows the general principles that</P>
      <P>environmentally responsible management should be an integral part of all exploration programmes;</P>
      <P>those involved should make themselves aware of any ecological or cultural areas of interest within the prospecting licence area;</P>
      <P>there be compliance with all relevant laws and regulations covering the environment;</P>
      <P>best contemporary practice be applied where this is more rigorous in its protection of the environment than is required by law;</P>
      <P>environmental consequences of each activity be considered and planned for;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>every effort be made to avoid pollution <Col N="603" /> during exploration;</P>
    <P>the licensee take responsibility for ensuring that sub-contractors are aware of the guidelines and laws and regulations relating to the environment;</P>
    <P>there be full consideration of and close liaison with landowners and regulatory authorities and</P>
    <P>damage which may occur be minimised and corrected without undue delay.</P>
    <P>The environmental guidelines are reviewed and revised as appropriate. Revisions are carried out to take account of amendments in legislation or advances in good environmental practice and the most recent revision took place in September 1995.</P>
    <P>I should also add that the standard prospecting licence issued by my Department contains a condition which requires the licensee to avoid damage to the environment and amenities and places all rights granted under the licence subject to the relevant requirements of such law as may be applicable in relation to planning and development, control of water pollution, Wildlife Act, National Monuments Acts, etc.</P>

      <P>The Government, however, expects the boards of all commercial State bodies to constantly review their cost base with a view to ensuring maximum efficiency and competitiveness.  Employment levels are an integral part of a company's cost base and it is, in the first instance, a matter for boards to consider the need for rationalisation programmes within their organisations.  In many State bodies such programmes are essential in order to successfully meet the challenges of competition and market liberalisation.</P>

      <Col N="605" /> Under the Joint INTERREG Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland, 1994-99 telecommunications investments planned for the Donegal area include the replacement and upgrading of telephone exchanges and the provision of fibre optic cabling and high speed transmission systems.  At the end of the investment period Donegal will have a digital telecommunications network.  There will also be a significant upgrading of the electricity infrastructure in Donegal.  This upgrading will include the provision of a 110kV station at Buncrana at an estimated cost of £3.6 million.  On the transport side the existing bus station in Letterkenny is to be upgraded at a cost of £120,000.</P>

      <P>Quantitative restrictions on the number of road freight operator licences were removed with the enactment of the Road Transport Act, 1986.  The present position is that persons or firms who satisfy qualitative criteria in relation to financial standing, good repute and professional competance can qualify for a national or international road freight carrier's licence.  Access to the profession of road passenger transport operator is achieved by satisfying similar qualitative criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU Council-Regulation 881/92, access to the market in international haulage within the European Union is available to Irish operators in possession of an international road freight carrier's licence.  Cabotage, that is the freedom for Irish operators to pick up and drop freight for hire or reward with another member state, is being progressively liberalised pursuant to EU Council Regulation 3118/93.  Full <Col N="606" /> liberalisation of freight cabotage is scheduled for 1 July 1998.</P>
    <P>The provisions of passenger road transport services, apart from services provided by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath, is governed by the Road Transport Act, 1932.  There are a number of difficulties associated with the implementation of this legislation and there is a general consensus that it is in need of updating.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review is under way and consultations with all major interests in the passenger road transport sector, which began last year, is almost complete.  It would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt the outcome of this process by speculating on possible proposals for the reform of the sector which may emerge.</P>
    <P>At present passenger cabotage, in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2454/92, is permitted for all services except ordinary scheduled services. The Commission has recently tabled its proposals for the future liberalisation of services including inter-city services.  I am giving the most careful consideration to the possible impact of the Commission's proposals on the overall Irish road passenger market.</P>

      <P>As I said in response to Questions Nos. 25, 48, 53 and 111 on 31 January 1996, I considered very carefully the proposal for adopting Baldonnel military aerodrome as a second commercial airport for Dublin. The conclusion I reached, having consulted my Cabinet colleagues, was <Col N="607" /> that the project would not be in the interests of the aviation sector and the economy generally.</P>
      <P>I made an extensive public statement on this issue on 24 January 1996 and I have arranged for a copy of that statement to be placed in the Dáil Library for the convenience of Deputies.  In summary.  I pointed out that Dublin airport has the capacity to cater for traffic growth for the foreseeable future; independent studies have shown that Aer Rianta's cost base is not excessive and that its landing charges are competitive; and two airports for Dublin would duplicate infrastructure and facilities leading to increased costs as economies of scale would be lost.  Airlines would be reluctant to transfer to a secondary location because of the loss of hubbing opportunities and integrated services that such a move would entail.  The coming on stream of the Baldonnel proposal would coincide with the planned abolition of the intra-EC duty free sales from 1999 which will have adverse implications for all airports and airlines. In other words, the economics of Baldonnel would be problematic at the outset.</P>
      <P>A commercial airport at Baldonnel would impact not only on Dublin airport but on the catchment areas of Galway, Shannon, Cork and Waterford airports putting further pressure on some of these airports to survive or grow.</P>
      <P>The Baldonnel project would not come on stream until the end of the century; in the meantime the Dublin airport development programme cannot be put on hold.  It would make no sense to enhance capacity at Dublin Airport and at the same time provide capacity at another location.</P>
      <P>Baldonnel aerodrome will continue to be used by the Air Corps.  The Department of Defence is looking at the possible use of the facilities at Baldonnel for private executive air travel.</P>
      <P>In view of the foregoing, I do not envisage giving the question of Baldonnel as a second commercial airport for Dublin any further consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply to a question by Deputy O'Malley on 31 January last on US-Ireland access issues, I outlined the relevant details of the air transport access provisions of the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement.  There have been no changes to this agreement in the interim period.</P>
      <P>I have not yet received the final report of the steering group looking at Ireland-US access issues.  In my reply to the Deputy on 5 March last, I indicated that a preliminary report had been received from Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte and that this was under review having regard to the announcement by Aer Lingus and Delta of their new code-sharing proposal and by World Airways of its new scheduled services to Ireland commencing in June 1996 and its code-sharing arrangement with Continental Airlines.  I am pleased to advise that the Aer Lingus-Delta and the World-Continental arrangement were approved recently by the US Department of Transportation.  These positive developments along with the new Aer Lingus service from Chicago will result in a substantial increase in capacity on US-Ireland routes this year.  This is likely to be in the order of 16-17 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte have had detailed discussions with both Aer Lingus and Delta about their future plans.  This information together with the inauguration by World-Continental of new weekly services from the US West Coast i.e. Los Angeles as well as from Newark, is now being taken on board in the completion of the report which will, <i>inter alia,</i> outline prospects for increasing existing services and for delivering new services from new points in 1997 and 1998 in particular.  Follow up action either by State agencies or by my Department will be decided once the recommendations and prospects have been examined.  I have no plans to publish the report which may well contain <Col N="611" /> confidential and sensitive marketing information.</P>
    <P>However, I hope to be in a position to advise on the broad recommendations subject to any commercial sensitivities that might be involved.  I should, however, like to advise that having regard to the fluid nature of the aviation world, the situation must remain under ongoing review.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific question of improved access to the west of Ireland from the US, I should point out that under existing policy on transatlantic scheduled services enshrined in the bilateral arrangements, there are no restrictions on US airlines operating services either scheduled or charter, from any point in the US to Shannon.  In addition, US airlines may operate any number of direct non-stop charter services from any point in the US to Knock International Airport.  Similarly Irish airlines can operate an unlimited number of charter services to Shannon and Knock from any US point and unlimited scheduled services to Shannon from four US points, i.e. New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if an Irish or US airline wishes to operate services to-from Dublin then an equivalent US service must be operated to-from Shannon.  This policy has clear benefits for the west of Ireland in that it ensures that any growth in US-Ireland air services will lead to growth in services to Shannon. Of course, the question of whether any airline inaugurates a particular service is purely a commercial decision for that airline.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 34 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1995, I announced the results of the alternative energy requirement scheme, the Government's first major alternative energy support initiative. Under this scheme contracts were awarded to independent producers for the generation and sale of 89MW of electricity, to be produced from renewables, and a further 22 MW from combined heat and power systems.  Ten wind energy projects were awarded contracts with a combined total of 73MW and these projects are currently at various stages of the planning process.</P>
      <P>Arising from the AER1, and conscious of the need to develop a long-term renewable energy strategy, I initiated an indepth review of renewable energy policy.  I am happy to confirm that this process is now complete and that Government approval for the broad policy parameters has been secured.</P>
      <P>My strategy statement arising from the review is currently being finalised and I will announce full details on Friday, 26 April.  I will also furnish copies of my statement to the Oireachtas Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the American Express air fare index which was launched in June 1995 and which is published on a quarterly basis.</P>
      <P>I would like first to inform the Deputy of the regulatory position in relation to control of air fares which is as follows: under the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2409/92 which came into effect on 1 January 1993, air carriers licensed in the European Economic Area are free to set air fares and the conditions under which these fares apply in respect of carriage within the EEA in accordance with their own commercial judgment, subject to certain safeguards.  As Community air carriers and those from Norway and Iceland which make up the EEA are no longer required to obtain Government approval for air fares in respect of carriage within the EEA, I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>Fares on services between Ireland and non-EEA countries are governed by individual bilateral air agreements. By and large, as in the case of the USA, these include liberal provisions in relation to air fares.  This would mean that only in very exceptional circumstances would the respective aviation authorities intervene in relation to fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, however, examined the latest published American Express Index and the accompanying press release which compares increases on five to six published air fares from 51 major cities in western Europe on a quarterly basis.  On the basis of this examination, I believe that the reference in the press release and subsequently in the media coverage to price increases on all Ireland-European air services is misleading.  Overall the index shows that Ireland compares very favourably with other European countries, whether comparing simple <Col N="614" /> average or weighted average increases for major European points.</P>
    <P>In respect of Ireland, the index compares five fare types on the following eight routes &mdash; Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Manchester, Paris, Rome and New York.</P>
    <P>The year on year changes on fares i.e. Quarter 1 1995 v Quarter 1 1996 for the 40 fares i.e. five fares for each of the eight routes are as follows: decreases ranging from &mdash; 19 per cent to 4 per cent on seven fares on four routes; no change on 18 fares on six routes; increases of 2 per cent on five fares on 2 routes; increases of 3 per cent on three fares on one route; an increase of 4 per cent on one fare on one route; an increase of 5 per cent on two fares on one route; an increase of 11 per cent on one fare on one route; an increase of 15 per cent on one fare on one route and an increase of 20 per cent on two fares on one route.</P>
    <P>The latter two increases which are credited as taking place on leisure fares to Rome are disputed by Aer Lingus, which advise that there was no change on one fare while the other increased by 18 per cent as the result of the ending of a special promotional fare, and the fare returning to the pre-promotional level.  In the case of the 11 per cent increase, this relates to the business class fare on the New York route.</P>
    <P>Overall, in relation to Irish fares it is clear that where increases have taken place, that the bulk are generally either below or in line with inflation trends.  I am particularly pleased to note that the trend on leisure fares is largely one of fare reductions or no change.</P>
    <P>I should also point out in relation to fare comparisons that it is important to look at trends over time as timing of price increases, special offers etc, may give rise to a misleading impression at a particular time.</P>

      <P>The possibility of a review and update of this treaty to place greater emphasis on health, safety and environmental aspects has been raised by Ireland in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference which is considering amendments to the treaties of the Union.</P>
      <P>The Euratom Treaty was drawn up nearly 40 years ago and much has changed since then.  The health and safety provisions of Euratom, including Article 34, which deals with &ldquo;dangerous experiments&rdquo;, are relatively weak, not surprisingly given the apparent lack of appreciation in the 1950s of the dangers of ionising radiation and the lack of emphasis on environmental issues in general.  The possibility of a strengthening of the nuclear safety provisions of Euratom is of particular relevance in the light of the further enlargement of the EU.</P>
      <P>Any amendment to the Euratom Treaty would require the unanimous agreement of all member states.  This unanimity would be difficult to achieve given the opposition of certain member states to any review of Euratom and the lack of enthusiasm for revision.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the obvious institutional and substantive difficulties facing us in seeking to have the Euratom Treaty amended, the Government is considering how to address the desirability of enhancing the health and safety provisions of the Euratom Treaty in the context of our EU Presidency.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a report to the European Parliament on 16 October 1995 on the findings of the Commission's fact finding mission to French Polynesia.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Commission's visit was to verify the operation and efficiency of the environmental monitoring facilities installed by the French authorities during the nuclear tests carried out last year in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The team leader of the visit, Mr. Janssens of Directorate-General IX of the Commission which is responsible for Environment, Nuclear Safety and Civil Protection, was questioned by a number of MEPs on various aspects of his report including a question on whether any comparisons existed between the effects of the Mururoa tests and radioactive discharges from nuclear energy plants such as Sellafield and THORP or the Chernobyl accident.  In stating that the <Col N="617" /> overall exposure of the Polynesian population is lower than in most countries in Europe and France particularly, unintended confusion was caused about the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>In fact, Mr. Janssen made no specific reference to radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea.  This misunderstanding was referred to again in the Parliament in November 1995 when Commissioner de Silguy said that he regretted that the statement of the Commission in October had been misinterpreted and that there is no danger to the inhabitants of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland monitors the levels of radioactivity in Irish waters.  In relation to the Irish Sea, the monitoring programme involves the routine sampling and analysis of seawater, seaweeds, sediments, from the Irish Sea coastline and fish and shellfish from landings at the east coast fishing ports.  Samples of seawater and sediments are also collected from areas of the Irish Sea from south of Dublin extending to the north of Dundalk Bay.</P>
    <P>The results of the RPII's monitoring programme provide reassurance that there is no significant risk to the health of the Irish public as a consequence of the Sellafield discharges.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, contamination of the Irish Sea by discharges from the British nuclear industry, however minimal, is objectionable and unacceptable and I consider that all radioactive discharges should be progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated at the earliest possible date.  The Paris Convention on discharges from land based sources places an obligation on member states to prevent pollution of the seas.</P>

      <P>With regard to the issue of privatisation, I refer the Deputy to section 21 of the Government's programme for renewal which clearly states that State assets will not be sold except where it protects employment and is in the long-term strategic interest of the company and its shareholders.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 40 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been intensely involved in efforts to bring about an end to the current violence in Lebanon and northern Israel and to ensure the safety <Col N="620" /> of the Irish UNIFIL battalion.  This involvement stems, on the one hand, from our participation in the EU Troika and, on the other, from our role as a UNIFIL troop contributor.  We have been in constant contact with the Irish UNIFIL contingent and have been closely monitoring the situation in south Lebanon.  We have also monitored and contributed to diplomatic initiatives which have aimed to end the current crisis.  We made national statements on 13 and 18 April and a statement to the UN Security Council on 20 April.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been centrally engaged in the EU Troika in efforts to end the crisis.  Over the past ten days a senior official in the Department of Foreign Affairs responsible for the Middle East has participated in a series of urgent Troika missions in Beirut, Damascus, Amman, Cairo and Tel Aviv.</P>
    <P>The attack on the UNIFIL position at Qana, south Lebanon, was strongly condemned by the Taoiseach and in a statement issued by me on Thursday 18 April.  An EU statement expressed shock and consternation at the attack and called for the violence to cease. Also following the Qana attack, a reinforced EU Troika mission, headed by Italian Foreign Minister Agnelli, met with a number of key parties to the conflict last weekend including Israeli Prime Minister Peres and Foreign Minister Barak, Lebanese President Haroui and Prime Minister Hariri, and President Assad of Syria.  The Troika also visited wounded Lebanese civilians in two hospitals to express the EU's sympathy.</P>
    <P>Throughout the past two weeks since the intensification of the violence, Ireland has been involved in discussions on the situation at the UN.  We have ensured that priority is given to the safety of civilians and the UNIFIL contingent in all such discussions, as well as in the text of the Security Council resolution on the subject.  Ireland's permanent representative at the UN addressed the Security Council on 18 April, expressing the Government's strong condemnation of the attack on <Col N="621" /> the UNIFIL post at Qana and our deep concern at the deterioration in the situation in the Middle East, with the consequent strains on the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Government has also been involved in bilateral contacts with parties to the dispute.  On my instructions, the Israeli Ambassador was summoned to the Department on Tuesday, April 16 so that the Government's concerns could be made clear to his authorities. In that discussion, officials made clear our serious reservations about the proportionality of Israel's response to Hizbollah attacks.  In particular, concerns were expressed for the safety of Lebanese civilians and UNIFIL personnel, and about attacks on Lebanese infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Israeli Ambassador was called in again on Friday, 19 April to express the Government's condemnation of the Qana attack and to reiterate once more our very grave concerns about attacks on Lebanese civilians and infrastructure, as well as the great importance we attach to the safety of UNIFIL.  The Ambassador was told of the Government's clear view that the shelling should stop immediately.</P>
    <P>I might mention that in the light of the Government's concern about the growing humanitarian crisis, I have allocated £200,000 emergency aid for Lebanon. This will be distributed through a number of channels including the International Channel of the Red Cross, UN agencies and our UNIFIL battalion.</P>

Statutory Instruments No. 459 of 1994 and No. 379 of 1995 give effect in Ireland to Directives 91/321/EC and 93/102/EC respectively.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been aware for some time of the widespread concern about the level of financial supports available to foster parents.  This problem is being addressed in the context of the resources made available for the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991.  A significant proportion of the additional £35 million provided for this purpose to health boards in the years 1993 to 1996 has been used by boards to develop all aspects of their fostering services.  As part of this process, I decided to increase, from 1 March last, the foster care allowance to £60 per child per week in respect of children age 12 years and over.  This initiative, which involves additional funding in the region of £1 million per year, is supplementary to the normal annual increases in fostering allowances granted in line with social welfare rates.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that improvements are also required in relation to the level of allowance for foster children under 12 years of age.  I consider the recent increase as a first phase in the provision of improved financial supports to foster parents.  Subject to availability of resources I intend to continue to improve the level of allowances next year.  Health boards may pay higher rates of allowances in particular foster cases here, for example, a child has a disability or has other special needs. Boards also make a range of additional payments to cover items such as clothing, school and medical items.</P>

      <P>My Department is examining the extensive comments received on the draft consultation guidelines with a view to issuing guidelines in final form as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As to the question of emissions, the draft consultation guidelines provide that applicants for planning permission should be required to furnish evidence that the proposed installations comply with the guidelines of the International Radiological Protection Association, or other internationally accepted standards, in order to ensure the use of best international practice.  There have been a number of submissions on this issue including the question of a power density limitation, and these are being considered.</P>

      <P>Courts fines under the Litter Act, 1982, do not accrue to local authorities and information on them is not available on the basis of local authority areas.  Amounts collected by local authorities in on-the-spot fines have generally been quite small.  The largest amounts collected in 1994, the latest year for which details are complete, <Col N="633" /> were: South Dublin County Council, £2,575; Galway Corporation, £1,700; Dublin Corporation, £1,325; and Fingal County Council, £1,150.</P>

      <P>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which has been ratified jointly by the EU and its member states, calls on developed countries, <i>inter alia,</i> to aim to return, individually or jointly, greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels.  In accordance with this joint commitment, the EU objective is to stabilise emissions of CO2, the main greenhouse gas, at their 1990 levels by the year 2000.  As part of this policy, it is recognised that emissions in some member states will increase in line with their economic and social development requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, as its contribution to the achievement of the EU objective, is committed to limiting the growth in CO2 emissions in the year 2000 to 20 per cent over their 1990 levels.  CO2 emissions in 1994 were 6.8 per cent higher than in 1990.  National policies and measures to contribute to the mitigation of climate <Col N="639" /> change have been set out in the national CO2 abatement strategy, 1993, and the national communication under the framework convention on climate change, 1994.  These address a number of areas including energy, transport, forestry and waste management.  The intensification of existing policies and measures, as well as the development of new ones, is being considered in the context of current negotiations to strengthen convention commitments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 74, 76, 78 and 79 together.  Last week, I approved Mayo County Council's proposals for the augmentation of the Westport water supply at an estimated cost of £2.25 million.  Construction is expected to commence later this year and the project will, on commissioning, provide an additional 400,000 gallons of treated water daily. The scheme is also designed to facilitate the delivery of a further 600,000 gallons per day to Westport to meet anticipated future demand.</P>
      <P>Water conservation measures are an integral part of water supply projects funded under my Department's water services programme and no specific sum has been set aside for this purpose. However, in the context of proposed new water supply improvement schemes at a number of cities and large towns, major conservation programmes are under way in Dublin, Galway, Waterford and Wexford; expenditure on these in 1996 is estimated at over £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mayo County Council recently submitted an integrated proposal for water conservation and network renewal for Westport, comprising leak detection and district metering costing £112,000; new distribution mains costing £236,000; and watermain replacement costing £181,000.  I recently approved a grant of <Col N="642" /> £120,000 in respect of the water conservation element which is intended to reduce water losses by up to 70,000 gallons per day.</P>
    <P>The planning and design of water schemes is a matter, in the first instance, for individual sanitary authorities.  The detailed information requested with regard to current and projected water usage in the Westport area is not readily available in my Department and could more appropriately be sought from the relevant local authorities, in this case Mayo County Council and Westport Urban District Council.</P>
    <P>The economic assessment referred to in the reply to Question No. 157 of 2 April, 1996 was contained in a report <i>An Economic Appraisal of Environmental Projects supported by the EU Cohesion Fund</i> prepared by Fehily Timoney Weston in association with DKM Economic Consultants.  Extracts from the report, in so far as it relates to the Westport project, will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>To date, no water supply schemes have been turned down by the European Commission for Cohesion Funding.  The main objective for environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund is to support compliance with EU environmental legislation, in particular, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.  The emphasis, therefore, placed by the Commission <Col N="643" /> has been mainly on waste water and water quality projects, rather than water supply projects.  My Department seeks to meet the demand for these latter projects within the overall allocation for the water and sewerage programme.</P>

Priority is given to projects in the areas of community-based youth work initiatives, young homeless people, young substance abusers and young travellers.  Grants are allocated to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the development needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to a range of socio-economic factors.  In 1995, a total of £6,032 million was made available through vocational education committees and voluntary organisations under the <i>Grant Scheme for Special Projects to assist Disadvantaged Youth.</i></P>

      <P>As outlined in the Education White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> the primary objective of the junior cycle is for students to complete a broad balanced and coherent course of study in a variety of curricular areas relevant to their own personal development and to allow them to achieve a level of competence in these which will enable them to proceed to senior cycle education.</P>
      <P>The White Paper also indicates that the curricular framework at junior cycle has as one of its objectives that all students in accordance with their abilities and aptitudes will have experienced or achieved &ldquo;a knowledge and appreciation of their social, cultural and physical heritage and environment&rdquo;.  The White Paper states that the programme for all pupils at junior cycle will include a core of Irish, English, Mathematics, a science or technological subject and at least three further subjects from a wide range of full and short courses.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary to look at the current curriculum provision as outlined in rules and programmes for secondary schools and realign in accordance with the objectives of the White Paper.

      <P>It is my policy that proper provision be made for the Irish language in all schools.  All arrangements for the Irish language sector are made in this context.  The White Paper, <i>Charting Our Education Future,</i> proposes the establishment of ten regional education boards.  Drafting of the necessary legislation has already started.</P>
      <P>The Government has a definite and positive policy towards the Irish language. Education boards will be obliged to implement this policy.  I would be concerned that the establishment of a separate board for the Irish language sector would diminish the status of the language and reduce the emphasis placed on the Irish language by the other boards. For this reason, I do not propose to establish a separate board for the Irish language sector.  I am, however, confident that the education boards will be fully competent to implement the Government's policy towards the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper indicates that each board must provide for the systematic planning and coordination of the provision of education in its area; provide a range of support services to the schools; ensure the empowerment and participation of local communities in the education system; and provide fully in the educational system for the diversity <Col N="650" /> which exists in the community, including the Gaeltacht community and the community of all-Irish schools.</P>
    <P>Education boards will have the following advantages when dealing with the Irish language.  They will be located close to the schools and to the communities which they will serve and each board will be empowered to establish committees and/or specialist groups to advise and assist, as appropriate, in the implementation of policy.  It is clear, therefore, that the education boards will be empowered to service the Irish language sector.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently having discussions with the interested parties in order to explore the ways in which the specific needs of the Irish language sector can be met in the context of the education boards.</P>

      <P>My Department has for many years made special arrangements in the certificate examinations for candidates who would have difficulty in communicating what they know to an examiner because of a physical disability, including visual and hearing impairments, or a specific learning difficulty. The special arrangements are intended <Col N="652" /> to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment. They are also intended to ensure that, whilst giving candidates every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment, the special arrangements will not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements are not in general approved in the case of pupils who are assessed as being slow learners or as being mentally handicapped where the learning difficulties of such pupils arise solely from their level of general intellectual ability and are not due to specific difficulties in reading or in writing. Applications for special examination arrangements in respect of students with Down's Syndrome are considered on their merits and within the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the meaning of the statement, clawback rule abolished for carers who get rent-mortgage supplement, from the Social Welfare fact sheet dated 23 January 1996; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the supplementary <Col N="666" /> welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to eligible people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution <Col N="667" /> which clients are required to pay from their own resources.  In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
    <P>Carer's allowance is a means-tested scheme for people who are looking after elderly or incapacitated people who require full time care and attention.  The weekly rate of carer's allowance is £62.50.  The clawback mentioned in the question comes into effect in a case where a person who was formerly an adult dependant on a spouse-partner's payment, is awarded the carer's allowance in their own right.  The personal rate of carer's allowance is £25 higher than the adult dependant rate.  This additional £25 is currently counted as means when the rent or mortgage interest supplement is being calculated and the supplement is reduced accordingly. As a result, the carer, who is an adult dependant, is financially no better off as a result of being awarded the higher rate of carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>As the carer's allowance was intended to reward carer's in the home for the work they perform, I have decided to abolish the clawback of the additional income from carer's allowance when assessing carer's for rent and mortgage interest supplements.  To achieve this, it is necessary to amend the regulations governing the SWA scheme under which supplements are paid.  I intend to make the necessary regulations in June.</P>

      <P>I understand that all of the application forms and maps in respect of farmers in County Donegal, who submitted an area aid form accompanied by the required maps in 1994 or 1995, have been issued.  These application forms should be completed and returned to reach the area aid unit, with maps if amendments are being made or new land is being declared, on or before 15 May 1996.  I obtained Commission agreement today for an extension of the deadline to that date from the original proposed cut off date of 30 April.</P>
      <P>If, however, a farmer has not received his-her area aid application form he-she should obtain a blank 1996 area aid application from the local Teagasc or district livestock office, complete it, and submit it to reach the area aid unit on or before the new closing date.  If a farmer has not received his/her maps or is experiencing difficulties with completing the maps, then the farmer should ensure that the area aid application is submitted before the closing date and maps if required should be forwarded as soon as possible thereafter.  The maps record the mapping details previously submitted by the farmer and have, therefore, only issued to farmers who submitted a map with an earlier year's application.</P>

      <P>There have been no changes in the EU regulations governing the deseasonalisation premium as they effect this year's payments. However, under the 1995-1996 price proposals the EU Commission is proposing that the trigger level be reduced to 38 per cent and be based on total steer slaughterings on the island of Ireland.  In addition, the Commission is proposing that when the trigger is not reached member states will have the option of maintaining the premium at 60 per cent of the current rate, to be financed by a reduction in the second tranche of the special beef premium.</P>

      <P>The cost of the voluntary severance package under the cost and competitiveness review (CCR) is estimated by ESB to be around £210 million in present money terms.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the CCR is estimated by ESB to be around £260 million over the period 1996 to 1999.</P>
      <P>The package will be self-financing to the extent that the savings over the same period are expected to be around £250 million.</P>
      <P>From the year 2000 onwards the annual gross savings are projected by ESB at £85 million but some of this will be offset by ongoing annual costs of about £27 million leaving the annual net savings under the cost and competitiveness review at about £58 million per annum.</P>

      <P>In March 1995, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications Deputy Emmet Stagg, instructed the Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC) to reinstate the Whiddy Island Oil Terminal by the installation of a single point mooring for the discharge and loading of crude oil.</P>
      <P>Work on the project has been completed within the last month and I expect that the terminal will shortly be in a position to resume operations.</P>
      <P>The provision of the single point mooring will allow full access to the 205,000 tonnes of strategic crude oil stocks currently held there and provides the possibility for that stock to be increased by the National Oil Reserves Agency.  It also enhances the attractiveness of the terminal for possible commercial activity by third parties in the future and the INPC is preparing to market the terminal for that purpose.</P>

      <P>The question of responsibility for planning <Col N="683" /> and related aspects is clearly a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>The provision of communications masts is subject to planning approval.  I am informed that the planning authorities may impose whatever conditions they see as necessary in accordance with their powers and obligations under the Planning and Development Acts and that, to assist them in this, the Minister for the Environment has issued draft guidelines in relation to planning applications for communications infrastructure which cover a number of issues including the question of promoting sharing of facilities and clustering.</P>
      <P>I have taken the step of writing to each of the relevant bodies under the aegis of my Department requesting that they facilitate as far as possible all requests for sharing of mast facilities.  I have also requested my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, to make a similar request of the relevant bodies under the aegis of his Department.  It should be noted that the sharing of facilities is not always possible due to structural, technical and capacity planning reasons.  I am confident, however, that, where possible, all relevant bodies will co-operate in this without the necessity to introduce further regulation.</P>

      <P>Wexford County Council formally sought a lease of foreshore on 21 August 1995 to carry out coast protection works at Cullenstown, County Wexford.  Further information sought was supplied by the applicant on 18 September 1995.  Certain technical aspects of the applicant's methodology relating to construction of the proposed works had to be clarified before the applicant could be given permission to publish the application for the purpose of public consultation.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the applicant's proposal on 24 January last, two objections were received, one from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.  Both objectors called for an assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed coast protection works to ensure that they would not adversely affect important conservation sites in the area. I understand that the Office of Public Works originally passed on their concerns to Wexford County Council last August.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, it would not be in the public interest to determine the application for the lease of foreshore at the present time and it is a matter for Wexford County Council to resolve the objectors concerns by meeting the legal requirements of the Wildlife Act and related legislation.</P>
