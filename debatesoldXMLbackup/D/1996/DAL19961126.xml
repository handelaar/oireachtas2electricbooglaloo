      <P>It is estimated that 20 per cent of poultry meat consumed here in 1994 was imported.  The estimates for 1995 will be available shortly and will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The quantity of poultry meat imported in 1995 was 6.3 per cent higher than in 1994.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that the figure of 20 per cent highlights that the Food Safety Board should have a mandate in respect of imported as well as home produced food?  While we have correctly focused on the consumer's right to proper hygiene and food <Col N="2" /> safety, the emphasis is only on home produced products.  Does the Minister of State accept that a similar emphasis should be placed on our rapidly increasing food imports and that the Food Safety Board should play a role in protecting consumers' rights in terms of imported foodstuffs?</P>

      <P>It is estimated that gross outward migration flows in the 12 month periods to mid-April 1995 and 1996 were 33,900 and 32,800 respectively.  The corresponding gross inward migration flows were 32,200 and 38,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> It is not possible to provide a breakdown of these figures on a county basis.  However, a comparison of the 1991 and 1996 Census results at county level, in conjunction with information on births and deaths, enables a county breakdown of net migration for the intercensal period to be derived.  The information relevant for the 1991-96 period is contained in the following table.  It is important to emphasise that the county figures for net migration shown in the table reflect all movements of persons into and out of each county, not only to or from abroad, but also from other parts of the State.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that emigration from some counties is much <Col N="4" /> higher than from others and that it is a serious problem in parts of the west, as highlighted in the bishops' report and subsequent seminars and discussions? While the Minister of State cannot provide a breakdown of figures on a county basis, I presume he is aware from his own constituency that the position is particularly serious in parts of the west.  Has he data on that area?</P>

      <P>The preliminary results of the census show unexpected variations.  The population in Dublin County Borough has decreased by 5,303, in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown it has decreased by 953, in Fingal it has increased by 4,582 and in South Dublin it has decreased by 3,436, giving a population decrease of 5,110 in Dublin.  Deputy Kitt mentioned the initiative adopted by the bishops, the Western Development Partnership Board and the commission being established, which is being ably dealt with by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey.  The figures for the west are not as bleak as predicted.  There has been a population increase of 4,070 in Galway County Borough, but a decrease of 205 in County Galway.  In County Leitrim, where initially a population decline was anticipated, the population has increased by 131.  The population in County Mayo has increased by 522, in County Roscommon it has increased by 76, and in County Sligo by 262.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy, <i>Challenges and Opportunities Abroad</i>, and the Fianna Fáil document by Deputy Ray Burke emphasise the need to keep in contact with our emigrants.  Does the Minister of State see a role for the Government in being in contact with emigrants and, if possible, in encouraging them to locate their businesses in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>All Governments have determined to retain maximum contact with our diaspora &mdash; people who have left this island and people who claim Irish origins.  There have been many initiatives, for example, the DÍON fund which assists housing initiatives in the United Kingdom in particular.  In addition, there are initiatives in obtaining visas.  County associations also link on a regular basis with various Departments here.  There is a great deal of liaison and interaction between the Government, Departments and our emigrants.</P>
      <P>While it is desirable to have a process to track Irish people who set up businesses overseas, I am at a loss as to know what kind of system or device could be put in place to produce accurate statistics. We are open to suggestions about what kind of mechanism could be introduced to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly see a role from the point of view of attracting investment by Irish emigrants who have done well overseas.  No matter where one travels one is impressed by the success achieved by Irish people overseas.  Last week I was in Chicago on Government business and was amazed by the number of Irish people who have done tremendously well there in the business, legal and political fields, and all of whom broadly proclaim their Irish origins.  These people are well known established figures who are leaders in their spheres.  In terms of attracting them back, our problem is not identifying them but convincing them to invest and establish here. We have a fairly good database in that regard.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of charting economic programmes and planning for the future, it is desirable to have as accurate data as possible on the reasons people leave, where they go and the pattern of the inflow and outflow to the register.

Would it not be prudent to at least do some research on why people leave the register, who they are and what level of education they attained?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that this is essentially a statistical question, to use the time worn phrase of the Ceann Comhairle, does the Minister of State think that when Deputy Walsh asked him for a breakdown of those who had left the live register he asked for a gender statement?  Why can a sophisticated Department such as the Department of Social Welfare and the Central Statistics Office not answer elementary questions such as whether these people were short term or long-term unemployed?  Surely Deputy Walsh did not look for a gender breakdown of those statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>By giving the overall figure and then breaking it down in terms of gender, I was simply being helpful.  It is important to know the gender patterns of those in employment.  A significant factor overlooked is that the drop in the number on the live register for those two months is the largest for that period in the history of the statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, and it remains to be seen, surely it is evident that we need to glean more information about why that is the case, the people concerned, if they returned to work or where they went.  Otherwise, if we are caught up in the numbers rather than the reasons for the decline in the number, this is a useless exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that for economic planning it is important that the statistics are as accurate and precise as possible and that account is taken of the causes for changes in them as well as the raw statistics.  I will bring that to the attention of the CSO.  Regarding September, it is also recognised that other factors are prevalent and have become the norm.  Schools reopen, students return to college and factories, which were closed for holidays, reopen.  Those factors are standard, not variables.  Allowing for them, the number on the live register fell by 8,900 in the month to end September 1996 and by a further 11,100 in October 1996, the largest decline in that figure on record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying he is not aware that the dominant factor in all of this was the publicity surrounding the Central Statistics Office arising from his published material about social welfare fraud?  Is he still reiterating the point that he thought Deputy Walsh was looking for a gender breakdown of the figures when he tabled this question?</P>

      <P>Regarding the causes for the decline in figures, it is not my remit to look behind them.  This is a policy matter.  If the Deputy wishes to link it to something that happened during summer period, well and good.  The net point is that there has been a significant drop in the number of people signing on the live register&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I tabled this question to glean some information about the status of those people signing on and off the register.  I have been told about their gender balance which may well be very interesting.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Copies of the conference programme have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Conference on Local Development addressed two main themes.  They were the Irish experience of implementing local development policies and the significant role played by local partnership in social and economic development, and the European dimension, particularly in the light of the commitment to the Essen strategy to tackle the unemployment issue, especially through territorial employment pacts.</P>
      <P>The conference allowed participants an opportunity to share their thinking on and experiences of local development strategies and to learn from them.  It provided for discussions on the European Commission's proposals for mobilising local interests &mdash; local authorities, social partners and communities &mdash; through territorial employment pacts, which embody the area partnership approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conference was held in Dublin Castle and was attended by over 300 people.  The keynote <Col N="10" /> addresses on Monday evening were delivered by the Taoiseach and President Santer and the discussion over the last two days will have an important input into the work of the December European Council.</P>

      <P>The OECD study launched in May stressed the need to ensure that successes achieved are generalised and lessons learnt are applied as widely as possible in regard to these various schemes targeted at the socially excluded living in disadvantaged areas and marginalised communities.  How does the OECD's view tally with that of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the vast bulk of money allocated to local development in 1995 was directed at the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria used in the local development grant scheme include (1) the level of disadvantage in an area, (2) the impact of the grant on the community, (3) how the project complements other local development activities, (4) a maximum of 75 per cent of reckonable costs, (5) sponsors' capacity to carry out the project successfully and (6)  the ability to satisfy accounting and accountability requirements of the Department. Regarding the groups in the Dublin South Central constituency which received funding in 1996, four groups in that constituency received grants totalling £15,000 or 6 per cent of the total 1996 allocation.  It is estimated that eight groups in Dublin Central, Deputy Ahern's constituency, received grants totalling £80,000 or 32 per cent of the 1996 allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister of State about the 1995 figures.  I am glad the allocation of funding in 1996 appears to have been more equally spread.  Will the Minister of State explain what happened in 1995?  I would prefer if the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, was present to answer these questions as he is familiar with this matter.  The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted, in very trenchant form, that on examination of the audit of the local development initiative he found there was no documentary evidence on the files for 1995 of any critical analysis of projects for which grant-aid was sought or that the specified criteria had been adhered to.  He stated that tax clearance certificates were not adhered to, that tax details were not obtained prior to payments being made in November 1996 and that only 12 of the 37 projects which he looked at had provided the relevant tax clearance certificates.  He also pointed out that grants were paid to a number of projects for work which did not commence &mdash; and was not planned to commence &mdash; until 1996, which was in contravention of the approach agreed with the Department of Finance in the establishment of the criteria to which the Minister of State referred.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State condemn the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for this outrageous behaviour and the fact that the grants benefited his constituency? Will he confirm or deny that the Minister of State made representations for such grants? Will he also confirm that the Comptroller and Auditor General's scathing report on the handling of local development initiatives within the office of the Minister of State has now been adequately addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the criticisms in the annual report on local development grants, due regard was taken of the comments by the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit in assessing 1996 applications.  This has resulted in an analysis report on each successful project file where offers of assistance have been made.  The Department's position is that respondents must complete and return a current status report and all necessary documentation, including tax certificates, before payments are made.  In addition, all tax and accounting requirements must be fully complied with before any money is paid out.</P>

      <P>Whatever about people complaining about Ministers pouring money into their own constituency, is the Minister of State aware there is grave worry over the fact that money is being wasted everywhere with regard to area partnership proposals?  Last night I attended a residents' association meeting in my constituency where I discovered that £500,000 is to be invested in Rathmines Fire Station to turn it into a community and information centre for the people of Rathmines and Terenure.  What reality is there to accountability if we fling European money into daft projects of this kind?  The people <Col N="15" /> of Rathmines do not need a fire station to be turned into a community information centre to be paid for by the people of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is removed from his constituency community if he does not realise that applications of the kind to which he referred are fully processed.  Area partnership board proposals in my part of the country are scrutinised. Criteria must be complied with, regardless of whether it is a county enterprise board or an ADM partnership board application.</P>
      <P>There is unemployment in Dublin south-east; an examination of the figures will doubtless illustrate that there is substantial unemployment in Rathmines.  I do not often frequent the area but there was much unemployment there during my student days.  Doubtless there still is and it is for Deputy Michael McDowell to discover the extent of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My constituency of Dublin South-East was very well endowed in the past by community information centres which were all populated by the members of one specific party. Deputy Bertie Ahern is aware of this.  I am very sceptical of any proposal to turn Rathmines Fire Station into a community information centre because that will do nothing for long-term employment.  It is tantamount to flinging money around simply because it is available; it achieves nothing.  We do not need a community information centre in Rathmines and we do not need £500,000 invested in a derelict fire station so that people can appear in local newsletters when opening them to give the impression they are doing something useful for the local community when they are not.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell made no attempt to ask a question.  It is regrettable that he should take this view when attempts are being made to relieve unemployment in the Rathmines area by the efforts of volunteers participating in the area partnership boards.  He demeans them by criticising their proposed projects.  There has been work on renewal in the city centre.  Why should similar work not take place in Rathmines?</P>

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General, not his staff, was critical of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  The Minister of State refers to correct form filling and submission of correct documentation.  What are the criteria with regard to value for money and decisions to proceed with projects?  Who in Government considers how the money will be spent or if it is to be spent?  Is the work necessary, or what is being achieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The report form is very detailed, as is the project analysis given to a successful application. The 1996 applications which I have examined demonstrate that there is value for money on the work being undertaken.</P>

      <P>The grants involved for last year amounted to £872,000.  Both the Comptroller and Auditor General and I found that all the procedures had been broken and that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Gay Mitchell, had used up most of the money in the Dublin South-Central constituency. Following this, and in response to the complaints by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Taoiseach suggested that to try to comply with the criteria agreed with the Department of Finance and the Accounting Officer and the procedures and criteria that would be acceptable to the Comptroller and Auditor General, consideration would be given to spreading the grants to a wider area in 1996.  Has this worked, or did the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, also raid all the money for 1996?</P>

      <P>I do not have the information for 1995.  If I had it to hand I would gladly give it to the Deputy.  He conveniently forgets that the Department of Finance gave sanction for individual grant payments in the middle of December 1995 and the Comptroller and Auditor General was aware of this.  I have outlined the new system put in place for 1996 and it is working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of the SMI and the document Delivering Better Government is under way across and within all Departments.  Six working groups of business representatives from the private sector and public servants are producing action frameworks for: quality service; human resource management; open and transparent service delivery; information technology; regulatory reform; and financial management.</P>
      <P>The working groups will produce their initial reports shortly to the co-ordinating group consisting of action frameworks for implementation of the recommendations of the document Delivering Better Government.  These action frameworks will then be considered by the SMI co-ordinating group and the Government and released to Departments and Offices for implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within Departments and offices the focus to date has been on producing statements of strategy that develop and adapt the detailed focus on <Col N="18" /> results contained in the document Delivering Better Government in the light of their own functions and resources.</P>
    <P>The statement of strategy for the Department of the Taoiseach is being finalised and will be published before the end of this year.  The Department has established a number of internal groups to deal with the implications of the SMI for the internal organisation of the Department and its level of services provision.</P>
    <P>Emerging from the deliberations of these groups, the Department of the Taoiseach is formulating action plans in the following key areas: production of detailed programmes of work for each division in the Department; enhanced training and development programmes for staff at all levels; improvements in the operation and delivery of internal support services, including information technology; development of appropriate structures to facilitate communication, consultation and participation involving staff at all levels within the Department.</P>
    <P>Consultancy costs incurred to date in respect of the engagement of an external facilitator to assist the Department in developing its response to the Strategic Management Initiative totalled £16,877; 50 per cent of this cost, £8,439, was recouped from the Department of Finance central fund in respect of the Strategic Management Initiative.</P>
    <P>I cannot overemphasise the significance of the SMI process and the change programme set out in the document Delivering Better Government to updating our system of governance to reflect today's realities and to achieve high levels of effectiveness in the civil and public service.  The business of Government has increased out of all proportion since the founding of the State and has been particularly marked since the early 1960s.  Moreover, the business of Government has reached a level of complexity today that was unimaginable when our system of governance, as enshrined in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, was devised.</P>
    <P>The need to update the system and its supporting structures to reflect the realities of carrying out the business of Government in today's complex and fast changing economic and social environment is paramount.  The introduction of the SMI began this process of modernisation.  The document Delivering Better Government which sets out a comprehensive and integrated programme of change for the civil and public service continues and reinforces it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear the document Delivering Better Government was not a priority of the Department of Justice in recent weeks and that much of what the Minister of State speaks about, even something as basic as reading correspondence, is not in place in that Department. When will we see the action plans promised by the Minister of State?  Will one be published for each Government Department or just for the Department of the Taoiseach?  Why did the Minister of State not fulfil the undertaking she gave <Col N="19" /> us on the last occasion we raised this issue when she undertook to send us a copy of the contract of employment entered into between the Government and its consultants in relation to this initiative?</P>

Like all other Departments, the Department of Justice will submit its statement of strategy before the end of the year.  We expect to receive it in mid-December.  I look forward to receiving it.  The SMI process and the document Delivering Better Government are being taken seriously in that as in all other Departments.</P>

      <P>I will be in office for another year. If I am given the chance to continue for a few years after that in this particular office, by the time we will have rolled out the SMI and all that is contained in the document Delivering Better Government the Deputy will not want for transparency or accountability.  The Government and the Opposition are not divided on this point. Rome was not built in a day.  Experience in all other Parliaments and democracies which have renewed and revised their system of public administration in recent years shows that this cannot be achieved in one or two years, that it will straddle the term of office of one or two Governments. It will take a number of years and require political commitment across the spectrum in the short, medium and long-term to achieve all we want to achieve.  We have not got there yet and I will not pretend that we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade (Mr. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Kenny, who is in Europe presiding over an Internal Market Council meeting.  I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already indicated in replies to previous questions on this subject that the tourism brand concept was originally conceived by the Tourism Council established by his predecessor and developed subsequently under the direction of an industry steering group led by Bord Fáilte.  The task was formally completed with the launch last week of the tourism brand Ireland when Bord Fáilte, working with the tourism industry partners throughout the island and overseas, also assumed responsibility for management of the brand and putting the necessary resources and effort behind its successful deployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The brand proposition, &ldquo;An Emotional Experience, Live a Different Life&rdquo; builds on our two key identified tourism assets, the accessible, unspoiled pastoral scenery and the interaction with friendly, engaging people.  I understand from Bord Fáilte that the proposition has been derived from extensive professional consumer research carried out around the world.  The development of a premium value brand is intended to make <Col N="23" /> more discerning and high yield tourists want to visit Ireland, with the results being measured in terms of retained revenue, regional distribution, extension of the season and visitor loyalty.</P>
    <P>The new tourism brand total marketing approach is designed to benefit the island as a whole and to help increase tourism revenue in all regions.  The visual images and advertising material incorporate a broad regional spread. Bord Fáilte inform me that the communications will give priority to international consumer groups who are more likely to come in the off season and to use the less congested areas of the country, particularly at peak periods.  Specific initiatives related to the brand for individual regions are matters for Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism authorities and the local trade.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated previously, Bord Fáilte has managed the budget for developing this initiative, including monitoring costs and sourcing funding, as an integral part of its day-to-day marketing and promotional activities.  The development cost, for which the board budgeted the sum of £3 million, includes the production of extensive television advertising for all the principal overseas markets, a still photographic bank, promotional and support communication material, the design of a new logo and associated fees.  This up to date bank of visual imagery for Ireland can be used with confidence well into the next century. The new identity also involves the development of a consistent visual look which, over time, should be adopted on all published tourism promotional items.  Bord Fáilte informs me that it is also currently in discussion with a number of commercial companies about the possibility of licensing them with use of the logo and the communications style in their print and other marketing activities.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive programme for the use or roll out of the new brand is expected to go into place on a phased basis over the next year or so. The new television advertising will be progressively introduced into all key markets by spring next year.  The final marketing budgets for 1997 and subsequent years have yet to be determined and the expectation is that the industry will row in fully behind the new brand.  The main consumer advertising partnership or the OTMI, composed of representatives of Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourism Board and the industry North and South, has already committed resources behind the deployment of the new brand.  Bord Fáilte estimates that up to £60 million a year is spent on the broad definition of tourism marketing, funded by the Exchequer, the EU and industry sources.  The objective will be to reorientate an increasing element of that diversified expenditure behind the brand, which is expected to shape the promotion and marketing of Irish tourism well into the next millennium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his extensive reply.  I congratulate the industry for the support it gave to Bord Fáilte regarding the presentation of the brand image and commend the professional manner in which Mr. Noel Toolan of Bord Fáilte presented it to the visitors to the Shelbourne Hotel on that occasion.  It was well conducted and well received.</P>
      <P>However, there was one glitch in the proceedings which had nothing to do with the designers of the logo, which is intended to instantly remind people of Ireland when they look at it.  It is not a reflection on the designers from a first class company but the logo will be meaningless without the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; underneath it.  Will this word be attached to the logo when it is produced? Does the Minister agree that the shamrock has been relegated?  One would need a magnifying glass to see it and this is unfortunate because it is instantly recognised as the symbol of Ireland to people who would not ordinarily understand such matters.  The logo will be less meaningful than its predecessor in the North American tourism market.  I am occasionally critical of Bord Fáilte but, credit where it is due, the brand image presentation was excellent and the presentation by Mr. Noel Toolan was professional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his welcome for the new brand.  He was present at the launch where there was some speculation as to what the logo represented.  The message did not come across until one saw two people embracing and exchanging the shamrock.  As a result of extensive research by the industry this design was agreed upon and I have no doubt it will, in time, prove very successful.  As in all commercial undertakings there is a certain measure of risk involved but I hope, as was intended by the people who designed the logo, it will see us into the next millennium and ensure increased visitor numbers.</P>
      <P>As regards the shamrock, I was confronted last week by a lady in Roscommon who is retired from the tourism business and who brought me to task about this matter.  She said that the shamrock always has been the Irish emblem.  It will continue to be the corporate logo of Bord Fáilte Éireann, which is extremely important.  Bord Fáilte has not abandoned the shamrock.  We are talking about a combined effort by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte and the concept of two people embracing the shamrock, which is common to both parts of the country, is significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The two people embracing the shamrock are crushing it to extinction, which is unfortunate.  A feature of the presentation I liked was the involvement of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  That board is not sufficiently involved, but the fact that it is involved is a start. It is meaningless to have two tourist boards on this island; there should be only one board.  The Minister should contact the excellent company <Col N="25" /> that designed this logo with a view to giving the shamrock greater definition because it is part of what we are.  Perhaps consideration could be given to a talking logo such as &ldquo;We are embracing the shamrock&rdquo; or &ldquo;Look for me, the shamrock, in the middle of this embrace&rdquo;.  It is unfortunate the shamrock has been effectively abandoned in favour of the new logo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's point, but we have to be realistic about this and, having spent in excess of £3 million on designing and launching the logo, it is unlikely there will be any change in the immediate future.  I will convey the Deputy's remarks to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the innovation which is inherent in the new logo for Irish tourism, but I have some concerns.  What will be the effect on the overseas tourism marketing initiative in terms of the amount of funding available?  The Minister said that the cost of the presentation would be included in the general Bord Fáilte costs.  I am concerned that in promoting the new logo a substantial amount of money which was previously spent on direct marketing will be diverted to that area.  Will the Minister set my mind at ease on that point?  What lead-in time is envisaged by Bord Fáilte and the trade generally for this radically new symbol?  As the Minister will appreciate, its positive effect will depend greatly on its recognition factor.  I agree with Deputy Andrews it is unlikely in the short-term or even in the medium term it will be recognised as a symbol of Ireland.  When can we expect it will become so recognisable that it will play a constructive role in marketing tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to advertising, a sum of £60 million is provided annually in the Bord Fáilte budget specifically for the OTMI.  It is hoped some of that money will be used to promote the logo in the interests of this island, North and South.  It is hoped also that the campaign will get off the ground early in spring so that it will impact on next year's tourist season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we see the new logo on promotional material?  The Minister stated that Bord Fáilte will continue to use the shamrock logo.  Where will we see the new logo and how will it be recognised in the way brand names in the commercial world acquire recognition which render them valuable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misquoting me regarding the logo of Bord Fáilte Éireann and the marketing initiative.  The shamrock will continue to be the corporate logo of Bord Fáilte, but when marketing the island of Ireland the new logo, at the launch of which the Fianna Fáil spokesperson was present last week, will be used.  I think Deputies will agree it has been received enthusiastically <Col N="26" /> by the trade and by all those involved in tourism.</P>

      <P>In reply to similar questions on this subject on 17 October the Minister outlined a range of policy measures being taken to improve training and recruitment in the tourism sector. The CERT Research Report on Successful Recruitment and Staff Retention in Tourism, launched earlier this year, sets out clearly the factors which need to be considered by tourism businesses in their approach to designing an attractive job and career package that leads to successful recruitment and retention of staff.  This includes a reasonable level of pay and conditions, improved staff-management relations and the development of attractive career paths.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging to note that the industry representative associations and individual businesses in tourism are already conscious of the competitive staff recruitment environment which they face.  As the Minister stated in an earlier reply, the Irish Hotels Federation will shortly launch a programme to highlight the attractiveness of careers within the hotel and guesthouse sector. CERT, in conjunction with the industry, has taken steps already to increase training places and to improve the image of the industry, including direct training initiatives which will provide approximately 600 additional training places for full-time craft and employment programmes to supplement those provided in Department of Education colleges.</P>
      <P>CERT mounts nationwide publicity and promotion campaigns to attract school leavers and unemployed adults into training.  These include media campaigns, the advertising of vacancies on Aertel, workshops for career guidance counsellors, career talks in school and career exhibitions. At present a national campaign is being planned for 1997 to target some 6,000 recruits. Employers will be asked to help tackle the image problem.  The aim of the campaign is to position tourism as a first choice career and to promote employment packages that support this image. Already rates of pay to CERT graduates during 1996 have been substantially higher than in previous years, and this can only serve to enhance the image of the industry.</P>
      <P>In 1995 CERT set up a national recruitment committee representative of industry bodies to co-ordinate and implement local promotion campaigns by industry.  The work of this committee is continuing and these promotion campaigns are being extended countrywide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, CERT launched a new Trainers <Col N="27" /> in Industry programme which will create up to 2,000 formally accredited trainers in Irish tourism companies by 1999.  This will mean direct training by CERT is backed up by a substantial increase in training carried out by the industry itself and means that the industry will take greater responsibility for the development of its own workforce.  In addition, a new CERT-National Tourism Certification Board initiative will provide on the job training and certification at elementary level for all skill categories in the industry.  CERT is confident that given its own fully comprehensive national recruitment campaign, and with the support of the industry, the challenge of recruiting and training the additional workforce required for the sector can be achieved.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his extensive reply.  I put down this question by way of support rather than criticism of the industry. The industry is aware of the shortcomings in the various areas referred to by the Minister.  The production of a statement of direction for the industry in terms of staff, pay and conditions and so on will be very helpful.  Will the Minister agree that in some areas the conditions under which staff operate are not the best?  Not only are working conditions not up to standard but living conditions also must be considered.  Will the Minister bring these matters to the attention of the industry which, in the main, can hold its head proudly as a flagship operation?  Will the Minister of State agree that matters remain to be addressed?</P>

      <P>The first people to acknowledge the problems are those in the industry.  The Irish Hotels Federation and the trade union movement are taking measures to address them. In recent weeks I was invited to Liberty Hall where SIPTU and other craft unions in the catering and hotel industries held an open day to inform young people about careers in those industries.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me a question regarding living conditions but I am not in a position to furnish that information to him, unless he refers to some specific instance.  I will convey the Deputy's concerns to the Minister.</P>

      <P>That is what I want the Minister of State to do because I am not in the business of informing and I do not intend to give the information to the Minister.  I want him to be aware that in some instances conditions are less than salubrious as far as young people are concerned.  It is those living and working conditions, among others, which do not attract young people to the industry.  This industry has proven to be one worth developing but it is appropriate that I should point out some of its shortcomings.  The industry is aware of these and will no doubt check them in due course.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of problems in the industry.  There is a demand for young people in the hotel industry which wants to encourage school leavers, as a first option, to seek employment in it.  That is extremely important but certain measures will have to be taken to achieve this.  There are certain drawbacks in the industry. Having worked in the services sector I know the hours are not attractive.  A seven day rota does not appeal to young people who are not prepared to sacrifice their leisure time to go into an industry when they can have better pay, more sociable hours and better working conditions in other industries.  These conditions will not attract some people but there are others who are ideally suited for the tourism industry.  It is significant that we have 102,000 full-time job equivalents in the industry and before the end of this decade more people will be involved in tourism than in agriculture. I welcome the latest initiative by CERT to recruit 6,000 people this year and the fact that the industry is rowing in behind CERT to provide training.  That is recognition of the problem and I hope it will be addressed in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister recently met representatives of the Irish Hotels Federation, the Town and Country Homes Association and the Irish Farm Holidays Association who presented him with a submission proposing a statutory licensing system for all tourist accommodation. At this meeting the Minister reiterated his view, already expressed in this House, that he did not favour the statutory licensing of all accommodation but undertook to have these proposals examined and indicated he would be in touch with the associations in due course.</P>
      <P>The Minister's view and that of his predecessor is that the statutory licensing of all tourist accommodation is not practical, nor would it necessarily lead to an improvement in standards to any great extent.  In addition to possible difficulties as regards policing and prosecution, it could lead to a reduction in the accommodation bank available, particularly during the high season and at festival times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present unapproved operators do not have access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte <Col N="29" /> and the tourist information office network, nor do they have access to tax breaks or other subsidised finance schemes which are available to the approved sector.  The pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas and the subsidised tourism loan schemes were carefully designed so that only approved operators would be eligible.  Unapproved operators are obliged to comply in the same way as approved operators with official requirements, for example, in the areas of taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene.  My Department has impressed on the relevant enforcement agencies the need for constant vigilance to ensure their policing or inspection practices do not discriminate as between the approved and unapproved sectors.</P>
    <P>The ideal solution would be for unapproved operators to become approved and I can confirm that both Bord Fáilte and the recognised approving bodies will mount an information campaign encouraging operators to seek approval and explaining clearly not only what is involved in terms of procedure, but also in terms of the benefits to be gained from being part of the approved tourist accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response has much to recommend it in terms of plans for licensed and unlicensed accommodation, but difficulties exist even in the licensed sector.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was clear in my original reply to the Deputy's question.  The Minister, Deputy Kenny, and his predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, indicated clearly it was not their intention to force people in the unlicensed sector to register because some of them only provide accommodation during race meetings or festivals. They are not in the business for most of the year unlike many approved bed and breakfast establishments. Likewise it will be particularly difficult to force people complying with planning and fire and safety regulations, who are working in a manner acceptable to the health authorities regarding hygiene, to register unless some other system is introduced.  In the coming year Bord Fáilte and the other approving agencies intend to highlight the advantages of registering including tax incentives and the advertising that is available to people with approved establishments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 86 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Domestic Tourism Marketing Initiative or DTMI, which I launched in February 1996, is specifically targeted at developing shoulder and off-season domestic tourism.  At the launch I announced I had secured £500,000 towards the cost of developing a new home holiday initiative, with co-financing from the industry to encourage greater marketing of home holidays, particularly in the off peak and shoulder periods.  I established a high level working group comprising representatives of the tourism industry, the relevant state tourism agencies and officials of the Department <Col N="31" /> of Tourism and Trade to develop the initiative on a partnership basis.</P>
    <P>The working group, which met on a number of occasions since February 1996, has developed an integrated national marketing programme to accelerate growth in home holidays with particular emphasis on the shoulder and off season periods. Bord Fáilte's promotional campaign is also designed to promote shoulder and off-season holidays with main advertising campaigns promoting autumn-winter, spring-early summer holiday taking. Specific campaigns, such as the &ldquo;golden years&rdquo; and Christmas-New Year breaks, are also targeted to generate additional spend and season extension.</P>
    <P>The domestic tourism marketing initiative has been most concerned, in devising its programme of activities, to ensure there is no duplication between the various campaigns and that all are operated in the most efficient and effective way to promote domestic tourism throughout the year.  Estimated revenue from domestic tourism last year totalled £625 million, down 7.8 per cent on the comparable figure for 1994.  While the revenue from domestic holiday visits decreased by less than 2 per cent, the principal reduction in revenue was due to a decrease in business visits, visits to relatives and other visit categories during 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that western regions are considerably more dependent on domestic tourism than regions in the east and that they have not benefited from the very substantial increases in overseas tourism. Bearing that and the worrying trend of a reduction in 1995 over 1994 in mind, has the Minister any plans to initiate a stronger campaign to ensure the domestic tourism industry shows some growth in regions where heretofore there have been tourism losses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the decline in domestic tourism has not just occurred over the last year. This is largely due to the fact that people now have more disposable income and tend to go for short foreign breaks whereas in the past they remained at home.  The Deputy asked me if I have any further plans.  Yesterday I attended a meeting of the domestic tourism marketing initiative board in Athlone, together with the regional officers from every region.  We will relaunch the campaign for 1997 on 7 January 1997. We are very conscious of an imbalance at the moment; Dublin is a major attraction.  There has been huge investment in the Dublin area and that is siphoning business from other regions, not alone the west.  It is hoped the recent branding operation with the images it creates will help to address this problem.  It depicts a pastoral image of this country which does not promote urbanised areas and I sincerely hope that this new initiative with the domestic tourism marketing initiative <Col N="32" /> will succeed in spreading the prosperity from the growing numbers coming to our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the initiative which is to begin on 7 January is likely to be far too late for the spring of next year and is unlikely to have much effect until the summer when southern and western regions probably have least need of extra business?  There is a particular need for domestic business during the shoulder seasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We took the precaution earlier this year of ensuring that the autumn campaign would run into the spring of next year.  Funds have already been provided for and we will not wait for 7 January to start off the campaign.  We had a run in period from the autumn of this year to the spring of next year.  Plans are already in train to cater for the Deputy's reservation.  I sincerely hope they will prove successful on this occasion.  We do not have the figures for this year yet and I hope we will have positive results from the very short advertising programme by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 80 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, makes provision for European Regional Development Fund support for a large dedicated conference centre to be built in Dublin and capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> Following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, an alternative strategy was pursued whereby Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development, examined an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved under the tourism operational programme for public and similar bodies.</P>
    <P>Upon completion of their examination of the RDS proposal Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the product board, commissioned an independent cost-benefit analysis which is required under the tourism operational programme in the case of all large projects.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm, ECOTEC, which was selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure. Reports of this nature would not normally be made public as they contain information of a commercially sensitive nature.</P>
    <P>The Government, having taken into account a number of factors including the recommendations of the Product Board and Bord Fáilte and the results of the cost-benefit analysis, agreed on 5 November 1996 to make a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS.  The Government is recommending approval of 75 per cent capital grant aid subject to the existing financial provision for such project in the current tourism operational programme.  I understand this provision is already adequate to fully meet the total cost of grant recommended in the Government's submission and will not necessitate any change in priorities or budgets in the current operational programme.</P>
    <P>The proposal has now been submitted to the European Commission for its formal agreement which is required under the operational programme for projects of this scale.  We await a formal response from the Commission and in the interim, I do not propose to anticipate or speculate on the substance of that response.  A specific timeframe for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until a proposal has been formally approved by the European Commission and matters such as planning permission are in place. There is, however, no reason to believe the project cannot be completed and supported within the timeframe permissible under the operational programme.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any formal legal actions pending against the State following the decision to terminate the open tendering competition for the national conference centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear from the Minister of State's reply whether the RDS has already been found to be eligible for the higher rate of European funding.  I expect it has not yet been found <Col N="34" /> eligible.  Does the Minister agree it is a great pity that contracts for consultancy reports such as the cost-benefit analysis have to be placed outside the country?  We have had many examples of it in several Departments in recent times.  It is a pity that we are not able to do this work ourselves and keep within the country the very substantial amounts of finance involved.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the Government ought to have a fall back position in mind in the event that any of the myriad difficulties which might beset the RDS proposal come into play?  I understand there may well be difficulties in relation to the local community.  There may be planning difficulties and perhaps even a failure to get the level of European funding which is expected.  As I understand it from the Minister, if that happened, the conference centre proposal would effectively collapse.  Am I correct in understanding that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's first question, we no longer have any choice in these matters.  We are now part of the European Union and it is necessary to advertise internationally when we advertise these contracts.  Does the Deputy agree that if the Government had decided on a fall back position, we would have to go to Europe and say that although we are making a submission on behalf of the RDS, in case it is not successful we have another proposal?  Does he agree that it would undermine our position and send out the wrong signals?  I think it would.</P>

      <P>The principal decisions relating to the Internal Market taken by the Council of 25 October, which the Minister chaired, were: approval of a directive on the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a frontal impact; adoption of a Council resolution on the simplification and rationalisation of the Community's customs regulations and procedures; and a decision authorising the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the EU, an agreement concerning customs co-operation with Norway.  The Council approved without discussion a large number of other decisions, some relating to the work of other councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Council noted the Commission's intention to launch the &ldquo;Citizens First&rdquo; information campaign on 26 November which is designed to inform EU citizens of the rights and <Col N="35" /> opportunities created for them by the Single Market. The Council also noted the progress made by the Commission in relation to SLIM (Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market) initiative and on its major study on the impact of the effectiveness of the Single Market, and welcomed the Commission's statement that its communications on both these issues would be ready for discussion at the Internal Market Council on 26 November.</P>
    <P>During the meeting, the Ministers met their counterparts of the ten Central and Eastern European countries as part of a structured dialogue process to assist those countries to prepare for integration with the EU's Single Market.</P>
    <P>All the decisions taken at the Council will, in their own way, contribute to the consolidation and development of the Single Market which is so important to our exporters.

      <P>Notwithstanding the cessation of the IRA ceasefire, visitor numbers have continued to grow, increasing in the first nine months of this year by over 11 per cent to 3,821,000. Growth in particular markets has been strong with visitor numbers from Britain up by almost 14 per cent, North America up by just under 12 per cent and Mainland Europe by over 7 per cent. Revenue for the first half of the year has increased by over 16 per cent over the same period in 1995 to £777 million.  There is, therefore, every indication that 1996 will be yet another record-breaking year for Irish tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years Ireland has been one of the fastest growing tourism destinations in Europe.  This record growth predates the IRA ceasefire, continued throughout the period of the ceasefire and is still continuing today.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate whether some potential visitors have been deterred from travelling to <Col N="36" /> Ireland by the ending of the IRA ceasefire.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The small business expansion loan scheme announced in the 1994 budget made a £100 million loan fund available to small businesses in the manufacturing, tourism and international traded sectors, £25 million of which was allocated specifically for projects in the tourism sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of this scheme is evident from the fact that the £25 million allocated for tourism projects was fully approved at the end of September 1994.  All the funds had been drawn down at the end of April 1996.  A total of 120 tourism projects were assisted and over 2,000 associated jobs maintained or planned.  Following the success of this scheme, the Government introduced a new subsidised loan scheme, the access to finance scheme, on 12 September 1995.  This fund is being administered by the AIB, Bank of Ireland, National Irish Bank and Ulster Bank.  A minimum of £52 million &mdash; 25 per cent of the fund &mdash; is reserved for the tourism sector.  The loans are for a fixed term of seven years at a fixed interest rate of 6.5 per cent.  This fund provides a minimum loan size of £20,000 while the maximum loan size is £500,000.  Projects are eligible on a similar basis to the small business expansion loan scheme.  The banks have indicated that they <Col N="37" /> expect all the funds under the scheme will be drawn down by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a further small business loan scheme would be a matter, in the first instance, for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who has assured me that, if another scheme is devised, the importance of the tourism sector to the economy, which was recognised in the small business expansion loan scheme and the access to finance scheme, will not be overlooked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Will he agree that the return for the investment of £25 million arising out of the budget allocation for tourism under the small business loan scheme in the budget of 1994, leading to the creation and maintenance of about 2,000 jobs in the tourism sector, is a very good return for that kind of investment?  That being so, is it the Minister's intention to urge the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to continue that kind of scheme in the budget of 1997?  What action is he taking to make that happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that job creation and retention of that magnitude is something we have to take seriously.  Already the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has given an assurance to the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, that if a further scheme is introduced finance will be available for tourism.  I sincerely hope the Minister will introduce another scheme or reintroduce one of the previous schemes.  I will convey the Deputy's views to the Minister.</P>

Will he also agree that his Department ought to play a more central role in ensuring that conditions are suitable for tour operators to come here, and keep tabs on the activities of Bord Fáilte to ensure that action is taken to encourage even <Col N="38" /> more tour operators who effectively decide how many tourists come from overseas markets?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 50, 51, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 67, 69, 70, 81, 85, 87, 88, 92, 94 and 95 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already stated in replies to <Col N="40" /> previous questions on this subject that the tourism brand concept was originally conceived by the Tourism Council, established by his predecessor and developed subsequently under the direction of an industry steering group led by Bord Fáilte.  That task was formally completed with the launch last week of Tourism Brand Ireland when Bord Fáilte, working with tourism industry partners throughout the island of Ireland and overseas, also assumed responsibility for managing the brand and putting the necessary resources and effort behind its successful deployment.</P>
    <P>The brand proposition &mdash;&ldquo;An emotional experience, live a different life&rdquo;&mdash; builds on our two key identified tourism assets, the accessible unspoiled pastoral scenery and interaction with friendly, engaging people.  I understand from Bord Fáilte that the proposition has been derived from extensive professional consumer research around the world with 17 different consumer focus groups.  The development of a premium value brand is intended to make the more discerning and higher yield tourist want to visit Ireland repeatedly with the results being measured in terms of retained revenue, regional distribution, extension of the season and visitor loyalty.  The new tourism brand total marketing approach is designed to benefit the island of Ireland as a whole and to help increase tourism revenue in all regions.  The visual images and advertising material incorporate a very broad regional spread.  Bord Fáilte inform me that communications will be especially targeted at those international consumer groups who are more likely to come in the off season and to use the less congested regions of the country.  Any specific initiatives related to the brand for individual regions are matters for Bord Fáilte, the regional tourism authorities and the local trade.</P>
    <P>The cost of developing this initiative and the individual breakdown of the respective items involved, is the responsibility of Bord Fáilte and falls within its day-to-day activities.  The development costs include the production of extensive TV advertising for all of the principal overseas markets, a still photographic bank, promotional and support communication material, the design of the new logo and associated fees.  This up-to-date bank of visual imagery for Ireland can be used with confidence well into the next century. The new identity also involves the development of a consistent visual look which, over time, should be adopted on all published tourism promotional items.  Bord Fáilte has informed the Minister that already several major commercial tourism companies have sought to be licensed to use the logo and the communications style in their own print and other marketing activities.</P>
    <P>The roll out of the new brand is expected to take place on a phased basis over the next year or so.  The new TV advertising will be progressively introduced in all the key markets by spring next year.  The final marketing budgets for 1997 and subsequent years have yet to be determined and <Col N="41" /> the expectation is that the industry will row in fully behind the new brand.  The main consumer advertising partnership &mdash; OTMI &mdash; has already committed its resources behind the deployment of the new brand.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has estimated that up to £60 million per year is spent on a broad defination of tourism marketing both by the State, European Union and industry sources.  The objective will be to reorientate an increasing element of that diversified expenditure behind the brand which is expected to shape the promotion and marketing of Irish tourism well into the next millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of questions on the matter reflects the interest in the brand and, perhaps, the worry that it may not benefit all regions equally, as has been the case heretofore.  Question No. 43 relates to the Shannon region.  The Minister had set up a Bord Fáilte initiative in relation to promoting European tourism in which the western tourism organisations, with the exception of Shannon Development, were involved.  Will he find out from the Minister why Shannon Development was not centrally involved in that promotion?  Why did Shannon Development consider it a good idea to be excluded?  I understand the Minister encouraged it to issue a statement to that effect.  I take a serious view of the fact that the tourism organisation in that region was not centrally involved in the European promotion.  The reply of the Minister of State in relation to the brand is welcome but it will need to be monitored carefully in the context of the west losing out badly in overseas tourism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any fear that the new logo, the new brand, will take so long to yield its meaning to the ordinary person of average intelligence, such as myself, that explaining it to people will become a growth industry in its own right?  It will be like the Americans explaining James Joyce's <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>.  We will have dictionaries trying to explain to people the meaning and the purpose of the new brand.  I confess in all humility its meaning has eluded me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the brand is as successful and as enduring as <i>Finnegan's Wake</i> we have nothing to fear.  The interest in James Joyce attracts many people to Ireland.  I have no doubt the concept is revolutionary and that in time the message will get across.  When we see it on the television screen it is quite impressive.  As with any commercial undertaking there is an element of risk involved and a huge risk is involved here.  We have a successful tourism package.  Nothing we do should tarnish or damage that image in any way. This brand was decided after considerable international research and 17 different consumer groups were interviewed about the concept.  By and large it received universal approval.  Those <Col N="42" /> present at the launch in the Shelbourne Hotel some weeks ago will say that the reaction of those in the industry was euphoric.  It is an exciting concept. The manner in which Mr. Noel Toolan presented it was impressive.</P>

      <P>On 12 November the Taoiseach announced in the House, in the course of the Confidence in Government motion, that a courts services board would be established on a non-statutory basis.  On Friday evening last, following a statement by Deputy O'Donoghue, we learned the Government would not now proceed on that basis.  Since this is a matter of legislation referred to in the House under the relevant Standing Order, will the Minister for Finance inform us why the Government, in particular the Minister for Justice, did not relay that decision taken at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday last in the course of the debate on the Inquiry into the Department of Justice on Wednesday or Thursday last, or when answering questions here on Thursday afternoon bearing in mind especially its pertinence to that debate?  Will the Minister for Finance explain the reason for that omission and also inform Members of the present position with regard to that legislation since there appears to be some confusion about the timescale for the establishment of the courts services board on a statutory basis?  The record of the House shows a conflict as to whether the Government examined the matter only in the course of the Confidence in Government motion or, as the Minister for Justice <Col N="45" /> stated whether that decision was taken in May last.  The Minister for Finance might inform us whether it was taken in May last and, if so, why no progress was made thereon up to 12 November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government in general, the Taoiseach in particular, was very anxious to move as quickly as possible to establish this courts services board.  Between the time the decision was taken by Cabinet and announced by the Taoiseach to proceed with its establishment on a non-statutory basis pending the introduction and implementation of legislation in a manner similar to that in which the Government moved successfully to establish the Criminal Assets Bureau &mdash; based on precisely the same formula &mdash; we received the third report from the Denham committee which, <i>inter alia,</i> contained the draft heads of a Bill which short-circuited the normal time lapse between a non-statutory operation and a provisional statutory operation.  The Government then decided very sensibly that, since a lot of the work had been done by that committee, it was not necessary to proceed on a non-statutory basis.</P>
      <P>On promised legislation, no doubt the Deputy will be glad to learn that work is proceeding on this Bill as a matter of priority and thanks to the work undertaken by the Denham committee, it is hoped to introduce it as soon as possible.  I regret I am not in a position to state precisely when, but given the commitment of the Government to have this legislation enacted as soon as possible &mdash; which aspiration I know is shared by all Members, including the Leader of the main Opposition party &mdash; the House will be informed as soon as we have a more accurate timetable for its introduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister for Finance agree that, following a meeting with Mr. Justice Hamilton and Mrs. Justice Susan Denham on Monday last, despite the Government having taken a decision to change its position at Cabinet on Tuesday last &mdash; which appears to have been the case from what the Taoiseach stated in the course of a press conference on Sunday last &mdash; followed by a two day debate in the course of which the Taoiseach had assured the House all questions would be answered the Minister for Justice did not refer to that changed position or, if she did, she was misleading?  The Minister stated: &ldquo;In May this year I obtained the approval of the Government to set up an independent courts service to run the courts.&rdquo;  Further actions on the implementation of that decision were taken both this week and last week but the Minister <Col N="46" /> for Justice did not state the nature of those decisions, blatantly misleading the House.</P>
      <P>With the information available to him the Minister for Finance has now stated that, on the presentation of the third report of the Denham committee, the Government knew the establishment of such a board on an <i>ad hoc,</i> non-statutory basis was not sufficient.  If the Government were honest it would look to what was said on page 50 of the first report of that committee.</P>

      <P>Does it not matter if Ministers mislead the House?  Does it not matter if the record of the House is incorrect?  Does it not matter if the Government takes decisions, engages in debates and yet does not inform the House of what occurred?  If these matters mean anything then the Minister for Finance should reply.  Given that the Taoiseach believed on 12 November it was necessary and possible &mdash; I questioned him on this point &mdash; to set up the courts service on a non-statutory basis within a week, will the Minister for Finance say how soon the necessary legislation to set it up on a statutory basis will be brought before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters should be dealt with by way of substantive motion, and this has been stated by the Chair on many occasions.  Does the Minister for Finance wish to respond?  The relevance of this matter to the Order of Business is questionable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is anxious to deal with this critical issue as expeditiously as possible and the formula used recently proved successful. During the debate on the Second Stage of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act it was agreed by all sides of the House to establish the bureau on a non-statutory basis in early August and to put it on a statutory basis as soon as possible thereafter. Given that experience and the necessity to move quickly, the Taoiseach was of a similar mind on this matter.  Deputy Ahern probably inadvertently created a different impression, but it was always our intention to set up the service on a statutory basis.  The net question was how quickly it could be set up and put into operation as an interim measure.  When we received the third report it was obvious that we could fast track the legislative procedure more quickly than we had anticipated.  This is the reason we decided to proceed with the legislation.  I do not know when the legislation will be introduced but I will find out and communicate directly with the Deputy.  As evidenced by our desire to move on its establishment even on a non-statutory basis, it is our intention to set up the service on a statutory basis as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Organisation of Working Time Bill brings our laws on worker protection into the 21st century. It simplifies and updates labour law dating back to the 1930s.  The world of work has changed out of all recognition since the 1930s and I am <Col N="53" /> sure Deputies will agree it is time to review and modernise a body of law dating back 60 years.</P>
    <P>The Bill places concerns for workers health and safety at the heart of how work is organised.  It gives workers across the economy a legal right to minimum daily and weekly rest and to adequate rest breaks during the working day.  It extends from three to four weeks the present legal right to paid holidays, phased in over three years to 1999.  Next year workers will be entitled to 16 days holidays, in 1988 they will be entitled to 18 days and in 1999 and thereafter to 20 days per annum.  Holiday rights for part-time and casual workers are being improved and, for the first time, our law will specify that employers must have regard to balancing family needs with work requirements in the timing of annual leave.</P>
    <P>The new Bill tackles the vexed issues of Sunday work and zero hour contracts, issues at the heart of the recent industrial disputes in Dunnes Stores. Employers will be legally required to give reasonable advance notice of working hours to enable workers to make family and social arrangements. There are currently 137 pages of legislation, more than seven Acts, together with hundreds of regulations, licences and orders governing working time.  This Bill will replace those with modernised and flexible legislation.</P>
    <P>The need for ministerial approval every time there is a change in shift patterns is an example of outdated law which will be abolished when this Bill is enacted.  I am also simplifying the procedures for resolving disputes under labour law. There is great flexibility in the Bill to accommodate different shift patterns, overtime and work arrangements.  In general, the Bill's standard provisions on rest breaks and shift patterns can be varied once appropriate compensatory rest is offered.  Agreed working arrangements which are working well can be accommodated within this flexible framework.</P>
    <P>The European Union is not just about economic and monetary union.  It is also about establishing common standards and basic rights for Europe's citizens.  The Bill gives effect to the EU Directive on Working Time which will apply in all member states and was recently reaffirmed by the European Court as based on the principle of promoting the health and safety of workers. Shared principles and common policies are the foundation stone of the European Union ideal. Ireland has benefited greatly from membership of the European Union and, in turn, we are proud to subscribe to the principles of social solidarity which underpin the Union.  Fundamental to those principles is a core set of minimum rights, a minimum decency standard for workers.</P>
    <P>The majority of Irish employers already meet these minimum standards.  When they carefully examine the small print of this Bill, they will know they have little to worry about in terms of this legislation.  The skill, quality and commitment of our workforce are our key competitive resource.  As good employers recognise, that commitment and those skills are best mobilised in a <Col N="54" /> working environment that offers good working conditions, adequate breaks and an overriding concern for the health and safety of workers. Excessive working hours, or working long hours without a break, can damage the health of workers and tired workers can put their safety, or that of their colleagues, at risk.  Excessive working hours have been linked to accidents in the workplace, to stress, and health and family problems. A study carried out in California has shown that working more than 48 hours a week can double the risk of coronary heart disease.</P>
    <P>I have found that the greatest commitment to health and safety in the workplace comes from our largest and most successful companies.  Far from undermining competitiveness they recognise that investment in health and safety planning for their workers is a key part of their business startegy. Large multinational companies are keen to promote health and safety values and do not have a difficulty with this legislation.  They have more difficulty with the whinging of certain representatives who imply there is a poor business environment here when they believe there is an excellent one.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of misunderstanding about the provisions dealing with the 48 hour working week.  I want to put the record straight in this regard.  I have built into the legislation a substantial degree of flexibility about how this rule will be applied.  Examples of this flexibility are that hours can be averaged over four, six or 12 months, fully providing for seasonal work or a rush of overtime to meet a particular order, and that hours are calculated net of lunch breaks, coffee breaks, etc.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that the present limit on weekly working hours in industry is 53 hours a week.  Since this was set in the 1930s, average working hours have fallen by five hours a week, from 44 hours to 39 hours a week.  The working hours limit is now being reduced accordingly by five hours.  I do not think this is excessive 60 years later.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that in this day and age workers should be asked to work excessive hours to earn a decent wage.  However, the overriding principle of this Bill is that workers' health and safety must come first.  One cannot opt out of wearing a hard that on a building site.  There can be no voluntary opt-out where basic health and safety are involved.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of Working Time Bill implements the main provisions of the EU Directive on Working Time 93/104 adopted three years ago by the Community, which will have effect in all member states, including the UK.  Other provisions of the directive will be implemented by regulations under the 1989 Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act.  The directive's legal base in Community law has been reaffirmed as a measure to improve workers' safety and health.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes beyond just implementing the directive.  We are taking the opportunity to address a number of problems that have emerged <Col N="55" /> in recent times, first, the issue of pay for working on Sunday &mdash; I am delighted that Deputy Tom Kitt has submitted his own Bill in this regard. Second, zero hour contracts are being outlawed, which is a very important and progressive move. Third, holiday rights are being extended to categories of part-time and atypical workers previously excluded from these entitlements.  Fourth, there will be simplified procedures for claiming entitlements under the Act in case of dispute.  Fifth, we are addressing a loophole that has emerged where a company is wrongly named in a labour law claim to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. Claims will now not be out of time if the company is inadvertently wrongly named.</P>
    <P>Another important feature is the Bill will apply generally to all employees in the public and private sector alike.  Historically, public sector employees were excluded from the scope of labour law.</P>
    <P>The overall effect will be to greatly simplify and clarify the rights and obligations of employers and workers.  The Bill represents an updated and modern approach to conditions of employment.  It will update the basic entitlements of workers to adequate rest during the working week, rest breaks while at work, maximum hours of work and holidays, bringing these into line with the terms of the EU Directive on Working Time.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeals seven Acts regarding conditions of employment applicable to various sectors and replaces them with generally applicable legislation.  The Acts to be repealed are the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 and 1944; the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts, 1938 and 1942; the Night Work (Bakeries) Acts, 1936 and 1981 and the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  The Bill also repeals section 4 of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991.  The practical effect of this is that employers and employees can now refer to one consolidated Act instead of seven Acts or 137 pages of primary legislation and hundreds of regulations, orders and licences.  We are always being asked to simplify red tape and regulations, which is what I am doing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the number of people working on Sunday has been rising steadily. While seven day working has always been a feature of certain industries and services, for example, the bar trade, the increase appears to be due to extended operating time for industry and an increase in Sunday opening hours for shops.</P>
    <P>The most practical way of recognising the special character of Sunday is to provide that some additional payment must be made to employees required to work on Sunday.  This is the approach adopted in the Bill.  Most employees who work on a Sunday already have a premium built into their rate of pay to cover Sunday working and I think it is generally accepted that Sunday working should command a premium.  In the <Col N="56" /> various employment regulation orders the premium varies across sectors but the principle is generally well established.  The Bill proposes to set this principle down in law.  This measure has, at the same time, the effect of recognising the special nature of Sunday as a traditional day of rest while permitting Sunday work which has become commonplace in a large range of employment sectors.</P>
    <P>Recent labour force survey figures show a dramatic increase in the number of people at work, with a greater participation rate in the labour force of women than ever before.  Part of this increase is made up of part-time employment and other atypical work.  I recognise the needs of business for flexibility and that many employers require working patterns which are no longer based on our traditional view of regular working hours or the full-time job.  I am also very conscious there is a demand from some workers for part-time and a typical work to match their own personal circumstances, and this appears to be the case for many women who take up such employment. I spent many years as an atypical worker.</P>
    <P>However, the trend towards greater flexibility in the workplace has led to the development of some disturbing practices.  Of particular concern is the development of the practice known as the &ldquo;zero hours&rdquo; contract.  This practice, whereby the employee must make himself or herself available throughout the week for work that may not materialise, is perhaps the most demeaning.  It has all the hallmarks of the old hiring fair practice, and shows no regard for the worker who may be called upon to work at a moment's notice or, worse still, remain on standby without being offered any work.  Workers must be able to plan ahead for their working hours, their family and child care arrangements, their social life and their income.</P>
    <P>Changing patterns in the organisation of work and the need for flexibility on the part of the employer clearly place new pressures on employees.  However, greater demands for flexibility on the part of the employer must be accompanied by certain protections for the employee.  For this reason we propose a twofold measure in this legislation, first, to ban zero hour contracts and, secondly, to require employers to give advance notice of working hours to their employees.  Under these new measures employees will not only be entitled to advance information on their rostered hours but also to be paid for a minimum number of the hours for which they are required to be available.</P>
    <P>The zero hour contract concept is somewhat different from casual work.  It refers to the situation where employees are required to be on call on a constant basis, such as was the case in Dunnes Stores.  There has been a wide welcome by industry for this change.</P>
    <P>The legislation will also improve holiday entitlements by raising the statutory minimum from three weeks to four on a phased basis over the next three years.  The three week entitlement <Col N="57" /> dates from 1973 and has been surpassed by means of collective agreements for the great majority of employees since then.  Our latest information is that about 80 per cent of workers currently get four weeks holidays.</P>
    <P>We are also using the opportunity to improve the holiday entitlements of part-time workers and those on very short contracts.  We are extending the right to holidays to all employees regardless of hours worked, and the principle that holidays are earned against time worked will apply to all. With growing participation by part-time employees in the workforce, we want to see basic rights such as holiday pay extended to all employees.  The participation rate for part-time employees has risen from 8.5 per cent to 13.8 per cent in the past eight years and it is important to extend this provision to them.  For example, somebody who works four hours on a Monday for one employer, four hours on a Tuesday for another employer and four hours on a Wednesday for a third employer will earn holiday entitlements for all the hours they work.</P>
    <P>We are also changing our approach to the enforcement of these new statutory rights and propose to give an expanded role to the Labour Court which will act as the arbitration body for the purposes of this new legislation.  The Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner Service provide a cost effective, speedy service in which I am confident that any problems or disputes arising in this legislation can be quickly resolved.  Under the enforcement provisions an employee or a trade union will be permitted to take his or her case to a rights commissioner, and on appeal to the Labour Court, without resorting to formal legal proceedings. Working time issues such as disputes over rest times have traditionally been dealt with by the Labour Court and a reservoir of expertise has been built up in dealing with these issues. This replaces provisions whereby holiday disputes must go before the ordinary courts, as the Labour Court is more appropriate for such disputes.  On Committee Stage we will look at a procedure whereby a holiday case can be bundled in with a series of cases going before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, for example, in the interests of simplifying enforcement for workers.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are also leaving substantial space for the social partners and employer and employee representatives at local level to utilise the significant flexibility permitted by the directive to negotiate working time arrangements which accommodate the interests of both employer and employee.  Alternative rest and working times may be agreed at local or sectoral level and the terms of such agreements will be binding under the legislation.  Through this measure we are responding to and encouraging the move towards genuine partnership at local level.  The Bill gives employers scope to organise working hours to accommodate production demands and it sets out new standards and norms of protection for workers.  Competitive pressures and the adoption of new systems of work have <Col N="58" /> given rise to new working patterns.  The organisation of work is facing rapid change at every level.  We recognise this and are responding to these changes in this Bill, which is an extremely flexible instrument.</P>
    <P>This legislation will apply to all employees, with certain exceptions including doctors in training, sea fishing and other work at sea and the transport sector.  Work is under way in Brussels on appropriate directives to cover those sectors and that is the reason they are not included at this stage under this legislation.  The transport sector will be exempted by regulation to provide for a more comprehensive description of the types of transport employees which are to be excluded.  Under that provision workers with transport duties, irrespective of whether they work for a transport company, would be exempted.  The Bill also exempts employees who determine the duration of their working time.  Separate sector specific directives are being discussed in Brussels for the exempted categories.  I understand that the Commission will publish a White Paper on the manner in which those categories will be regulated early next year.</P>
    <P>In addition, we also propose to exempt the Defence Forces and the Garda.  I am satisfied that in normal circumstances the Defence Forces and the Garda have sufficient protection built into their rostering and holiday arrangements. However, due to the nature of the service provided by those two categories, and in accordance with the exemption permitted in the framework directive, it would be impractical to apply the terms of the directive to their work.  In accordance with the directive, the Bill also gives an enabling power to exempt employees in the civil protection services where the nature of the work inevitably conflicts with the directive.</P>
    <P>I am also incorporating additional flexibilities for certain sectors recognised as having such a need.  They include industries subject to seasonality or a foreseable surge of productivity and cover agriculture, public utilities, the media, security industry and industries which cannot be interrupted on technical grounds.  Those sectors, listed on pages 42 and 43 of the Bill, can avail of a six month averaging period for the 48 hour week.  In addition, exemptions from the provisions regarding daily rest, rest periods at work, weekly rest and night work may be made by means of ministerial regulation in those sectors. In effect, all the derogations permitted under Article 17 of the directive have been provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of misunderstanding about the 48 hour rule provision and I want to explain carefully what is involved.  First, the limit is an average 48 hour week.  Workers will still be free to work more than 48 hours in any given week, for example, at busy times of the year, provided their average hours calculated over the reference period do not go over the 48 hour figure.  Employers will be able to arrange <Col N="59" /> overtime to meet a seasonal rush of business or to meet a particular order.  The 48 hour limit can be averaged over four, six or 12 months, which will offer flexibility to seasonal businesses and those working annualised hours.</P>
    <P>The generally applicable reference period is four months.  That is increased to six months in a wide range of sectors and circumstances and may be as high as 12 months under the terms of a collective agreement.  Accordingly, the limit in the Bill allows for a significant amount of regular overtime, it is some 23 per cent higher than the standard 39 hour week agreed to by the social partners under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, and certainly allows considerable scope through the averaging arrangements to deal with seasonal or other peaks in demand.</P>
    <P>The generous nature of the limit is evident from the fact that so few people will be affected by it.  The Labour Force Survey indicates that only 6 per cent of employees regularly work longer than 48 hours per week.  As many of those belong to the exempted categories, the number affected will be significantly below that figure.  It is difficult to see how a measure which impacts so marginally on the workforce could possibly have the dire consequences predicted by some interests.  There is some special pleading and scaremongering in regard to this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have taken full advantage of the flexibility under the directive to allow a six month averaging period in the designated sectors and other seasonal or continous process sectors.  Averaging over 12 months is available to any firm which concludes a registered collective agreement with the workforce.  Collective agreements in unionised companies will have to be negotiated through the normal negotiation mechanism, the trade union.  Under the Bill individuals can be free to work 48 hours a week right around the year, equivalent to working six eight hour days every week throughout the year.</P>
    <P>Second, the calculation of the 48 hours will be based on net working hours, time spent working not including work breaks such as lunch or tea breaks.  A person who works for 48 hours per week probably spends in the region of 55 hours in the workplace when work breaks are taken into account.  Such an employee could spend 11 hours per day over a five day week or about 9.5 hours per day over a six day week in a workplace without breaching the limit.  Accordingly, the limit allows for quite a long working week.  In many cases that may mean workers who work a gross 55 hour week may work under 48 hours net. Those arrangements will cater for the vast majority of existing overtime arrangements, where overtime is worked to cope with normal fluctuations in the workload.  I reject suggestions that there is not sufficient flexibility in the Bill to meet competitive challenges, seasonal orders or a rush of business.  There is a great deal of flexibility <Col N="60" /> built into the Bill and if people read the small print, they will realise that is the case.</P>
    <P>It is also important to point out the limit on weekly working time is not importing any new principle into Irish labour law.  Limits have applied to working time for 60 years in a wide range of sectors including industry, construction, public utilities, retailing, hotels and the licensed trade.  For example, in industry and construction working time is currently limited, under legislation dating back to the 1930s, to an average of 53 hours per week over any 12 month period.</P>
    <P>The new legislation will change this position in two respects.  First, the limits will apply to a wider range of sectors and, second, current limits are being reduced.  The reduction in the 53 hour limit to 48 hours must be viewed in the context of the general reduction in working hours since the limits currently applicable were set in the 1930s.  The standard working week in industry in the 1930s was 44 hours, it is now 39 hours.  The reduction in the limit mirrors very closely the general reduction in working hours.</P>
    <P>Article 18 of the directive gives member states the option of allowing an individual worker to opt out of the maximum working week of 48 hours by means of agreement with his or her employer. The provision was included in the directive at the request of the UK to reflect the particular industrial relations environment in Britain.  To my knowledge the opt out clause will not be availed of by any of the other member states where it is widely regarded as incompatible with a partnership approach to industrial relations and I share that view.  Partnership has served us well over the last decade and we are currently engaged in attempting to negotiate a new agreement.  It would be wholly inconsistent with that general approach to include that opt out clause in the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the 48 hour limit is a health and safety measure.  It would be unprecedented to allow an individual employee to opt out of a health and safety requirement.  The risks associated with working long hours have been established and it is legitimate for the State to seek in law to eliminate those risks which carry costs in human terms and to the economy and the Exchequer.  Health and safety legislation is never optional.  Employees are not permitted to decide for themselves whether to wear protective clothing or to handle heavy loads.  It is the duty of the employer to ensure they comply and the duty of the State to enforce the law.  It would be a retrograde step if we were to import the concept of voluntary acceptance of risk into our health and safety law.</P>
    <P>We must query whether the opt-out clause, if it were provided for in the legislation, would, in practice, be voluntary.  Individual employees could be put under severe pressure by their employers and by fellow employees.  Employees are often interdependent in their work &mdash; increasingly people work in teams &mdash; and refusal by some to avail of the opt-out clause may, in practice, <Col N="61" /> prevent others from working beyond the limit.  In such circumstances the availability of the opt-out clause would be a continuing source of dispute and tension and it would be naive to believe conditions exist for genuinely free choices to be made.  I am concerned about workers who are unorganised or who have limited bargaining power being forced to &ldquo;agree&rdquo; to opt out of rules for their health and safety agreed across Europe. We should not lightly open the door to a system that would replace collective bargaining and social partnership which has served this country well with individual negotiation of working conditions or individualised contracts rather than the going rate for the job.</P>
    <P>The employment aspect must also be considered. As a country with 180,000 people out of work, we need to look very critically at arrangements where some people work excessive hours while others are not being offered work.  The sole purpose of including provision for the opt-out clause in the Bill would be to allow for extremely high levels of overtime to be worked on an ongoing basis.  For example, we would be legislating for two people to do three jobs.  Employment is the top priority of this Government and it would be wholly inconsistent with that commitment to include, what is in effect, an anti-employment measure in the legislation.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons the opt-out is not included in the Bill.  While the impact of the 48 hour rule will be very limited, some people will certainly be affected.  However, Governments must make choices on the basis of the broad national interest and I urge the House to accept that the Government's decision in this case is the right one in that context.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the Short Title and for the commencement of the Bill.  Section 2 is an interpretation section and defines the terms used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 exempts members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, persons engaged in work at sea, doctors in training, family members who are employees and persons who determine the duration of their own working time.  This section also empowers the Minister to exempt from any provision of the Bill by regulation employees involved in transport activities or in the civil protection services where application of the Bill would be such as to undermine the efficiency of the service concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 4 exempts from the daily and weekly rest provisions, set out in Part II, an employee each time he or she changes shift and an employee whose work involves periods of work spread out over the day.  The section empowers the Minister to make regulations regarding split shift workers.  It also allows the Minister, on condition that compensatory rest is provided, to exempt by regulations specified sectors set out in Article 17 (2) of the directive from provisions of the Bill regarding daily and weekly rest, rest intervals at work, night working and information <Col N="62" /> on working hours.  The Minister must consult the employers and employees likely to be affected by the proposals before making such regulations.  In addition, the section provides that a collective agreement approved by the Labour Court, registered employment agreement or an employment regulation order may exempt affected employers and employees from compliance with the sections of the Bill, set out in Part II, which deal with daily and weekly rest and rest intervals, provided that the employees benefit from compensatory rest.</P>
    <P>Section 5 exempts employers from compliance with the working time provisions of the Bill, without prejudice to the employees' entitlement to compensatory rest, in exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been avoided or are due to unusual or unforeseeable circumstance beyond the employer's control.  Section 6 provides that if an employee is not entitled to the minimum rest provisions set out in the Bill by reason of ministerial regulation or an approved collective agreement, including a registered employment agreement or an employment regulation order, the employer must ensure that the employee has available to him or her equivalent compensatory rest.  If, for objective reasons, it is not possible for an employer to ensure that the employee avails of the minimum rest to which he or she is entitled, the employee is then entitled to appropriate compensation which may not be of monetary or material benefit, but may take the form of provision of a benefit which improves the physical conditions under which the employee works or the amenities or services available to the employee while at work.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a standard provision which empowers the Minister to make regulations concerning aspects of the Bill and also to amend or revoke any such order, with the exception of a commencement order.  Regulations or orders must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 8 empowers the Minister to appoint inspectors for the purposes of the Act and sets out the powers of such inspectors while section 9 repeals certain conditions of employment, night work, such as bakeries, and holidays enactments.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a standard section dealing with the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.  Section 11 provides for an entitlement by an employee to a minimum rest period of 11 consecutive hours in each 24 hour period.  Section 12 provides for an entitlement by employees to a rest break while at work of 15 minutes in a period of four and a half hours' work and 30 minutes, which may include the preceding 15 minutes, in a period of six hours' work.  Breaks at the end of the working day do not satisfy these requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for an entitlement by everyone to a weekly rest period of 24 hours which must be in addition to the daily rest period of 11 hours.  This may be granted over a 14 day period.  In the event of technical or other objectively justified circumstances, the employer may <Col N="63" /> decide that the weekly rest is not preceded by the daily rest entitlement of 11 hours.  Unless otherwise specified in an employee's contract of employment the weekly rest period shall include a Sunday.  If the employee must work on a Sunday he or she will be entitled to another day off during the week.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that an employee required to work on Sunday shall be entitled to a premium payment for this work which may consist of a payment or time off in lieu or a combination of both. If the employee does not already receive a Sunday premium he or she shall be entitled to the appropriate premium payable to a comparable employee in a collective agreement in force in a similar industry or sector in accordance with the arrangements set out in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that an employer shall not permit an employee to work for more than 48 hours averaged over a four month period.  A six month averaging period is permissible in the sectors set out in Article 17 (2) of the directive such as agriculture, tourism and electricity production. This section also allows for the averaging period to be extended to a maximum of 12 months by collective agreement.  The averaging period shall not include absences from work due to statutory annual leave, sick leave or maternity or adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>Section 16 defines &ldquo;night time&rdquo;, &ldquo;night work&rdquo;, &ldquo;night worker&rdquo; and &ldquo;special category night worker&rdquo;.  It provides that where a night worker is not a special category night worker, the employer must ensure that the employee does not work more than an average of eight hours per night &mdash; 48 hours per week &mdash; averaged over a two month period.  The section provides that employers and employees may enter into a collective agreement, which must be approved by the Labour Court, which may extend the period over which the nightworking is averaged.  This section provides that where a night worker is categorised as a special category night worker, following a risk assessment of the hazardous nature of the work, there shall be an absolute limit of eight hours night work per 24 hour period.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that an employee shall be entitled to be notified in advance of the hours which the employer will require the employee to work.  Where unforeseeable circumstances justify a change in the notified times, an employer may alter the starting or finishing times.</P>
    <P>Section 18 effectively bans zero hour contracts. In broad terms the section provides that, in the event of an employer failing to require an employee to work at least 25 per cent of the time the employee is required by his or her contract of employment to be available to work for the employer, the employee will be entitled to payment for 25 per cent less of the contract hours or 15 hours per week, whichever is less.  The section <Col N="64" /> is modelled on the settlement provisions of the Labour Court in the Dunnes Stores dispute with regard to zero hour contracts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 sets out the three mechanisms for earning an entitlement to annual leave.  The mechanisms are similar to those applying to employees in existing legislation on holidays, including part-time employees, while allowing for the increase in holiday entitlement from three weeks to four weeks or from 6 per cent to 8 per cent of time worked for part-time employees.  The new four week entitlement shall not come into effect until April 1999.  Up to then the First Schedule sets out the transitional arrangements giving entitlement on a phased basis as follows: April 1997 &mdash; 16 days; April 1998 &mdash; 18 days and April 1999 &mdash; 20 days.</P>
      <P>Section 20 sets out the criteria which shall apply to the times at which annual leave may be granted and to the arrangement whereby an employee may be paid for this leave.  A change from the existing arrangements is that an employer must take into account the need for the employee to reconcile work and any family responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Section 21 sets out the criteria which shall apply to public holiday entitlements.  The qualifying period for part-time employees of at least 40 hours during the five weeks before the public holiday will be required for entitlement to a public holiday.  Section 22 provides that the mechanism for calculating the rate of pay for a public holiday shall be set out by regulation.  This section also provides the time off granted to an employee for holidays or public holidays shall be regarded as time worked for pay purposes.  Section 23 provides that an employee, or his or her personal representative in the event of his or her death, shall be entitled to the payment of any holidays or public holidays compensation owing at the time of cessor of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 provides that the Labour Court shall approve collective agreements which are concluded to vary the basic terms of the Bill concerning working time.  Before it can approve a collective agreement, the Labour Court must be satisfied that such agreement accords with the directive, that it has been concluded in the manner usually employed in determining the pay or other conditions of the employees concerned and that the body negotiating the agreement is representative of the employees concerned.  The Labour Court shall determine its own procedures and shall keep a register of the approved collective <Col N="65" /> agreements which shall be available for inspection of the public.</P>
    <P>Section 25 specifies that an employer must keep records for at least three years to show that he or she is complying with the legislation. Section 26 provides that an employee who refuses to co-operate with an employer in breaching the legislation shall not be penalised by the employer. Section 27 provides that an employee or an employee's trade union may make a complaint to a rights commissioner that an employer has breached stated provisions of the legislation or the provisions of an approved collective agreement. The rights commissioner shall investigate the complaint and decide that the complaint was, or was not, well founded and where appropriate require the employer to comply with the legislation and pay compensation to the employee. The complaint must be presented before six months following the occurrence of the breach unless exceptional circumstances prevented this. Provision is also made in this section for ministerial regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that a party may appeal a decision of a rights commissioner to the Labour Court which, following a hearing at which the parties may present evidence, may affirm, vary or set aside a decision of the rights commissioner.  An appeal must be made within six weeks of the communication to the parties of the rights commissioner's decision.  The Labour Court shall determine the proceedings for such appeals.  Where a rights commissioner's decision has not been appealed by the employer and has not been implemented within six weeks, the Labour Court, without an investigation, may make a determination the same as the decision. The Minister may, at the request of the Labour Court, refer a question of law for determination by the High Court.  Any party to proceedings before the Labour Court may appeal a determination of the Labour Court to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides that a determination of the Labour Court can be enforced by the employee, the trade union or the Minister in the Circuit Court without hearing the employer or any evidence in relation to the complaint.  The court may order the employer to pay interest on the award.</P>
    <P>Section 30 deals with evidence in relation to prosecution of a person for failure to attend before the Labour Court, refusal to give evidence, or failure or refusal to produce documents. The section provides that a document signed by the chairman or registrar of the Labour Court, giving details of the alleged offence, shall be admitted by the court as evidence of the matters so stated without further proof.</P>
    <P>Section 31 allows the Minister to present a complaint to the rights commissioner in circumstances where a breach of the legislation or collective agreement is taking place and it is unreasonable to expect the employee to present a complaint.  The complaint so presented by the <Col N="66" /> Minister shall be treated in the same way as if it were a complaint from the employee.</P>
    <P>Section 32 obliges employers who employ outworkers to keep a register, the details of which will be set out by regulation.  The Minister may also set conditions relating to the employment of outworkers.  Failure to comply with this section shall be an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 33 prohibits double employment where the aggregate total of hours worked exceeds the provisions of the Bill.  Failure to comply with this section shall be an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides that an offence may be prosecuted by the Minister.  Section 35 sets out the procedures for the preparation by the Labour Relations Commission of a code of practice for the purposes of any section of the Bill.  Section 36 is required to clarify the powers of inspectors under the Bill.  Section 37 is a standard provision relating to avoidance of provisions in an agreement which excludes or limits the application of or is inconsistent with any provision of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides for the making of regulations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, to give effect to some provisions of the working time directive.  Section 39 provides for a solution to the difficulties encountered with the enforcement of decisions of a rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court under a range of legislation where details relating to an employer are incorrectly set out in a decision.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a long and complex measure and I ask Deputies to consider its contents carefully.  It is clear from some of the comments made on its publication that there are misunderstandings about it and, in particular, a failure to recognise the degree of flexibility which it contains.</P>
    <P>For example, several inaccuracies appeared in an article which appeared after publication of the Bill.  The article criticised it for failing to provide for a lead-in period or a phasing-in of its provisions. However, there is no provision in the directive which would permit this.  The directive was adopted three years ago and it might reasonably be argued that there was ample time to prepare for its implementation.  However one responds to that argument, the directive does not permit of any phasing-in of provisions after transposition date, other than in relation to holidays, for which we are providing.</P>
    <P>A second error in the article concerned the provision in the Bill for exemptions from the requirements regarding daily rest, weekly rest and rest periods.  The article alleged that such exemptions could only be effected by way of collective agreement.  This is wrong.  Deputies will note that section 4 (3) provides that exemptions may be made by way of ministerial regulation in any of the circumstances in which they are permitted by the directive.  In effect, the maximum flexibility permitted by the directive has been incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> The article also alleged that no recognition had been given to changes in working practices in accordance with which some employees were more and more in control of their own working time.  Again, it appears the author overlooked an important provision in the Bill.  Deputies will note that section 3 (2) (c) provides that a person who determines the duration of his or her own working time is exempt from the Bill.  I urge Deputies to consider its provisions carefully when the flexible approach which has been adopted to the transposition of the directive will become evident.</P>
    <P>The Bill builds on solid improvements in worker protection already in place.  The safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, puts a legal responsibility on management to plan for safety in the workplace in conjunction with staff representatives.  Part-time workers who work over eight hours per week now enjoy the full range of employment protection law.  Workers are now entitled to a written statement of the terms and conditions of their employment.  Contract workers enjoy improved protection under the Unfair Dismissals Act and renewing a contract need not always mean a break in the employment relationship.  Workers employed through employment agencies also enjoy improved protection under employment law. They are included under this Bill also.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I steered through two important Acts to strengthen workers' rights.  The Protection of Young Persons Act strengthens the law in relation to the employment of under 18s, raises the minimum age of normal work to 16 and puts work for young people of school-going age in the clear context that their education comes first.  The Transitional Information and Consultation Act, better known as the European Works Council Act, gives workers in the private sector for the first time a legal right to information and consultation structures with central management in those firms covered, multinationals of a given size operating in at least two member states.</P>
    <P>Further progress is under way.  Negotiations have begun in Brussels between employers and unions under the social Protocol on protecting atypical and part-time workers.</P>
    <P>I hope agreement will be reached on a new national programme and that the prosperity which social partnership has brought will be further built on under a new programme.  I want to see that prosperity underpinned by a respect for basic workers' rights, particularly in the most vulnerable sectors of the economy.  The reform and modernising of our labour laws to bring them into the 21st century has an important role to play in underpinning this process.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are all aware, this is complex legislation, confirmed by the length of the speech <Col N="68" /> of the Minister of State.  As she is aware, during the debates on the Protection of Young Persons Act and the European Works Council Act my party and I were very supportive.  We had interesting discussions and introduced some amendments.  As my party when in Government agreed to the EU directive on working time in November 1993, I support many of the measures contained in this Bill and hope the Minister of State will take account of the points I raise in relation to the voluntary opt-out clause.</P>
      <P>My party welcomed then, as it does now, any measures introduced in the interests of workers in Ireland and throughout the European Union. Although described in the 16 November edition of <i>The Economist</i> as a muddle, which many people feel it is, I regard the working time directive as comprehensive.  It gives the European Council responsibility for the adoption of laws aimed at protecting the health and safety of workers in all member states.  This Bill goes further than seeking to implement its terms in domestic law; it seeks to substantially amend Irish legislation &mdash; eight enactments in all &mdash; dealing with employer-employee relations.  The main aim is to protect employees against the adverse effect on their health and safety caused by working excessively long hours, by having inadequate rest or destructive working patterns.  The Bill, broadly, gives effect to the directive on these issues.</P>
      <P>According to EU Commission figures, the average number of hours worked weekly by employees in Ireland is 40.  The comparative figure in Britain is 43.7.  It is clear, therefore, that this legislation will not impact on the vast majority of workers.</P>
      <P>As a party which has always strongly advocated social partnership, Fianna Fáil is especially concerned that the Minister of State has adopted a dogmatic approach towards the voluntary opt-out clause in the case of a person who wishes to work more than 48 hours per week.  The Minister of State referred to the need to promote social partnership. I remind her that it works two ways.  Her narrow interpretation of the directive has resulted in the director of the Small Firms Association stating it would have to carefully consider its continued participation as a social partner in the current discussions on a new national programme to replace the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> if the Bill is implemented in its present form.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister said today, I am convinced she has not listened carefully to this view. It is unacceptable and insulting to workers that she is preaching the philosophy of &ldquo;we know what is best for you&rdquo;.  The rights and freedoms of the individual are paramount in society but they are being trampled on by the Minister of State in not allowing people to avail of the voluntary opt-out clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister of State and I am convinced she has missed one point.  There is a work ethic in society &mdash; we discussed this <Col N="69" /> issue during the debate on the Protection of Young Persons Act &mdash; which we must respect. There is also the question of individual choice. We should start, in looking at these issues in this modern age, with the individual's position. Listening to the Minister of State I wondered at one point if I was living in a communal-communist state where the state decides what is best.  I make this point with some degree of alarm because the Minister is missing the entire issue of an individual's right.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the opt-out clause was included to satisfy the British.  However, the deputy leader of my party, Deputy O'Rourke, who has clarified her position on this issue, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who was Minister for Enterprise and Employment at the time, supported the principle of the opt-out clause on the basis I outlined earlier.  It can be interpreted in a number of ways, including the point of view of the British who want an open flexible approach.  However, an individual's right is part of the debate and the Minister should consider this aspect rather than lecture the House.</P>
    <P>Rather than protecting individual rights, the Minister suggested this legislation will become a major job-creating mechanism.  Individual workers are being told they can work only for a certain time and earn a certain amount and that by forcing them to work less, the unemployed will be somehow given an automatic opportunity to enter the labour market.  This is utter nonsense and demonstrates a paucity of ideas emanating from the Government in relation to job creation.</P>
    <P>Jobs will be created when the Government of the day gives individuals and enterprises, particularly small enterprises, the freedom, opportunity and encouragement to grow and expand.  Jobs will be created by new enterprises and ideas and not by curtailing the individual freedom of those currently working in the labour market as the Minister proposes in the legislation.  The principle of an individual's right is key and in that regard there is a need for bottom up rather than top down development in relation to employment policies.  The Minister's comments smack of a big brother, or big sister, approach.</P>
    <P>Flexibility is a critical factor in an enterprise society, particularly in relation to small enterprises.  The recent Forfás report, <i>Shaping Our Future,</i> stated that overly restrictive employment protection legislation has negative consequences for employment and inward investment. Employers and employees have sought such flexibility.  For example, many workers in the security industry and other areas are concerned that their take-home pay could be reduced by between £1,000 and £5,000 a year if provision is not made for an opt-out, which is permissible under the directive.  Such workers have contacted me in groups and as individuals.  It has been suggested that there is an orchestrated campaign but we are wise enough to recognise genuine campaigns.</P>
    <P>It is incomprehensible that the Government <Col N="70" /> would introduce legislation which would result in workers losing out financially.  The Minister should listen carefully to individual workers, many of whom are very concerned about the legislation, because they are being denied their right to choose the number of hours they work each week.  The Irish Security Industry Association made a comprehensive submission on the legislation and I understand the Minister of State has, on two occasions, met delegations from the security industry to discuss the Bill.  The association is concerned that, while the Bill will impact on only 6 to 7 per cent of workers overall, 100 per cent of security officers will be affected.  It made a number of proposals which the Minister rejected.  However, its most recent proposal to provide for an opt-out clause under a collective agreement &mdash; which I hope the Minister has been &mdash; indicates a possible compromise on this matter and should be examined carefully by her.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Government claims to practise transparency and openness, it is alarming that the Minister of State in recent letters to Deputies suggested that the net 48 hours working week can be circumvented by increasing the gross hours.  In a recent letter to a Deputy she stated that the 48 hours week is calculated on net and not gross hours, with lunch breaks, coffee breaks, etc., excluded.  She went on to state that a 55 hour gross working week could well be less than 48 hours net working hours.  I reject this nod and wink approach to the real concerns raised by workers in the security and other industries.</P>
    <P>The law must be clear, honest and structured to allow employees and employers to know precisely where they stand.  To suggest that there are ways around this matter is not the proper way to proceed.  I, the Minister and others rejected such approaches in the past when society turned a blind eye to various matters in relation to employment policies.  We should be clear where we stand and that is why this issue must be addressed honestly.  My party has major concerns in that regard and if that is not the case, we will put down amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor my party will stand over or tolerate a low wage economy and I advise the Minister to reconsider the constructive proposals made by the Irish Security Industry Association about the Bill.  I referred to the association on a number of occasions because its position is unique.  The black economy which exists in that industry should be stamped out.  Legislation can and should be introduced to regulate the security industry to ensure a proper licensing system is in place for all security firms.  If that were done and an opt-out clause under a collective agreement were put in place, the concerns of many workers in the industry would be met and the growth of the black economy and the number of unscrupulous employers in the sector would be severed once and for all.  There is a way forward but the Minister has got it wrong by pursuing her approach to the bitter end.  The principle of an individual's right is involved and the Minister <Col N="71" /> should reconsider how the directive, which includes an opt-out clause, is implemented.</P>
    <P>Credit must be given where it is due and the Minister has finally dealt with the issue of zero hour contracts.  I have made a number of contributions on this matter since taking up responsibility for labour affairs for my party and I am most concerned about it.  Given the unprecedented casualisation of employment and the growth in part-time work, the practice of some employers of recruiting staff on zero hour contracts should be vehemently opposed.  A zero hour contract means employees do not know when they will start or finish work.  They usually must wait by the telephone to be called to work and in some cases employees travel to work only to be told they are not needed.</P>
    <P>This level of control over an employee is totally unacceptable and I proposed in the past that zero hour contracts should be outlawed.  This is why I welcome the fact that the Minister is endeavouring to eliminate zero hour contracts in the legislation.  Employees should be entitled in law to advance notification of their working hours and employers who attempt to continue such contracts should be vigorously pursued.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with Sunday work in a general and inadequate manner.  In recent years the increasing commercialisation of Sunday and changing lifestyles have placed shop workers in the retail sector under pressure to work on Sundays as part of the normal working week.  The recent ruling by the European Court on the UK challenge to the working time directive means that Sunday is no longer different from any other day.  This is a worrying development because Sunday has traditionally been a day of rest, a family day.  I am convinced that shop workers should not be obliged to work on Sunday if they do not wish to do so.  Even in the UK, where there is a minimalist approach to Sunday work, the employee has the option of not working on Sundays. Despite promises by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, during the Cork by-election campaign, the Government has not addressed this issue since taking office.  The Bill will do nothing to prevent a shop worker being coerced into working on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>I am the first to accept that the broader issue of Sunday trading is difficult to address.  Throughout Europe, for historic, cultural and religious reasons, various countries have different approaches to it.  The Government of which I was a member considered this matter and the trade union, MANDATE, has particular views on it.  I am currently consulting Fianna Fáil members of local authorities on this issue and how it could be addressed.  Given the many retail companies coming into the country, particularly from the UK, there is genuine concern that Sunday will be the same as any other day.  We have certain traditions which must be respected.  The issue is whether Governments can intervene to change <Col N="72" /> patterns and trends.  It is difficult to deal comprehensively with the overall issue and I am carrying out a consultative process in my party.  I am convinced that as a nation and as legislators we can deal with the issue of workers in that framework. There is a move towards casual and part-time work, which is part of this issue and relates to the conflicts that arose between the management of Dunnes Stores and employees.  Opening hours should be considered in terms of Sunday trading, but there is a separate issue that can be dealt with immediately, the position of the worker.</P>
    <P>Recent figures show a dramatic increase in Sunday work, particularly in the retail trade.  In 1992 there were 209,800 people working on Sunday, in 1994 that figure increased to 219, 200 and in 1995 it stood at 226,100.  This Bill does not address the voluntary or involuntary nature of Sunday work.  Provisions should be introduced to ensure it is not obligatory for an employee to work on Sunday, particularly in the retail trade. This is an area of major growth in Sunday work where problems have arisen for employees.</P>
    <P>Today I sought, and received the approval of the House, to introduce a Private Members' Bill entitled Protection of Workers (Shop) Bill, 1996, which would provide greater protection for shop employees in terms of Sunday work, in particular the option to opt out of Sunday work.  That Bill would apply only to the retail sector where there are growing pressures on workers to work on what has been traditionally a rest day, a family day.  Such an approach is bolstered by the ideology behind the directive we are discussing in terms of annual leave where there are provisions that the employer take into account family responsibilities of the employee.  There is recognition in the directive of that very important factor, the family circumstances of workers.</P>
    <P>It seems inconsistent to accept that Sunday working should be compensated for on the one hand while on the other hand employees are not given the option to stay at home with their families on that day.  If the Minister wishes to adequately protect Sunday workers in the retail sector &mdash; the Bill I intend to introduce specifically deals with that sector &mdash; she should support the Bill when it comes before the House.  The Bill primarily deals with the question of opting out of Sunday work.  It is a measure to protect the worker.  It also seeks time and a half payment for Sunday work, recognising that Sunday is different, and that payment is made on an overtime basis.  The Bill seeks adequate notice, and I accept the Minister is dealing with that issue in this legislation. It will include sensible exemptions in regard to hotels, public houses and so on.  It will be a minimalist Bill in that sense but it will deal with an issue that arose in the Dunnes Stores dispute which has not been solved and which may become an even greater issue.  This is a concern not only for workers but for the public.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in that it brings us into line with European standards on health and safety.  It updates existing legislation and deals with the <Col N="73" /> issue of zero hour contracts.  I cannot, however, support the Minister's decision not to allow for the voluntary opt-out for those who wish to work more than 48 hours per week.  I do not wish my position to be misinterpreted in any way, but I believe that is a very important choice for the individual.  In the vast majority of cases the individual will not take the opt-out option.  We are dealing with a very small percentage of workers. Given the initial response of representatives of the business community, the Minister's uncompromising stance has the potential to wreck the whole process of social partnership.  The views of those representatives that there should be a phasing-in period should be taken on board by the Minister &mdash; she referred to that matter.</P>
    <P>There is no great rush by other Governments to introduce legislation in this area &mdash; I understand that two Governments have introduced such legislation.  Since it has taken so long to introduce the Bill, the deadline is past and it is now being rushed through.  Plenty of time should be given to discuss it and there should be no rush in dealing with the legislation.  In the interests of the business community and workers and having listened to the views of the representatives of the business community, the Minister should insist at EU level that there be a phasing-in period.  That would give industry enough time to assess the impact of the legislation, make the necessary arrangements to implement it and negotiate collective agreements.  The Minister can still get it right if she enters genuine dialogue with the social partners on this legislation but judging by her statement on introducing the Bill, I am not optimistic about the prospects of arriving at an agreed outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will oppose this legislation for a number of reasons which I will outline later. I wish to quote from the report entitled Shaping Our Future, published last May by Forfás, the agency that advises the Government on industrial policy.  In regard to labour market regulations the agency, when referring to employment policy and employment issues, stated:</P>
      <P>Given the high level of unemployment in Ireland the trend towards increased protection should be kept under constant review and slowed down where appropriate.  Any proposals coming forward, for example, from the EU must be scrutinised in consultation with employers and trade unions, particularly those in small and medium sized enterprises, to ensure that they will have no significant consequences for the competitiveness of Irish enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister say whether consultation took place?  Given that the advice of Forfás a few months ago was so strong in terms of regulations and the effect they have on the competitiveness of Irish industry, why is the Government ploughing ahead to introduce this working directive in its most liberal form?  As a result of this directive <Col N="74" /> being put into effect will any worker lose his or her job?  Will any worker have a loss of earnings? Will industrial costs increase and will the competitiveness of Irish industry decrease?  Will any foreign company be lost to the economy as a result of implementation of the directive?  I do not believe the Minister will be able to give a categoric assurance on any of those questions.</P>
    <P>Europe has been good to our economy.  We receive £2 million net per year, £35 per week for every household, but just because Europe is bankrolling us does not mean it must also steamroll us.  Europe is the unemployment black spot of the world, with an unemployment level of 20 million people, the equivalent of the population of three member states, or four if one includes Luxembourg. It is chilling to look at the record in this regard.  In Germany the unemployment rate is 10.5 per cent; Italy 12 per cent; Spain, 22.5 per cent; France, 12.5 per cent and the United Kingdom 7 per cent.  In the United States the unemployment rate is 5.5 per cent and in New Zealand, 6 per cent.  I could give figures for the whole industrialised world but nowhere would one find such a high unemployment record as in Europe.</P>
    <P>The reason Europe fares so badly in the employment stakes is that it is so heavily regulated. There are two countries in particular, Germany and France, that are very much burdened with labour market interventions and these regulations are being introduced so that they can claw back the edge they have lost in competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the loosely regulated economies such as Ireland and Britain.  They are pushing for these directiveness because they do not want to continue to lose out when it comes to foreign mobile investment coming to those countries.  Their record has been bad and they have been losing out in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to great pains to tell us these regulations are being introduced in the interests of health and safety.  I can think of nothing worse for one's health than losing one's job or £20 or £30 per week.</P>
    <P>The private sector industry, to which Deputy Kitt referred, has a major problem in relation to the black economy.  The blue chip or scrupulous companies in that industry will lose out as a result of this directive.  The average pay in the blue chip companies is approximately £4.20 per hour.  The best paid employees are in the blue chip companies. Those companies will put this directive into effect as they obey European law, but it will play havoc with manpower planning in that sector.  It will increase the costs of these companies and they will, therefore, have to increase their charges.  As a result they will lose out to the unscrupulous companies in the sector, the cowboys who could not care less about Europe or its directives.</P>
    <P>Time and again companies in that sector have made it clear to the Minister and the Government that if these regulations are implemented in this form, many jobs in the sector will be put in jeopardy. <Col N="75" /> One company surveyed its 350 employees and it is interesting to note that only one employee believed this directive should be implemented in the manner suggested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If this directive is about health and safety, why does the Minister give herself power under section 3 (b) to exempt certain categories of employees from its provisions, in particular those engaged in civil protection?  A prison officer will be able to work 80 or 90 hours per week but the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for last year indicated that one prison officer earned £800 per week in overtime.  The Minister is giving herself a power to exclude that category of worker from the provisions of the directive, yet she tells us it is about health and safety.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  If it is about health and safety it should apply to every worker, regardless of whether they work for a private security firm or in the prison service.  It is interesting to note that the average overtime earnings of a prison officer in 1995 was £300 per week.  The prison service is ridden with overtime. Virtually every officer in the service works long hours of overtime, yet the provisions of this legislation will not apply to them.</P>
    <P>This legislation is an obstacle to the private sector in particular.  The real engine of growth in this economy is small and medium sized businesses. They take the risk and use their entrepreneurial skills to invest their money in enterprises for their own benefit and for the benefit of the community because through their efforts and their risk-taking they employ other people.</P>
    <P>There was an assumption in the Minister's contribution that all small and medium sized businesses employ ten, 20, 50 or perhaps 100 workers because she referred to them keeping employment records for three years of the hours worked by each of their employees.  Under these provisions they will have to make those records available to their employees if they intend to take legal action against the company.  It is time we realised that small and medium sized businesses are not an extension of the Central Statistics Office.  Their purpose is not to complete official forms for the Government but to develop their companies into successful enterprises, thereby contributing to the growth of the economy and employment within it.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for new companies in particular to get a venture off the ground.  I note Deputy Creed is in the House; he is the excellent chairman of the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services, although with 23 committees and eight Deputies, my attendance record of late has not been as good as I would wish.  The Deputy would bear out what I am saying.  Small business people believe they are harassed and hounded all the way by officialdom.  The Joint Committee on Small Business and Services has made great efforts recently to reduce the burden the State places on small and medium sized businesses. <Col N="76" /> Regulations of this kind being implemented in their most drastic, rigid form by the Minister are a further obstacle to job creation and an additional cost to industry.</P>
    <P>It is a time of great uncertainty when companies are first established.  They do not know what support, if any, there will be for their goods or services.  They need flexibility and a staff that will support that flexibility and work the hours that are required of them, particularly at the beginning of the venture.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any employee should have to work more than 48 hours per week but if people want to work longer hours they should be free to do so.  This should be a free society, not some class of Communist society that tells people they can only work 48 hours per week if they work in particular sectors.  That is objectionable and I agree with Deputy Kitt in this regard.  If we are really interested in social partnership, what is the problem in allowing employees to negotiate with their employer to work more than 48 hours? There is little point in the Minister telling me it is an average over four or six months in the case of some employment.  People should have the right every week, even if it is for 52 weeks, to work more than those hours if they wish.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that autonomous decision makers will not have to comply with this directive. The Minister said that junior hospital doctors will not have to comply either because regulations will be forthcoming in regard to them.  People who work for the State will be exempted, by and large, from the provisions of this directive.  The Minister gives herself a way out in civil protection but what is so special about the prison service that its employees can work for 80 hours per week while those working for a private security firm cannot work for more than 48 hours?</P>
    <P>It has been estimated in Britain that it will cost £2 billion to implement the directive.  Comparing like with like given the size of our respective economies, I estimate the cost in Ireland will be between £80 million and £100 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give us the cost so she can respond later.  Has her Department worked out the cost?  In The Square shopping centre in Tallaght, for example, the cost to one company which will have to increase its security as a result of the directive will be approximately £35,000 to £50,000.  Perhaps the Minister can give me the cost but if it is what I suggest, and I believe that to be the case comparing like with like, that is the equivalent of adding 4 per cent to the standard rate of corporation profits tax.  That is an enormous cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This economy has a huge number of people unemployed.  The Minister referred to 180,000 in her contribution but the real figure is approximately 250,000.  The Minister cannot say that those who work in community employment have real or sustainable jobs.  We must talk about those <Col N="77" /> who have real or substainable jobs.  We have a small productive base in this economy.  For every ten people that work, there are 22 dependants. Of those ten, eight are private wealth creators and two work for the State.  Those eight have 24 dependants or a ratio of 1:3.  Denmark, for example, has a 1:1 ratio.  We must increase the productive base of this economy if we are to generate more wealth, more employment and better social services.  We cannot do that by putting in place regulations that do not have any benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the directive sound rosy. She talked about people having more leisure time with their families but people must meet their household needs and pay their bills.  For many workers these regulations, when implemented, will make the difference between paying and not paying their bills.  In some sectors such as private security we are talking about a loss of earnings of between £20 and £30 per week.</P>
    <P>In relation to the enforcement of the regulations, section 8 states that the Minister may appoint inspectors.  What will be the cost of that inspectorate?  Will those inspectors work anti-social hours? Who will ensure that the inspectors comply with this legislation?  Will they be forced to work 48 hours or more?  I am interested to hear what their working hours will be.  What will happen in relation to a factory that closes at 7 p.m. and does not open again until 7 a.m.?  What security arrangements can be put in place during that 12 hour gap?  Is the Minister suggesting that at 4 a.m. the security guard will have to give up work or is she talking, as I think she is, about putting additional costs on industry?</P>
    <P>When we deal with legislation of this kind we imagine we are talking about very big concerns. The Germans and the French, who drove this legislation, have very big concerns.  A large company in Ireland would be considered small in Germany.  The task force on small business showed that the cost of administering the Government's various provisions in so far as they affect industry adds 4 per cent to the cost base of a small industry as against an additional cost of less than 1 per cent for larger corporations.</P>
    <P>We seem to be taking the view when debating this legislation that it will only affect larger units. In some cases we are talking about companies that employ three or four people.  Many of them work on the basis that everybody puts their shoulder to the wheel.  People do not demand clear demarcation lines.  They do not say that a particular task is not their job or object to working more than 48 hours, yet the employer will have to ensure they do not do so if he is to obey the law as the Minister expects him to.</P>
    <P>We are very good at bringing in legislation but we are not good at enforcing it.  We know that there is a high level of fraud in the taxation system. The Comptroller and Auditor General told us that £1.4 billion in taxes was not collected in 1994.  We know there is a high level of fraud in the social welfare system and that the Department's <Col N="78" /> recent efforts to publicise that fact took 20,000 people off the live register in two months. If we cannot implement our tax and welfare policies without massive fraud, how on earth will we implement these directives?  The Minister was not clear on that matter in her contribution.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider on Committee Stage any of the suggestions that have been made by the interests that feel discriminated against in the way she has introduced this legislation?  She had an alternative, particularly in relation to the opt-out clause.  Can the Minister say whether she is prepared to allow for voluntary agreements between workers and their employers and to allow for the opt-out clause, to which most businesses would like her to agree?  Many sectors want the voluntary opt-out clause.  I do not accept that, as the Minister claims, workers will be forced to do work they do not want to do.  Does she really believe that more people will get work as a result of this directive?  The opposite will be the case.  The more regulations, difficulties and obstacles we put in the way of employment, the more jobs we put at risk.</P>
    <P>If the costs I have mentioned this evening are not correct, who evaluated them?  Has any independent analysis of the cost of these directives been done by the Minister's Department?  I wish to know the cost of the implementation of this directive, both the cost of policing it and the cost to industry of compliance.  How many workers will have to meet the conditions laid down in this legislation and how many will be exempt from it?</P>
    <P>The Minister placed emphasis on zero hour contracts and casual employment.  Some 200,000 people are now casually employed in the economy. Some five years ago, 5 per cent of those who worked in the manufacturing industry were casual employees.  That figure has more than doubled to 11 per cent because the more regulations, obstacles and difficulties we put in the way of business, the more they will move towards the casualisation of their workforce.  The quality of Irish employment has disimproved accordingly. The measure we are debating puts a further obstacle in the way of employment.  It adds to the industrial cost base of our economy.  It will not do much for the health or safety of workers.  It will not secure their employment or improve their take-home earnings.  On the contrary, it will act as a barrier in that whole area.</P>
    <P>For these and many other reasons the Progressive Democrats will oppose this legislation on Second Stage.  It would help me in my attitude on Committee Stage if the Minister indicated whether she is open to the voluntary opt-out clause which any Minister attached to the Department of Enterprise and Employment should be delighted to take on board.  Why should we say to workers and their employers who voluntarily agree to particular practices in an industry or in a particular plant that their agreement is not good enough for the Government?</P>
    <P>It is time we realised that the mandarins in Brussels do not know best what is good for Irish <Col N="79" /> workers.  It is time we stood up to these mandarins. We have asked for and received derogations from competition for Telecom Éireann to the year 2000 and beyond.  It is strange that rather than look for a derogation from these regulations and the indirect costs they would place on industry, rather than even introduce them in their most liberal form, we are to introduce them in their most inflexible form.  We are doing a great disservice to employment, industry, to workers, their families and their health and safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House.  I commend her for resisting the pressure put on her by the Opposition and various representatives of employers to water down the Bill.  According to those organisations we are always one step away from a financial disaster, but the disaster never happens.  I am not sure how well employers are served by this &ldquo;cry wolf&rdquo; brigade.</P>
      <P>The significance of this Bill will increase in the run up to the next general election.  Across Europe support or opposition to this EU directive has become a benchmark separating those who are prepared to support the extension of reasonable rights for workers from those who are not.  The British Government has led opposition to the measures contained in this Bill and thankfully its plea to the European Court of Justice that the directive should not have been subject to majority voting because it did not cover health and safety issues was rejected.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the prolonged working of long hours, for instance, is not injurious to people's health or their quality of life.  Studies conducted on behalf of the British TUC have been conclusive on that issue.  Workers who continually work long hours are more prone to physical and mental illness and marriage breakdown and spend less time with their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland those opposed to the Bill have not had the courage of the British Government to oppose the Bill in full.  Their attitudes to the Bill are confused and duplicitous.  I read recently that Deputy O'Rourke regarded the decision not to allow an opt-out from the 48 hour rule as one which ran against common sense.  Deputy O'Rourke prides herself on her realism and pragmatism. I will tell Deputy O'Rourke about reality.  The fact that our economy has progressed in the past few years does not mean we do not continue to have problems.  Some industries continue to have low and exploitative levels of pay. Some employers are prepared to use every loophole in the system to further their own ends.  It is not difficult to imagine employers putting pressure on workers to opt out of the 48-hour rule, if that were possible under the legislation.  There are good employers, and they comprise the majority of people engaged in business.  However, one does not make labour laws to cater for good employers.  I welcome the provision in the Bill <Col N="80" /> which will make zero hour contracts illegal.  It is an indictment of some employers that such a provision is necessary.</P>
    <P>There is nothing unreasonable about the 48-hour rule.  There is sufficient flexibility to allow for seasonal or occasional overtime.  The 48-hour rule only applies to a mean 48 hours per week over a four-month period.  Are Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats suggesting that workers should have to work more than 48 hours a week to earn a reasonable wage?  Should they have to work that long to earn one holiday per year?  If that is the case &mdash; and sometimes it is &mdash; the problem is surely not the number of hours worked but the remuneration received for the work.  Rather than chasing politically expendient shadows, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats should admit that the real problem is remuneration.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's position on this Bill is deeply contradictory. Within the past fortnight that party published a document on women and work. Newspaper reports on the launch of that document suggested that Fianna Fáil would seek to encourage flexible working arrangements to create a working atmosphere more favourable to the family.  I support such an approach.  Moreover, the adoption of measures such as job sharing and proper support for women in the workplace would not only help the position of women in society, it would increase the availability of employment to those currently not employed.  It is unfortunate that despite these fine words, Fianna Fáil failed at the first hurdle.  This Bill is a defining moment for Fianna Fáil.  Normally its one and only policy in Opposition, the policy of not offending anyone, is sufficient to get by.  That policy will not wash on this issue.  Fianna Fáil is either in favour of workers being accorded dignity, respect and legal protection or it is not.  In this case it appears its financial backers are calling the shots, but cowardice brings its own reward. On this occasion Fianna Fáil bought some more lucrative lunching time in the Berkeley Court.</P>
    <P>As to the Progressive Democrats, one expects no more from a party of avarice, fresh from their tawdry display of greed and intolerance at the weekend.  They would like nothing better than to get stuck into the rights of workers in this, the first debate of the week.  Deputy Harney railed against the Bill.  Her view is clear-legislation, by definition, damages our competitiveness.  This is a simplistic view of how competitiveness is compromised.  Productivity tends to be greater in higher-earning and regulated industries.  When the British Government abandoned that country's wage councils, wages did indeed go down, but employment did not go up.  The United States, the most free market-oriented economy in the world, whose performance on the job creation front is often argued by economists, has recently agreed to a twofold increase in the legal minimum wage.  They know regulation has a role to play.</P>
    <P>The directive and the Bill provide for holiday <Col N="81" /> entitlements of 20 days, an increase of five days which will have to be implemented over three years, a rest break when six hours has been worked, a minimum uninterrupted 24-hour rest period per week, a maximum weekly working limit of 48 hours, a maximum of eight hours' night work in any 24 hour period.  These strike me as reasonable proposals.  The Minister engaged in wide-ranging consultations with all the social partners prior to publishing the Bill, and I welcome in particular the support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>What is at stake here is the European social model.  Although they are reluctant to say it, the parties opposite do not believe in a high wage, high tech economy.  Deputy Harney often talks about Hong Kong and New Zealand.  Fianna Fáil is not so explicit.  The bottom line is that this economy will never be able to compete with countries in Eastern Europe where wage rates are often as little as one seventh of ours.  I am tired of the line that our tax system is at fault for problems caused by the opening of global markets.  Far too often the public perceive the European Union as being about foreign policy and monetary union, and this frequently goes above their heads.  In recent years we heard talk of subsidiarity, but that means nothing to the public.  If Europe is to succeed it has to be about more than monetary union.  It must also be about social solidarity and this directive is part of developing that ideal in a way that is beneficial to workers.</P>
    <P>The line used by the Progressive Democrats to justify their intention of giving back tax to those who are already well off is well known.  What impact do they think a reduction in the top rate of tax of 48 per cent to 40 per cent will have on those who are low paid or contemplating moving from welfare to work?  Why, if they are so concerned about the problems facing young people with low skills on low wages, is their track record so awful in this area?  When in Government they made no effort to tackle this employment trap. Would they support the introduction of a minimum wage to help raise the incentive to work?  I fear not.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which create holiday entitlements for atypical and part-time workers who are not catered for under the current arrangements.  As the incidence of part-time working increases this is a necessary and important move.  For many people part-time working gives them an opportunity to work which they would not have if they had to work full-time. Those people too should be accorded the dignity of legal protection.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill.  I look forward to the coming election when Fianna Fáil will be asked to explain its position on this to the voters.  I listened to Deputy Tom Kitt earlier.  I too support the development of small businesses, but I reject his accusation that the Government is adopting a <Col N="82" />&ldquo;big brother&rdquo; approach.  Why, every time a measure that would benefit workers is introduced, do those who are opposed to it argue that it is not in the interest of workers to receive such benefits?  Deputy Kitt spoke about the difficulties facing workers forced to work on Sundays.  I look forward to reading his recently published Bill. However, the arguments he cited in favour of his own Bill can also be used in favour of this Bill, minus the opt-out clause.  Deputy Kitt criticised the Minister for the delay in bringing the Bill forward, but in the same breath implied that she should not be in a hurry because there has been no huge impetus to legislate for the terms of the directive elsewhere in Europe.  Deputy Kitt cannot have it both ways.  No doubt the same argument was used against the criminalisation of child labour.  The 48 hour week is the equivalent of six eight hour days per week or, if lunch times are included, almost 55 hours per week over 16 weeks.</P>
    <P>This Bill simplifies much of our existing labour legislation and even if it did no more it would be welcome.  We do not have a dearth of labour law but much of what we have is difficult to enforce because of its complexity.  I welcome the Minister's move in this direction and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  Lest anybody be under any illusion, we on this side of the House welcome in principle most of what is in the Bill.  It will implement the bones of the Directive on working time agreed by the European Union more than three years ago.  For the benefit of the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil was in power at that time.  I understand the heads of this Bill, including the opt-out clause, were agreed at that time between the Government parties which included the Labour Party.  Obviously somebody &mdash; perhaps some of its partners further to the left &mdash; has influenced the Labour Party in the meantime.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil agrees in principle with most of what is in the Bill.  However, there are one or two aspects about which we have reservations and on which we will table amendments on Committee Stage.  The protections provided for in the Bill are welcome and necessary. Nobody would want people to work excessive overtime to receive a decent wage.  We are as concerned about the health and safety of employees as any other party in this House.  The zero hours contract is one about which we have reservations. Everybody should be given ample notice of working hours.  An abuse of the system as it existed was that employers did not co-operate with their employees and took advantage of certain sections of the community and certain employees who were vulnerable.  I am pleased a section covering this is included in the Bill and it will have our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> The Bill gives effect to the European Union Directive on working time.  The Minister acknowledges that the large industries and the large employers will not have any problems with it.  However, I agree with my party colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, who referred to the negative effects this legislation will have on some medium sized employers and on small businesses because of the increasing number of regulations and the increased paperwork which, by law, they will have to complete.  This will bring further pressure to bear on the administrative capacity of certain small companies.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Small Business and Services, of which I am a member, was impressed by the excellent presentations made over the past two years by various employer and employee groups.  These presentations made members aware of the conditions under which some companies have to work.  An interesting plea was made at the meeting last week by sections of the small business community who are concerned about certain aspects of the Bill, including the non-inclusion of the voluntary opt-out.</P>
    <P>A stark case was made by an employer in the security business.  He said his employees have to work a five day week, ten hours each day, mainly at night time, doing security duty for large firms. The employees are obliged, once every hour to take a five minute walk around the premises to check the security of the various places within that business and to sit down and watch security monitors.  The work involved is not taxing in the physical sense but the working time these individuals put in is substantial.  However they will not be allowed the option of voluntary overtime over a 48 hour week under the terms of this Bill.  Compare that with trainee doctors who are excluded under the terms of the Bill.  Their work is such that they have to be alert while on duty, yet they are not protected by the 48 hour working week. It is difficult to understand the reason trainee doctors are excluded while people in the security business are included.</P>
    <P>The holiday extension from three to four weeks is welcome, even though it is spread over a three year period and does not have to be fully implemented until 1999.  I would have preferred a shorter lead-in time.  Small businesses will be most affected by this legislation.  Due to the number of changes in work practices and in the work place it is only right to update our legislation. This legislation will simplify and consolidate seven Acts and more than 137 pages of legislation and hundreds of regulations, licences and orders which have governed working time for years.</P>
    <P>The Bill which contains most of what we were seeking will have the support of the Fianna Fáil party.  Workers should not have to work excessive hours to get a decent wage.  In Ireland today most workers do not have to work excessive hours and have sufficient legislative protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said she was changing the approach to the enforcement of these new, statutory <Col N="84" /> rights.  Employers listening to such language immediately question whether this will place potential employers at a disadvantage, as that is the attitude of the Minister and Government to their endeavours to encourage job creation; certainly it does not boost their confidence.</P>
    <P>Our greatest commercial competitors are our fellow European Union member states, including the United Kingdom.  In the case of the latter, we shall be unable to fight for a fair market share since they are availing of the opt-out clause.  That being the case, perhaps the Minister should carefully examine whether it is worth placing our industry and market share at risk.  Article 18 of the directive affords member states the option of allowing an individual worker to opt-out of the maximum 48 hour week by agreement with his or her employer.  Why do we not avail of that article if there is to be true partnership between employer and employee, particularly when a voluntary agreement exists to allow an employee to avail of increased overtime?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in principle but ask the Minister to seriously consider the voluntary opt-out clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill and look forward to the early implementation of its provisions as I have &mdash; like all Members &mdash; received a number of inquiries from constituents, some of whose concerns arose from a misrepresentation of what the Minister was endeavouring to achieve.  I hope this debate will help to clarify the many issues, thus offering reassurance to those who feel these regulations may be too restrictive in practice.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that the Bill was drafted with the health and safety of workers in mind, a concept all Members support.  I attended a meeting of the Select Committee on Small Business and Services last week, the first opportunity the Minister had of briefing Members on the provisions of this Bill and their practical impact, at which there were quite a number of submissions from representatives of different business groups and unions representing various employees. When the Minister responded to our questions, most people were satisfied that this is a reasonable, non-draconian Bill, the provisions of which will not constitute any huge burden on employers or create an impediment to employees endeavouring to maximise their earned income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said last week and repeated this afternoon that, even if this updating legislation was not being forced on us by the European Union, it is required bearing in mind the many economic and social changes since the 1930s following which relationships between employers and employees have changed dramatically.  Even since the 1950s and 1960s, the old ideological division between them has vanished, leading to a greater degree of partnership and recognition that both must grow and thrive together, the consensus <Col N="85" /> being that what is good for the employer will be good for the employee.</P>
    <P>The Minister repeated that, bearing in mind the huge numbers of people unemployed here, we might well hope that the provisions of this Bill will help in the creation of jobs to some small extent.  There is more than sufficient work available and more than sufficient numbers of people willing to work but supply and demand cannot always be appropriately married.  When employers examine the rules and regulations to be complied with on the enactment of this Bill they may find, certainly in the case of a number of firms, that it would make sense for them to recruit extra employees which, even on a very small scale, will yield desirable results.</P>
    <P>Most people who approach public representatives are anxious to know how the 48-hour working week regulation will impact on them.  In the case of my constituency, the first to spring to mind are those employed by co-operatives involving a high level of seasonal work and they have expressed the greatest number of concerns to me. Therefore, we are grateful for the Minister's clarification at last week's committee meeting and again this afternoon, clearly demonstrating that the 48-hour rule will not have the negative impact some had feared.  When it is realised that it will be an average 48-hour week, spread over perhaps four, six or 12 months, it will be readily recognised that the requisite flexibility will be afforded because any such rule or regulation relating to employment must afford such flexibility.</P>
    <P>Regrettably we are informed that anything between 3 per cent and 5 per cent of workers could be affected.  However, we must view the matter from the wider perspective, that its provisions will be welcomed by most, including those with fears that their incomes might be affected, most of whom will agree that in the majority of cases, the flexibility involved will allow reasonable compromise and most people's work practices will remain unaltered.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted the results of the Labour Force Survey showing that 6 per cent of employees regularly work longer than 48 hours per week.  When it is realised that this new 48-hour working week will be a net rather than a gross limit, most people will readily realise that their working week will fall comfortably within that limit.  I acknowledge the concerns of those who fear they may be affected but it is my firm belief that most people's working hours will fall comfortably within the purview of the new regulation. Within the past few days we have been made aware that an employer and employees can negotiate a 12 month working arrangement with their union representatives.  This arrangement will eliminate many of the problems and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the opt-out clause.  When dealing with European directives <Col N="86" /> one expects the demand for an opt-out clause to come from the House of Commons, not from Dáil Éireann.  We cannot have our cake and eat it by claiming all the prizes we regularly seek from Europe or lecturing Britain on the need for further European integration while availing of an opt-out clause at the first opportunity.  We must look at the overall picture in terms of the positive economic and social benefits of EU membership and try as far as possible to enshrine European directives in Irish law.  The Minister is taking the correct course of action in implementing the regulations in full.  While an opt-out clause may seem to get us off the hook it will cause problems down the line.  For example, some industries may avail of the opt-out clause while others will not and difficulties could arise in firms where employers have different views from those of their employees.  Under the Minister's proposals everyone will be working on a level playing pitch. The achievement of a 48 hour working week over six or 12 months or within a three or four year period will eliminate many of the problems which might arise.</P>
    <P>Holiday entitlements have been progressing at a reasonable rate for many years and there is nothing radical in the proposal that all workers should be entitled to four weeks holidays.  The social partnership philosophy is widely accepted and many employers would offer a four week holiday entitlement to employees even if there was no obligation on them to do so.  Most employers and employees recognise that when they work together they succeed but when they have different agendas they fail.  The four week minimum holiday entitlement is a helpful rather than a negative measure.</P>
    <P>My views on zero hour contracts are similar to those of the previous speaker.  Most reasonable people will agree that this area needs to be tided up and will welcome what is being done.  Hope-fully the regulations will bring to an end the unreasonable demands put on employees by a tiny minority of employers.  Most employers recognise the need for a good relationship and clear agreements with their employees.  The sooner zero hour contracts are eliminated the better.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to regulate the position of employees who work on Sundays.  We could devote an entire debate to the issue of Sunday trading, a matter which must be addressed by the Government.  The huge increase in Sunday trading in recent years has been of little benefit to the country from an economic point of view and has been damaging to many people from a social point of view.  From an economic point of view there is very little difference between Sundays and weekdays.  One of the factors which led to the growth in Sunday trading was that many employees were obliged to work on Sundays without any increase in pay.  It is not its purpose <Col N="87" /> but I hope the legislation will help to regulate the number of hours worked on a Sunday and reduce the level of Sunday trading.</P>
    <P>The representations I received on the legislation related solely to the maximum 48 hour working week.  I am glad the Minister has clarified the position and is ensuring sufficient flexibility to deal with any problems which might arise.  Most reasonable people will admit that the legislation is very much in line with the employment and social legislation required in the Ireland of today.  Previously employers had to comply with a plethora of rules and regulations.  The legislation will make life much simpler for employers in terms of keeping accounts etc.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to debating it in more detail on Committee Stage.  I am glad the Minister is providing the maximum possible flexibility as it will ensure the legislation works from both an employer and employee point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Court's verdict on the 48 hour working week received widespread coverage in the national and international media. The court found against Britain in stating that the legal basis of the directive was well founded, the measures being taken were proportionate to their end and the Council of Ministers had not exceeded its powers or infringed essential procedures. The judgment dealt with the legality of the directive and did not deal, as the Minister stated at a committee meeting last week, with its merits or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Padraig Flynn subsequently made it clear in an interview that it was a good day for social Europe and for those who believed employees should have the right to say no to excessive working hours.  However, in its transposition into Irish law the opt-out clause has been substantially eroded and the inbuilt flexibility in the original European directive has been lost. The Bill will be portrayed as enlightened legislation and those who oppose the imposition of the 48 hour working week will be portrayed as supporters of exploitation and sweat shops.</P>
      <P>There are many positive features to the legislation with which nobody could take issue.  Many of its provisions have been recognised for years by enlightened employers.  In general, good practice has been the norm in the labour market and the majority of employers and workers do not require the force of legislation to recognise their mutual obligations and responsibilities.  A happy and productive workforce leads to the long-term viability of a business and a reciprocal opportunity of reasonable wage structures, bonuses and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 15 November, the Minister stated this is balanced legislation which will stand the test of time, bring labour law up to date and eliminate sweat shop practices.  As I stated at last week's meeting of the <Col N="88" /> Joint Committee on Small Business and Services, which the Minister and representatives of employee and trade union groups attended, there is a responsibility on her and those groups to eliminate sweat shop practices and, more importantly, to identify them and not make general sweeping statements which appeal to the emotional dimension of this debate.  The passing of this legislation will not prevent people from referring to the fact that certain types of employment are poorly paid and that working conditions are not good, but one must compare like with like and one marketplace with another.  Broad generalisations are a dishonest attempt to indict many types of employment which cannot pay the same wages or provide the same working conditions as sophisticated pharmaceutical, chemical, computer and other such industries, which are only a recent phenomenon here.</P>
    <P>The theory of market forces does not work in practice.  I am sure the Minister and many other Members have never employed a person on a full-time basis and do not have hands on experience of the ingredients necessary for producing a product or rendering a service year after year, with the instinct and toughness to survive in a competitive national or international environment. I was amused at Deputy Bree's contribution. He may be a full-time public representative, but his experience in the workplace before becoming a public representative is open to question. His comments on business ethics and work practices were laughable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The surest reality in this debate is that if the legislation were to apply to owners and managers of industry as it will apply to workers, the 48 hour rule would ensure not only the loss of thousands of jobs but owners would spend considerably longer at home with their families than is currently the case.</P>
      <P>It could be argued that the 48 hour week is sufficiently long and that thereafter workers' productivity falls and health and safety can be at risk, but what studies and reports objectively prove that point?  Accidents will continue to happen, regardless of the length of the working week. Monday morning blues have as much to do with health and safety as with poor productivity due to excesses taken over the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the opt-out clause can be got around by collective agreements, but how will the 60 per cent of the productive sector which is not unionised negotiate collective agreements?  The Minister adopted a minimalist approach to the exemptions built into the directive.  While I accept the legislation will affect only 6 per cent of our workforce who, as a result of the nature of their employment can often work longer than 48 hours, if passed unamended it will have serious consequences for certain categories of industry and <Col N="89" /> rather than creating thousands of new jobs, as predicted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, it will mean the loss of jobs for certain categories of employees.  The 3 per cent figure, which the CSO said will be affected, was arrived at by categorising all workers as clerical workers and then averaging it.  The Bill will affect not only the security industry.  The dairy food industry and the construction and construction supply industries are also vulnerable under the directive. Employees in those industries often do substantial overtime, but doing away with it will not translate directly into new job opportunities for those currently unemployed.  The question of overtime has been examined by Governments, unions and others over many years and its elimination cannot be easily translated into additional jobs.  The current high unemployment level is also due to our taxation policy, the tax wedge between take-home pay and current social welfare rates and many other factors which I will not put on the record.</P>
    <P>Rather than creating new jobs, the Bill will result in workers double jobbing and turning to the black economy.  A category of non-managerial staff work on trust arrangements to complete tasks set for them; they are not employed for a certain number of hours.  They are not controlled by management or supervised in the normal way and they are free to work whatever hours are necessary to complete the task in hand. How will the Bill affect workers who operate on a call-out basis?  If such workers have to work until midnight, under the legislation they will not be able to start work until 11 a.m. the following morning.  More importantly, the Bill will create additional administrative requirements in terms of extra computerisation, record keeping and so on.  All firms will have to seek additional professional help to comply with its requirements. What will be the percentage payroll costs of complying with the legislation?</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Great Britain has opted out of the Social Charter and, with a cohesive and united front of professional spin doctors, paid for out of the public purse, some sectors here and in Europe are trying to portray Great Britain as the sweat shop of Europe.  The Minister of State was reminded at the committee meeting that many Irish industries are currently setting up factories in England to avail of competitive rates.  Why do we shed crocodile tears when the Welsh or Scottish industrial agencies successfully secure largescale overseas industries in the face of intense competition from the IDA?  One could argue about whether sufficiently attractive grant-aid packages are offered by this Government.  We certainly need more jobs.  Can the Minister of State name one overseas industry which located in Great Britain, because of the efforts of the Welsh or Scottish development agencies, which <Col N="90" /> she would not want located here because of their work practices?</P>
    <P>There is some flexibility in the legislation in that the working week can be spread over a four or six month period and this can be extended to 12 months, if there is agreement between employers and workers and it does not include meal breaks.  Why give statutory effect to something that can be left to individual employees and employers?  It could be argued that there would not be equal bargaining power, but can the Minister say with her hand on her heart that she has received persistent complaints from workers about having to work long hours?</P>

      <P>They may certainly complain about safety standards or low pay rates, but I would be surprised if, other than in rare circumstances, complaints are made about having to work excessive hours.  Jobs could be at risk.</P>
      <P>A long-standing complaint relates to the punitive regime applied to junior doctors who have to work more than 100 hours per week.  They are not producing a standard article or operating a standard production process.  They deal with a multiplicity of matters in emergency hospital wards and outpatient clinics, but they will not benefit under the Bill.  Neither does it apply to law enforcement, prisons, security or emergency services or the transport sector.  Accordingly, a large number of State employees are excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  Why should it be difficult to recruit extra workers in the State services and train them to do the work that is being done at excessively high overtime rates when the Minister suggests that the private sector can employ extra people to do the overtime that is being done by others?  Why should prison officers be paid substantial overtime?  For the Minister to say this matter is being examined and proposals are in hand to rectify it could justifiably lead to indignation among employers and employees in the private sector who will be affected by the directive.  Why should a law apply primarily to the private sector when a large category of State employees are exempt?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the need for conservation and sustainable farming methods, condemns the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for the lack of openness, accountability and consultations particularly with the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to his plans to introduce areas of conservation <Col N="91" /> and further condemns him for not bringing the following promised legislation before the House, the Wildlife Amendment Bill and the National Parks and Heritage Areas Bill and notes with concern his stated intention to introduce regulations under the European Communities Act in relation to special areas of conservation without prior debate in the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht came into office for the first time, few other Ministers were dealt such a good hand.  As the programme for the Fianna Fáil and Labour partnership Government shows, the Minister landed on his feet.  Even before he had excitedly danced his way to his new desk and his new Department, the Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins, already had the go-ahead in the programme for Teilifís na Gaeilge the headquarters of which was to be in his constituency.  He had similar commitments in relation to increased funding for the Arts Council and the national cultural institutions.  At the same time, he was given on a plate a plan for the development for the film industry which had come out of the 1992 Coopers &amp; Lybrand study commissioned by Deputy Reynolds.  The Minister was also in luck on the heritage front as he was the first Minister to reap the benefit of the newly formed Heritage Council.</P>
      <P>The Minister also reaped the benefits of the decisions taken by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, on the arts and heritage fronts over the years.  The former Taoiseach encouraged the first Rosc exhibition and introduced freedom from tax for creative writers and artists, which he later supplemented with the Aosdána scheme.  He established the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham.  He saved Temple Bar from destruction and created a thriving cultural quarter there.  He also removed VAT from books, and Government Buildings is one of Mr. Haughey's many monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these formed a sound structure which the new Minister was handed on a plate.  With the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht portfolio, the Minister had inherited the earth, although he is by no means one of the meek.  A rich, developed legacy dropped into his lap.  With the hardest work done for him, the Minister was in a strong position to attend to the details of his portfolio, consult about the future and bolster the legal framework in many areas of our culture and heritage.  However, the Minister has not done any of this.  He has proved an unworthy successor to the legacy and structures left by Mr. Haughey and others.  This motion shows that the Minister for <Col N="92" /> Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has behaved in a contemptible manner.</P>
    <P>What is even more obnoxious about his behaviour is how he will use taxpayers' money to try to cover up his failures.  I refer in particular to an advertisement placed by him today in the farming section of the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  No doubt, hearing that the buffalo were coming, the Minister decided he had better pretend to be more open on this issue.  It is no coincidence that the advertisement appeared on the day when this debate began.  The Minister will probably claim it is part of the consultation.  How much did this damage limitation exercise for the Minister cost the taxpayer?  It is a cynical abuse of power, especially when the advertisement omits to say the Minister intends to sign the changes into law within days.  It is not a coincidence that every Deputy received a copy of the advertisement in the post this morning.  Such measures seem to be panic measures on a day when we have the opportunity, thanks to the Fianna Fáil Party, to openly debate this issue in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been one of the most secretive in this Government.  In relation to this conservation issue, despite what the advertisement says, he did not consult the Houses of the Oireachtas or the farmers who will be directly affected.  The same story has applied to the interest groups involved with the National Cultural Institutions Bill currently before the Seanad.  The Minister has been forced to consult only at this late stage in relation to that legislation.</P>
    <P>One might wonder why the Minister behaves in such a highhanded fashion.  It is certainly not because he is busy with legislation.  None of the 32 Bills enacted so far this year has involved the Minister.  As is highlighted in the motion, important legislation promised by the Minister has still not materialised.  This includes the Wildlife Amendment Bill and the National Parks and Heritage Areas Bill, which are directly related to the conservation issue.  Major legislation in the Minister's area remains on a list of promised Bills.</P>
    <P>The railroading through of these conservation proposals is not due to the fact that the Minister is busy building his own arts and culture legacy. When one reflects, it is hard to think of anything which the Minister has originated and achieved on the arts, culture, heritage or Gaeltacht fronts during his term of office.  Apart from some photo opportunities with Hollywood film stars and writers at the Frankfurt book fair, he will have to hold the coat tails of others to claim a legacy of any sort.</P>
    <P>The lack of openness, accountability and consultation in relation to the conservation areas reflects his overall attitude to office.  Like a throwback to the old Stalinist days, the Minister believes he can make his decrees without discussion or debate.  The Minister knows best and nobody is allowed to question that.  His use of taxpayers' money today for a personal <Col N="93" /> advertisement reflects his cynical attitude to office.</P>
    <P>The background to our motion relates to the Minister's plans to introduce an EU directive on conservation areas.  This Directive No. 43/1992 on national habitats has been around for some time. It had always been expected that this directive would come into Irish law in some form, but it was anticipated this would happen by way of a Bill and that there would be full and open debate and consultation during the preparation of the legislation.  We had been led to believe that one of the many Bills endlessly promised for the last two years by the Minister would deal with this matter.  Out of the blue, on 12 November the Minister announced in the Dáil during Question Time that he would be bringing this directive into force before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>The Minister's plan to bring the directive into force by way of regulations rather than a Bill is deliberately designed to circumvent discussion. Regulations do not have to be approved by the Oireachtas, are not subject to a vote and are normally only presented following a debate on actual legislation.  With a Bill there would have to be consultation and openness but the Minister is presenting the regulations as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  This is a backdoor and secretive mechanism for bringing the EU directive into Irish law.</P>
    <P>It is questionable procedure to use regulations to bring this directive into Irish law as, like so many other things the Minister does, it may be open to legal challenge.  The courts have established there are times when a Bill is necessary to introduce an EU directive into Irish law, and when it can be done by regulation.  I do not believe this is an occasion when it can be done by regulation.  Will the Minister give the Attorney General's advice on this issue to the House tonight?</P>
    <P>The Minister is currently facing a challenge to his power to make regulations to compulsorily acquire 17 of the 25 plots of the Great Blasket island.  The plans for areas of scientific interest give rise to a Supreme Court challenge in the absence of a clear legal basis.  The Minister may be opening the State to further legal challenge because of the manner in which he is progressing this issue.</P>
    <P>The reason we are so shocked that regulations are being used is the number of people who will be affected but have not been consulted.  The directive provides for the status of special areas of conservation, SACs, to be assigned to environmentally sensitive farming and bogland, primarily along the western seaboard and on the islands off Ireland.  Most of the SACs will be applied to areas which have already been designated national heritage areas.  In effect, SAC designation will remove control of land from farmers who will have to apply to the EU if they wish to engage in any farming activity.  Primarily of interest to the EU is that the land and environment of the SACs be preserved in their natural habitats.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> National heritage areas cover 5,000 farmers and 7 per cent of the total land surface.  Under the proposed regulations, two thirds of NHAs will become special areas of conservation.  The SACs will cover 750,000 acres at 1,200 sites and will involve thousands of landowners.  Special protection areas have also been designated for particular bird species.  There are 106 of them covering 148,000 acres.  The natural heritage areas designations are to be made under an amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976.  That is the correct course as it will follow full debate and consultation.  These SAC regulations will not be subject to the same level of openness.  The level of information provided by the Minister has been abysmal.  For example, just days before he will sign the regulations we still do not know what sites are involved and if a list of the sites has yet been sent to Brussels.  The Minister is making a fundamental mistake in ignoring farming and local communities before making the regulations. Retrospective consultation is not good enough. Farmers are at the front-line of conservation. They are a key constituent in any plan to develop special areas of conservation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil favours a balanced approach to conservation where the rights of landowners are respected.  The party believes farmers have a key role to play and the development of SACs must occur in consultation with them.  We accept the need for conservation and sustainable farming methods.  Unlike many others, we are extremely concerned that more than two million acres of peatland have already been damaged.  A total of 17.2 per cent of State territory is under peatland and about half of it has been damaged.  We recognise the need for something to be done, but we firmly believe farmers and local communities should be consulted.  They must not be trampled on, but must become a social partner in the process.  The Labour Party makes much of its respect for the social partners in the talks on national agreements.  Farmers are one of those partners, but they have not been treated as such on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister's behaviour reminds me of something written recently by David Hickey of An Taisce.  In a report commissioned by the Heritage Council on the NHAs, Mr. Hickey warned that the folk memory of landlordism still lives on.  What the Minister is doing smacks of that.  He is casting himself as some sort of new Cromwell trying to take over land without consultation or compensation.  Mr. Hickey's report went on to say that to make NHAs more acceptable there should be compensation where the livelihoods of landowners are significantly affected by designation.  The Minister has airbrushed the compensation issue out of the picture.  We believe the conservation proposals must be fashioned in such a way as to ensure that farmers' incomes are not jeopardised.  The Minister must make information available on what compensation is planned and must be upfront about the issue.  At present farmers <Col N="95" /> believe no compensation will be paid for ineligibility for grant aid.  That must be clarified tonight by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A recent meeting in Galway was told the entire EU budget from all 15 member states from which such compensation will come amounts to £100 million a year.  Is that the full extent of the compensation planned?  What will it mean for individual farmers?  Will taxes have to be imposed on other sectors such as agri-business and tourism?  The Minister has also refused to disclose details of the restrictions to be placed on farming practices or appeal structures against the designation.  The Fianna Fáil demand is for a proper and meaningful consultation and for an independent appeals structure.  In direct contact with the farmer it must be made clear if the only grounds for appeal will be on a scientific basis. These issues must be clarified as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>There should be an interdepartmental approach to this issue.  At present the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry offers incentives that lead to overgrazing.  The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht disapproves of that, but there does not appear to be any communication between the two Departments.  One arm of Government has no input into the actions of another.  That must end. I propose an interdepartmental approach to the conservation areas proposal.  The Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Environment and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht must come together and consult.  The SACs could be achieved as part of a partnership arrangement with the EU, the Government, farmers and the rural community.  It could be done as part of an overall plan for economic and rural regeneration and, through education, there could be common recognition of the environmental importance of such areas.  Without openness, accountability and consultation there will not be progress.  Progress must start here with a full and open debate before any regulations are signed.  There must be consultation about whether regulations are even the correct legal way forward.  For once the Minister should address these issues in an open and accommodating way.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputies de Valera and Lawlor for using the Opposition's time this week to discuss this matter of public importance which is causing widespread concern and, in some instances, fear in the farming community, particularly among small fragmented farmholders in the west.  Coming from west Mayo I recognise how environmentally sensitive and important is much of the area of my constituency, that what has been inherited and, in the main, preserved by the rural farming community must be passed on intact to the next generation and that only sustainable farming methods will be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 92/43 will establish a common <Col N="96" /> framework for the conservation of animals, plants and natural habitats and such a network of special areas of conservation is proposed to be set up throughout Europe to be known as NATURA 2000 and, in addition, each country is required to establish its list of areas to be designated as being of scientific value to be known as natural heritage areas.  ASIs were the forerunner of NHAs and everybody now knows the background to the ASI debacle, the unconstitutionality finding by the Supreme Court and that the developers of a worthwhile proposal in Clifden, stymied for several years, could proceed further with their investigation of its viability.</P>
    <P>It was recognised that farming practices during the past 20 years have changed as a result of the Common Agricultural Policy with direct income supports and quotas on the one hand and increased production and intensification on the other.  However, farmers were encouraged by the European Union, State agencies, State employees and Teagasc officials to undertake this course during the past 20 years, otherwise they would disappear from the farming scene.  EU-designed schemes are directly responsible for these changes and farmers must not be blamed for availing of the opportunities, actively supported by Government Departments and State bodies, to ensure that their small farmholdings became viable and were capable of producing sufficient income to maintain farm families.  For the past 100 years we have seen a consistent fall in rural population in counties such as Mayo, but the downward trend has dramatically slowed and at the last Census it had stabilised.  However, notwithstanding the massive transfer of resources from the EU to Ireland to support the agriculture industry, it is recognised that 80 per cent of those transfers go to less than 20 per cent of the farming community &mdash; that 20 per cent do not live in Connacht &mdash; and, accordingly, 80 per cent of the farming community get the balance.  It is in the west where there are mainly small farmholdings that the average headage and premium payments amount to £3,500, not a large sum of money by any yardstick.  Furthermore, recent proposals put on the table during the Irish Presidency, if implemented, could have a further dramatic effect, particularly on farmers aged over 65, as could a capping of the maximum amount of income supports to which participating farmers could be eligible.</P>
    <P>Like any other sector, the farming community, in this instance, small farmers in the west, will exercise their rights and take whatever action is necessary to ensure their interests are not jeopardised or undermined and that their future livelihoods can be maintained.  Any EU directive or regulation arising therefrom transposed into Irish law must take account of that.  Despite the EU directive being passed in 1992 and assurances that there has been widespread consultation and negotiation on the EU habitats directive, that is not how it is seen from the farming community's perspective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> A public meeting organised by the IFA was held on 19 November in Westport and attended by between 500 and 600 farmers, some of whom travelled over 70 and 80 miles over very icy roads. The meeting considered the Minister's reply to inquiries by Deputy de Valera in the House on 12 November when he said that he proposed to give effect to the European Habitats Directive and to transpose the directive into legislation later in the month.  The Minister went on to advise that after the passage of the legislation he would propose the best peatland sites for designation as special areas of conservation and that no activity or development likely to have a significantly damaging effect on these sites would be allowed other than on the grounds of human health and public safety.  However, one person's perception of what activity or development is likely to have a significantly damaging effect on these sites can be different from another's.</P>
    <P>Who is the arbitrator of the standard?  Is it to be officials who have never dirtied their hands in farming activity?  At the meeting the IFA categorically denied that there was any meaningful negotiation or consultation with the Minister or his officials in respect of SACs.  The effect and implication of such a designation has not been comprehended and the general body of farmers want to be assured they will be able to continue with their activities after designation. Otherwise, the implications must be spelt out clearly and unequivocally.  If farm incomes are to be affected a compensation package must be negotiated and put in place between the Minister and the representative farm bodies.  Nothing short of this will be acceptable.  In this respect, the Minister would be well advised to follow the example of his colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and his officials as to how best to make progress and achieve cooperation and support from the farming community.</P>
    <P>I have seen the maps of the proposed national heritage areas.  Substantial parts of my county, especially west Mayo drawing a line from Ballycastle to Linane, are so designated.  County Mayo probably has the highest percentage of land mass in the country of proposed natural heritage areas.  Much of the land is on divided commonage, held in many instances by large numbers of farmers, some of whom reside and work on the land and some of whom are now living abroad in the UK or the US owing to the lack of job opportunities which could have been offered to them but were not.</P>
    <P>Some farm the land more intensively than others.  Many of the commonages are proposed natural heritage areas, but the REP scheme has regrettably not had the desired uptake.  However, progress has been made and, recognising that the REP scheme is voluntary, it is a matter for the farmer and his REP scheme planner to determine on a compliance with the scheme; especially with regard to stocking levels.</P>
    <P>Changes have been made to the REP scheme <Col N="98" /> to make it more attractive to farmers.  They were obtained by the skilful negotiation, understanding and experience of the IFA and the Minster for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and made the scheme more attractive and viable.  It will be seen to work more on commonage land than heretofore.  They include the exemption of the first £2,000 of income under the scheme from affecting social welfare entitlements.  Nevertheless, income from the scheme over that level can bring farmers into the tax net or remove their entitlement to social welfare and ancillary benefits, such as medical cards.</P>
    <P>The proposed natural heritage areas to be given a statutory footing by amending the Wildlife Act, 1976, have not caused the same level of concern as the special areas of conservation due to the fact that the procedure for notification, appeals and the National Parks and Wildlife Service approval of agriculture grants in respect of NHAs has been redefined as part of the substitution of the NHAs for the old systems of the ESIs.  It is the stated intention of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to give notice to every landowner within an NHA of its proposed designation through individual notification sent by post as well as through public notices, which appeared in December 1994 in local newspapers.  These notifications are important, not only to encourage participation in the REP scheme, but also to make good the legal shortcomings of the ESI system as found by the courts in the Clifden airport judgment.</P>
    <P>However, the provision of special areas of conservation will become compulsory.  There is no voluntary aspect to the scheme and any reading and interpretation of the proposed natural habitats regulations makes clear that the designation of farmers' lands as being a special area of conservation will have consequences for the long-term effect and legal status of that holding.</P>
    <P>The proposed regulations allow the EU Commission to initiate consultation with the Minister in the case of a site that is not included. They further provide for restrictions in the carrying out of operations and activities on those sites.  Who determines the operations or activities?  Are they to be known in advance of the signing of the regulations or are they to be forced on the farming community after they become law?</P>
    <P>Some of these sites have been known as European sites and the landowner must not undertake any operation or activity mentioned in a notice unless that person has obtained the prior permission of the Minister.  The Minister must advise on the kind of activities he considers will not be permissible on such sites so that the farming community can discuss their effects on future farming practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> The regulations further provide that the Minister may take a court injunction against any person undertaking any operation or activity inside or outside a European site &mdash; this will lead to an extension of such sites &mdash; or on a site placed on the list under regulation, or where consultation has been initiated by the EU. Furthermore, the regulations provide for the compensation of landowners whose land is affected by designation.</P>
    <P>I have only seen the explanatory memorandum to date.  I have not seen the proposed draft regulations, but doubtless they will be detailed and comprehensive to give effect to the intention, as set out in the explanatory memorandum.  They appear to provide for objections to be lodged within a period of two months and, following consideration of such objections, for transmission of the list to the EU Commission.  Who is to hear these objections?  Will it be a body of persons employed in the Minister's Department or an independent appeals mechanism?</P>
    <P>How is the level of compensation to be assessed in respect of land affected by designation?  The regulations provide that compensation is payable based on the amount equal to the damage suffered by the owner or occupier by the depreciation of an interest in the land to which he is entitled as a result of the discontinuance, or the compliance with the conditions on the continuance, of any use of the land consequent on designation as a special area of conservation.  Terminology such as this should lead to a viable solicitor's practice in terms of determining levels of compensation for those who have been driven out of their customary way of life.</P>
    <P>How are these damages to be assessed?  Is it on a once-off basis and paid as a lump sum or by instalments?  Is it to be calculated over a period of years, with the farmer in question being assessed on the basis of his capability to undertake normal farming activity depending on his age or other factors?  Is the compensation to be taxable if received as a lump sum or as an income?  The IFA and the other representative groups are entitled to this information before matters are signed into law.  Regulations can be signed by the Minister without being debated in this House.  I am delighted, therefore, that Deputy de Valera moved this motion to make the Minister accountable.</P>
    <P>The regulations go on to provide for the erection of notices on lands indicating the existence of the designation.  Is the farmer to be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of such notices?  The regulations, especially the explanatory memorandum, which I have only had sight of, raise many serious questions.  The Minister is about to sign regulations when the groups representing farmers, especially the small farmers of the west, state that there has been no <Col N="100" /> meaningful negotiation and consultation and that many questions remain unanswered.</P>

      <P>Every new job announced is in the Pale.  If the Minister of State wants facts and figures, I will give him them.</P>
      <P>It was stated in an article in <i>Business and Finance</i> in February this year that an estimated 2 to 3 per cent of the country was likely to be designated.  In July 1995 the IFA claimed it had information that up to 20 per cent of the areas described as natural heritage areas would be designated as special areas of conservation.  My latest information &mdash; this was borne out by Deputy de Valera &mdash; is that up to 70 per cent of the proposed natural heritage areas in west Mayo will be subject to compulsory designation.</P>
      <P>Apart from normal farming activity, what are the implications for the exploitation of turbary rights, the extraction of turf either to supply one's family's fuel needs for the winter or to supplement one's income, as happens in Ballycroy, by supplying turf to other families who do not have access to turbary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the implications of the designation of the entire inner section of Clew Bay and every square inch of every island in the bay, including Inishturk and Clare Island, as special areas of conservation?  Will this affect the 300 members of Clew Bay Oyster Co-operative Society Limited involved in the shellfish business in the bay?  Will it affect the further promotion and growth of the mariculture industry, particularly salmon farming, <Col N="101" /> and also the further development of wild trout fisheries with which it is in conflict?  Who has the Minister's ear in this debate?</P>
    <P>Will the compensation package, the contents of which are not known, take into account loss of income only?  Will compensation be payable for the reduction in the capital value of the underlying asset, namely, the farmland?</P>
    <P>In an article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of 2 November an eminent auctioneer in County Galway, Matt O'Sullivan, was quoted as stating that potential buyers of lands designated as natural heritage areas were being put off by such restrictions.  An auctioneer in County Tipperary was quoted as stating that because 40 per cent of a 69 acre farm he was selling was designated as a natural heritage area and forestry grants were not being paid on that portion of the land its value had been reduced significantly.</P>
    <P>Until now there has been no statutory prohibition or control of normal day-to-day farming activities but with the transposition of the EU habitats directive into domestic law and the subsequent amendment of the Wildlife Act the questions I and others have posed must be answered.  The farming community is as entitled as the myriad groups which comprise the environmental movement and others such as the Irish Peatlands Conservation Council and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy to have its voice heard.  I support the general thrust of the work of these two bodies but a balance must be struck and environmentally sensitive areas must not be preserved at the expense of the continuation of viable farming using sustainable farming methods.</P>
    <P>Members of the farming community are as entitled to be considered custodians of the environment, a function they have fulfilled for many hundreds of years, as the interest groups which have jumped on the bandwagon of environmental protection in more recent years. Those who seek to provide greater protection to wild species of birds and animals must also take into account the wish of rural farm families to preserve their way of life.</P>
    <P>The preservation of a rural population with the ability to manage their own farms and maximise their incomes year in, year out without damaging the environment is essential if they are not to undergo dramatic change over the next ten to 20 years.  There has been a drift from rural areas to towns and, particularly, to the east coast. Practically all the new jobs announced in companies with the potential to create 200 to 1,000 jobs are on the east coast.  It was amusing to read about the Taoiseach's traffic initiative when caught in a traffic jam for two hours a few weeks ago.  A blind man can see that the uncontrolled growth of Dublin city will cause major problems in terms of congestion.  As the Government does not have the political will to spread new off-farm jobs evenly throughout the country, instead of being eased the problems will become more acute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> I do not want my portion of the constituency to become a large national park to be visited for eight weeks of the year by tourists to look inquisitively at the way the native rural population seek to survive at subsistence level, and for the remainder of the year the native rural population to ponder how they can survive without the tourism dollars.  The tourism industry has not put a £20 note into the pockets of 99.9 per cent of the members of the farming community in the west.  The Government and the European Union, if they want to have a say in relation to the way the west is preserved, will have to provide the wherewithal.</P>
    <P>The IFA proposals are reasonable.  It has suggested that, where it is proposed to designate lands, there must be a proper and meaningful consultation procedure, involving direct contact with the landowner, and an independent appeals mechanism under which economic as well as scientific factors are taken into account in deciding boundaries.  Where restrictions are imposed farmers should be compensated for loss of income.</P>
    <P>In January this year the Heritage Council expressed concern at the destruction of wildlife habitats, echoing complaints from a number of environmental groups.  It was concerned that the Wildlife Act, 1976 had not been amended to allow for the designation of natural heritage areas to protect endangered wildlife habitats, and stated that recent controversies surrounding the Masonite plant, the Mutton Island sewage treatment works in Galway Bay and Pullboy Mill near Ballinasloe had arisen because of a lack of public consultation.  Before signing the regulations the Minister must enter into meaningful consultations with the farming organisations, allowing them time to spell out the implications of special areas of conservation to their members, and agree a compensation package.</P>
    <P>In relation to the advertisement, a copy of which, apparently, was sent to each Member &mdash; I have yet to receive it &mdash; it was brought to my attention that it was stated, in what I thought was a news article, in the farming supplement of the <i>Irish Independent</i> that some progress had been made on special areas of conservation.  I went through the supplement several times but could not find it.  I did not think for one moment that what I was looking for was an advertisement.</P>
    <P>On 17 November the Minister said in the House that he would sign the measure into law before the end of the month.  He has now done a U-turn for which I thank him.  This will ensure that there will not be widespread confrontation. In the recent past beef farmers protested outside the House to make their case.  If this measure is signed into law without the full support of the IFA, small farmers in the west who encounter most difficulties in surviving and receive the least amount from the European Union will bring their message loud and clear to Dublin.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera prefaced her remarks about Teilifís na Gaeilge, the Arts Council, the film industry and the National Heritage Council in what has become her consistent style and I wish to correct some untruths.  When I became Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, there was no Cabinet decision in my possession to establish Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Those decisions were taken in February 1993 and on 20 January 1995.  Teilifís na Gaeilge was not in the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats programme for Government, although it was included in their election programmes.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Arts Council, I have continually paid tribute to my predecessors who had responsibility for this area, including the distinguished contribution of former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey.  In the six weeks that I was out of Government, funding for the Arts Council and the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge was cut.  The Deputy also referred to the film industry.  Before I took office one or two films were made each year.  However, 49 films were made in 1995.  The record of the Deputy's party in that area was the abolition of the Film Board; I refounded it.</P>

      <P>It is crucial to set the context for this debate.  The need to preserve nature is now recognised at a world level because biodiversity is currently under threat at an unprecedented rate and scale.  The farming organisations, which are to the forefront of ecological management, accept this point.  A quarter of all existing species are threatened with extinction within 30 years.  In Europe 22 per cent of higher plants, 42 per cent of mammals and 52 per cent of fish are thought to be under threat and ecosystems and habitats are being degraded and destroyed across the continent.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Ireland still supports significant populations of some plants and animal species and a variety of important habitats but, even in Ireland, the rate of decline and loss of habitats and of animal and plant species has accelerated greatly in recent years.  When any of these are lost or destroyed they cannot be replaced nor, generally, restored, no matter how much we may wish it or are prepared to invest.  It is essential that we conserve nature as far as possible given its value and its direct and indirect economic and ecological values.  Increased economic efficiency has, in some cases, resulted in adverse effects, including habitat destruction and elimination, pollution of watercourses, land and soil degradation and erosion.  It has led to practices such as overgrazing which are not sustainable in any event, irrespective of their consequences for nature conservation.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we provide for the conservation of our natural heritage, together with the long-term continuation of sustainable farming practices.  These are not mutually exclusive goals and they can be successfully blended together in Ireland.  It has been done in north Clare through consultation.  By providing an environment in which nature can survive and flourish, we will provide for the long-term sustainability of agriculture and farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two most obviously relevant Community legislative instruments for nature conservation are the Birds Directive, adopted in 1979, and the Habitats Directive, adopted in 1992.  The Habitats Directive in many respects represents a broadening of the Birds Directive to the full range of fauna and flora and their habitats.  Both directives contain two groups of provisions for conservation, the direct protection of species and the protection of habitats.  Together, these directives provide a framework for the conservation of fauna and flora and their habitats <Col N="106" /> including, by the establishment of NATURA 2000, a network of sites for the conservation of species and habitats which are of Community importance.  While they are particularly relevant, these instruments cannot be viewed or implemented in isolation from broader Community environmental and agricultural policy.</P>

    <P>I wish to turn to the content of the Habitats Directive, and specifically the regulations which have been drafted with a view to transposing the directive into Irish law.  The aim of the directive is to contribute towards ensuring biodiversity through the conservation of wild fauna and flora. A key provision in the achievement of this aim is the designation of special areas of conservation, SACs, and special protection areas, SPAs, to protect the best examples of natural habitats in the European Union.  This laudable objective is one to which no doubt every Member subscribes, although I wonder.  The directive was notified to member states by the European Commission on 5 June 1992.  In accordance with Article 23 of the directive, member states are obliged to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive within two years of its notification.</P>
    <P>In the SACs and SPAs, member states are required to take measures to avoid deterioration of natural habitat and, where development is proposed, to take account of the impact on the conservation status of the area.  Thus, in order to comply with the Habitats Directive, Ireland is obliged to introduce certain controls to protect the areas which contain the best examples of natural habitats and to limit any developments likely to damage such sites.  I will refer later to these controls and what they will mean to individual landowners.  It is important first to put on the record the steps leading up to my producing the regulations to give effect to the directive.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that this directive was notified to member states by the European Commission in June 1992 with two years within which to bring into force the necessary laws, regulations and administrative provisions.  The responsibility at that time lay with the Office of Public Works and its then Minister, Deputy Noel Treacy.  When I was appointed Minister I found <Col N="107" /> that no progress whatever had been made in implementing the directive.  Accordingly, I instituted an exhaustive consultation process with the various Departments affected by the directive, particularly the Departments of the Marine, Environment and Agriculture, Food and Forestry, as well as the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I was also particularly conscious at all times of the necessity to consult conservation and farming interests.  I refute categorically any suggestion that I did not consult with, or that I excluded from my deliberations, interested parties or their representatives.  I have provided dates of some, but not all, of the meetings which took place with farming representatives.  It is particularly tiresome to be lectured by certain members of the Opposition who singularly failed while in Government to advance the implementation of this directive one iota, although they knew what it involved and were aware of its timescale and obligations.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that there has been a lack of openness reflected in the use of regulations to implement the directive.  There is little need to remind Deputies that directives are most regularly implemented by way of regulation, not with the purpose of avoiding debate but as the most efficient and effective means of implementing a provision which is already legally binding.  Let me give a few examples in the environmental and heritage areas: S.I. No. 349 of 1989 &mdash; regulations made on foot of the environmental impact assessment directive by the then Minister, Pádraig Flynn; S.I. No. 241 of 1982 &mdash; regulations to give effect to article 6 of the birds directive made by the then Minister Brendan Daly; S.I. No. 59 of 1994 &mdash; regulations under the birds directive made by the then Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>

With constant pressure from the Commission to transpose the directive, regulations were the best means to progress the matter.  There was no element of seeking to slip in the regulations by the back door, as has been stated.  Even before the Government gave approval on 26 June this year for the regulations to be drafted, I and my officials were involved in consultations with groups which would be affected by implementation of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to meetings and consultations with farming interests, in mid June this year I, with my officials, met members of the national executive of the IFA as well as representatives from Galway and Mayo.  When drafting the regulations was under way, in late September I met the Connemara branch of the IFA.  I also met <Col N="108" /> members of the ICMSA.  Throughout this period my officials as well as officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry have been regularly meeting members of the national executive and local branches of the IFA and the ICMSA.  In the last couple of months alone my officials met farming representatives on 1 October, 15 October, 21 October and 22 November, as well as some meetings at local level.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to a three day workshop, organised by the National Parks and Wildlife Service division of my Department, held in Galway in early October specifically on the topic of special areas of conservation &mdash; SAC &mdash; site management, at which farming and conservation groups as well as the European Commission were represented.  So much for the allegation of lack of consultation.  I do not, however, presume that every farmer feels fully informed on all the implications of SACs for farming practice.  I accept there are certain fears in the community, fears that have been fuelled by some less than judicious comments from certain members of the Opposition.  That is why I welcome this opportunity to seek to allay those fears and to set out the factual position.</P>

      <P>I recently published a message to farmers and landowners acknowledging their many legitimate concerns about the proposed designation of NHAs and SACs and stressing that I am willing to respond to them to the greatest extent possible, while at the same time meeting my own obligations as Minister responsible for the conservation of the natural heritage.  I have great sympathy for them.  At the end of one meeting they said that they believed progress had been made in a whole range of areas.  I also confirmed that I will publish information which should help to clarify the issues and answer questions for farmers and landowners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me turn to the content of these regulations and their implications.  I reiterate that SACs and special protection areas &mdash; SPAs &mdash; for birds are required to be established and protected under the habitats and birds directives.  SPAs have been in existence for some time and more than 100 have been designated to date.  When the regulations take effect the process of designation of SACs will begin and the sites proposed for designation will be publicly advertised.  Every effort will be made to contact individual landowners and users who will be provided with descriptions and maps of the sites proposed for designation and details of the restrictions in farming practices, if any, that arise as a result.  Landowners-users will have two months during which they may dispute the scientific basis for proposed designations.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputies that the habitats directives only allows scientific bases for disputing these proposals.  I, as Minister, do not have discretion to consider economic arguments.  I have, however, sought to create as transparent a system of designation as possible.  If, for example, a landowner or user disputes the designation he may contact the National Parks and Wildlife Serve stating his grounds.  I hope most objections can be resolved at that stage.  If the matter is still unresolved to the satisfaction of the landowner-user he may appeal to me as Minister, again only on scientific grounds.  I propose, however, to put in place an advisory group to assist me in dealing with such appeals.  I propose that such advisory group might consist of three members, a nominee of farming interests, a nominee of conservation interests and my own nominee.</P>
      <P>The main question of interest to farmers and their representatives is the impact designations may have on farming practice.  The first and fundamental point is that it is not the intention of the directive, and certainly not my intention, to drive farmers off their land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers have, over generations, by their traditional farming practices, created and maintained the habitats now being protected and without continued farming activity in these areas conservations cannot succeed.  In some cases, however, SAC designation will mean that farming practices in the area will be controlled in some way, although in many cases such designation will involve no change to farming practice.  Where restrictions <Col N="110" /> are required farmers and landowners can be assured they will be practical and sensible.  For example, the conditions applied to blanket bogs, heaths and upland grasslands within SACs-SPAs will be identical to those recently agreed for the rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; in NHAs by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltachta, farming organisations, Teagasc and private REPS planners.</P>
      <P>Any project or development which could impact on a NATURA 2000 site must be examined and its potential impact assessed. Where a site contains a habitat identified as priority within the terms of the directive, a project which would have a negative impact can be permitted only with the agreement of the European Commission.  In other habitats I as Minister can allow projects with negative impacts to proceed only for reasons of overriding public interest.  Ministers of the Government, planning authorities and other State bodies must have regard to the provisions of the directive in assessing applications for licences, permits and planning permission.</P>
      <P>I turn now to an element of the regulations which is still the subject of discussions with the farming organisations, namely, compensation for changes in farming practices required as a result of SPA or SAC designation.  The issue here is appropriate compensation taking into account any loss suffered by the landowner or user &mdash; that is on the agenda of tomorrow's meeting.  There have been lengthy discussions between my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry with a view to producing a coherent and equitable package.  I am optimistic that agreement on this package can be achieved before Christmas.  However, to give plenty of time for these issues to be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties, I am prepared to give an undertaking that these regulations will not come into operation until the beginning of February next year.</P>

This has informed my approach to statements in this House and it is a practice I have <Col N="111" /> sought to honour in my dealings with those who are concerned for and affected by both environmental and cultural issues.</P>
      <P>In the context of the habitats directive the first batch of notices containing proposed SAC designations will issue early in February.  These will consist, in the main, of sites which host priority habitats such as blanket and raised bogs, turloughs, machair and sand dunes.  Farmers will then have a period of two months in which to consider an objection to the designation on scientific grounds.</P>

Gan comhoibriú gníomhach ó fheirmeoirí, ní éireoidh linn na gnáthóga sin a chosaint amach anseo.  The farmers created the very thing we want to protect and their co-operation is vital in bringing it to a happy resolution.</P>
      <P>As Minister I am well aware that farmers are concerned about designations and their consequences.  It is my policy to keep those affected by environmental designations fully informed at all times and to achieve the maximum possible degree of consultation.  I hope that what I have outlined here will allay some of these fears.  I reiterate further that restrictions will be imposed only where this is absolutely necessary for conservation.  Flexibility will be shown, and compromise reached, to the maximum extent possible.  We have arrived at an historic point where farmers are recognised as the custodians of the environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was reared on a small farm, I still live in a rural community and I have more contact with farmers than the Minister.  I am amazed that in all the meetings the Minister attended, he has not attended many public meetings.  I refer in particular to the meeting organised by the IFA in Galway on 11 November which highlighted the need for that organisation to have all available information on the question of national heritage areas and the forthcoming proposals on special areas of conservation.  I hope the Minister makes some progress in his negotiations, the majority of which have taken place in Mespil Road, but it is important that he attends public meetings on the issues concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a reply to a question tabled by me last week the Minister used the word &ldquo;transposition&rdquo;&mdash; he also used it in his contribution this evening.  He stated in the reply that the transposition was in its final stage of preparation and that all candidate SACs would be publicly advertised after the transposition occurs.  This is the issue that concerns us this evening; what is happening with SACs?  The issue was brought to my notice <Col N="113" /> by the IFA at the meeting in Galway on 11 November.  I hope the Minister can give us some information in that regard.  Mr. Michael Slattery, Deputy President of the IFA, stated at the meeting that 20,000 farmers were involved &mdash; 750,000 hectares &mdash; and because of their concern there was a need for an answer from the Minister. So far that has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The message to all farmers and landowners in the farming supplement of today's <i>Irish Independent</i> is the first time the Minister has indicated he intends to address the three &ldquo;Cs&rdquo;. On the issue of compromise in the message the Minister states: &ldquo;I have indicated my willingness to discuss the constitution of an appeals system and my officials will be talking to farming organisations over the coming weeks in this regard&rdquo;.  That is the first time to my knowledge the Minister indicated that.</P>

These facts were brought to our attention by the IFA and nobody in the Minister's Department has denied them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting in Galway the Office of Public Works made an excellent presentation.  Its <Col N="114" /> representatives could not answer all the questions but they did their best.  They are awaiting some direction from the Minister.  There were excellent presentations also from the National Association of Regional Game Councils and from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>We have a crisis in agriculture and the Minister would know more about it if he attended public meetings.  I meet the Minister of State at most meetings and his presence is welcome. Unfortunately he always says he does not have any money but his heart is in the right place.</P>
    <P>Farmers are losing confidence in the Government because of problems created by the BSE crisis and those involving our trade with countries such as Russia, Iran, Libya and Egypt. These proposed regulations regarding NHAs and SACs are the last straw.</P>
    <P>Mr. Desmond Crofton, the director of the National Association of Regional Game Councils, stated that the French Government had decided to put a freeze on the national implementation of the habitats directive.  I would like the Minister to respond to that.  Mr. Crofton quoted from an article published by the Heritage Council.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The impetus to put in place a range of environmental policies has come mainly from the European Union and not from Irish administrations.  Thus, Ireland is reluctantly adopting the environmental policies of its northern European neighbours as a quid pro quo for the economic benefit of membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Sargent does not take offence but Mr. Crofton concluded his speech by stating: &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, if we sacrifice our traditions and part of our Irishness in return for EU money, we will be no more than cultural prostitutes with the European Greens as our clients and our own Government as our pimp&rdquo;. That is a very striking comment from the National Association of Regional Game Councils and very strong feelings were expressed at the meeting.  The Minister has, perhaps for the first time, decided to give us a little breathing space.  I ask him to delay action and to have consultation.</P>
    <P>The question of compensation is important.  We know there will be extra payments, but farmers from the Minister's constituency in Connemara have asked what will happen after the five years of REPS.  There is no indication that there will be further compensation.  It is most important that there is willingness to compromise.  I hope the Minister has indicated he will do that.  If so, this is the first time I have heard him say so and it is the only way we will come to a resolution. Farmers are worried about their future and the many issues facing them and NHAs and SACs would cause further difficulties for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Conservation is of fundamental importance to the future of farming and tourism and to our future.  This area has proven difficult <Col N="115" /> because we have not been able to reach a balanced outcome in many situations; this is one of them.  Sometimes people who are most deeply and genuinely committed to conservation do the most damage.  Their actions frequently cause more damage than might have been caused by what had originally offered them.  I will not say the Minister always does that, or even that he does so in this instance.</P>
      <P>This debate offers an opportunity to strike a better balance.  There is a need to set the tone of the debate in terms of improving the Minister's proposals.  It will not be possible in the long term to hide behind EU directives in areas such as this. I suspect many people are coming to the conclusion that EU directives are in many instances daft and unnecessary and do not reflect the reality of their lives but rather damage the quality of their lives and undermine their ability to make a living.  Ultimately that is the proposition put before us tonight by Deputies de Valera and Lawlor.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House see the manner in which this issue has been approached as negative and damaging.  It may undermine the ability of farmers, particularly in the west, to make a living in the traditional way.  The sometimes self-appointed protectors of the environment have in many instances ridden roughshod over local people and farmers alike. There is a fear in the farming community, particularly in places where they have had experience of this that people who have conservation as their motto and who may be genuinely concerned have the capacity to do enormous damage.  We must look at transposing this directive into regulations in that context. That is the context in which farmers look at it.</P>
      <P>We must also look at this directive in the context of the west where smaller landholders feel that neither Government, political leadership nor farming leadership represents their views. The entire issue of conservation and the environment has been hijacked by individual politicians and by entire political parties who have frequently jumped on the bandwagon to achieve their own ends and damage has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, who put the motion before the House, the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, who also represents my constituency and the Minister, Deputy Higgins, who is very familiar with it, are aware of what happened in the Burren national park.  There are lessons for everybody in what happened there.  There are, in particular, lessons for those who genuinely attempt to protect the environment.  I heard a member of the Burren action group on local radio this morning berating the Minister's current proposals.  For those who do not know, the Burren action group opposed the centre at the national park.  It would have considered the Minister to be one of its supporters but that was not the impression given on the radio this morning.  The spokesperson for <Col N="116" /> the local community, those who support the centre, was somewhat bemused by the moving goalposts.</P>
    <P>Among my neighbours, whom I know very well and whose opinions I am aware of, much damage has been done.  They believe their views are considered to be of no value by the Government or by those who put forward strong theories on conservation.  They feel not so much ignored as insulted and mistreated.  In the context in which those who promote conservation ultimately damage it, I bring forward the example of my own area partly because it is a national park and mentioned both in the proposal and in the amendment but also because it illustrates where we finish up when we take action without adequate consultation with local people who are involved, particularly when we know their views and are seen to ignore them.</P>
    <P>The great danger in this instance is that farmers may feel and perhaps already feel that what is involved here will impinge on their ability to make their living, that they will lose part of their income and that will not be adequately compensated.  That is a key issue.  It is all very well for those of us who are not directly involved to have high ideals about what should and should not be conserved, but these people live in these areas and try to make their living in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The farming community has particular difficulties at the moment in relation to milk quotas, the BSE crisis and the prices they are paid for their produce.  The last thing farmers need is the imposition of a regime by an arm of State which further undermines their ability to make a living from their land.  It is important the Minister has the opportunity to say this is not intended, to say there is room for consultation, compensation and to set an agenda of realism in relation to the people who are required to make these sacrifices.</P>
    <P>People in rural areas who have preserved this great environment up to now feel they have not received credit for it.  They feel that they will be left out of the equation in the future.  That is why it is a pity all this was not covered in legislation which would have allowed far more opportunity to debate the issues.</P>
    <P>As the Burren is a national park it will obviously be affected by whatever Bill is introduced.  The Minister would do well to consider leaving this for his successor because, partly through his own fault and partly through the fault of others, the Minister's acceptability in the national parks area is not what it might be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>They might be remembered, but for the wrong reasons.  Having been born and reared in that community, I know that among the people there a sense of good will existed towards the State until about five years ago.  However, this has been undermined.  Nobody set out to achieve <Col N="117" /> that, but that is the result, and the more the Minister imposes solutions and ignores the wishes of the people, as he did in this case, the further down the road we will be to confrontation and to losing the good will of the very people who have up to now preserved these areas of importance.</P>
      <P>Besides the damage the conservation lobby may have done, albeit unwittingly, damage has been done as a result of allowing a number of EU directives to stack up because nobody was sure how they should be handled.  We have been exemplary Europeans in accepting the letter of European law.  While most of our European partners showed imagination and fitted directives to their own needs, we have not done that.  The Minister may say that is the fault of his predecessors.  However, he has been in office for four years, and knew that unless action was taken on these directives the EU would come after us. The EU went after the Spanish in relation to the birds directive, and they were not the only ones; many of our partners have shown scant regard for elements of directives that did not suit them.  We could have teased out these directives and reached a resolution which would have better suited the Irish situation.  I have no doubt that the various directives on natural heritage areas, special areas of conservation and half a dozen others, could be adequately and perhaps more than adequately adhered to, if they had been publicly discussed.  To some extent we have been highlighting the downside of the regulations but there may be some advantages, even in the short term.  In the overall scheme of things in terms of conservation there certainly will be a huge bonus some time in the future in doing what is best for the environment, perhaps not for us, but for the people who come after us, but it cannot be done by trampling on the people who currently conserve the environment, the farming people who have looked after the land for generations and who, unlike the rest of us, depend for their income on it.</P>
      <P>Thirty-eight regulations arise from this directive.  Some are far-reaching, and not very clear in terms of their long-term implications.  I can understand why farmers might be worried, why they might want to know how much compensation will be on offer, and exactly what the implications of this regulation will be. Nowadays people can hardly afford to say they are satisfied that they will have REPS payments for the next four or five years.  They need to know that their compliance with Government and EU regulations will not have the effect of undermining the livelihood in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approaching a problem of this magnitude by way of regulation is singularly inappropriate.  I have no doubt that the Minister looked at the possibility of drawing up a Bill and had his own reasons for deciding that this is the way to proceed.  Already there is strong evidence in places like west Mayo that people are grossly dissatisfied with the manner in which this is being done.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not <Col N="118" /> indicated that he will consider introducing legislation rather than regulations, because this issue is bigger than anybody seems to realise and has long-term implications in terms of retaining the good will of the people who will have to implement it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the birds directive which deals with special protection areas.  Even for those of us who deal with these matters frequently it is difficult to know exactly what the implications will be.  A very large proportion of the Shannon estuary has been or is about to be designated under the birds directive.  People living in that area are under the impression that the Government thinks birds are more important than people along the Shannon estuary.  There may be places where birds are more important than people, but if one looks at a map of the Shannon estuary one will see that a huge area appears to be designated under the special protection areas.  One has to wonder how much common sense was brought to bear when drawing them up, and what the implications for development are.</P>
    <P>When one group had finished berating the Minister, a Fine Gael MEP expressed concern about development on the Shannon estuary.  He called for the publication of a plan for development in the Shannon estuary which was drawn up at the behest of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  I had a particular interest in two or three elements of that plan which I had hoped to see implemented. Unfortunately they are not being actively promoted at present.  I had to laugh at the idea that a Fine Gael MEP should call for publication and action on this while at the same time special protection areas for birds are being designated on over 80 per cent of an area that the well-meaning MEP would like to see developed.</P>
    <P>We are gradually tying ourselves in knots by leaving all kinds of EU regulations until the last minute, and only then implementing by way of legislation or regulation, not having thought through the long-term implications for Ireland as a sovereign State.  We have people with the ability to deal with this issue at our own level. Kowtowing to the European Union is not the way to conduct the business of this State.  It is, perhaps, a bit late in the day for this directive, but if it is not, I urge the Minister to undertake a complete review of the manner in which conservation and environment directives are transposed into Irish law.  That needs to be done urgently.  I very much doubt if there is justification for having two thirds of national heritage areas converted into special areas of conservation.  That would involve a large amount of territory, affecting very many farmers, and more and more people will be grossly dissatisfied with the manner in which this is being done.  In that respect I welcome the tone of the Minister's advertisement and the letter sent to TDs and I hope what it promises will happen.  I suspect we would not have seen it were it not for this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first occasion on which I have raised my serious concerns about the apparent hands-off approach to this dispute.  There has been a certain aloofness in the attitude of the Minister and the Government to the pay negotiation.  The Minister may have been justified in the past in saying he wanted to stay away from the conciliation and arbitration machinery while unions balloted their members.  Now that the pay offer has been rejected twice, the time has come when the Minister must step in.  Perhaps he has already decided to do that.  The nurses' unions throughout the country are calling for intervention by the Minister.  He must respond to that request and hold a direct meeting with the Nursing Alliance.</P>
      <P>There are 26,000 nurses who have a strong case to make regarding their pay and conditions which have fallen seriously behind.  They have put up with a lack of progress on their pay and conditions and have been prepared to take on board the various changes in the structure of nursing without getting adequate recognition.</P>
      <P>If the national strike goes ahead, as seems increasingly likely, the health service will grind to a halt, probably within hours of its commencement depending on how it proceeds. The chaos that will result is unthinkable.  The Minister must act now while there is still time.  A strike here will undermine social partnership and shatter the chances of getting another national agreement which would be bad for the State.</P>
      <P>The nurses' dispute has been badly handled. Aloofness from the negotiations was a miscalculation and reduced the chances of a settlement but the intervention by the Minister for Finance in the dispute on 10 November, when he told the nurses they had made a grave or a gross error of judgement, was a serious mistake. It did not help the Minister for Health but most particularly it did not help the nurses' unions.  His comments insulted nurses who work under increasing and immense pressure and hardened attitudes in the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution of the 26,000 nurses must be recognised in their pay and conditions.  Their aspirations in relation to pay and conditions can be met within the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  In the past, as my colleague, Deputy Ahern, said recently on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which were much <Col N="120" /> more stringently controlled than is the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, radiographers, dental assistants, fire brigade staff and hospital doctors could be accommodated and their pay and conditions were improved despite the stringent financial controls.</P>
    <P>Nurses are the people in the health service who are at the coalface.  The Minister must recognise that.  They are the people who take abuse from the patients and from the families of the patients. They are the people in charge.  A ward sister in a hospital is like the manager of a small or medium sized enterprise.  She is responsible for the patients, visitors, staff nurses, paramedics, consultants who visit the ward and for doctors. Nurses who study for an extra qualification get no recognition for it.  The Minister and I who are former teachers know that if we were prepared, after we qualified, to go on for extra education it would be recognised.  The pay and conditions of nurses should warrant a response from a Government which recognises the stressful work they do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am obliged to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for affording me this opportunity to set out the current position on nurses' pay.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, following discussions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, proposals on the settlement of the claim by nurses under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> were agreed.  These proposals provided for significant increases including an increase of 14 per cent approximately in the maximum of the scale for staff nurses, bringing it to £20,350.  This improvement, when combined with premium payments, would result in an experienced staff nurse typically earning £25,000 per annum in respect of a normal 39 hour week.  In addition the proposals provided for a whole range of non-pay improvements, for example, in relation to the position of temporary nurses and commitments in regard to developments in nursing education.  The Nursing Alliance &mdash; composed of the four unions the INO, the Psychiatric Nurses Association, IMPACT and SIPTU &mdash; recommended acceptance of these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As these proposals were not accepted both the nurses' unions and the management subsequently agreed to refer outstanding issues to an independent adjudication board.  This mechanism, involving referral to an independent third party, formed one element of the framework agreed between Government and ICTU to address outstanding problems among various groups of public service employees under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  It was also envisaged that, as in any other analogous industrial relations situation, this adjudication process would represent the final stage of processing of the nurses' claims.  Both sides entered into the adjudication process on this <Col N="121" /> basis.  The adjudication board addressed all of the outstanding issues identified by the unions.</P>
    <P>The adjudication board found in favour of the nurses in recommending a series of significant improvements to the earlier offer, including a pilot scheme of early retirement, bringing forward the date of payment of increases for some grades, further reviews of the position of nursing managers and tutors and continuation of certain allowances.  The improved arrangements for temporary nurses involved permanent appointments immediately for a total of 1,700 temporary nurses with a commitment to convert further posts to permanent status following a joint review.</P>
    <P>These extended proposals obviously would have required additional expenditure, which the Government was fully prepared to support, on the basis that the proposals had been recommended by an independent adjudication board and on the understanding that the unions would feel similarly bound to accept the outcome of the independent third-party adjudication.  The Government indicated clearly that the revised set of proposals represented the absolute limit of what would be affordable within the most generous interpretation of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> parameters.</P>
    <P>The Nursing Alliance again recommended acceptance.  However, in a further ballot the proposals were accepted by nurses represented by SIPTU and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA and rejected by nurses represented by the Irish Nurses' Organisation, INO, and IMPACT.  The executive of the Irish Nurses' Organisation is due to meet tomorrow, 27 November 1996, to consider formally implementing a ballot of its members for industrial action.  I would not wish, in anything I say tonight, to pre-empt the decision of the INO executive.</P>
    <P>I have received no recent request from the Irish Nurses' Organisation or the other unions involved for a meeting.  However, I have responded positively to all previous requests.</P>
    <P>I would be deeply concerned at the impact of strike action on the health service and on the patients in its care.  It is also clear that an industrial action of the type now apparently being contemplated by the INO would have very serious ramifications for the prospects of any new pay agreement based on social partnership.  For these reasons I again appeal to the leadership of the Irish Nurses' Organisation and the other nursing unions, with the assistance of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to reconsider their strategy and to adopt an approach more in keeping with the partnership model of industrial relations.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having selected this topic for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> The matter to which I refer is the impending closure, announced two weeks ago, of Irish Crown Cork Company Limited, with the loss of 110 jobs.  Will the Minister for Health inform me what action has been taken by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment within those two weeks to avert this closure?  Has the Minister been in receipt of a report from the IDA on the matter?  Has the Minister or any official of his Department visited the plant to assess the position?  Did the Minister or any of his officials travel to the United States in an attempt to persuade the parent company to reconsider its decision or did the Minister just wash his hands of the whole matter like a latter day Pontius Pilate?</P>
    <P>What would the Minister for Enterprise and Employment have done if this or a similar plant had been located in his constituency?  The workforce at Cork Crown comprises mainly women, the majority of whom are the sole breadwinners in their households.  What kind of Christmas will these workers and their families have?  It is particularly poignant that the doors of that factory are due to close on 20 December, five days before Christmas, when all families endeavour to provide a little extra for their children.  Yet those 110 families are being condemned to having a little less.  Somehow it smacks of the worst practices of the 19th century.</P>
    <P>Unemployment in the Churchfield area of Cork stood at 41 per cent prior to the announcement of this closure.  Moreover, unemployment in Cork City has risen by 2 per cent in the past year and has increased constantly in the three years 1994, 1995 and again this year so far.  This is in sharp contrast with what we are told is happening in other regions where we hear frequently of new industries being located and many new jobs being created.  Not alone is Cork not getting any new jobs, it is losing existing ones, the retention of existing jobs is just as important as creating new jobs.  Unemployment on the north side of Cork city stands at approximately 28 per cent while unemployment on the south side stands at 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to urge his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to take immediate action.  He must direct the IDA to double its efforts to salvage this industry.  If such efforts fail, he must immediately find an alternative industry for the plant on that site. Moreover, he must instruct the IDA to adopt a hands-on approach in obtaining additional new industries for the Jobstart on the north side of Cork city.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Health to use his influence with the Minister for the Environment to have work started on the Blackpool bypass, an essential precondition to the development of the north side of Cork city.  Unless that bypass is constructed the north side of Cork city will <Col N="123" /> continue to be bypassed by domestic and overseas job-creating investors.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>Irish Crown Cork Company Ltd, has been in Ireland since the 1930s.  The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cork Crown and Seal Inc. Philadelphia, USA, one of the largest manufacturers of metal packaging in the United States and the leading can and closure company worldwide.  The company manufactures aluminium easy open beverage ends for export which account for over 80 per cent of total output, the balance of output being the manufacture of food cans for the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The company has already announced its intention to cease production by 20 December 1996 and has informed the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Industrial Development Authority that the closure of the Cork plant, which is loss-making, arises from the loss of substantial export business and changing technology.  Other contributing factors are over-capacity in a highly competitive marketplace and competition from the &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; manufacturing facilities in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I understand the United States parent company examined the scope for investment in existing and new products for the Cork plant but concluded that such investment would not be viable given available markets and over-capacity in existing and smaller beverage ends; food can manufacture for the Irish market alone would not be economic.</P>
      <P>Efforts by the Industrial Development Authority to secure a reversal of the decision to close the Cork plant have been unsuccessful.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment contacted the parent United States company but was unable to obtain deferral of the pending closure.  Against that background, he received agreement of the company to work closely with the IDA, as that agency endeavours to identify a possible replacement industry and provide every possible assistance in marketing the Cork facility to prospective industrialists.  In addition the Minister of State at the Department of Education and the Environment, Deputy Allen, met local management and unions in an effort to avert closure of the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister very much regrets the proposed closure of this long established Cork plant and its job losses in an area of high unemployment.  The Industrial Development Authority and other development agencies are fully aware of the challenges, the need to attract new industry and encourage the expansion of existing ones on the north side of Cork city and elsewhere within the Cork region.  The IDA is currently finalising negotiations with a number of major overseas companies in the electronics and health care sectors.  These projects are expected to create <Col N="124" /> approximately 1,000 new jobs and provide valuable employment opportunities in the Cork area.  Negotiations are also under way with some existing companies in the Cork area with a view to future expansions.  The Minister is hopeful that these ongoing efforts will prove successful in helping to tackle the high level of unemployment prevailing in the Cork area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, a fellow Kildare man, for coming in to reply.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State will be aware, the north Kildare area has experienced the highest population growth of any region outside Dublin county for the best part of the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>Considerable excitement was generated some years ago when Íarnród Éireann decided to implement a long promised, initiative for regular train services between north Kildare satellite towns and Dublin.  In recent months I have been inundated with representations from constituents wanting to know when the long promised funding for the upgrading of the Dublin-Maynooth line will be provided.  People throughout the world know about the west Clare railway through the great song by Percy French.  However, some of the experiences of my constituents on the Dublin-Maynooth line in the past month make much more interesting reading.</P>
      <P>I am a great believer in public transport.  I traipsed up and down from Kildare to Dublin between 1967 and 1975.  Some other people and I wrote letters to CIE and Ministers on the benefits of opening the Sallins and Newbridge railway stations to regular train services and this is now being done, 20 years later.  The people of north Kildare have been calling for a long time for the development of the line, but what has happened in the past month makes very grim reading.  The train service has gone from bad to worse and some of the stories about it would be laughable if people were not so badly affected.  Many people from the area have been forced to use their cars to travel to Dublin.  One letter I received stated that the train has to go so slowly through Confey that it would be easy for passengers to jump off. Apparently this is not an unusual occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of the representations I received I wrote to the chief executive of Iarnród Éireann who wrote back explaining some of the problems. One of the problems relates to &ldquo;severe localised contamination of the railway by fallen leaves&rdquo;. He states that the leaves are compressed by the rolling action of passing wheels and the resulting mulch bonds firmly onto the rails causing a significant reduction in traction and breaking adhesion.  He also states that compressed leaf mulch can affect the electric signal system, resulting in the need for manual controls at certain signals.  He says that these factors lead to <Col N="125" /> slower acceleration, slower speed and longer journey times.</P>
    <P>The position would be greatly improved if the Clonsilla-Maynooth section of the line, which is only a single track, was upgraded.  There is little point in Ministers encouraging people to use public transport if it does not operate properly. There are two ways of making profits, one is by reducing costs and the other is by increasing business.  One way of increasing business is to provide a better service, and this applies to shops, pubs and railway lines.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is anxious to resolve this problem and I ask him to ensure the long promised additional funding is provided as soon as possible so that this service can be held up as an example of what a suburban train service should be.  I will not embarrass the Department or Iarnród Éireann any further by quoting from some of the other letters I have received.  I ask the Minister of State to impress on his Cabinet colleagues the necessity of providing this long promised funding as quickly as possible. Otherwise people will stop using the train service and will use their cars to travel to Dublin, thereby exacerbating the traffic problems.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McCreevy for raising this issue, in which we have a common interest. Although most modern trains have been fitted with brushes, no solution has been found to the problem of fallen leaves which reduce the traction between the wheel and track.  This is an ongoing problem in areas where there is an incline in the track.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the implementation of an improved public transport system for the greater Dublin area with a view to giving existing public transport users an improved service and encouraging motorists to use public transport.  On the new western motorway a bus lane has been built where the hard shoulder used to be.  While I am caught in a six mile queue of traffic on my way into work every morning the buses speed by me.  I understand Iarnród Éireann has had to schedule extra buses to cater for the increase in the number of passengers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The transport strategy developed by the Dublin Transport Initiative over a period of three years provides the general policy framework for the future development of such a transport system in our capital city.  As a result, we will develop transportation for the long-term in a way which commands the support of the various agencies involved in delivering transport services and the general public.  These services are being improved in a way which is user friendly, environmentally sensitive and financially realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in this context that improvements to the Connolly-Maynooth service have been <Col N="126" /> recommended.  I am pleased to confirm that since the Government came to office it has succeeded in making significant progress on many of these projects.  For example, significant EU investment in DART and other suburban rail services has been secured.  Last March the Minister, Deputy Lowry, approved a package of investment in DART and suburban rail services, including the Maynooth rail service, under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999.  The overall development plan for the Maynooth rail service prepared by CIE covers all elements of the route infrastructure, including track renewal, doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth, signalling, rolling stock, stations and parking facilities.  The total cost of the package is approximately £40 million.</P>
    <P>The package of measures for this line can be implemented in stages, and this is being done.  For example, the reopening of the Drumcondra station is incorporated in the DART and suburban rail investment package announced by the Minister, Deputy Lowry, last March under the Operational Programme for Transport. Further development is provided for in the mainline rail investment package which is being co-financed from the Cohesion Fund.  This includes a major upgrading of track and signalling as part of the improvement of the Dublin-Sligo line.  The Department has been in discussion with the EU Commission about the inclusion of further elements of the Maynooth-Connolly package for future funding.  A key issue in this respect is the desirability of doubling the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made and, although the doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth did not form part of the initial investment package under the Cohesion Fund, the European Commission has retained independent consultants to review CIE's proposals for the development of the Maynooth rail service.  I am aware of the strong wishes of the communities adjacent to the Connolly-Maynooth railway line to have the service upgraded in line with the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  This development is desirable.  Much progress has already been made and I am taking a direct interest in the continuing efforts to secure additional funding for further work.  The next step is the doubling of the track and, while I do not want to prejudge the EU consultants' work, I believe this project can meet EU criteria and that there is an excellent case for securing funding for this work.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of my commitment to the improvement of the line to Maynooth and I am anxious to ensure that CIE implements its plans for the route.  I also welcome Deputy McCreevy's support for this proposal.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise on the Adjournment the <Col N="127" /> important issue of the blockade by French lorry drivers in France which has cost Irish businesses approximately £2 million.  The future does not look good.  Contracts entered into by Irish companies are in grave jeopardy.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning a gentleman outlined the serious difficulties his company is experiencing because of the dispute.  The French blockade is causing severe difficulties for some of our people and if it is allowed continue it will cause grave tensions at Calais, La Rochelle and other ports on the French western seaboard as well as at border crossings with Germany and other countries. Tensions are extremely high at present.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, met representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association to discuss this matter.  I have been in daily contact with the president of that organisation.  What has the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, done in this regard?  What has the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs done to represent our citizens who, through no fault of theirs, cannot get in or out of France with their commodities?</P>
      <P>It is pertinent that we currently hold the Presidency of the EU as this problem transcends many ministries.  The export of live animals is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  One of our organisations called on the Minister, Deputy Yates, as president of the Council of Agriculture Ministers to make representations to the French Government and French agencies to alleviate the problem.  The Departments of Tourism and Trade and Enterprise and Employment could also make a significant input.  Jobs here are at stake because of what is taking place in France.</P>
      <P>We should raise with the EU Commission, through the Presidency, the question of compensation for losses sustained by Irish companies because of this debacle.  None of the companies involved was able to get insurance because it is a matter of civil strife in another country.  The Government should do more than it is doing at present.  We cannot stand idly by.  With due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, we need a more high powered input from the Government to get these people off the hook. We need direct intervention from Ministers and, in particular, from the Taoiseach who should put pressure on the French Government not to allow a dispute in France affect non-nationals and Irish people.  I urge the Minister of State to pass on to his Government colleagues the necessity for urgent and direct involvement at a high Government level in this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for raising this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for the purposes of this debate to recall that this dispute, which is currently bringing much of France to a standstill, involves a disagreement about pay and conditions between <Col N="128" /> employers and employees in private sector transport companies in France.  The fact that the employees have resorted to such disruptive means of highlighting their grievances is outside the control of the Irish Government to influence. It is essentially, therefore, for the French authorities to endeavour to bring both sides in this dispute together in an effort to get an early solution.  I am satisfied from contacts with the French authorities that everything is being done to facilitate such talks.  I can confirm that talks on the dispute resumed at 3 p.m. this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The situation in France continues to be serious. The strike is entering its ninth day and truckers are extending their barricades.  The problem has worsened in the past two days as the number of barricades has extended to towns and fuel depots around France, causing fuel shortages in a number of areas and a number of French ports have been blocked.</P>
    <P>My first concern is for individual Irish drivers unwittingly caught up in a dispute not of their making.  I can confirm that my concerns regarding Irish hauliers stranded due to the ongoing strike were communicated to the relevant French authorities by diplomatic means via the Irish Embassy in Paris last week.  The representations made to the French authorities highlighted the particular difficulties experienced by Irish hauliers.  Many of the loads being carried contain perishable foodstuffs and are liable to rapid deterioration, some 80 per cent of Irish haulage operators are one or two vehicle enterprises and could be subject to disproportionate loss in the circumstances and many drivers are experiencing personal difficulties due to being held up for almost a week.</P>
    <P>In response to our approach the French authorities have been in contact with the Irish Embassy pointing out that action had been taken over the weekend to assist Irish and other Union nationals in returning to their home countries.  I have been able to confirm with the Irish Road Haulage Association that some drivers managed to get through towards the end of last week.  The French authorities also requested details of particular difficulties involving Irish drivers to see if anything can be done to alleviate the situation. My officials have been in contact with the Irish Road Haulage Association and will immediately pass on details of particular difficulties which individual drivers are experiencing.</P>
    <P>The Irish Embassy has dealt with a number of calls from Irish hauliers stranded at roadblocks throughout France.  The embassy has confirmed that it will assist by giving advice on local conditions, traffic and accommodation, providing other assistance, including cash advances, to individual drivers under the usual consular conditions and making direct interventions with different French local authorities to assist Irish hauliers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> The embassy has also confirmed that it will continue to give what assistance it can to Irish drivers who contact it.  I can confirm that officials in my Department will continue to keep in close contact with staff in the headquarters of the Irish Road Haulage Association as the situation unfolds.  I have complimented members of that association for their work in this regard and they <Col N="130" /> complimented the staff of my Department for their co-operation.</P>

      <P>The current review of the special trading house scheme at my Department is due to be completed before the end of this year.  From preliminary information received from licensees it is estimated that total sales achieved in 1995 were £28.5 million accounted for by nine trading houses.  Five of these trading houses are actively trading while the other four had modest sales in 1995 but have little or no sales projections for the future and-or are only trading on a reactive basis. The other 12 trading houses licensed since the scheme was introduced have ceased to trade.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the future of the scheme until the review has been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has achieved record and sustained tourism growth in recent years with 4.25 million overseas visitors in 1995.  This does not constitute mass tourism nor is the Government interested in developing a mass tourism product in Ireland.  Unlike for example some destinations where tourism is concentrated in narrow coastal areas, we can achieve a wide geographical spread of tourism.  This, coupled with our low population density and improving seasonal spread, means that we are better placed to preserve our environment, while at the same time maintaining a unique holiday experience for our visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government policy on tourism development takes full account of the value of the image of Ireland's clean, green environment and the consequent need to protect it.  The ambitious growth targets set for the tourism sector relate to growth in overseas revenue and job creation and emphasise the need to develop <Col N="132" /> a sustainable industry concentrating on a quality product rather than quantity.  The strategy of increasing tourism revenue rather than numbers is an integral element of the &ldquo;Brand Ireland&rdquo; campaign launched last week.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 acknowledges that a balance must be struck between tourism development and preservation of the environment.  Measures to achieve this objective, as set out in the programme, include the following.  First, improving the seasonality profile of Irish tourism.  The aim is that by 1999, 75 per cent of visitors will arrive in Ireland outside the peak July-August period compared with about 70 per cent at present.  Second, attracting high yield business.  Priority is given to marketing conference and incentive business and other quality niche and activity markets such as cruising, golf, equestrian, shoppers and users of paid services such as accommodation and car hire.  Third, where possible enhancing existing product investment rather than creating new developments.  Fourth a wide geographical dispersal to minimise capacity problems.  Fifth, capital projects recommended for assistance under the programme are required to comply with all environmental regulatory requirements as a condition for grant approval and support for overseas marketing under the programme is weighted towards projects that aim to extend the season.  Sixth, progress on the consistency between tourism developments and the principle of sustainability will continue to be monitored as part of the programme.</P>
    <P>Statutory responsibility for environmental protection generally rests with the Minister for the Environment while the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has certain statutory responsibilities in relation to the protection of heritage areas.  I understand that the heritage services &mdash; the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service &mdash; of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht operate an ongoing review of the impact of visitors on heritage sites in order that suitable control and management procedures are exercised and applied as necessary.  Similarly, the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service aims to keep visiting levels at each heritage property to the optimum number of visitors consistent with site protection and presentation and to manage such properties accordingly.</P>
    <P>I fully acknowledge the need for the ongoing monitoring and management of the impact of tourism on the environment, particularly during the peak tourism season.  Such problems are already being addressed in the context of the strategies and monitoring arrangements that I have already outlined.  I am satisfied that the issue is afforded a high priority by the relevant agencies and there are therefore no plans by my Department to introduce specific legislation in this area.</P>

However, I understand that An Bord Tráchtála has no specific promotional initiatives planned for the Indonesian market.  Ireland, both in the context of the Presidency of the EU and in our own right, continues to support political efforts to find a resolution to this problem including contributing financially towards the cost of talks aimed at a resolution.  In so far as my Department is aware no proposals have emerged in an EU context for the imposition of any form of trade sanctions against Indonesia.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>I recently met representatives of the Irish Hotels Federation, the Town and Country Homes Association and the Irish Farm Holidays Association who presented a submission to me proposing a statutory licensing system for all tourism accommodation.  At this meeting, I reitreated my view, already expressed in this House, that I did not favour the statutory licensing of all accommodation but undertook to have these proposals examined and indicated that I would be in touch with the associations again in due course.</P>
      <P>It has been not only my view, but also that of my predecessor, that the statutory licensing of all tourist accommodation would not be practical nor would it necessarily lead to an improvement in standards to any great extent.  In addition to possible difficulties as regards policing and prosecution, it could in fact also lead to a reduction in the accommodation bank available, particularly during the high season and at festival times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, unapproved operators do not have access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte <Col N="134" /> and the tourist information office network, nor do they have access to tax breaks or other subsidised finance schemes which are available to the approved sector.  The pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas and the subsidised tourism loan schemes were carefully designed so that only approved operators would be eligible. Unapproved operators are, on the other hand, obliged to comply in the same way as the approved sector with official requirements, for example, in the areas of taxation, planning, fire and safety, and hygiene.  My Department has been impressing on the relevant enforcement agencies the need for constant vigilance to ensure that their policing or inspection practices do not discriminate as between the approved and unapproved sectors.</P>
    <P>The ideal solution would be for unapproved operators to become approved and I can confirm that both Bord Fáilte and the recognised approving bodies will be mounting an information campaign encouraging operators to seek approval and explaining clearly not only what is involved in terms of procedure, but also in terms of the benefits to be gained from being part of the approved tourist accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 54 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 17 October, the Tourism Council, at its last meeting in Ballintubber on 11 October, agreed outline terms for a special seasonality programme for spring 1997 which will involve a musical theme and will be administered by Bord Fáilte.  The event is scheduled for the first two weeks in March and will act as a lead-in to other activities, <Col N="135" /> such as the St. Patrick's Day Festival.  In terms of target markets, the council envisages that Britain, Northern Ireland and the home market offer the best prospects for the festival.</P>
    <P>The Tourism Council has concluded that the proposed event should be staged in four cities, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Cork.  The council envisages that the lead event could be supported with a series of fringe events to be organised by the regions and aimed at spreading the commercial benefits of the festival throughout the country.  It will be the responsibility of organisations at local level to encourage participation in various fringe events among the trade.</P>
    <P>While the details have yet to be worked out, it is envisaged that the proposed festival will be financed through a combination of commercial income, sponsorship and support provided through industry, EU and State sources.  I have agreed to the allocation of £125,000 to Bord Fáilte specifically to support the programme.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of a range of measures being taken to help address the seasonality profile of Irish tourism as set out in the detailed reply on this subject on 17 October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to similar questions on this subject on 17 October I outlined a range of policy <Col N="137" /> measures being taken to improve training and recruitment in the tourism sector.  The CERT research report on successful recruitment and staff retention in tourism, launched earlier this year, sets out clearly the factors which need to be considered by tourism businesses in their approach to designing an attractive job and career package that leads to successful recruitment and retention of staff.  This includes a reasonable level of pay and conditions, improved staff-management relations and the development of attractive career paths.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging to note that the industry representative associations and individual businesses in tourism are already conscious of the competitive staff recruitment environment which they face.  Indeed, as the Minister stated in an earlier reply, the Irish Hotels Federation will shortly launch a programme to highlight the attractiveness of careers within the hotel and guesthouse sector.</P>
      <P>CERT, in conjunction with the industry, has taken steps already to increase training places and to improve the image of the industry, including direct training initiatives which will provide approximately 600 additional training places for full-time craft and unemployed programmes to supplement those provided in Department of Education colleges.</P>
      <P>CERT mounts nationwide publicity and promotion campaigns to attract school-leavers and unemployed adults into training.  These include media compaigns, vacancies on Aertel, workshops for career guidance counsellors, career talks in schools and career exhibitions.  At present a national campaign is being planned for 1997 to target some 6,000 new recruits. Employers will be asked to help tackle the image problem.  The aim of the campaign is to position tourism as a first choice career and to promote employment packages that support this image. Already, rates of pay to CERT graduates during 1996 have been substantially higher than in previous years, and this can only serve to enhance the image of the industry.</P>
      <P>In 1995 CERT set up a national recruitment committee representative of industry bodies to co-ordinate and implement local promotion campaigns by industry.  The work of this committee is continuing and these promotion campaigns are being extended country wide.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, CERT launched a new &ldquo;Trainers in Industry&rdquo; programme which will create up to 2,000 formally accredited trainers in Irish tourism companies by 1999.  This will mean direct training by CERT is backed up by a substantial increase in training carried out by the industry itself and means that the industry will take greater responsibility for the development of its own workforce.  In addition, a new CERT-National Tourism Certification Board initiative will provide &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; training and certification at elementary level for all skill categories in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT is confident that given its own fully <Col N="138" /> comprehensive national recruitment campaign, and with the support of the industry, that the challenge of recruiting and training the additional workforce required for the sector can be achieved.</P>

      <P>Tourism from Great Britain to Ireland is currently enjoying a high level of growth, as evidenced in the data produced by the Central Statistics Office which indicate that the total number of British visitors to Ireland since 1992 was as follows: 1992, 1.758 million; 1993, 1.887 million; 1994, 2,087 million; 1995, 2.365 million.</P>
      <P>Final figures are not yet available for 1996 but Bord Fáilte is projecting the number of British visitors as 2.55 million.  While targets for 1997 are not yet finalised, Bord Fáilte indicates at this stage that it will be seeking an increase next year of up to 9 per cent in British visitors.</P>
      <P>The recent launch of the new marketing strategy, &ldquo;Tourism Brand Ireland&rdquo; in conjunction with the overseas tourism marketing initiative is expected to further impact on the performance of all of Ireland's main markets including Great Britain.  Bord Fáilte has indicated that the outlook for Britain is positive for next year. However, factors such as the economic situation in Britain and the situation in Northern Ireland remain issues with potential to enchance or diminish prospects depending on emerging developments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 71 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Central Statistics Office figures for the first six months of this year show that the total value of exports for the period was £14.9 billion compared to £13.3 billion in 1995, an increase of 13 per cent. For the month of June itself, there was an increase of 14 per cent over June 1995.  Our trade surplus, grew from £3.4 billion for the first half of 1995 to £3.9 billion this year, an increase of 14 per cent.  Preliminary CSO estimates for July also <Col N="140" /> indicate an increase of 14 per cent over July 1995. ABT's growth target for indigenous exports for 1995 and 1996 is 14 per cent for each calendar year.</P>
    <P>While the CSO does not provide statistics broken down on the basis of nationality of ownership, ABT carries out quarterly and annual surveys of the exports achieved by their indigenous client firms.  This survey excludes the food and drink sectors which are the responsibility of An Bord Bia.  ABT estimate that total indigenous exports are estimated to have reached £3.8 billion in 1995 an increase of 16.8 per cent on the 1994 figure.  This increase is ahead of ABT's 1995 growth target of 14 per cent. Latest estimates now suggest that merchandise exports by foreign-owned companies currently constitute over 70 per cent of total exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been advised by the Department of Finance that if, for example, a bed and breakfast operation were to be made liable to commercial rates, the relevant rate would be applied to the rateable valuation in respect of the property, or element of the property, used for the operation.  The rateable valuation of an individual property is determined by reference to its net annual value, in this case, its net annual rent.  The interaction of the rate in the pound for the rating district in which a bed and breakfast was located with the rateable valuation for the same bed and breakfast operation would determine its rates liability.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to estimate impact on accommodation costs if all forms of accommodation were made subject to commercial rates as proposed in the report referred to, because there are too many other variables &mdash; for example, quantum of rate bills, competitive and market forces etc. &mdash; to be considered to allow for any form of reliable estimate to be made at this stage.</P>

      <P>On March 25 1996, the General Affairs Council approved a negotiating mandate in relation to a free trade agreement with South <Col N="141" /> Africa.  This was formally presented to the South African authorities on 29 March 1996.  A first meeting between the two sides took place in June 1996 and some progress was made on non-trade aspects such as economic and industrial co-operation, education, research, and technology. The South African delegation indicated that it was not in a position at that stage to decide on the trade aspects of the proposed agreement.</P>
      <P>The position at the beginning of Ireland's Presidency was that the South African authorities were examining whether they could accept the trade aspects of the proposed free trade agreement with the EU.

      <P>I pointed out in my reply of 2 February 1995 in response to a similar question, there have been several Government-led trade missions to the region in recent years, including missions which I led to Malaysia in 1995 and to Korea and Taiwan earlier this year.</P>
      <P>I will continue to avail of all appropriate opportunities to advance Ireland's economic relations with the countries of the region, both through bilateral contacts such as trade missions and inward visits.  I will also use the channels afforded by the multilateral trade fora of the EU, the WTO and the OECD to enhance economic relations and to pursue the greatest possible market opening for Irish goods and services.</P>
      <P>Initiatives at ministerial level are supplemented on the ground by the ongoing promotional activities of An Bord Tráchtála which has an extensive network of offices and trade consultants in the region.

Imports came to £6.9 billion and exports amounted to £4.3 billion or 16 per cent of total exports, leaving a negative balance of £2.6 billion.

I have indicated in response to previous similar Dáil questions, that the primary vehicle for grant-aiding tourism currently is the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.  A co-ordinating committee, chaired by my Department, meets on a regular basis to ensure a coherent approach to the administration of the programme.  The committee is composed of representatives of all agencies involved in implementing and administering the programme, including the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Education, the Department of the Marine, the Department of Tourism and Trade, Bord Fáilte, the Central Fisheries Board, CERT, the Office of Public Works and Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>There is also a national monitoring committee for the Operational Programme, again chaired by my Department, comprised of representatives from the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, relevant Government Departments, the tourism agencies, tourism industry, farming and trade union interests.  This committee has general responsibility for ensuring smooth implementation in pursuit of programme objectives.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department, and as appropriate Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development, are represented at monitoring committee level for other Operational Programmes contributing to the development of the tourism industry, for example, INTERREG &mdash; Northern Ireland and Maritime, the special programme for peace and reconciliation, and the International Fund for Ireland.  They are also represented on the appropriate regional structures for monitoring the implementation of the community support framework as a whole.</P>
      <P>Co-ordination of grant-aid for the tourism sector is afforded a high priority and I am satisfied that the existence of these co-ordinating mechanisms will ensure that priority is maintained and will go a long way towards eliminating the potential for overlap or duplication.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 77 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has set specific targets for the tourism industry for the period 1994 to 1999 in the Operational Programme for Tourism which the European Commission has agreed to co-fund along with the participating public agencies and the industry.  These targets are: to achieve foreign exchange earnings of £2,250 million per annum by 1999; to create 35,000 full-time job equivalents &mdash; 17,250 in tourism, 6,000 in construction and the remainder in indirect and induced employment in the wider economy; to improve the quality of service through high quality training; and to concentrate growth in shoulder and off-peak periods so that by 1999 75 per cent of visitors arrive outside the peak July/August period.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 is the key plank in the strategy to achieve the above targets, including growth and employment targets.  It builds on the partnership between the public and private sectors initiated under the last Operational Programme.  The investment underlying this strategy, as set out in the current Operational Programme, is expected to amount to £652 million in total, made up of £369 million in the form of EU grants, £84 million from the Irish public sector and £199 million sourced from private investors.  Additional, funding provided through the Vote of the Department enables Bord Fáilte, Shannon Development and CERT as the principal Government agencies concerned, to pursue other tourism policy priorities.</P>
      <P>Further EU funded programmes and initiatives also underpin the Government's strategy in this sector.  The programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, which has an agri-tourism scheme, and the LEADER II programme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, together with the local urban and rural development programme, also provide support for tourism initiatives.  In the Border counties, assistance for tourism projects is available from the International Fund for Ireland, the INTERREG II programme and the special support programme for peace and reconciliation. The maritime INTERREG programme can provide assistance to tourism projects in the Dublin, mid-east and south-east regions.</P>
      <P>Under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, £52 million of the £208 million fund has been specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country.  A similar scheme especially for the Border counties, was recently introduced under the programme for peace and reconciliation.  Investments under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain tourism resort areas can also qualify for generous tax relief under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies can see, there is in place a whole range of measures to ensure that tourism growth targets are achieved and that the <Col N="145" /> employment potential of the sector is realised to the optimal possible level.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle is one of a number of principles that underpins the development of environmental policy both at national and EU level.  In the WTO, a committee on trade and environment has been set up to identify the relationship between trade measures and environmental measures, in order to promote sustainable development.  Within that committee the EU has suggested a number of amendments to the rules of the multilateral trading system to promote sustainable development and has promoted discussion of a number of environmental policies, including the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  Further discussions on the role of trade-related environmental policies are likely to continue following the WTO ministerial conference in Singapore in December.</P>
      <P>The WTO agreements do not hinder developing countries from pursuing appropriate policies to ensure adequate food supplies for their populations, whether produced domestically or imported.  In their decision on measures concerning the possible negative effects of the reform programme on least-developed and net food-importing developing countries, WTO ministers agreed to establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the implementation of the results of the Uruguay round on trade in agriculture did not adversely affect the availability of food aid at a level which is sufficient to continue to provide assistance in meeting the food needs of developing countries, especially least developed and net food-importing developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 247 and 280 together.</P>
      <P>The questions from my colleagues come at an appropriate time in the wake of the world food summit which concluded on 17 November last and addressed the issue of eradicating hunger and creating world food security.  At that summit it was acknowledged that food security is a complex and multi-faceted concept.  If we are to feed all our people, we must produce and distribute food efficiently and trade is vital to this.  Appropriate trade policies, in accordance with WTO rules, are therefore an important element in the food security equation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The WTO agreements, whose implementation will be reviewed at the ministerial conference, contain a number of concessions to developing countries in general &mdash; for example, they are subject to less stringent liberalisation time-tables <Col N="147" /> than other WTO members &mdash; and special provisions for the least developed countries.  The latter are contained in two decisions adopted at the end of the Uruguay round declaring that least developed countries need only undertake WTO commitments to the extent of their ability and promising increased technical assistance and food aid.</P>
    <P>As regards the export subsidisation of agricultural products, EU subsidies are being reduced in accordance with the reform programme agreed at the end of 1993 in the Uruguay round.  This programme provides for a reduction in the quantities of products subsidised and in expenditure on the same over the course of the six year implementation period of the agreement.  The reform programme will be reviewed at the end of the decade and it seems likely that the pattern of reducing subsidy levels will be continued in future WTO Agreements.</P>
    <P>Through the decision on measures concerning the possible negative effects of the reform programme on least-developed and net food-importing developing countries adopted at the end of the Uruguay round, Ministers agreed to establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the implementation of the results of the Uruguay round on trade in agriculture does not adversely affect the availability of food aid at a level which is sufficient to continue to provide assistance in meeting the food needs of developing countries, especially least developed and net food-importing developing countries.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee on agriculture to the ministerial conference recommends that action be initiated within the framework of the food aid convention with a view to the establishment of food aid commitments sufficient to meet the needs of developing and net food-importing developing countries during the Uruguay round reform process.</P>
    <P>The EU is supporting the adoption at the ministerial conference of a &ldquo;plan of action&rdquo; for least developed countries which should have a beneficial effect in relation to food security.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office published the preliminary report of the 1996 Census of Population in July 1996.  This report contained population headcount figures based on summaries prepared by each of the 3,400 enumerators engaged to carry out the census fieldwork.</P>
      <P>While the report emphasised that the results are of a preliminary character and subject to revision when the definitive results become available, previous experience suggests that the revision to the overall population count is unlikely to exceed 0.2 per cent of the preliminary population figure.  A noteworthy feature of the recent report is that it is the first time that preliminary population figures were published at the level of district electoral division-ward. Revisions can be expected when the final figures for these small areas become available.  However, the indications are that, in general, these will also be relatively slight.</P>
      <P>In compiling the preliminary population figures each enumerator compared the number of households and persons returned for the 1996 census at street-townland level with the corresponding 1991 figures.  The purpose of this check was to ensure that a complete enumeration had taken place and to verify any significant changes in population or households since 1991.</P>
      <P>Regarding the figures for the wards of Sligo east and Sligo north, there was an appreciable increase in the number of private households recorded in these wards between 1991 and 1996. Two factors serve to explain why the increase in population was not of the same order: first, a decline in the population resident in institutions such as hotels and hospitals, and second, the long-term downward trend in average household size.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 98 to 102, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Florence European Council requested the Irish Presidency to bring forward for the Dublin European Council on 13-14 December &ldquo;a general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties&rdquo;.  The European Council has, of course, also decided that the Intergovernmental Conference should end not during the Irish Presidency but by the middle of next year.  The Intergovernmental Conference has not, therefore, yet reached the stage of definitive agreement on the different areas under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions during our Presidency have covered the full range of issues identified by successive European Councils for consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference.  Such discussions have, wherever possible, focused on draft treaty texts put forward by us in our capacity as Presidency sometimes in the form of <Col N="151" /> a range of options.  The Presidency papers in question are forwarded to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has, of course, primary responsibility for environment issues.  Most recently, in reply to parliamentary questions on 30 October he set out Ireland's approach to the enhancement of the environment provisions of the treaty.  Environment issues at the Intergovernmental Conference were first discussed under the Irish Presidency on the basis of the Presidency introductory note dated 17 September to which the Deputy has referred.  The Presidency introductory note, which was discussed by Intergovernmental Conference representatives on 30 September, suggested that the environmental provisions of the treaty could be enhanced in two main ways; first, by including in the Treaty an explicit formulation of the Union's commitment to sustainable development; and second, by including in the Treaty a strengthened horizontal provision to ensure that environmental considerations are integrated into the sectoral policies of the Union.</P>
    <P>At the meeting on 30 September, a broad measure of support was expressed by member states both as regards the incorporation in the treaty of the principle of sustainable development and as regards a strengthening of the integration principle.  In the light of that meeting, the Presidency put forward in a document dated 22 October a suggested approach on the environment which was discussed by Intergovernmental Conference representatives on 29 October.</P>
    <P>The Presidency's document suggested in the form of treaty language how the sustainable development and integration principles might be incorporated in the treaty.  Again there was wide measure of support for the approach suggested. A key consideration remains that all treaty amendments must be approved unanimously by the member states at the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is, therefore, too early to predict with certainty what the final outcome will be on issues under consideration.  Some member states have expressed support for a reference to protection of the environment in Article 36 of the treaty and the Presidency introductory note dated 17 September reflected that fact.  However, that particular option has not as yet attracted broad support at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>As regards Article 100A, there is a broad view, shared by the Irish delegation, that any amendment of Article 100A should not call into question the present balance of that Article which is essential to avoid undermining the internal market.  There is, however, an openness to clarifying and tightening up the provisions of Article 100A as they relate to the environment without in any way undermining the principles of the internal market.</P>
    <P>The possible extension of qualified majority voting as well as the co-decision procedure is being addressed in the wider context of <Col N="152" /> institutional questions under the First Pillar.  The challenge is to ensure that the workings of the Union &mdash; the Council and its voting methods, the Commission and its composition, the European Parliament and its legislative role &mdash; are examined and if necessary adapted particularly in view of enlargement, while at the same time ensuring that the balances which have served the Union well are maintained.</P>
    <P>While the conference has gone a long way towards identifying the issues and clarifying the different views of the member states on the various institutional questions, there is broad recognition that some of the more sensitive institutional questions such as the size of the Commission and voting weights in the Council will realistically only be resolved towards the end of the Conference.  The Irish delegation will continue to take a positive approach to both the extension of qualified majority voting under the First Pillar and of the co-decision procedure subject to the necessary detailed examination of these issues when it takes place.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies I gave to Questions Nos. 45 and 59 of 31 October 1996.</P>
      <P>During discussions on the situation in East Timor at the General Affairs Council in Brussels yesterday, Ministers expressed support for the bilateral talks between Portugal and Indonesia, under the auspices of the UN Secretary General, which are scheduled to resume in December.  The Council also expressed the hope that there would be some tangible progress made during these talks.  Further to the Union's common position on East Timor, which was adopted on 25 June 1996, the Council has also invited the European Commission to make proposals on certain development projects intended to benefit the population in East Timor.</P>

      <P>Consideration is currently being given to the implications of restructuring deals for existing pensioners and pensions increase policy across the public service.  While a number of restructuring deals have been concluded to date, <Col N="153" /> the outcome of talks has still to be finalised in the case of several major public service groups. Pending completion of the latter and consideration of the pensions issues generally I am not in a position at this stage to set out the effect of such deals on pensions in payment in respect of former civil servants.  I can, however, say that grades represented by the Association of Higher Civil Servants and the Civil and Public Service Union as well as some grades represented by IMPACT have received an increase of 1 per cent from 1 April 1994 in line with the interim increase which was given to serving officers in those grades.</P>

      <Quest>the efforts, if any, that have been made to comply with the Government commitment to employ people with disabilities to a minimum of 3 per cent of total staff; the current percentage of people with disabilities employed in each Government Department; the reason the commitment, if any, is not being complied with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22413/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As of 1 October 1995, the most recent date for which data are available, the proportion of people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service was 3 per cent.  A tabular statement listing, by Department, the percentage of staff with a disability employed on 1 October 1995 follows. Figures in respect of 1 October 1996 are currently being gathered and will be forwarded directly to the Deputy as soon as they are available.</P>
      <P>Each head of Department is fully aware of the Government policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities, which was reiterated in the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disabilities in the Civil Service, a copy of which is issued to all staff. The Code of Practice calls on all Government Departments to continue to play their full part in employing people with disabilities.  In addition, since 1993, the Civil Service Commissioners have assigned a member of their staff as Liaison Officer for the Recruitment of People with Disabilities into the Civil Service to liaise with candidates, Departments and relevant specialised organisations.</P>
      <P>The quota of 3 per cent applies to the Civil Service as a whole, not to individual Departments or grades.  However, as can be seen from the list, the majority of Departments had a percentage of 3 per cent or higher of disabled people on their staff as of 1 October 1995.</P>
      <P>While the matter is kept continuously under review, there are no plans at the moment to alter the 3 per cent quota.  The priority at present is to ensure that</P>
      <P>(a)  the quota is maintained; and</P>
      <P>(b)  the working environment in the Civil Service is such that staff with disabilities can contribute to their full potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service is implemented by (a) from time to time holding <Col N="155" /> competitions confined to people who are registered with, or entitled to be registered with, the National Rehabilitation Board as having a disability, (b) facilitating people with a disability when competing in open competitions not confined to people with a disability and (c) where possible, retaining staff who become disabled after their recruitment.</P>
    <P>While the emphasis for some time has been on the achievement of the target quota, it is also important to ensure equality of treatment between staff with and without disabilities once in employment.  With this in mind, the Code of Practice, drawn up in 1993, covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation and equipment and safety and evacuation procedures.  The ideas for the Code of Practice were developed in conjunction with the Civil Service unions, the relevant voluntary bodies and in consultation with staff with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service, as an employer, is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for people with disabilities, which includes ensuring that people with disabilities who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire are not disadvantaged by reason of having a disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the European Monetary Institute (EMI) report entitled <i>Progress Towards Convergence</i>, released earlier this month.  This report is the first to be produced in accordance with Article 109j(1) of the Treaty on European Union.  That Article obliges the Commission and the EMI to report to the Council by end-1996 on the progress made in the fulfilment by member states of their obligations regarding the achievement of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), including their obligation as regards compatibility of national Central Bank legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 108 of the Treaty requires each member state to ensure that Central Bank legislation be compatible with the Treaty by, at least, the establishment of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).  As the European Council has confirmed that stage 3 of economic and monetary union will commence on 1 January 1999, such establishment will take place in 1998.  The EMI report refers to the need for a second report to be produced under Article 109j in early 1998.  It has, therefore, been decided to wait for the present and to legislate for economic and <Col N="157" /> monetary union in a single Bill.  As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank Bill, 1996, which is at present before the House, contains a limited number of economic and monetary union-related provisions but these are only designed to ensure compatibility with certain defined provisions of the Treaty on European Union which took effect with the start of the second stage of economic and monetary union on 1 January 1994.  Extensive preparatory work on other economic and monetary union-related legislation has, however, already been done.</P>
    <P>The EMI has been consulted on this approach, including the preparatory work done, and has expressed agreement.  The Deputy will have noted from page 29 of the EMI report that the EMI noted that the Central Bank Bill, 1996 is &ldquo;...a step towards fulfilling the Treaty and Statute requirements for Stage Three and that further adaptations are under consideration.&rdquo;. Consideration is being given at present to the issues raised in the EMI report now available with a view to the drafting of the future Economic and Monetary Union Bill and account will obviously have to be taken of any further recommendations which the EMI may make in this regard.</P>

    <P>It should be noted in particular that the 1994 figure includes the cost of abolishing the 1 per cent income levy and the full year yield from making unemployment benefit reckonable as income for tax purposes.  The 1995 figure takes into account the full yield arising from the restriction in tax relief for covenants introduced in the 1995 budget.</P>
    <P>The 1995 and 1996 figures respectively include the effect of the reduction and non-renewal of the PRSI income tax allowance.  The yield from the phased standard rating of income tax relief on mortgage interest and medical insurance premiums has been allocated to the year in which the incremental increases in yield actually arise.</P>

    <P>The above figures are based on the full year cost of the changes introduced in the areas of income tax, 1 per cent income levy, health contribution and employment and training levy, and employee PRSI in the three budgets arising during each national programme.  The figures, therefore, take account also of increases in the income tax area introduced in the relevant budgets.  The data is drawn up on the same basis as that entered in the reply to Question No. 110 for answer also today.</P>
    <P>It should be noted in particular that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> figure includes the increased full year yield, £130 million, arising from the introduction of the 1 per cent income levy in 1993 and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> figure includes the cost of abolishing the levy in 1994, £135 million.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The National Cancer Registry Board was established as a statutory body in 1991.  It is the successor body to the Southern Tumour Registry and was established on the basis that it would expand coverage to the entire country.  The board commenced full national registration on 1 January 1994.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the registry has now completed collection and checking of information on cancer cases and deaths for 1994; that this data is in the process of analysis and that a report will be published early next year.  I am advised that this report will have information on, <i>inter alia</i>, incidence and mortality rates for all cancers, the age and sex distribution of cases, their geographical distribution by county and within Europe, and the treatment of patients.  The registry plans to issue a report on the 1995 data in the summer of 1997, and annually thereafter.</P>
      <P>The registry has a close working relationship with the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry and a number of collaborative studies on cancer incidence and mortality are planned when data from Northern Ireland becomes available.  Once sufficient data has been collected, the registry plans to study the geographical distribution of cancer risk on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming registry report will provide comparative incidence data for a wide range of cancers for Ireland and 25 other European countries, including Scotland, England and Wales.  The registry plans to include data for Northern Ireland in 1997, if available by then.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Registry Board has close contacts through its membership of the Cancer Registries Collaborative Group and the UK Association of Cancer Registries, with the regional registries of England, and with the Welsh and Scottish National Cancer Registration systems.  The registry is working with those bodies to make the data of all registries in the UK and Ireland more comparable.</P>

In addition, full upper and full lower dentures are available to all edentulous medical card holders over the age of 16 years.

      <P>The consultation process on mandatory reporting which I initiated last February with the launch of &ldquo;Putting Children First&rdquo;, the discussion document on mandatory reporting, culminated in &ldquo;The Reporting of Child Abuse &mdash; The Contribution of Mandatory Reporting, a consultative forum which I hosted in the Grand Hotel, Malahide on 16 September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 200 submissions, from groups and individuals, were received in response to &ldquo;Putting Children First&rdquo;.  The submissions examined, not only the question of mandatory reporting but also provided a useful information and commentary on other aspects of our child protection services. Every person or group who made a submission <Col N="164" /> was invited to the forum.  The submissions reflected a wide diversity of views on mandatory reporting and this divergence of opinion was also in evidence at the consultative forum.  However, a majority of those present at the forum expressed reservations or opposition to mandatory reporting.  There was widespread agreement that further development of our child care services is required to ensure that children and professionals can report abuse in the knowledge that appropriate investigation, treatment and support services are available to victims.  The need for improved co-ordination and co-operation between agencies as a means of addressing the problems that currently exist in relation to the reporting of child abuse received much attention and support.</P>
    <P>The arguments surrounding mandatory reporting of child abuse are complex and concern such issues as the most effective use of resources, professional judgment, the types of abuse that should be subject to mandatory reporting and who should become mandated reporters.  It is because of the complexity and importance of these issues that I have engaged in a lengthy consultation process on the subject.</P>
    <P>Detailed work analysing the conclusions of these workshops is under way and, as I have previously announced, I will be making a decision in relation to reporting arrangements for cases of child abuse by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Magnetic Resonance Imaging facilities in the public hospital sector are available at Beaumont Hospital.  This facility was provided on the basis that it would serve both public and private patients, with private patients paying a charge for the service.  Private MRI facilities are also available at the Mater Private Hospital, St. Vincent's Private Hospital, the Blackrock Clinic, and on the campus of Cork University Hospital. While my Department does not routinely collect information regarding the cost of transferring patients for MRI scans, the Deputy will appreciate the need to balance factors such as cost against the considerable capital and staffing costs which would arise in connection with the provision of additional MRI scanning facilities.</P>
      <P>However, I have had a review of the current availability of MRI technology in Ireland conducted and am currently examining options for further diffusion of MRI facilities in the Irish health service, taking into account all relevant factors.  I hope to have consideration of this review finalised in the near future and to be in a position to make a decision on developments in this area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose taking Questions Nos. 129, 139 and 158 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of medical card eligibility is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these <Col N="166" /> guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers.</P>
    <P>I have given the issues raised by the Deputies very careful consideration and I would of course be anxious that every person in genuine need of a medical card should receive one.  It is, however, open to all persons, be they persons on modest or reduced incomes, or persons suffering from disablement, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the North Western Health Board concerning this case and have been assured that the application has been reviewed on hardship grounds.  However, as the person's income was substantially over the standard income guidelines, the health board considered that the applicant would not be entitled to a medical card on hardship grounds. Should the circumstances of the applicant change a fresh application would, of course, be treated in a sympathetic manner by the health board.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a particular illness.  As the person in question is not suffering from one of the specified illnesses, she is not eligible for a long-term illness card.  The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are not certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, enables health boards to <Col N="168" /> make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has recently carried out a comprehensive review of their home help services which included an assessment of the dependency levels of those in receipt of the service.  A framework is now in place to identify low, medium and high dependency levels of clients to which specific hours are committed reflective of their need.  Based on their dependency rating the home help client is to receive five, seven or nine hours home help per week.  This is in line with the average in other health boards.  In addition, this framework has enabled the board to increase the hourly rate of pay to £2 an hour, effective from 30 September 1996.  This increase was made possible by the additional funding of £100,000 made available by my Department to the board earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The revised framework was discussed with the board's public health nursing staff and a number of existing home help clients to establish their views on the proposals.  Those canvassed have expressed unqualified support for the revised scheme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this revised scheme has allowed the board to standardise their home help services in line with other health boards and to provide a more equitable service to the elderly in their catchment area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The birth notification form already contains a section which provides for the identification of specific birth defects in newborns.  Under the heading &ldquo;Infant's Health&rdquo;, information is sought on the &ldquo;Main Disease or Congenital Malformation Affecting the Infant&rdquo; as well as any secondary diseases or anomalies.  On its own, however, this information is not sufficient to provide data for a national register of birth defects.  The reason for this is that the birth notification form is designed for the early notification of births, and many birth defects may not be diagnosed until a later stage.</P>
      <P>A register of birth defects must draw data from numerous sources in order to be as comprehensive as possible.  These would include hospital in-patient data, child health service information, laboratory and pathology services, and death certificates in addition to birth notification data.</P>
      <P>Since 1979, a European project (EUROCAT), to establish population-based registries of congenital defects in EU countries has been in operation in Ireland.  It currently covers the Eastern Health Board area and Galway County. Data from the birth notification form comprises one of a number of important sources of information for EUROCAT.  The question of extending EUROCAT to cover other areas of the country will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The job sharing scheme, which was introduced in 1985, is applicable to all health agencies, including health boards, under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The scheme is open to all staff.  The terms of the scheme provide that its operation and management is a matter for each health agency and must necessarily depend on the demands of the service.</P>
      <P>The decision as to whether a specific post or category of post may be filled on a job sharing basis is a matter for the employing authority.  My Department has urged health agencies to make the scheme available to as many employees as possible, taking into account service considerations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>Under the dental treatment services scheme which was introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994, dental treatment will be extended to all adults with medical card eligibility on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>In the initial phasing of the scheme persons aged 65 years and over were identified as a priority group and additional resources have been made available to health boards to enable them to provide dental treatment including denture treatment for this group.  In addition, emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is available under the dental treatment services scheme to all medical card holders irrespective of age and eligible persons over the age of 16 may attend any private dentist under contract with the health boards, if in pain and in need of emergency treatment.</P>
      <P>The second phase of the scheme was introduced from 1 June 1996 and involves the extension of the scheme to medical card holders in the 16 to 34 year old age group and the provision of full dentures to all edentulous medical card holders.</P>
      <P>According to information supplied by the BMS (Payment) Board the following number of eligible persons have been treated under the dental treatment services scheme.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Persons aged 65 years or over Treated under the DTSS since 1 November 1994</P>

    <P>Due to difficulties being experienced in the operation of the scheme the number of persons approved for routine treatment in the 16 to 34 years old age cohort has been limited.  This has arisen because, as the table above shows, the emergency element of the scheme is using a disproportionate amount of the budget for the scheme as a whole.  This has limited the amount of routine treatments which the health boards have been able to approve.</P>
    <P>Strenuous efforts are being made to bring the emergency element of the scheme under control with the assistance of revised arrangements for emergency treatment.  These are designed to ensure that the emergency element of the scheme is used only for the relief of pain in accordance with the original design of the scheme.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy may be aware, on 5 November I launched the national cancer strategy which includes wideranging proposals for a reorganisation of cancer services.  The strategy also deals with the provision of palliative care services, including those provided by hospices.  I propose to circulate the full details of the national cancer strategy to all Oireachtas Members shortly.</P>
      <P>The strategy indicates that the future development of palliative care services, including hospice facilities, will be promoted in a structured manner.  It is my intention to ask the proposed national forum, as outlined in the national cancer strategy, to provide detailed advice on the development of palliative care service nationally. In addition to this the following initiatives for the development of this service will be taken:</P>
      <P>&mdash; all health boards will be asked to draw up a set of priorities for the development of palliative care services in their area;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" />&mdash; the proposed supraregional cancer services, as outlined in the strategy, will have a consultant led palliative care service.</P>
    <P>There will be a programme of phased development of specialist palliative care in regional cancer services, in consultation with the health boards and other involved in palliative care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Funding to voluntary agencies by health boards is usually by means of grants under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, which enables health boards to give assistance by way of a contribution to expenses.  Lottery funding is also distributed to voluntary organisations by health boards.</P>
      <P>Decisions concerning the level of these grants are a matter for the health boards.  Such decisions are made in the context of a wide range of relevant factors including an assessment of existing services and the role of individual voluntary agencies in providing services locally. Other sources of funding available to a particular agency would also be relevant.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate, therefore, to base decisions concerning the level of funding solely on the number of persons facilitated by the voluntary organisation.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand from the South Eastern Health Board that the person in question, who worked in Waterford, attended the Accident and Emergency Department at Waterford Regional Hospital on 27 October 1996.  The person was seen by the registrar on duty, was given pain killers and discharged with a head injury card. This person attended again on 28 October 1996 with some of the symptoms referred to in the head injury card and was admitted to hospital. The person was discharged on 30 October 1996. The patient was seen at an out-patient clinic on 5 November 1996 and was discharged to the care of his general practitioner.  I am informed by the board that the treatment offered to this patient was consistent with the complaint as presented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In 1991 the Minister for Health set up a National AIDS Strategy Committee to examine various aspects of AIDS.  This committee in turn established sub-committees which undertook a range of research into the areas of: Care and management of persons with HIV/AIDS; HIV/AIDS surveillance; Education and prevention strategies; Measures to avoid discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS.</P>
      <P>Each sub-committee provided a report, which was published in April 1992, and which became the recommendations for a national AIDS strategy.  Since then the Department of Health and health boards, which are responsible for the provision of health services, have been working to implement these recommendations.  Since 1992 additional funding has been provided to all boards to provide HIV/AIDS and drugs services.</P>

    <P>As treatment for HIV/AIDS is provided in a number of facilities, ranging from primary care to tertiary treatment in acute general hospitals, it is not possible to give a breakdown of the amount of funding expended in relation to the treatment of persons with AIDS.</P>
    <P>Statistics on AIDS have been provided since 1985.  The cumulative numbers of AIDS cases since 1985 are as follows: 1985, 13; 1986, 19; 1987, 42; 1988, 86; 1989, 143; 1990, 207; 1991, 279; 1992, 349; 1993, 418; 1994, 479; 1995, 498; 1996, 514 (at 31 March 1996).</P>
    <P>In 1991 a HIV primary care research unit was set up, with funding provided by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of general Practice in University College, Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  The unit's terms of reference were to establish the optimum role for primary care in the management and prevention of HIV and AIDS, to develop the Protocols and educational means of implementing this role in the setting of Irish general practice and to examine the psychosocial aspects of living with HIV and to assess how the interface with primary care could be developed to enhance the quality of life and needs of individuals living with HIV and AIDS.  Various research projects have been undertaken by the unit including a survey of general practitioners, a survey of HIV positive patients, a cohort study of HIV positive patients attending two Dublin general practices, the use of primary care services by drug users attending HIV prevention unit, a quality of life study, a Merchants Quay study on primary health care needs of injecting drug users and GP/hospital combined care of patients with HIV disease.  Publications <Col N="179" /> are available on these projects and other aspects related to research of HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>My Department commissioned the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN) and Nexus Research to provide a report and baseline study on HIV prevention strategies and the gay community. This was published in 1995 and its recommendations form the basis for the development of future prevention strategies for this specific group.</P>
    <P>Since almost 50 per cent of cases of HIV/AIDS are drug related the funding which is provided to health boards is for the provision of both drugs and AIDS services.  Additional funding granted each year to health boards since 1992 for drugs and AIDS services is as follows:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following its consultation process, the board is now of the opinion that the establishment of a diabetic clinic at Tralee would require the appointment of an additional consultant.  In view of the significant resource implications for this development, it will have to be prioritised, in the <Col N="180" /> first instance, by the board.  It will then fall to be considered by my Department in the context of the board's priorities and the many competing demands for resources within the acute health sector.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As part of the 1992 development of services to people with a mental handicap, a special home support scheme was initiated to help meet the needs of families with a member with a mental handicap.  The scheme works in a flexible manner; for example by providing assistance to clients in their homes, taking them to leisure activities and allowing carers a few hours off.  The home support service is provided by both health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies and is specifically targeted at those persons who have no service or an inadequate service.</P>
      <P>People with physical disabilities receive home support through home help schemes provided either by the health boards or on their behalf by voluntary agencies to give domestic assistance to people who need it.  A number of voluntary organisations provide a home care attendant service aimed at offering temporary relief to the carer by providing a care attendant to look after the daily living needs of the person with a disability.  The service is available at weekends, overnight and at other unsociable times.  The development of home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities will be addressed in the context of the publication of the report of the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Domiciliary care allowance (DCA) is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are so severely physically or mentally disabled that they need care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  Eligibility for the DCA is determined primarily by reference to the level of care and <Col N="182" /> attention which the child requires rather than the type of disability involved.</P>
      <P>The guidelines state that the child's disability must be present at the time of the application, have been present for at least six months prior to that date and be likely to continue for at least a year.  Once approved, payment is made from the date of application.</P>
      <P>The question of income support is one of the areas which have been covered by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, whose report has just been launched by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  Accordingly, the criteria for entitlement to DCA will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations contained in the report.</P>

    <P>The NPWS is currently examining the nature conservation needs of an area in the Sliabh an Iarainn-Cuilcagh range and would hope that cross-Border conservation measures can be agreed in conjunction with the Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland.  As this examination is still at an early stage, it is not possible to give any details of what area of land may ultimately be involved or the particular <Col N="183" /> nature conservation designation that could be applied to it.</P>
    <P>For any area in this jurisdiction to be designated as a national park it must first contain a significant range of natural or semi-natural ecosystems.  It must also meet other internationally recognised criteria, such as having a minimum size of 1,000 hectares and the area must be in State ownership or under State control for management purposes.  It is not clear if the area mentioned by the Deputy would meet such criteria for qualification as a national park.</P>

      <P>Car testing will be carried out at dedicated test centres established and operated by a franchisee to be appointed on a national basis, following an open competitive tendering process.  It is envisaged that test centres will be strategically located in an integrated national network to minimise the distance motorists will be required to travel for a test; in addition, consideration will be given to the use of mobile test centers in more remote areas.  The franchisee will be responsible for providing suitable premises for test centres and will not have the authority to appoint agents to carry out testing on its behalf.  The proposed system will be based on dedicated testing centres and will operate independently of commercial garages where servicing and normal repairs are carried out.</P>

      <P>An application for entry in the special voters' list is required to be made each year because the list <Col N="188" /> remains in force only for the duration of the relevant register of electors of which it forms part.  As the special voting facility is not confined solely to persons with a permanent physical illness or physical disability, the requirement that applicants for entry in the list make an application annually is essential to ensure that persons do not remain on the list after their circumstances may have changed.  Since 1992, medical certificates are not required for applications after the first, unless specially requested by the registration authority.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities are not required to apply an income limit in determining eligibility for local authority housing, although some authorities may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income limit for shared ownership and local authority house purchase loans is based on a formula of two and a half times the principal income in the preceding income tax year, plus <Col N="191" /> once any subsidiary income in the same period. To be eligible, the product of this formula should not exceed £35,000.  Full details of the formula and examples of its application in different circumstances are contained in <i>Social Housing</i>&mdash;<i>The Way Ahead</i>, copies of which are in the Oireachtas library.  No income limit applies in the case of approved applicants for local authority housing, local authority tenants and tenant purchasers who surrender their dwelling to the authority and tenants for more than one year of houses provided by voluntary housing bodies under the rental subsidy scheme who surrender their dwelling to the voluntary body.</P>
    <P>My Department has not specified a maximum level of finance which may be advanced under the shared ownership system; however, the housing authority must be satisfied that the applicant's income is sufficient to meet the loan repayments and the rent.  The maximum local authority house purchase loan currently available is £33,000, other than on specified offshore islands where the maximum is £35,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189, 190, 191, 192 and 193 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is required by the Road Traffic Act, 1968, to consist of not less than three and not more than five members, appointed by the Minister.  The bureau's establishment order provides that one of the members is to be appointed by the Minister as chairman.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the bureau, Dr. Robert Carroll, died on 16 February 1996 and my Department was notified of this by the bureau at the time.  On 25 April 1996, I appointed one of the remaining four members, Mr. G. Maher, as chairman.  Mr. Maher served as chairman until 5 September 1996 when the current chairman, Dr. Bernadette Herity, was appointed.  The appointment of a fith member of the bureau will be made shortly following receipt on 15 November of nominations by the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
    <P>A total of 913 certificates was issued in the period 16 February to 25 April 1996 where, on analysis, it was determined that the specimen contained a concentration of alcohol in excess of the maximum permitted level.  These certificates were issued by the director of the bureau, or by one of the duly appointed deputy directors, each of whom is authorised by law to issue such certificates under the seal of the bureau.  The director is responsible under the Acts for managing the day-to-day business of the bureau and for exercising general supervision in relation to the performance by it of its statutory functions. It is not the practice, therefore, to have certificates completed, issued, signed, or sealed by the chairman.  Moreover, no question relating to any such certificate came before a meeting of the bureau in the period referred to.</P>
    <P>The bureau's establishment order provides that the proceedings of the bureau shall not be invalidated by any vacancy or vacancies among its members and that the quorum for a meeting of the bureau shall be two.  The order also provides that, if the chairman is not present at a meeting of the bureau, the members of the bureau who are present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting; this procedure was followed in the period 16 February to 25 April 1996.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the foregoing that the bureau is validly constituted, and has been throughout 1996.</P>

      <P>The main criteria to be met for the granting of permanent recognition are that the school can clearly demonstrate that there is sufficient pupil demand to ensure its long-term viability and that it is being conducted in accordance with my Department's rules.</P>
      <P>All new multi-denominational primary schools and all-Irish schools, both primary and post-primary, are initially recognised by my Department on a temporary basis.  The period of temporary recognition of a school is a trial period during which its general operation and future viability can be assessed.  When my Department is satisfied that a school has a viable future and is being conducted in accordance with the rules, full recognition may be granted.</P>
      <P>More recently, however, as a result of significant demographic decline which is already evident at primary level, my concern to ensure the viability of all applicant schools has increased considerably.  This was a major factor in my decision to establish the commission on school accommodation needs, whose task it will be to draw up detailed criteria for the recognition of new primary schools.</P>
      <P>I will consider if new or revised conditions are required with regard to the recognition of new schools in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>The total grant aid allocated to each county for the years 1994 to 1996 under the recreational facilities grant scheme and the amounts allocated per head of population for these years is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Projects are selected for assistance in accordance with criteria which includes the priority of the proposed improvements/facility in relation to the organisations' existing facilities; the amount of local funds available; the ability of an organisation to undertake the project; the availability of other facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds and the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department has regard to the number of applications received and the level of funding allocated to each county in previous years under both the recreational and major facilities schemes.  I am satisfied that these schemes are operated in a fair and reasonable manner.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that this school has recently been selected for inclusion in the urban phase of the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  Under this initiative, a targeted programme of special supports is being made available to selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>As a result of its inclusion in this initiative, the school in question has been allocated four additional teacher posts to allow for a maximum class size of 15:1 in all junior classes.  The school will also receive special additional funding for the purchase of teaching and learning materials and equipment.  A further sum will be allocated to the school to facilitate the development of out of school projects aimed at combating educational disadvantage.  In addition, the school will attract enhanced capitation funding at a rate of £75 per pupil.</P>
      <P>A newly appointed co-ordinator is overseeing the operation of the urban phase of the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  My Department is also arranging to provide targeted in-career development for the teaching staff involved in the new initiative.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that the school in question is one of a small group of schools which have been allocated a special teacher counsellor post under a pilot initiative aimed at addressing the difficulties presented by disruptive pupils.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 and 218 together.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the national lottery has significantly increased funding available for sport and has assisted the introduction of new initiatives over the past number of years in both the current and capital programmes and has provided for the expansion and improvement of existing schemes.  The total expenditure on sport from 1986 to 1995 was £96.721 million.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides support for youth work services, principally by grant-aiding voluntary youth organisations and community groups from the proceeds of the national lottery. A specific scheme of grants is made available in respect of special out-of-school projects for disadvantaged young people.  Under the grant scheme for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth, grant-aid is allocated to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to a variety of socioeconomic factors, including drug misuse and juvenile crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> Given that youth work with disadvantaged young people continues to be accorded priority, I have provided for the establishment of a number of new projects and improvements in existing services under this scheme in 1996.</P>
    <P>At national and at European Union levels, the Minister of State at my Department is seeking to achieve greater emphasis on the special role which youth and sport activities can play in combating the problems of drug abuse, crime and social exclusion, particularly among young people.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will understand, however, that funding for schemes under these programmes is made available by the Minister for Finance in the context of the annual Estimates.  While this funding is limited in the context of the number of applications on hand seeking grant-aid, every effort is made by my Department to obtain maximum funding to assist voluntary community organisations with projects under the terms of the schemes.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to make any commitment at present in relation to future allocations of remedial teacher posts.  My capacity to allocate such posts in any school year is dependent on the availability of resources in that year and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available posts across a wide range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>

    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 <Col N="205" /> remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As a part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process as resources permit.

      <P>Under the resolution to which the Deputy refers, the members states agreed to intensify where <Col N="206" /> necessary, their efforts to integrate or encourage integration of children with disabilities into mainstream schools in all appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education <i>Charting our Education Future</i> sets out the Government's policy for the provision of suitable education services for pupils with disabilities.  A fundamental objective of the commitments in the White Paper is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures outlined in the White Paper are entirely consistent with and supportive of the sentiments expressed in the resolution to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The meeting of EU Education Ministers on 6 December, 1996 will be concerned with the concept of life-long learning.  It will not deal in detail with specific aspects of mainstream educational provision.  It would not therefore constitute an appropriate forum in which to seek a reaffirmation of the resolution in question.</P>

      <P>Part V of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 and the related First Schedule which came into operation with effect from 15 November 1996, introduced provisions which deal with drug trafficking at sea.  In particular, it enables the Naval Service, the Customs and Excise Service and the Garda Síochána to stop, board and search ships in order to detect drug trafficking offences.  This will greatly enhance the ability of the Irish authorities to deal with drug trafficking at sea.</P>
      <P>Ireland ratified the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances on 3 September 1996.  The convention, which comes into force as regards Ireland on 3 December 1996, contains, among other things, a requirement in Article 17 on parties to the convention to co-operate to the fullest extent possible to suppress illicit traffic by sea, in conformity with the international law of the sea.  Part V of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, gives effect to the requirements of Article 17.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also prioritised action against drugs during its Presidency of the European Union.  A series of measures to protect the external frontier against drug trafficking have been agreed.  Of particular importance in this regard are measures introduced to promote police customs co-operation, combat trafficking on the Balkan routes and enhance co-operation between customs and business in the fight against drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> Other practical measures being proposed by the Presidency include initiatives at the external frontiers, measures to combat money laundering, prevention of the diversion of precursors, training, judicial co-operation and international co-operation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  229 and 231 together.  The position in relation to this matter is as follows. The Garda authorities have been approached by ESAT Digifone with a proposal to share Garda ratio masts in the context of ESAT's planned mobile telephone network.  The Garda consider that the arrangements proposed by ESAT is technically feasible and would offer significant benefits to them.</P>
      <P>The Departments of Finance, the Environment and Transport, Energy and Communications, and the office of Public Works were consulted and had no objection in principle to ESAT sharing Garda radio masts.  Approval in principle was, therefore, given to the Garda Commissioner to enter discussions with ESAT on the basis that a definitive decision to enter such an arrangement would be taken only if it could be established that it would represent value to the State and would not impair Garda communications or security.  As yet, no final agreement has been reached or contract made.</P>
      <P>Discussions with ESAT are ongoing and the various Government Departments involved are being kept informed of progress.  A condition of any agreement with ESAT would be that their use of any Garda site would be subject to their complying fully with planning legislation.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are aware of the Department of the Environment guidelines on telecommunications antennae and support structures, and are satisfied that the proposals being considered by them do not conflict with these guidelines.</P>

      <P>Pending completion of the restructuring deals and consideration of the pensions issue generally I am not in a position at this stage to set out the effects of such deals on the pensions of all former members of the Garda Síochána or the Prison Service.</P>
      <P>Restructuring deals have still to be finalised in respect of several other major public service groups.

    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> In so far as the Garda Síochána is concerned, agreement was reached at the Garda conciliation council in March, 1994 which provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances for members of the force of garda, sergeant and inspector rank who retired after 1 January, 1993.  The agreement was reached under the terms of the local bargaining clause &mdash; clause 3 &mdash; of the agreement on pay and conditions which formed part of the <i>Programme for</i><i>for Economic and Social Progress</i></P>
    <P>A similar restructuring deal under the local bargaining clause &mdash; clause 2 (iii) &mdash; of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, which succeeded the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, has not yet been concluded in respect of the superintendent and chief superintendent ranks in the force.  In this regard, the rank represented by the Association of Garda Superintendents has, under the terms of clause 2 (iv) of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> received a 1 per cent special pay increase effective from 1 April 1994 which will be fully offset against the final outcome of the restructuring deal.  This 1 per cent increase has been applied to the pensions in respect of retired superintendents.</P>

      <P>By virtue of seven Government decisions taken since 1992 in response to humanitarian appeals, 705 persons from the formers Yugoslavia have been admitted to the State.  The latest decision was taken in August 1995 in response to an appeal from the United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees.  This latest decisions provided for the admittance of up to 250 persons from the former Yugoslavia together with their close relatives.  To date some 151 of these persons have arrived and a further 39 are to arrive shortly.</P>
      <P>These persons, often referred to as programme refugees, are admitted to the temporary protection of the State with the full rights of refugees, in that they benefit from health, social welfare, education, housing and employment-related services on the same basis as Irish nationals.  These persons have been advised that there is no question of them being forcibly repatriated to their country of origin and while most have decided to remain in the State a small number have voluntarily returned to their home country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By virtue of my discretionary powers under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and <Col N="212" /> 1986, I have decided that these programme refugees from the former Yugoslavia may apply for naturalisation as Irish citizens after three years' residency in the State.  In this regard they are being treated in a similar manner to &ldquo;convention refugees&rdquo;, that is, those persons who are granted refugee status under the provisions of the 1951 United Nations Conventions relating to refugee status as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol thereto.  My Department has already received 126 applications for naturalisation from programme refugees from the former Yugoslavia and the processing of these applications has commenced.</P>
    <P>In addition to programme refugees from the former Yugoslavia, we have received a number of applications for asylum from individuals from this region who have made their own way here over the past five years.  The applications of these persons are being considered in accordance with our international obligations in this area.  Such persons would usually be illegal immigrants to this country, most of them not being in possessions of visas; but it is the general practice that persons in those circumstances who seek asylum having arrived here will not be removed from the State until their applications for asylum have been fully considered.  The Refugee Act 1996, which I expect will be in force early next year, puts this practice on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>I am aware that persons putting themselves forward as refugees or asylum seekers from various areas of central and eastern Europe have been seen begging in our streets.  There are some indications that not all of those with placards or notes to that effect are from where they say they are, or are in fact asylum seekers at all in some cases.  The Garda Síochána have been advised of the situations.</P>
    <P>In so far as this activity is concerned, I might add for the Deputy's informations that supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; SWA &mdash; legislation provides an entitlements to &ldquo;every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs...&rdquo;; section 171 Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1993.  There is no residence conditions in the legislation, and presence in the State is sufficient to receive a payment regardless of immigrations status.  Accordingly, programme refugees who are not in employment qualify for SEA, as do asylum seekers.  A single person may qualify for a payment of £62.40 per week and a married couple with three children may qualify for a payment of £140.50 per week.  Payment may continue indefinitely and may include all SWA elements including basic payments, rent supplements and other payments such as exceptional needs payments and clothing and footwear allowance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  236, 238, 246, 248, 257 and 258 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the report of the inquiry which I established to investigate the failure to inform Judge Lynch of the Government decision of 1 August 1996 to remove him from the Special Criminal Court.  This report outlines the sequence of events surrounding this failure.  It deals with the receipt of the Attorney General's letters dated 2 October 1996 and dated 1 November 1996 on pages 4 and 7 and I refer the Deputy particularly to those pages of the report.</P>
      <P>The letters from the Attorney General were not marked urgent or for immediate attention. Furthermore, none of the correspondence received by me or my Department in this matter was sent by registered mail.</P>
      <P>With regard to the response to the Attorney General's letter of 1 November, the report of the inquiry, as I stated in my statement to this House on 20 November, confirms that the actions taken by me on 5 November on receipt of the Attorney General's letter and on 6 November to rectify the failure commenced with my query to an official in the Courts division.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's letter of 1 November was received in my Department on 5 November. As I stated to this House on 21 November I understand that letters issuing from the Office of the Attorney General are, as is the case in most Government Departments, either hand delivered or sent by post.  I do not know why the letter dated 1 November was not received in my Department until 5 November but it should perhaps be mentioned that a weekend intervened between these two dates.</P>

      <P>The position is that judicial appointments are made in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the Government decision in my Department indicating the name of the person nominated by the Government to the President for appointment as a judge, the person nominated is contacted by telephone about the general arrangements for the making of the appointment and swearing in.  The person concerned is normally notified orally and in writing of the detailed arrangements for the swearing in ceremony which, under the Constitution, must take place not later than ten days after the signature of the Warrant of Appointment by the Taoiseach and the President or such later date as may be determined by the President.  The Warrant of Appointment, signed by the President and the Taoiseach, which must be available for the swearing in ceremony, is dispatched by my Department to the Registrar of the Supreme Court who notifies my Department in writing when the new judge has been sworn in.</P>
      <P>In the case of appointments to the Superior Courts the signature by the President of the warrant and the swearing in of the new judge generally take place on the same day.</P>
      <P>It can happen, for a variety of reasons, that all arrangements are made orally.  I should point out that the warrant itself is the written instrument of appointment.</P>

      <P>Although no formal checklist has been used, it is the case that procedures have existed in my Department for the implementation of Cabinet decisions.  The procedures that existed when I took up office are the same as those that existed during previous Governments.  Nobody in my Department is aware of a situation where these procedures failed to work satisfactorily, apart from the recent case involving Judge Dominic Lynch.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware from my statement to the Dáil on 20 November 1996 on the Cromien-Molloy report, new detailed arrangements have now been put in place in this regard.  These arrangements require weekly reporting between the Secretary and the Assistant Secretaries of the Department to ensure that decisions taken by the Government are acted upon immediately and that implementation difficulties, if any, are promptly identified.</P>

      <P>The procedure followed by my Department, in common with other Departments, for insertion of a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is that the notice in question is forwarded to the editor of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> accompanied by an official demand form.  The form identifies which particular Department and section has submitted the request.  Once the text of the relevant notice is approved, generally at senior administrative level, the demand form is signed either by that officer or by an officer reporting to him/her.</P>
      <P>A wide variety of notices are inserted by my Department and the offices under its aegis. Examples would include the notice of making of statutory instruments, the granting of certificates of naturalisation, and the making of censorship orders regarding books and videos.  Follow-up procedures arising from publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> are not relevant in all cases and will depend on the particular notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notices for the appointment of judges are <Col N="220" /> placed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> by the Government Secretariat.  In the case of prohibition orders for books, these must be entered in the Register of Prohibited Books immediately following their publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  The publication of a notice of a certificate of naturalisation or the making of a statutory instrument to provide for, say, a new place of detention, would, however, require no follow-up action arising directly from the publication.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that up to 1990-91, copies of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> were circulated to all members of the Judiciary.  This practice was then stopped after consultation with the Judiciary and only those who expressly requested circulation continued to receive copies.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for qualification for retirement pension, which is payable at age 65, is that the person retires from insurable employment, other than employment which is insurable only for occupational injuries benefit. This condition has been in force since the pension was first introduced in 1970 and is considered to be reasonable.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension which is payable at age 66 has no retirement conditions attached to it.</P>
      <P>The cost of eliminating the retirement condition and effectively reducing the old age pension age to 65 is estimated at £30 million in a full year, not including the additional cost of free schemes.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> considered that a standard age for both retirement and old age pensions should be 65 years.  However, because of the costs involved they considered this to be a low priority.</P>
      <P>The numbers in receipt of retirement pension at the end of 1994-95 and the end of September 1996 are as follows; 1994, 62,211; 1995, 65,761; 1996, 68,753 at end of September 1996.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996 provided for the introduction of class A PRSI for community employment workers commencing such employment on or after 6 April 1996.  In addition, provision was made for existing community employment workers, that is, those who commenced community employment prior to 6 April 1996, to be given the option of paying class A PRSI, if they wished, or of continuing with their existing class J PRSI.  Existing community employment workers were given until 30 April 1996, to exercise that option and those who opted for class A PRSI will continue to pay class A for the duration of their employment on community employment.  It is not possible for them to revert to class J at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of class A PRSI contributions for community employment workers places community employment on a par with other class A employment in so far as social insurance is concerned.  Community employment workers get a paid PRSI contribution for each week on community employment instead of the credited contribution which they would have received previously.  The resulting increased number of <Col N="222" /> paid contributions will improve the insurance record of community employment workers and help them to qualify for social insurance benefits and pensions in the future.</P>
    <P>By virtue of paying class A PRSI contributions, persons returning to the live register after completing a period of community employment, may qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance LTUA.  In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, LTUA is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the justification for the dependency principle in the social welfare system; the reason two members of a couple receive lesser payments than two individuals who are, for example, brother and sister or father and son both living in the same dwelling; his views on whether the living costs are the same in all cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare system, as originally developed, was based on the traditional pattern of the husband being the main breadwinner and the wife being mainly dependent on him for income support.  The social and economic realities in Ireland have altered considerably over the past 50 years and the social welfare system has responded to these changes.  For example, the automatic presumption of a wife being dependent on her husband was replaced in 1986, with the introduction of the equal treatment provisions which provided for a genuine test of dependency applying equally to both men and women.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, while there have been significant changes in demographic, labour market and family structures over the years, the fact remains that women, and particularly married women, are under-represented in the labour market. Although women account for just over 50 per cent of the population, at present women comprise only 37 per cent of the paid workforce and married women only 18 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All claimants for social insurance payments, regardless of their marital status, household situation or means, receive the full personal rate of payment once they satisfy the relevant contribution conditions.  This is not the position, however, in the case of social assistance <Col N="223" /> payments.  While the structure of social assistance payments does not systematically reflect the variety of household situations which may exist, nevertheless the level of assistance payable is frequently affected by the claimant's household situation.</P>
    <P>For example, in assessing the means of single persons who are living with their parents for unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance purposes, account is taken of the benefit derived by the claimants by virtue of their residing in that household.  There are a number of other provisions which affect the level of social assistance payable.  For instance, where both of a married or cohabiting couple claim unemployment assistance or pre-retirement allowance, the rate of assistance payable to both is limited to the &ldquo;married rate&rdquo;, that is, they each receive half of the personal allowance together with the adult dependant allowance.</P>
    <P>The rate of assistance payable in such circumstances reflects the fact that such households achieve certain economies, the most obvious examples being accommodation costs and household expenses.  The extent of economies achieved by other household types varies depending on how they organise their affairs.</P>
    <P>The concept of dependency has been the subject of a number of recent studies and individualisation of entitlements has been proposed as an alternative.  The review group on the treatment of households in the social welfare code looked at a number of alternative systems for providing individual entitlements.  For example, every adult irrespective of marital status could be provided with an entitlement to payment in his or her own right, irrespective of the means of the spouse or partner.  Alternatively, the means of a spouse or partner could be taken into account in determining the entitlements of one of a married or cohabiting couple.  The expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems also examined this issue. However, they found a number of disadvantages associated with the introduction of a system of individual entitlements and recommended against implementation of such a scheme in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The replacement of the existing dependency arrangements with a system of individual entitlements would be extremely costly and would require fundamental changes to the existing payments structure.  Accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of the long-term development of the social welfare system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to basic income for children, it is now widely recognised that some aspects of the State's income support for children contribute to poverty traps and disincentives to work.  As stated in the Government programme, this Government is committed to working towards a basic income system for children.  We have already been taking the first steps in this regard. We have been gradually improving child benefit, while reducing the relative importance of child dependant allowances.  Child benefit has been increased by 45 per cent since this Government took office.</P>
      <P>The expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, which reported earlier this year, identified reform of child income support as one of the key priorities for future development of the tax and social welfare systems.  The expert group rejected a full basic income for children on the basis of its high cost (around £400 million in additional annual expenditure), and because much of the gains would go to families on higher earnings.  The expert group put forward three more selective approaches to income support for children.  I am currently examining these, with a view to determining the best way of moving towards our overall objective of making income support for children more independent of the labour force status of their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to a general basic income for all, it is important not to confuse basic income with a <Col N="226" /> minimum adequate income, or a minimum wage. Basic income would be a payment, made by the State, to all citizens, regardless of other income, family circumstances or labour force status.  A full basic income would be paid at a level high enough to replace all social welfare payments.  A partial basic income would be paid a lower level, and would therefore require retention of part of the social welfare system to cater for people with no other source of income.</P>
    <P>The question of basic income was examined in some detail by the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare systems, which I referred to above.  The expert group also examined a number of options for full or partial basic income for all.  They looked first at a full basic income, that is, a basic income which would be high enough to replace existing social welfare payments and personal tax allowances.  Research commissioned by the group showed that, if this were to be financed through the income tax system, it would require a tax rate of 68 per cent on all other income.  The group concluded that such a high tax would be likely to have an adverse effect on employment, and therefore did not recommend full basic income at this point in time.</P>
    <P>The group also examined a number of options for partial basic income.  That is, a basic income at a lower level of payment; this would require the retention of some elements of the existing social welfare system.  The group rejected this approach.  The group's view was, essentially, that if the rate of basic income is high enough to have any substantial impact on simplifying the tax/transfer system, it would require very high levels of taxation.  It would be possible to fund a partial basic income at a low level (around IR£21 per week) without any tax rate increase.  This is just under one-third of the level of the lowest personal rates of social welfare payment.  Thus, a considerable part of the social welfare system would need to be retained in order to &ldquo;top up&rdquo; the partial basic income, so that partial basic income would not have a significant effect on incentives.</P>
    <P>Whether or not basic income becomes feasible in the future will depend on relative movements of a large number of variables, such as the desired level of the basic income, the tax rate that may be imposed, the dependency ratio in the population, the relative level of employment and unemployment, and any changes in social welfare systems and structures in other EU countries.</P>

      <P>Under this scheme grants can be made for a wide range of activities covering almost every aspect of personal and skills development for women.  Projects should involve the participants in the running of, and where possible, the design of the project itself.

      <P>While this group received funding on a once-off basis in 1995 towards the cost of office equipment and furniture, funding is not normally provided by my Department towards the ongoing costs of services that come within the remit of other statutory agencies.

      <P>This would include providing support services to people who have suffered a bereavement through suicide, which is the responsibility of the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>In this letter of 30 October the Deputy requested a copy of correspondence issued to the person concerned regarding her right to appeal a decision to reject her claim for deserted wife's benefit.  These notifications are of a standard format and copies are not kept for individual cases.  A reply to this effect issued to the Deputy on 25 November.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, deserted wife's benefit was awarded with effect from 1 December 1994 on the basis of the information furnished by the person concerned with her application of 17 May 1995.  An earlier claim in November 1991 was refused.  However, the case has been further reviewed and it has now been decided to award deserted wife's benefit with effect from the date of the original claim i.e. November 1991.  Payment of arrears due will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte Éireann is the executive agency responsible for promoting and developing tourist traffic in and to the State, through implementation of Government policy.  It is a statutory body and its powers and functions are set out in the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939-95.  It is run by a board of directors appointed by the Minister for Tourism and Trade with the consent of the Minister for Finance and it reports to the Department of Tourism and Trade.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development was established in 1959 and is the regional economic development agency for the Shannon region with responsibility for tourism promotion and development in the mid west region.  Whereas SFADCo reports to the Department of Enterprise and Employment, funds are provided through my Department's Vote to help defray its tourism administration and general expenses.</P>
      <P>The regional tourism organisations were initially established by Bord Fáilte in 1963 under section 5 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  They are structured as private companies registered under the Companies Acts, limited by guarantee with memoranda and articles of association which contain <i>inter alia</i>, stipulations relating to their management, administration and general business affairs.  In accordance with their memoranda and articles, regional tourism authorities are accountable to, and obliged to operate in accordance with the policies and directions of Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been advised by the Department of Finance that if, for example, a bed and breakfast operation were to be made liable to commercial rates, the relevant rate would be applied to the rateable valuation in respect of the property, or element of the property, used for the operation.  The rateable valuation of an individual property is determined by reference to its net annual value, in this case, its net annual rent.  The interaction of the rate in the pound for the rating district in which a bed and breakfast was located with the rateable valuation for the same bed and breakfast operation would determine its rates liability.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to estimate impact on accommodation costs if all forms of accommodation were made subject to commercial rates as proposed in the report referred to, because there are too many other variables e.g. quantum of rate bills, competitive and market forces etc., to be considered to allow for any form of reliable estimate to be made at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office estimates that in 1995 foreign exchange earnings from visitors to Ireland totalled £1,677 billion.  This revenue coupled with estimated domestic tourism expenditure in the same year of £625 million represented 6.4 per cent of GNP.  In the same year tourism accounted for 8.3 per cent of total employment in the economy or an estimated 102,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>This year the CSO estimate that overseas visitor numbers have increased by a further 11 per cent to over 3.8 million in the first nine months of this year.  Their estimate for foreign exchange earnings from visitors for the first half of 1996 is £777 million &mdash; an increase of over 16 per cent on the same period in 1995.  I am confident that Irish tourism will continue to make an increasingly important contribution to prosperity and employment in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283, 285 and 286 together.</P>
      <P>The proposed directive on the type approval of certain components and systems of two and three wheel motor vehicles forms part of the EC motor vehicle type approval system, the aim of which is to achieve harmonisation of manufacturing/safety standard requirements for two and three wheel vehicles throughout the community.</P>
      <P>These vehicles are not manufactured in Ireland not are the components or systems referred to in the proposed directive.  Accordingly, it does not have industrial implications for Ireland.  However, motorcycle users here will be affected to the extent that new motorcycles will have to comply with the provisions of the directive.</P>
      <P>After lengthy and complex debate at Council working group level in Brussels, a common position on the proposed directive was reached at a Council meeting in November, 1995.  As noted in the questions, the European Parliament has tabled amendments to the proposed directive and these were discussed at Council working group level during the Irish Presidency.  However, it emerged in those discussions in the Council working group that not all the amendments proposed by the European Parliament were acceptable to member states and, accordingly, the proposal will be examined under the conciliation procedure involving Council and Parliament.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, keen to see that process begin at the earliest date convenient to all the other parties involved, i.e. the Parliament, the EU Commission and the Council Secretariat.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to those signing on the live register but not in receipt of an unemployment compensation payment.</P>
      <P>Community Employment (CE) is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities together with some training that would enhance the employment prospects of those at whom the programme is targeted.</P>
      <P>The present eligibility criteria for CE only came into effect earlier this year following a detailed review of CE and in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment.  These criteria were designed to target the programme at priority groups and include provision for married unemployed persons to swop their social welfare entitlement in order to qualify for participation in the programme.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to widen the eligibility criteria to include additional categories such as those not in receipt of a social welfare payment at present. CE is operating at, or close to capacity, relative to available resources, and to extend eligibility would be at the expense of the priority groups for whom the programme is designed.</P>

      <P>Definitive statistics on the level of unemployment are based on the labour force survey.  Unfortunately, labour force survey results <Col N="236" /> are not available for small areas.  The live register provides monthly data on claimants for unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and other registrants classified by local office of registration but it is not an accurate indicator of the level of unemployment.  The number of persons on the live register at the Buncrana local office on the last Friday of October 1993 to 1996, was as follows:</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to re-adaptation aid payable, under Article 56.2 (b) of the ECSC Treaty, to workers made redundant from Irish Steel Ltd. due to the 1994 restructuring plan.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that considerable progress has been made in this matter and I am confident of a favourable outcome.  The indications were that a formal Commission decision would have been taken at this stage but because the Irish case is being processed with all other readaptation aid cases, the approval procedure has been delayed. However, my Department has recently been informed that a formal decision is expected to be taken within a couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>I understand that, once formal approval has been received, the Commission will make the funding available to my Department within two to three months.  I will then ensure that payments are made to the eligible workers as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Insurers impose premium loadings or charge higher premiums in the light of their underwriting experience in each category of insurance business.  Most insurers provide cover for diabetics suffering with a mild form of this condition without applying loadings of any kind. Insurers applying loadings on premiums for motorists with more severe forms of diabetes do so on the basis of their claims experience for such policyholders.</P>

    <P>I understand that the Irish Insurance Federation have been conducting negotiations with the Irish Diabetic Association with a view to establishing a standard questionnaire for completion by diabetic proposers for motor <Col N="238" /> insurance or named drivers on such policies with a view to a better assessment of the circumstances governing individual risks.  I also gather that these negotiations have now been finalised.</P>

      <P>The concern addressed by the Prompt Payments Bill, 1996, which was discussed during Private Members' Time on 20 November 1996 was the need to ensure that small businesses are paid promptly by Government Departments and State bodies.</P>
      <P>As explained on Second Stage, the Government considered that the Private Members' Bill would not prove to be an effective or adequate mechanism for ensuring the prompt payment of business accounts by public sector bodies to suppliers.  Consequently, I could not commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>In regard to my plans to address the problem of late payments, the position is that the Government gave formal approval, on 5 November 1996, to proposals submitted by me to have a Prompt Payment Bill drafted.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure the prompt payment of amounts due to suppliers of goods and services by public sector purchasers and by subcontractors on public sector contracts.  I expect to publish the Bill early in the new year.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any recent increase in the price of gas to horticultural growers in north County Dublin.  I understand <Col N="242" /> from An Bord Gáis that the initial gas price to these growers allowed for the recovery of investment in capital required for the conversion to natural gas and that subsequently a new pricing regime was agreed with representatives of the growers which is gradually bringing the price of natural gas into line with other natural gas users of similar size.  As part of this agreement there is a provision for a review of the situation at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In view of this forthcoming review I have asked An Bord Glas to arrange a meeting with An Bord Gáis and representatives of the growers regarding the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 326 and 329 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answers to Parliamentary Question No. 13 of 2 July 1996 and Question No. 7 of 24 October last in which I clearly set out Ireland's general position concerning review of the health and safety provisions of the EURATOM Treaty.</P>
      <P>The discussion paper, CONF/3877/96, to which the Deputy refers was, in fact, submitted by the Irish delegation to the Intergovernmental Conference on 19 July last.  A copy of the document has been forwarded to the Oireachtas Library.  The main purpose of the discussion document was to promote discussion on the challenges of enlargement as regards ensuring high standards of nuclear safety and radiological protection in the EU.</P>
      <P>On the basis of initial consideration of Ireland's discussion paper there would appear to be little support for addressing this issue by means of an amendment to the EURATOM Treaty at present.  As the Deputy is aware, any amendment of the EU Treaty requires unanimity.  There are, of course widely diverging views among member states about the benefits of nuclear power.  There are also different perceptions as to whether the strengthening of nuclear safety can best be addressed by means of a treaty change.</P>
      <P>There have been no contacts made at ministerial level by me concerning the terms of the discussion paper.  Consideration of any such contacts and the future approach by the Irish delegation to this subject will take account of the factors which I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 330 together.</P>
      <P>The recent publication, by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, of the results of the first phase of its national radon survey has set out in detail the levels of radon in counties Louth, Dublin, Wicklow, Cavan and Monaghan.  The survey is due to be completed in 1998 and the results of other counties will be published as they become available.</P>
      <P>The present results show that householders living in large areas of County Wicklow, on the Cooley Peninsula and Clogher Head in County Louth and in smaller localised areas in each of the other counties have a greater than 10 per cent chance of being exposed to an unacceptable level of radon.  These areas have been designated by the Institute as high radon areas and householders living in these areas are urged to have their homes tested for radon.  Where high levels of radon are found, householders are encouraged to take the necessary action to reduce the risk to themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>I stress that there is no need for householders to be unduly alarmed if they find their house has a high radon level.  Remedial measures are available and can be carried out without undue difficulty.  I do find it somewhat worrying that some householders appear to be quite reluctant to carry out remedial work despite knowing they have a radon level in excess of the minimum reference level.  In this regard, I have sought to have provision made in the 1997 estimates for a radon grant scheme which would financially assist existing householders to implement radon remediation measures.  However, I must emphasise that any proposals made by me to the Minister for Finance are subject to overall budgetary constraints.</P>

      <P>Agreement has been reached with the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (RACO) <Col N="251" /> under the restructuring clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for revised rates of pay effective from 1 October 1994.  The pensions of officers up to and including the rank of Colonel who retire after 1 October 1994, are adjusted to reflect the benefit of the pay increases implemented to date under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> agreement.</P>
      <P>The agreement recently reached with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) under the restructuring clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for increased rates of pay effective from 1 April 1994. The pensions of enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force who retire after 1 April 1994, will be adjusted to reflect the benefit of the pay increases now due to be implemented under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> agreement.</P>
      <P>Consideration is currently being given to the implications of restructuring deals of existing pensioners and pensions increase policy across the public service.  While a number of restructuring deals have been concluded to date, the outcome of talks has still to be finalised in the case of several major public service groups. Pending completion of the latter and consideration of the pensions issues generally I am not in a position at this stage to set out the effect of such deals on the pensions of former members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

      <P>In addition to basic pay, a military service allowance is payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in all conditions.  The current rate in the case of officers is £2,070 per annum, and in the case of noncommissioned officers and privates is £39.10 per week (£2,040 p.a.), with the exception of privates with less than three years' service who receive £14.09 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowance is paid irrespective of the actual hours worked.  In addition, all personnel posted to Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £49.57 per week in the case of officers and £43.81 per week in the case of noncommissioned <Col N="252" /> officers and privates.  The allowance is paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, incuding during periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc.</P>
    <P>Subsistence allowance is payable only where personnel who are performing duties away from their stations are not provided with meals.  This does not arise frequently, however, as there is a comprehensive catering system in place in Border units, in which there has been heavy investment, to cope with feeding troops in the field.</P>
    <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, the payment of allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (RACO) and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the association.</P>
    <P>The question of the payment of an allowance to personnel involved with the recent BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the associations, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential.  You will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is under active consideration at present it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 337, 338 and 339 together.</P>
      <P>The overall position is that Ireland is committed, by way of a signed international agreement approved by Dáil Éireann in 1992, to the provision of a Loran C station as part of a North West European radio navigation system. The Supreme Court judgment of July last which upheld an earlier High Court decision concerning the legal powers of the Commissioners of Irish Lights has implications not just for the proposed Loran C project but also for the existing range of radio-based aids to marine navigation provided by the Commissioners.  I propose, therefore, to shortly seek Government approval to introduce amending legislation to ensure that the Commissioners can continue to provide these valuable aids to marine navigation in the interests of maritime safety.  In relation to the proposed Loran C station, this project may not proceed pending resolution of separate legal proceedings concerning the granting of planning permission by An Bord Pleanála.  It is not possible, therefore, to make a definitive statement regarding the future of the project until there is absolute clarity on all the legal issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>System coverage prediction calculations indicated that the south west of Ireland would be the most suitable location for the Loran C station. During 1990-91 an extensive site selection study was undertaken in counties Kerry and Clare by the Commissioners of Irish Lights with the assistance of Ove Arup Consulting Engineers, the University of Wales and the head of the North <Col N="254" /> West European Loran C System Programme Management Office.  Over 40 potential sites were inspected and the site near Loop Head was chosen as the most suitable by reference to a comprehensive range of selection criteria.</P>
    <P>The total costs incurred to date in respect of the proposed Loran C station amount to £2,920,032, of which £1,395,577 has been paid by the Irish Exchequer.  Taking into account rebates provided by the manufacturer of the equipment involved, the net cost to the Exchequer so far is £889,752.</P>

      <P>The Control of Fishing for Salmon (Amendment) Order, 1996, prescribes the maximum numbers of commercial salmon licences in each district. Licences are being capped at the numbers of commercial licences allocated in 1995.</P>
      <P>This measure is part of a package of conservation measures to be taken for the 1997 salmon season and beyond in order to conserve salmon stocks and to allow for improved escapement to rivers.  The conservation measures are the first step in a series of new practical strategies for salmon management which will be put in place framed around the recommendations of the salmon management task force. Consultations are continuing with angling organisations and the sectoral interests at regional and national level on future directions for salmon management in light of the task force recommendations and the intention to proceed with the necessary conservation measures for 1997 have been clearly signalled, and debated, in these consultations.</P>

      <P>The Control and maintenance of Balbriggan Harbour is the responsibility of Dublin Port and Docks Board.  However, late last year my Department made a grant of £60,000 to Dublin Port and Docks Board towards a significant programme of remedial and renovation work to include the breaking and disposal of wrecks, clearing rubbish from the harbour and certain dredging works at Balbriggan Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1995 and January 1996 Dublin Port and Docks Board removed all wrecks from <Col N="255" /> Balbriggan Harbour.  I am disappointed to learn that since the removal of the wrecks, three further vessels have been illegally abandoned in the harbour.  Responsibility for the removal of the vessels lies with the owners.  Dublin Port and Docks Board have instructed the owners to remove the wrecks and have given the owners until the end of December to comply with their instructions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> I understand that Dublin Port and Docks was recently awarded, through the courts, recoupment of a substantial part of the costs of removing a vessel in the harbour.  They intend to continue to pursue irresponsible owners who abandon vessels to the detriment of the harbour and the environment generally.  I have asked Dublin Port and Docks Board to examine the prospects of a regular campaign for the removal of silt from the harbour.</P>
