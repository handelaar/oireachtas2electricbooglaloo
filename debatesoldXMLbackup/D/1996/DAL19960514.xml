    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will meet the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the INOU, on 28 May 1996 to discuss its application to be involved in any negotiations on a programme which might follow the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I feel that my making a statement at this stage regarding a meeting which has not <Col N="554" /> yet taken place would undermine the purpose of the meeting which is to allow me to hear, at first hand, what the INOU has to say.</P>
    <P>Social partnership extends far beyond the membership of the Central Review Committee.  It operates through three bodies, the Central Review Committee, CRC, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC and the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF.  Because I want the social partnership process to be as inclusive as possible, I have sought the formal inputs from NESC and NESF in developing a framework for any new national programme.  These will take the form of detailed reports prepared with the full involvement of all NESC and NESF members.</P>
    <P>Both the NESC and the NESF are broadly based bodies and I would like to point out that the Government took the opportunity when reappointing the NESC last year to include representatives of the INOU.  The INOU was, of course, already a member of the NESF. It is, in these ways, included in the social partnership process.  Furthermore, over the preceding three programmes, a large number of other organisations which are not represented on the CRC, the NESC or the NESF have made an input to those programmes through meetings with and submissions to my Department.</P>
    <P>I intend to ensure that in the preparation of any new programme, mechanisms will be developed to allow for a contribution in particular in areas of direct relevance to their members from a wider number of groups than at present.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> runs until the end of 1996. However, the associated pay agreement as it applies to the public service continues until 30 June 1997.  Preparations for a new national programme which would begin in January 1997 are already under way.</P>
    <P>I will be continuing to meet informally the social partners over the remaining year of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> as the need <Col N="555" /> arises and I would intend that formal discussions in relation to a possible new programme would open in the latter part of 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government worked out a framework for the various reports?  Is it the Government's intention to try to negotiate a national programme to succeed the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both questions is in the affirmative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline when the various reports he has mentioned will be ready?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the NESC report is at an advanced stage but I cannot tell the Deputy when exactly it will be ready as that is a matter for the council.  Most of the social partners who are members of the NESC have been involved in the preparation of the report and I know it will be ready in very good time for consideration when we commence formal discussions on a possible replacement for the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed wants to meet him with a view to convincing him of the need to have it involved as a full partner in the social partnership and in the Central Review Committee?  Further, can the Taoiseach give me any good reason that organisation, whose sole focus is on employment and which represents solely the concerns of unemployed people, should not be involved as a full partner in the social partnership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated already in my reply to the original questions from Deputies Tom Kitt, Bertie Ahern and Harney that I am aware of the purpose of the meeting which the INOU is having with me on 28 May.  I <Col N="556" /> would prefer to hear at first hand the views of the INOU before making any public comment on it.  I outlined in my reply, which the Deputy heard, the ways in which the INOU, through its membership of the NESC and the NESF, is already involved in a very meaningful way in the social partnership process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the Government's greatest failure is that it is not addressing the needs of the long-term unemployed.  This constitutes a crisis and the needs of the unemployed could be addressed by the inclusion of their representatives at the negotiating table.  Today I attended a meeting of the NESF, a worthy body and the Government is cosily sidelining the issue of long-term unemployment by handing it over to that body for consideration.  Will the Taoiseach accept that a more hands-on approach is necessary and he should give a commitment that representatives of the long-term unemployed will be at the table to negotiate the new agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined to the Deputy, the unemployed, through the INOU, are represented in the preparatory work on a new programme being prepared by the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum.  In that way they are involved in a detailed and consultative way in policy-making generally.  Not only do senior representatives of all other social parties attend the National Economic and Social Council, but senior decision makers in the public service attend and are members.  Through meetings of the NESC the unemployed, as represented by the INOU, have a detailed and a constant input into Government policy-making at the highest level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in this year's budget showed great commitment to meeting the need for employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed.  It recognises that the longer people are unemployed the more difficult it becomes for them to get an interview.  We recognise <Col N="557" /> that a period in unemployment is almost equivalent to the reverse of a period in training or education because the longer the period of unemployment, the less the chance of gaining employment. Similarly the longer a period in training, the greater are the chances of employment.  There is almost an inverse relationship between training and the duration of long-term unemployment. That is why in this year's budget the Government introduced a number of measures targeted solely at the long-term unemployed to give them extra assistance to put them on as near as possible an equal footing with other job seekers so that their position would be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>What about their new programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We recognise, as will anybody who has studied this matter, that the problem of long-term unemployment is not susceptible to short-term solutions.  There is a definite sense of purpose on the part of the Government in the measures introduced in this year's budget.  They represent the most comprehensive range of measures to tackle long-term unemployment introduced by any Government in the history of the State.  I am looking forward to displaying a similar and enhanced commitment to dealing with the problem of long-term unemployment in next year's budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he does not want to put his views on the record before he meets the INOU, but they are on the record of this House.  He said he does not favour that group being made a full partner.  Has he changed his view on that?  Is there any reason to treat that organisation different from, for example, Macra Na Feirme?</P>

      <P>As I will be meeting representatives of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, it would be appropriate to hear their views before conveying any view to any other party, including Dáil Éireann, about what I might or might not say at such a meeting.  It would be open to the suggestion that I were devaluing such a meeting if I were to announce a fixed position on what those representatives propose to say to me before I hear their points of view.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach stated that the Civil Service agreement will run to June 1997.  Following a meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions last week he made a statement to the effect that the outstanding issues will be resolved in the context of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Will he outline to the House how the outstanding difficulties involving the Army, the teachers, the nurses and the civil servants will be resolved within the terms of that agreement?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter in question is currently under discussion with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with a view to finding an appropriate resolution to it.  The terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> are clear in regard to the maintenance of industrial peace and the obligation upon all those benefiting under the agreement to abide by the industrial peace clauses of that programme.  That commitment to the maintenance of industrial peace for the duration of the programme is one of the fundamentals of the social partnership approach.  In that context the Government and the trade union movement generally, as represented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, are working together with a view to finding a reasonable resolution of the problems under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

      <P>In the past ten years money was available to solve such disputes.  Will the Taoiseach state the figure available to resolve the outstanding disputes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That matter is currently under discussion between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We are not thinking in the terms referred to by the Deputy. The way he framed his question does not highlight our approach to the matter.  A different approach was adopted in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to that adopted in previous agreements of that kind.  The Deputy may recall that the approach to which he referred of money for particular purposes, was not adopted under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and, therefore, the Deputy's question does not arise.  The provision under this year's <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was different.  It was a recognition that in response to agreements to change procedures, which would deliver increased efficiency and reduce costs in <Col N="561" /> the public service, provision could be made for what were known as productivity-related pay increases.  In the context of that provision under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, which also includes a commitment not to have recourse to industrial action, and as a result of the meeting I and other members of the Government had with congress last week, efforts are being made to resolve the outstanding difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister and I reviewed by phone on Wednesday and again yesterday developments in the lead up to the all-party negotiations.  We exchanged ideas on how further reassurances might usefully be given to all the potential participants in the all-party negotiations to the effect that these will be both meaningful and substantive, and we will seriously address the issues of concern to the parties.  I do not believe it appropriate to give further details of the conversations.  However, as I said in this House on 23 April, a decision on the composition of the Government delegation to the talks will be made in due course.  I am satisfied that, notwithstanding the demands on the Government arising from our forthcoming EU Presidency and the commencement of all-party negotiations, it is not necessary to reallocate ministerial functions.  The peace process and the all-party negotiations will, of course, continue to command a very high priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Prime Minister and I are committed to the success of the negotiations.  We will do whatever is necessary, consistent with democratic principles, to secure such a successful outcome.  As I have said on a number of occasions, the attainment of that objective requires that each other's allegiances, aspirations, identities and concerns are recognised and respected <Col N="563" /> by both the Nationalist and Unionist traditions and by both Governments.  In that regard, the Government will play our part in accordance with the commitment given in paragraph 6 of the Joint Declaration.  That commitment is, of course set, in the declaration, within the context of political talks involving the representatives of the Unionist community and we look forward to hearing their views at first hand in the negotiations.  As I said recently, the values of this State are pluralist.  No one religious or political view is so dominant as to exclude others.  Our Constitution has had to be recast so as to reflect these pluralist values.  Our policy on Northern Ireland should also reflect this core pluralist value system.</P>
    <P>However, in advance of the negotiations where the Unionist community will be able to express its views, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation established a sub-committee on obstacles in the South to reconciliation.  It did much useful work and had been close to finalising a report when it was decided to defer Forum meetings.  With a restoration of the IRA ceasefire, it would be possible to bring that work to completion and to publish the report.  I very much hope that this can be done.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I had a meeting on Friday last with the UUP leader, Mr. David Trimble.  We had a cordial and constructive exchange of views on a number of important issues. While I cannot give further details, I can say, that the meeting was particularly useful in terms of creating a better mutual understanding of our respective positions.</P>
    <P>As I have said frequently in this House and elsewhere, the Government very much wishes all parties, including Sinn Féin and the loyalist parties, to be at the all-party negotiations and we are working very hard to create the conditions for this.  These include the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.  In practice, this would require the IRA to issue a clear and definitive statement, essentially in the <Col N="564" /> form and terms used on 31 August 1994, that the ceasefire was being restored.</P>
    <P>In answer to the question on visits to Northern Ireland before 10 June, I have no such plans at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all agree that it would be very helpful if everyone was at the table on 10 June.  I do not understand how the Taoiseach will manage the EU Presidency and Northern Ireland with no change in duties, but obviously he has made up his mind on that matter.  As I have stated on a number of occasions recently, there is no point in setting a date for talks if we do not involve ourselves in confidence building issues so as to bring people together on 10 June.  I welcome the decision by the British Government last week to move on the Paddy Kelly issue. I understand it will make a statement tonight on the allocation of permanent funding to Meanscoil Feirste and I would like the Taoiseach to say if this is the case.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the decision about Paddy Kelly, will the Taoiseach and the British Government deal with the issue of loyalist and republican prisoners in urging a resumption of the ceasefire? This would bring about the resumption of the ceasefire and ensure that there was a balance.  Does the Taoiseach believe that prisoners due to be released from Irish prisons over the next few years could be released by Christmas 1997 at the latest in the event of a resumption of the ceasefire before the 10 June talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be in any way evasive in my answers to the Deputy's questions but the ones about prisoners warrant separate treatment and special preparation.  This applies, in particular, to his concrete suggestion about dates.  This matter would more appropriately be addressed by the Minister for Justice.  Obviously it is important to take account of each individual case rather than adopt a blanket approach.  As the House is well aware, during the ceasefire the Government <Col N="565" /> took an advanced view about the early release of prisoners who had previously been associated with paramilitary organisations.  That policy continued throughout the ceasefire and I would see no difficulty in resuming it once the ceasefire is restored.  The question of further measures might best be addressed by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the need to show a compassionate view in regard to prisoner issues in terms of rebuilding a commitment to the political process in the communities in Northern Ireland where support for paramilitary violence has been strong in the past.  A compassionate and reasonable view in regard to prisoner issues demonstrates to people in those communities that those in political authority are conscious of the sufferings which have been undergone, are aware of the feelings of those communities and are willing to demonstrate that politics can and does deliver results which are better than those delivered by violence.</P>
      <P>On the question of Paddy Kelly, I welcome his transfer.  This matter had engaged my attention over along period in my discussions with the British Prime Minister and British Government officials and Ministers generally.  Other Members of the House have also been actively involved to that end.</P>
      <P>It is important to recall that at my first meeting the British Prime Minister within days of my assuming office I raised the issue of Meanscoil Feirste. While there has been some significant improvement in the position of Meanscoil Feirste since then as a result of the representations made by me and others, further evidence of a commitment to respect for the Irish language through this school can and should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Presidency of the European Union, the existing allocation of responsibilities is the appropriate one.  As is always the case when a country assumes the Presidency, it will impose strains on the time of individual Ministers.  There will, in particular, be immense pressures on the Minister for <Col N="566" /> Foreign Affairs, but I have no doubt that, as on previous occasions, he will be well able for the tasks he will have to undertake.  We conducted intensive negotiations on Northern Ireland simultaneously when we held the Presidency in the past, particularly, to my knowledge, during the 1980s in the run-up to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

He is very committed to bringing it to a successful resolution and has shown on countless occasions a willingness to take risks for peace.  Any additional reassurance which can be given to those who have not heard it should be given.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply on the prisoners' issue.  As suggested, I will pursue it with the Minister for Justice, but it would be useful if he would use his good offices with the British Prime Minister to, at least, have a target set in terms of what would be possible in regard to loyalist and republican prisoners if there was a lasting ceasefire.  I exclude from this those recently convicted of mass murder, I am talking about those who have a relatively short period of their sentence left to serve.</P>
      <P>In his discussions on Friday last with Mr. Trimble did the Taoiseach manage to convince him of the benefits of involving Senator Mitchell in the process?</P>

The value of meetings of this nature <Col N="567" /> would be reduced if everything said at them was rerun publicly afterwards.  The meeting was very useful.  We covered all the relevant issues in a thorough way in a comparatively short space of time.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that in my earlier rather lengthy reply I did not advert to one aspect of the Deputy's first supplementary, prisoner issues in Britain.  I am very much aware of the concerns in the minds of many Deputies.  I frequently take opportunities, as they arise, to raise them with the British Prime Minister. On all prisoner issues, release policies and so forth, account has to be taken, properly, of the perspective of the victimes of crime who also have concerns. This has to be put in the context of the wider goal, the restoration of peace and the establishment of the absolute paramountcy of politics as a way of resolving problems, thereby removing violence from the equation once and for all.</P>

      <P>When in Dublin on Friday last Mr. Trimble outlined his views on cross Border economic co-operation and the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor.  Was the Taoiseach disappointed with the views expressed and will he confirm that the Government <Col N="568" /> will proceed, like all previous Governments, to promote cross Border co-operation and the Dublin-Belfast corridor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to make the point that, in his public address, Mr. Trimble did not set his face against cross Border co-operation, he made the obvious point that it is one form of co-operation that he wishes to see.  He also wishes to see trade and economic development links in other directions.  That is something we, in this jurisdiction, could hardly object to because we have trade and economic links in other directions.  He is perfectly entitled to hold the views he expressed about job estimates associated with particular proposals and specific suggestions of corridors running in one directions in one part of the Border rather than in other directions in other parts of the Border.  I have no doubt that others, like the Deputy, might disagree with them, but it is welcome that the Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party chose to come to Dublin and debate these issues in an open, forthright and honest way. Matters of this kind benefit from being the subject of open, forthright and honest debate.  The maintenance of any artificial unanimity, as if there were one received view of everything, is not necessarily the way by which we will get the best out of the potential that exists.</P>

      <P>The staffing schedule for national schools for the 1996-97 school year will be issued to all schools this week.  The schedule is unchanged from the 1995-96 schedule.  However, I have indicated that no two teacher school which would have lost a teacher under the schedule will do so.  It is currently <Col N="571" /> estimated that the number of teaching posts available for reallocation as a result of the fall in enrolments in the current year will be 341.</P>
      <P>First, as already announced I have committed myself to implement the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre report on new measures to break the cycle of education disadvantage.  One very substantial recommendation which I will be implementing is for the allocation of additional teaching resources to the most disadvantaged schools in the primary system, both urban and rural. Since the selection of schools has not yet commenced, it is not possible to identify accurately at this stage the number of posts required to implement these initiatives.</P>
      <P>Second, as I announced last week, I am extending the substitute supply panel scheme by an additional 20 teachers from September next.  This scheme, which I initiated in 1993, provides cover for teachers on absences of short duration.</P>

Twenty-five schools will be selected in urban areas where for the first time four classes &mdash; junior infants, senior infants, first class and second class &mdash; will comprise 15 pupils.  That was a major recommendation of the Combat Poverty Agency.  The rural initiative we are putting in place will also involve dealing with small clusters of schools with the necessary resources, financial and otherwise, which will help us not to top up the needs of those in disadvantaged areas but to break the cycle of disadvantage.  I am confident that the radical response by me to the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency for schools that are most disadvantaged will break the cycle of disadvantage.</P>

I invited the partners in education to respond to the Combat Poverty Agency report and I am committed to meeting the recommendations of that report.  The teacher unions are on record on the need for reducing class sizes and special intervention for disadvantaged schools.  The Combat Poverty Agency together with the Education Research Centre in Drumcondra were asked to bring forward proposals that would help us use our resources to break the cycle of disadvantage.

      <Col N="575" /> The major cost attached to introducing RSE relates to the provision of in-service training and support programmes.

    <P>All primary teachers are being provided with one day's inservice training in the current school year.  An additional two days' training will be provided for all primary teachers during the 1996-97 school year.</P>
    <P>In the case of post-primary schools, special seminars for principals and viceprincipals will commence shortly.  In addition, two two-day training sessions will be provided for post-primary teachers who have already received training in the area of pupil self esteem and relationships under the substance abuse prevention programme.</P>
    <P>The training programme for teachers was agreed and recommended by the special implementation group for RSE which I set up in 1995.  This group is representative of the partners in education, including parent, teacher and management representatives.  The group continues to monitor all aspects of the implementation of RSE.  The details of when and how training takes place are agreed in advance with the partners.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister cannot be more transparent and specific in her reply.  It seems extraordinary that the Minister is not in a position to estimate accurately the cost of the in-service programme for the introduction of relationships and sexuality education.  Will the Minister confirm the view conveyed to me by the partners in education that it will be September 1997 before the programme is introduced in primary schools?  Will she further confirm whether children attending primary schools will lose three school days &mdash; one this year and two in the 1996-97 academic year &mdash; as a result of the in-service training provision outlined by the Minister?</P>

      <P>The partners in education have a forum in the Department of Education, namely, the implementation group which I established to ensure that together we can see this very necessary programme in place in the 1996-97 school year.  The days of in-service, are agreed with the partners in education.  I had hoped to have this programme in place earlier than the 1996-97 school year but the partners conveyed to me the wishes of the teachers, particularly those in schools which do not have the programme, to involve themselves in in-career training for this new initiative.  The primary school teachers have already commenced training and early reports suggest that the teachers involved were pleased with the preparation and the commitment to give time to this training to ensure we get it right for the students.  That is a commitment to which all the partners subscribe.</P>

I simply want to know whether children will be at school on the days when the in-service training takes place.  I accept the need for in-service training but I merely want confirmation that children will not be at school on those days and, on that basis, perhaps the Minister might reflect on her policy initiative in terms of the time of school circular.  This makes a mockery of the Minister's original position.</P>

      <P>A major policy objective of the Government is to promote equality of access to higher education, irrespective of social class, age or disability, for all who have the capacity to benefit from it.</P>
      <P>In considering the likely impact of the free fees initiative on demand for third level places it is important to have regard to the following factors: (a) the number of students sitting the leaving certificate examination in 1996 will be more than 6,000 lower than in 1995; (b) the number of applications through the CAO for third level places in 1996 is expected to be more than 3,000 lower than in 1995; (c) pressure on full-time places in publicly funded colleges will also be eased by a number of new initiatives that are due to come into effect in the 1996-97 academic year. These include the extension of maintenance grants to students studying abroad, the provision of tax relief on tuition fees paid for certain full-time courses in approved private colleges and for approved part-time courses in a range of colleges.</P>
      <P>In addition to these initiatives, I have also announced a comprehensive university building programme.  At my request the Government approved in September 1995 a £60 million capital investment programme to provide 6,200 additional places in the period 1996 to 2000.  This programme is unique in that the funding is being provided under a joint initiative which combines the public and private sectors in providing £30 million each for capital developments in the sector for the first time at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am providing £46.5 million under the European Regional Development Fund 1994-99 programme for a range of specifically targeted capital projects to facilitate the universities in developing areas which are important to economic growth and job creation e.g. food business in UCC, pharmacy and microelectronics at TCD and science facilities at <Col N="579" /> DCU and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth are among those already announced.</P>

      <P>I am not sure the Minister has answered my question on the impact the free fees scheme will have in relation to pressure on college places. As the Minister has not answered that question I put it to her again.  I thought the purpose of the scheme was to ensure that more students would have the opportunity to attend university in the forthcoming academic year.  The Minister has talked about future developments in relation to the capital investment programme.  Is she aware that at examination time there is enormous pressure on library places in University College Dublin?  What is the Minister's view on how that immediate concern can be alleviated for those students who are facing examinations?  Is she saying the free fees scheme will not have any impact?</P>

      <P>I thought I had answered the question.  I referred to the pressure on college places.  I also made the point that students who have the capacity to benefit from third level education should do so.  The Deputy may be interested to note that the number of students who applied through the Central Applications Office for the academic year 1995-96 was 62,913 and for the year 1996-97 the number is 56,695.  On the application data from the CAO we are aware of the number of students seeking places.  Towards the end of the year we look back on those applications, those who were successful and the different paths pursued.  Conscious of the numbers of places required and the need to provide capital for buildings, I am satisfied that the free fees initiative will allow students with the capacity to benefit from third level education to do so.  The capital investment I have overseen in buildings for that sector has not been seen in the history of the State.</P>

      <P>This is a transition year.  The students who will be coming out will be older and wiser.  There are three options for people coming out after the leaving certificate &mdash; university, regional technical college and a post leaving certificate course.  More students are remaining in full-time education.  The European Union's investment in building, matched by Exchequer investment, will give us an unprecedented number of places at third level.  I believe that those who can benefit from third level education should be allowed do so.  We are overseeing a building programme which includes the universities, the National College of Art, the colleges and the upgrading of equipment.  The construction work has commenced in UCD and UCC.  The planning of the projects is at an advanced stage for those which are likely to start this year in UL, TCD, St. Patrick's College and Dublin City University.  A visit to any of these colleges is exciting because one can see the cranes in operation and the foundations being dug as the number of places is being increased.  That is evident to anybody who visits those colleges.</P>

What does the Minister intend to do with the proposal for an international swimming hall of fame, a worthwhile proposal which has been with his Department for some time?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, being my predecessor, should know as well as I do the circumstances behind this.  The Deputy is right in saying a feasibility study was commissioned by the Department in November 1994 and has been with my Department for some considerable time.  The terms of reference were that they should design and propose a facility that would be best suited to the Irish situation.  They have brought forward a proposal and have identified Tallaght as the optimum site.  The proposal was for a combination of a 50-meter pool plus a water leisure facility costing, at 1994 standards, about £17 million. The DISC proposal which he refers to <Col N="582" /> was for an Olympic pool combined with a museum, an international swimming hall of fame, the estimated cost of which was £34 million.  That proposal was almost identical to the proposal rejected by the Government of which the Deputy was a member in 1991 which was earmarked for the Custom House site.  The decision will be made in the context of a 50-metre pool costing in the region of £20 million and will be earmarked for elite sportsmen and sportswomen.  It will also have a community facility.  It will have to be decided in the context of applications for other facilities which are with my Department.  As of now there are applications totalling almost £500 million.  There are 1,400 applications with my Department for grants totalling in excess of £48 million. I have to make a choice in the context of my budget.  I had £4 million last year and I am pleased to say I have got a 50 per cent increase this year to £6 million. My priority is to deal with the communities, the grass roots of sport, the people who are keeping sport alive.  We are dealing with organisations at national level which have credible projects and many community-based projects throughout the country.  Certainly we recognise the need to deal with elite sportsmen and sportswomen and the decision will be made in that context.  I have tried to give the background to the position.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the Minister of State.  I know how difficult it is to get funding in that Department. Perhaps the senior Minister in the Department would make a special case with her Cabinet colleagues for the necessary finance for this 50-metre swimming pool.  It is high time a decision was made one way or the other. Has the Minister had any contacts with the sports department in Northern Ireland to see whether it would co-operate in the provision of a 50-metre pool for the 32 counties?  Has he explored the possibility of EU funding?  It should be available.  Could funding be raised through cross-Border co-operation <Col N="583" /> schemes, which were mentioned earlier by the Taoiseach?</P>

On co-operation on capital projects, we are exploring ways to pool our resources on projects in the Border areas and are looking at the Delors and INTERREG packages for that purpose.  We commissioned a group to consider a 50 metre pool.  With regard to Tallaght, which is regarded as the optimum site, I would find it difficult to draw down European funding for a project of that type there.  The policy group set up under the chairmanship of Mr. John Treacy will look not only at facilities but at our approach to the use of facilities and at coaching.  In its report expected in September it will give its view on the optimum use of facilities and resources.  As the Deputy knows, all the national sporting governing bodies and organs have been consulted and I have also asked the group to consult every political party, so this will be a national policy document.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that the proposals which were put to the teachers unions following the negotiations under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> provided for an agreed circular. It was intended that this circular would deal with the proposed arrangements relating to flexibility and change.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the introduction last year of the time in school circular and the hints from the Department and the Minister prior to its publication poisoned the industrial relations atmosphere in education and soured relationships with the teaching community and teachers generally?  There was a clear implication that up to the introduction of the circular teachers were not putting in the required hours &mdash; I know that is how teachers read it, having consulted the unions and teachers.  In that context, does she not feel it appropriate to withdraw the circular?</P>
      <P>An earlier reply, in connection with the introduction of in-service training for various programmes, revealed that the Minister may invoke rule 60 &mdash; which means children will lose school days &mdash; when she sees fit.  I understand the reason that must be done from time to time and I accept the need for flexibility but it is hypocritical of the Minister to take action on certain programmes while simultaneously pressing home the time in school circular.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it was hinted at for a long time &mdash; as far back as the publication of the Green Paper on Education in June 1992, this matter was dealt with in some detail.  The White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> published in April 1995, clearly stated the circular would be issued and was quite specific about its content, referring to 183 days for primary schools and 167 for secondary schools.  As to the Deputy's criticism, the circular did not extend the school week and it was open to schools to devise their own timetables once they met the 28 hour requirement.  The circular specifically stated that they did not pre-empt the outcome of further negotiations under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Issues were raised so the Department put in place a helpline and I believe it showed a flexible response to schools which had difficulties.  The time in school circular defined time in school.</P>

      <P>Whatever the Minister's motivation for introducing the circular, it poisoned the industrial relations atmosphere in education.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If teachers were not in a position to or did not voluntarily give extra hours, the capacity of schools to provide a comprehensive programme would be greatly reduced.  The Minister's concentration on this bureaucratic circular and the 15 extra hours included in the negotiated package has done great harm to the system and was a crucial factor in teachers' rejection of the pay package put before them.  There is need for a radical review of the direction taken by the Minister and her Department on this matter, because this parsimonious approach will mean we <Col N="586" /> will ultimately end up with a system where teachers do no more than count hours and minutes.</P>

      <P>To re-affirm the point, the time in school circular defined time in school, which is 183 days at primary level and 167 days at second level. It also defined the length of the school day and of the half day and addressed the issue of unforeseen closures.  The Department issued the circular, which did not increase the hours in school.  As some difficulties seem to have arisen, more at second level than at primary level, we put in place a help line and showed flexibility and willingness to respond to difficulties.  The question asked whether I intended to withdraw the circular; I have no plans to do so but I will initiate a process of consultation with the various interests, including parents, managers and teachers, to review the operation of the scheme.  The definition for how long schools should be open &mdash; 183 days for primary schools and 167 days for secondary schools &mdash; are included in the circular and the Department showed a flexibility of response to needs, especially in relation to unforeseen closures.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the publication of the circular was foolhardy and did not have the intended result?  Does she agree it is a criticism of the amount of time teachers spend doing extra curricular activities?  She is inferring that they are not spending enough time on such activities even though we are all aware of their voluntary commitment to culture, sport and other social activities outside school hours.  By issuing the circular, the Minister has killed off that commitment and ruined what was an exceptionally well motivated teaching force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the discussions on the Green and White Papers it was considered necessary for the Department of Education to define the school day and year.  For primary schools, the school year consists of 183 <Col N="587" /> days and the school day of no less than five hours and 40 minutes.  Two hours and 50 minutes constitutes a half day and there are special rules for infant and first classes.  This information was circulated to schools.  The difficulty about sending infant classes home early is covered in the circular.  Parents wanted to know the length of a school day.  I did not add one hour or take away one minute, I merely defined it.</P>
      <P>The definition is different for second level schools.  Instruction hours will consist of 28 per week, six per day.  Schools will continue to have discretion about distributing the 28 hours and their year will consist of 167 days.  The length of a half day is defined and time spent on school related activities is also covered in the circular.  At the teachers' annual conference I acknowledged the tremendous work done by teachers.  I also acknowledge that work by attending celebrations organised by teachers. However, the good work of teachers does not mean the Department of Education is outside its remit in defining, for parents, the hours of the school day and year and school flexibility in that regard. Clarity was asked for and was given.  We set up a help line for those with particular difficulties.  I did not pre-empt the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> talks.  This is a defining circular and does not add a day or a minute to the school year.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the difficulty regarding the circular relates more to the negative terms in which it was couched than to its definitions?

      <P>Some people called for the clarification of the circular and the Department outlined that the school day or year was not being extended.  We acknowledged the incorrect inference <Col N="588" /> that was drawn from the circular by setting up a help line and making officials available to answer queries from schools.  The Department acknowledged the negative interpretation of the circular and clarified the matter.</P>

      <P>For something that was meant to be a mere defining mechanism, the circular caused immense damage and disillusionment in the system. The Minister followed through on the circular by introducing a 15 hours requirement in the context of the pay package.  The Department can decide to close schools or facilitate their closure for a variety of reasons.  Schools will close for two extra days next year for the provision of inservice training.  Does the invoking of rule 60, which facilitates the closure of schools for a variety of reasons &mdash; not least the introduction of inservice training &mdash; undermine the definition of the school year and day in the circular?  The Minister is playing games with people.</P>

      <P>The greatest difficulties arose in regard to exceptional closures.  As I stated earlier, I will initiate a process of consultation with the various interests to review the operational aspects, but I do not intend to withdraw the time spent in school. There were 18 months of negotiation on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and <Col N="589" /> Work</i> and to say one followed the other ignores the level and intensity of the negotiation that took place.  I did not pre-empt the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 32, 39, 41, 44, 45, 55 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main priority areas for inservice training are set out in the White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future.</i> Funds for inservice training are allocated in <Col N="592" /> accordance with these priorities. Broadly, the priorities fall into the areas of facilitating the major curricular changes and reforms, advancing the professional development of teachers, training for managements and parents.</P>
    <P>Discussions with the partners in education are nearing completion in regard to producing a fully developed and detailed framework or plan for inservice.  These discussions are taking place in the primary and post primary incareer advisory committees, on which the Partners are represented, and which are chaired by my Department.</P>
    <P>A draft framework documents is currently being considered by the committees.  This document will provide a well structured basis for inservice provision and for the allocation of funds.</P>
    <P>The total amount provided under the Community Support Framework for incareer development at first and second level for the period 1994-99 is £36.5 million at 1995 prices.  This provision is confinanced by the European Commission under the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development to the extent of £27.4 million or 75 per cent.  Expenditure to the end of the financial year 1995 is estimated at £9 million, in respect of which EU funding at the 75 per cent rate is claimed.</P>
    <P>The funding provides for inservice training for teachers and for management training, including parent training. In addition, the running costs of the education centre network are funded under this programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it unacceptable and incompetent that nearly two years after the introduction of the operational programme we still do not have a national strategic plan for the provision of inservice training in our education system, which draws down nearly £27 million of EU money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very satisfied with the way this money has been invested following discussions with the <Col N="593" /> partners in education.  Two committees are involved in this, the primary and post primary incareer advisory committees.  I did not ask them to deal with their job quickly but in-depth.  The partners in education are on these committees chaired by the Department.  I am confident when the framework document now before those committees is published we will have the blueprint for expenditure from now until the end of this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparation is the key to teaching a class and it seems extraordinary we did not have a plan prior to drawing down the funds.  There is widespread concern among the partners about the way this scheme is being administered.  There is a lack of transparency in the allocation of the funding and the treatment of the partners.  The committees the Minister mentioned were described to me as nothing more than smokescreens.  There is considerable unhappiness among the partners about the manner in which this considerable sum of EU money is being spent.  It is extraordinary we do not already have a national plan in place with only three years to go until the end of the programme.  Does the Minister agree there is a need to establish a national council for incareer development?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Deputy has come to the House on behalf of the partners to tell me they are concerned, because I have a committee in place on which those partners are represented.  They have a forum in which to make these remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priorities for the expenditure of this money were clearly spelled out in the White Paper.  The money was to be used for curricular changes; the development of the junior cycle; the radical restructuring of the senior cycle; to enable teachers to assist students with learning difficulties; management programmes for principals, middle management and boards of management; <Col N="594" /> initiatives to provide for the professional development of teachers; programmes for parents; gender equality course modules and programmes in creative and performing arts, and science and technological subjects.  Those are the headings under which we are operating.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also put in place the structural framework.  It made the point we would devolve and decentralise where these decisions are taken as much as possible.  We see the new education boards as having a central role in ensuring the needs of the regions are met.</P>

      <P>The network of education centres is being expanded. They have a key role to play in planning the spending and investment of this money.  The incareer development unit has been set up in the Department since the publication of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Where partners are invited to participate on committees in the Department, I would prefer to hear from them that they consider it a smokescreen, rather than from the Deputy on their behalf.</P>

      <P>This is considered a very good and positive investment by those who speak to me on behalf of the partners.  If there is concern that we are not investing this money wisely, there is already a forum within the Department of Education for the primary and post-primary sectors and I would greatly welcome their criticisms.  The framework document for this massive investment is before the committees and those <Col N="595" /> remarks should be made at those committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a massive amount of money.  We are two years down the road and we do not have a national policy for it.  Does the Minister think it smacks of <i>ad hoc</i> management to tell us that a national plan is being put together two years later?  We have to submit a national plan to spend money in every other sphere to see where we will get value for money.  We talk about change in industry and technology but the same is true of the education sector.  It is a bit much for the Minister to say these groups will come together and we will probably have a plan sometime this year.</P>

      <P>We all realise now that the Department of Education must be on auto pilot because nobody seems to know about or want to be responsible for anything.  How much money has been allocated to the primary and secondary sectors and to the parents?  What guidelines are being used by the Department at the moment for the allocation of that funding?  Is anyone responsible for assessing the expenditure of this money and is the Minister happy that it is being properly spent?  Further, what contingency plans are there for the development of incareer work over the next few years, given that the operational programme will have ended by 1999?  Such plans should have been copper-fastened two years ago before funding was made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme priorities are very well set out and the structural framework is in place.  The Deputy asked a specific question on which I do not have the information. The information I have is in relation to a question about the strategy being adopted.  I can say that £9 million will be spent in 1995.  The partners involved with us in the investment of this funding, the teaching profession, managers and parents are more than satisfied that at last they have access to funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern about what will happen when we complete this investment.  For that reason it is important to have access to the network of education centres that we previously referred to as the teacher centres.  The centres generate some funding for themselves but also now involve themselves more and more in in-career <Col N="598" /> investment by the Department.  The allocation towards the running costs of the centres was £.5 million of the £9 million.  I will come back to the Deputy with specific monetary answers to the questions about the different sectors. There is investment in primary and second level education, for teachers, managerial programmes and parents. They are the headings under which this investment is being made by a special unit in the Department which was set up to ensure that we are getting the best return.

      <P>The Minister has outlined four major areas at which inservice funding will be targeted.  There is an absence of any allocation of money to the administrative wing of the Department.  Perhaps the committee will give consideration to the allocation of some of this funding to the introduction of new systems in the Department of Education and the training of officials and people in the Department of Education to ensure a more modernised delivery of the education programme, particularly in terms of the operation and organisation of the examination system. Today we again witnessed an appalling mistake in the context of engineering work being found near a bog in County Roscommon.  That has undermined the integrity of the entire examination system.</P>

      <P>Decisions have already been taken as part of the report. As the Deputy will be aware, I have already announced the provision of 6,200 additional places in the university sector over the next five years.  These places will involve a capital investment of £60 million to be provided by equal contributions of public and private sector funding.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have begun consultations with the authorities in the regional technical colleges regarding the change of title for these colleges, as recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>I regard these initiatives as the first steps in the implementation of the recommendations of the steering committee report.  The decision in regard to the university sector is a major step forward in the implementation of the report.</P>

      <P>When can we expect a decision on the reform and reorganisation of the regional technical college sector and the change of name which was signalled some time ago?  The longer it is delayed the longer the regional technical colleges will remain in limbo.  Deputy Deasy's question regarding Waterford is very pertinent to the report.  Many people in Waterford and throughout the country are awaiting the implementation of the recommendations in the report, not least in the north-west area of Dublin city which has been identified as the area of greatest need in terms of the provision of third level education, particularly regional technical college education.  The lowest participation rate in third level education is in that area.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would say when she intends to take decisions on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already taken decisions.  At the regional technical colleges' annual conference, which I attended, I suggested to them that there should be a new title for the regional technical colleges and asked them to respond to that recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair to the regional technical college sector to say it is in limbo.  I refer the Deputy to the White Paper position regarding the future of the regional technical colleges which are very much part and parcel of third level options. Interestingly enough, more students went to the regional technical college sector than to the university sector last year.  I spelt out in the White Paper what I see as twin missions for the regional technical college and university sectors. <Col N="602" /> I indicated that the regional technical college sector will come under the remit of the Higher Education Authority so that we will be able to plan for the future.  The committee report that was made available to me was one for which I asked so that as decisions were taken and we increased investment in the third level sector, the necessary information and projections on size, demographic trends would be available to me.</P>
    <P>While I have been in a position to respond positively to some of the recommendations, many of them have significant financial implications and they will only be considered with my Cabinet colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a specific recommendation in one of the working committee's reports that Waterford regional technical college be upgraded. There was no reference to the upgrading of any other regional technical college in a similar manner.  Does the Minister intend to stick by this recommendation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a recommendation in the report that Waterford regional technical college should expand to 5,000 places and that there should be a major focus on growth at degree level.  This has financial implications and must be taken in the context of the overall plan that the Government will put in place for the development of this sector.  I am satisfied that we have sufficient knowledge and information to allow us take a planned approach to the expansion of this exciting sector.</P>

      <P>The Minister's ship is ashore while all other boats have put out to sea.  On the question of third level places and the demands of industry, the Minister has been made aware by the IDA that, over the past seven years, there has been a lack of graduates in certain technological areas.  Nothing has been done about improving this until this year.

      <P>On the matter of Dáil reform, the Taoiseach informed me almost a year ago he would examine the possibility of allowing the Opposition to table parliamentary questions in the months of July and September when committees of the House sit, but said later he could not facilitate us last summer because the notice was too short. Having raised the issue again in October last, today I received proposals for discussion between the Whips to examine the possibility of allowing such questions in the forthcoming summer.  Since I understand it is envisaged that committees will meet in the months of July and September, what is the Taoiseach's response to my reasonable proposal that written questions be tabled to Ministers on the days such committees meet.  Failure to allow such a facility would make a mockery of the committee system and render it unworkable for the Opposition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): Ba chóir go mbeadh córas sláinte éifeachtúl againn i gcónaí, mar bíonn daoine tinne ag brath air go mór; ag brath ar leapacha bheith ar fáil sna hospidéil, gur féidir leo coinne a dhéanamh le dochtúirí.  Mar sin, cosnaíonn sé seo a lán airgid chun an tseirbhís seo a dhéanamh <Col N="789" /> éifeachtúil.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil an córas atá againne amhlaidh agus go gcuirfidh na hathruithe seo feabhas air.</P>
      <P>The three main objectives of this Bill are to improve financial accountability and expenditure control procedures in health boards; to clarify the respective roles of the members of health boards and their chief executive officer and to begin the process of removing the Department of Health from detailed involvement in operational matters.  We are spending £2.4 billion each year on health services.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides that health boards must have regard to certain matters in carrying out their functions.  They relate to securing the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources, cooperating and co-ordinating their activities with other health boards, local authorities and public bodies and giving due consideration to the policies and objectives of Ministers and the Government. Given that this section must be included in the Bill, is it the case that those matters were not considered in the past?</P>
      <P>A total of £2.4 billion will be spent on health, of which £1.3 billion will be allocated to health boards.  I was concerned that in the past consideration was not devoted to the efficient use of resources and to ensuring adequate co-operation and co-ordination among health boards, but I hope this section enshrines in the Bill what was the practice in the past.  The allocation of £1.3 billion, for health boards works out at almost £4 million a day.  That is a considerable amount of money and there must be co-operation across all sections of health provision, whether among hospitals or health boards, to ensure it is spent efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of how many improvements are made, an unusual approach to dealing with hospital waiting lists, particularly for patients awaiting heart operations, appears to have been adopted.  Cardiac surgery is traumatic for the patients and their families. Patients on a waiting list for a hip operation can survive even though they may have pain, but the life of patients <Col N="790" /> awaiting heart surgery may be in danger.</P>
    <P>I know of a person who was involved in an accident which necessitated surgery while he was on a waiting list for a heart operation.  That person had to have the heart operation first.  People on a waiting list for surgery find it difficult to understand why there is such a delay. Most heart operations are performed on an emergency basis.  People collapse, are rushed to hospital and have a heart operation, thereby displacing the next person on the waiting list.  I feel sorry for a person next on a waiting list whose operation is cancelled because of an emergency.  We are all aware of people who have had emergency surgery and some of us have had personal experience of it.  We are grateful that an excellent surgeon is available to perform emergency heart surgery when required. The skills of the surgeons who save so many lives and give people lucky enough to have a heart operation a better form of life are appreciated.</P>
    <P>Health boards, which spend almost £4 million a day, play an important role in administering health services and it is vital that they put the best arrangements possible in place.  I question whether in the past hospitals were located with the interests of the patients in mind.  I am mindful of the south east region.  I do not understand how Waterford hospital, situated on the coast, is regarded as central to serve the south eastern coastal region.  Only seagulls with broken wings can fly in from its west side and they will not visit the hospital.  Hospitals should be located centrally.</P>
    <P>One of my county council colleagues pointed out yesterday that a patient from Hacketstown on the Wicklow border must travel to Waterford to attend a hospital and the people of Waterford would be nearer to Fishguard than Hacketstown.  There is also the added problem of the need to travel a road that is not in the best state of repair.  In this regard the condition of the bridge in Waterford could also be improved.  The future location of hospitals should be given serious consideration.  I appreciate <Col N="791" /> that a decision made in the past will not be changed but dragging people from one end of a region to the other does not represent good planning and some planning in the past was bad.</P>
    <P>There should be a certain amount of decentralisation of health services. Patients from north Carlow should be able to avail of health services in Carlow rather than being transported, even while recovering from an operation, to the other end of the health board region.  It would be better if medical specialists saw 20 patients at a venue, such as the district hospital in Carlow, than to ask those 20 patients to travel to Waterford to attend the hospital.  I accept the South Eastern Health Board is reviewing the position and I hope they will make such a recommendation.</P>
    <P>Health boards administer many areas of health service.  I have particular interest in facilities for the mentally handicapped.  I am thankful that I do not have any personal experience of mental handicap, but I am involved in a group, Delta, which operates a training centre for adults with a mental handicap.  The health boards do great work in this area and I do not wish to criticise the South Eastern Health Board in this regard as it has given financial assistance to our group but I find it difficult to accept that it is considered sufficient for health boards to provide 80 per cent of the cost involved.  People with a mental handicap need special care.  School, youth and adult facilities for the mentally handicapped should receive 100 per cent funding.  I appreciate that talking in terms of facilities receiving 100 per cent funding seems extreme, but in the case of ordinary schools the parish and parishioners provide all the necessary funds.  Parents of children who have a mental handicap, and their friends, are worn out fund raising to provide necessary facilities.  Instead of attending talks designed to assist parents help their children with a mental handicap, they must attend fund raising meetings organising the selling of tickets and so on.  The parents and friends of people with a mental <Col N="792" /> handicap should be relieved of the awful burden of non-stop fund raising.</P>
    <P>When an extension was added to the training centre in Carlow a few years ago, the parents and friends of the children collected £36,000 which involved a great deal of hard work.  Those parents and friends also look after St. Laserian's Special School and Teach Sonais, a house which provides overnight accommodation.  There are many demands on the funds raised by parents.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for them and their friends to encourage people to take up official positions and they cannot be blamed for that.  It is difficult in any walk of life to raise funds, but parents with a child with a mental handicap have much more to worry about.  They should not have to attend fund raising meetings, run cabarets, sponsored walks or sell tickets they should be able to attend meetings designed to assist them to help their children.</P>
    <P>The Department should consider transferring funds to meet the needs of such children.  People with a mental handicap deserve the best facilities available and the provision of them should not mean any trouble for the parents.  I include elderly people who represent an increasing proportion of the population. We must provide first class facilities for those people who kept the State going, worked for miserable wages in many cases, did not have the benefit of electricity when they were growing up and suffered many hardships.  The least we can do is provide proper facilities for them in their old age.  Many hospitals provide excellent services for the elderly.  This represents a major change from the time people talked about the &ldquo;county home&rdquo; which in many cases represented the final straw.  This is still the case in many instances: one can change the name of a hospital and modernise it, yet some people still think of it as the county home.  In the past some old buildings were not up to standard but in fairness the nursing profession provided excellent care for the elderly. Health boards must continue to ensure <Col N="793" /> that beds are available for elderly people and those suffering from, for example, Alzheimer's disease.</P>
    <P>Section 15 requires a health board to publish an annual report on the performance of its functions during the preceding year.  Deputy O'Malley said that in some cases reports had not been published for three or four years and this amendment will ensure that action is taken as soon as possible to deal with a problem which arose in the previous year.  Section 20 deals with nursing homes.  Most nursing homes provide excellent facilities but we always hear about those which are not up to standard.  Such homes should not be tolerated and section 20 will ensure that people cannot cash in, so to speak, on the fact that elderly people have to be admitted to nursing homes.  No mercy should be shown to nursing homes which do not meet the required standard.  In saying that, I admit that most nursing homes provide excellent facilities.  While people must have adequate financial means to be admitted to private nursing homes at least they ensure that people can end their days in peace.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 21 which provides that the Minister may extend the term of office of An Bord Altranais pending the enactment of a Bill to revise the Nurses Act, 1985.  I hope An Bord Altranais will prosper and that the present dispute with the nurses will be resolved.  It is of little use referring to the vocation of nurses when they believe they deserve more money.  The Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the demands by providing £40 million and I hope a solution can be found to this difficult problem.  We do not want nurses to go on strike as it would not be good for patients or the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which I hope will improve the workings of health boards and their members who are being given responsibility for the allocation of funding.  I was a member of a health board for a few years before I became a Deputy and I know how easy it is to <Col N="794" /> criticise the chief executive officer for not doing certain things.  However, it is not easy to cut back on the funding for one section and give it to another.  I hope that the members of health boards will spend these vast sums of money wisely so that we have a better health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I also welcome the Bill which represents the first review of the legislation governing health boards since their establishment in 1970.  This important legislation deals with the structure and procedures for delivering the health services to the public and its aims and objectives are timely and laudable.  It proposes to strengthen financial accountability and the expenditure control mechanisms for the various boards, to define more clearly the prospective roles of board members and chief executive officers and to give greater authority and responsibility to the board for everyday operational matters.</P>
      <P>While the Minister will correctly continue to have overall responsibility and be accountable to the Oireachtas for all health services, the Department of Health will not be involved in the detailed management of individual services within a board's remit.  For example, a board will be free to dispose of land or to grant-aid voluntary bodies in its area within broad guidelines laid down by the Minister and the Department without having to seek approval of the Minister in each case.  This is a desirable development.  Deputy Browne referred to section 20 and I agree with the sentiments expressed by him on this matter.  I am pleased that this section makes it an offence to run a nursing home which is not registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions should strengthen the structure of health boards and make them more efficient in delivering health services to the public.  However, the Bill does not address many of the defects in the services.  They need to be addressed urgently and I trust the Minister will <Col N="795" /> give consideration to some of them in the context of the legislation.  I am not sure if they were dealt with in the strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and as a member of the Western Health Board I wish to refer to some of them.</P>
    <P>The first defect which affects all boards is the long waiting list for various procedures, the second is the closure of wards which has resulted in overcrowding in hospitals and the third is the early discharge of patients.  The waiting lists in all health board areas are too long and a patient who has to wait too long for a service is effectively being denied it.  There should be a more reasonable relationship between the length of time a public health patient has to wait for a particular service and the time within which it can be provided for a private patient.  Some years ago the Minister of the day allocated extra funding to reduce waiting lists and the Minister has continued this practice.  While this has led to some improvement there were still 28,000 people on the waiting lists last year.</P>
    <P>Cutbacks and stringent budgetary control, necessary and desirable as they may be from a financial point of view, have had the effect during the years of having wards closed with resultant overcrowding of available space and overstreching of personnel and services within hospitals.  We have all heard stories of patients left for hours on trolleys before being attended to properly and convalescing patients discharged into far from satisfactory home conditions. There is a need for much more funding for such services as home helps.</P>
    <P>In this context I appeal to the Minister to consult his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, with a view to easing the conditions for the carer's allowance.  There should be no means test for this allowance.  Taking on the responsibility for caring for an elderly or sick person is a serious and onerous task and, if the allowance has to be graded, the grading should be based on <Col N="796" /> the degree of care required by the patient.  A patient cared for at home for as long a period as possible means a financial saving to the Department and the State.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take some initiative to develop and strengthen the community care programme in every health board area.  I am familiar with the programme in the Western Health Board area which has suffered most because of the cutbacks and budgetary pruning over the years.  There is a level of demand and standard of service below which one cannot go in hospital programmes.  People who are acutely ill have to be admitted to hospital and given treatment appropriate to their illness, but there is no such yardstick in the area of community care, apart from ensuring that people have access to a doctor and chemist.</P>
    <P>For this reason the community care programme has had to bear the brunt of financial pruning with the result that many of the services intended to be developed have not been provided or provided on a hit and miss basis. Strengthening the programme makes economic as well as health sense.  A properly developed community care programme would mean fewer admissions to hospitals, shorter stays, better after care in the community and less chance of suffering a relapse which would necessitate rehospitalisation at further cost to the Department and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to what appears to be a serious unevenness in the services provided by health boards.  This manifests itself in many ways.  For instance, the length of time one has to wait for various procedures and the level of service provided, such as home helps and public health nurses, vary from board to board.  Even medical cards, so essential to the less well off, appear to be more easily attainable in some board areas than in others.  This is a vital matter, especially when one considers that a medical card is not alone a <Col N="797" /> passport to free medical care and hospitalisation, but to school transport and other fringe benefits.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to ensure that the range and standard of services are identical in all board areas.  This can only be done by ensuring that there is an equitable distribution of departmental funding taking into account the unique and special circumstances pertaining in each board area.  This does not appear to have been done in the case of the Western Health Board. Little account, if any, has been taken of the fact that it caters for the highest percentage of dependent persons in any health board area, that people have to travel long distances to avail of and provide services and that a large number of people have to travel outside the area, principally to Dublin, to avail of services not available within the board's hospitals.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the current nurses' dispute and wish the Minister well in his efforts to resolve it.  It will be tragic if these dedicated people have to resort to industrial action.  They are in the front line in delivering vital services to patients in their most vulnerable physical and mental state.  Very often, the quality of these services is determined by the diligence, care and dedication of the nurses on duty and is seen to be so by the patients themselves. How often have we heard patients on their discharge from hospital after a serious illness comment on the quality of care provided by and attention received from this dedicated band of health workers who have given sterling service during the years and are entitled to be appropriately rewarded without having to take to the streets?</P>
    <P>As a member of the Western Health Board, I wish to refer briefly to the Kelly Fitzgerald case mentioned in this debate and widely in the media and, in particular, the decision of the board not to publish the report of the inquiry which the board itself set up although satisfied at the time that its services had done all that was possible in the case. The report of the inquiry was discussed <Col N="798" /> by the board on 11 March.  In my opinion the facts supported its earlier view that its services had done all that was possible, but as well as the facts there were many opinions, based on hearsay and with the benefit of hindsight.</P>
    <P>The board sought legal opinion which strongly advised against publication.  It was not reluctant to publish the report, but there was a strong view that it was neither fair nor fairly compiled.  There was no list of people who gave evidence and no details of their evidence.  The staff of the board who had co-operated fully and willingly in the inquiry were not given any opportunity to see a transcript of the evidence they had given. The report did not give enough weight to the circumstances under which they were operating at the time without adequate resources or take into account the limitations of the law under which they did not have the right of entry to the family home, to insist on access to the children or require that they undergo particular treatment.  All this and more led the board to conclude that the report should not be published, although it did decide that the recommendations should be published.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the report there has been a disgraceful scape-goating of the board and its staff although any objective reading of the facts and the report and, in particular, the response of the board would lead one to conclude that the board acted honourably and with accountability in this case.  The bringing into effect of the 1991 Child Care Act and the large increase in staff and other resources since then gives some idea of the circumstances under which the board was operating at the time.  I hope, now that the media and other commentators have had their pound of flesh, we can get on with the job of providing better support services for families in trouble, due to environmental factors or other inadequancies, and making the task easier for child care agencies such as the Western Health Board.  I welcome the Bill and urge the Minister to rectify the <Col N="799" /> deficiencies in the services which the boards have to deliver and which I, in this brief contribution, have tried to highlight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a significant, important and, as Deputy Morley said, non-contentious Bill which will have a major influence on the quality of our health services in the years ahead.  It sets down new planning management and accountability provisions which will change the way the health boards conduct their business.  It presents a challenge to all in the health sector to work within a planning framework linked to specific resources and clear objectives. It brings accountability much more to the fore in planning and reporting terms.  It is about achieving efficiency.</P>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board by any standards, is one of the most efficient boards in the country.  It has not always been rewarded for that. When budgets were tight in the late 1980s and funding was allocated on the basis of previous costings, that board was penalised for its efficiencies whereas inefficient boards which ran up big overdrafts had them wiped out.</P>
      <P>The basic principle governing the conduct of health affairs of health policy and overall control of expenditure but should not be involved in the detailed management of health services.  Greater responsibility should be devolved to health boards and other executive agencies.  The role of all key parties, including the members of boards and their management, must be clearly identified and greater autonomy must be balanced by increased accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount provided in the Health Estimate for this year is £2.4 billion.  In the last five years the level of non-capital expenditure on health increased by 7 per cent in real terms.  This Bill provides for improved financial accountability for these vast sums of money and expenditure control procedures in health boards.  It clarifies the respective roles of members of health boards and chief executive officers and begins the process of removing the Department of <Col N="800" /> Health from detailed involvement in operational matters.</P>
    <P>The first objective is to strengthen the financial accountability arrangements in health boards.  The Bill provides that the boards will operate in an environment of service planning, with strict financial control and accountability.  It reflects the Government's strategic management initiative, with emphasis on making the public service more responsive, accountable and open.  The public expects a more open and accountable system of health administration.  Health boards will be required to prepare and adopt an annual report on the performance of their functions in the preceding year.  That will help the taxpayers to judge whether they are getting the best possible value for the money they contribute to the public finances.  Services will have to be even more responsive to people's needs and more information will have to be made available on the actions and decisions taken on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Another objective of the Bill is to clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of members of health boards and chief executive officers.  One of the key problems identified by the Commission on Health Funding in the present structure is that it confuses political and executive functions, to the detriment of both.  The exercise we are involved in here could be called subsidiarity, a decentralisation of authority, devolving from central control decisions that are best taken at local level where they are implemented.  The Bill is very important in that respect.</P>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board has the reputation, and deservedly so, of being a very efficient board.  I hope in allocating the budget in future years due account will be taken of the special circumstances in that area, such as the ageing population which is scattered over a huge geographic area where some places are inaccessible, with many people qualifying for medical cards, not because it is easier to get medical cards in that area <Col N="801" /> but because people's circumstances dictate it.  In regard to means testing for medical cards and other facilities, that there is a variety of means tests creates a major problem.  The Minister, together with the other Ministers involved, particularly the Minister for Social Welfare, should seek to have a common means test to cover all areas.  Because of the importance of the medical card to many people it is essential that the criteria are wholly appropriate.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill leads to the provision of a greater number of regional services, thereby bringing to an end the practice where patients have to travel to Dublin from all parts of the country for services.  I accept because of the nature of the service we are talking about, there will always be centres of excellence such as in the child care area and other specialities, and patients will have to attend those centres for treatment.  I have no objection to that, but with improved hospitals and consultants living in regional health board areas there is no reason many of the services should not be provided in the regions, putting an end to the mass movement of people to major centres, which has been a feature of our health services in the past.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether authority for our health service is vested in the Minister or in regional areas, one of the main objectives must be to get rid of waiting lists, a very unfavourable feature of our health services down the years.  All of us have heard examples of people who have to wait four, five or six years for hip replacement operations.  That is not acceptable, particularly for elderly people.  I would like to see waiting lists eliminated.  I am aware that will not happen, but it should be the objective of a good and caring health service.  I hope that giving greater authority to health boards will spur them on to eliminate waiting lists.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Morley mentioned, there should be greater concentration on home care.  The carer's allowance should be made more readily available by providing sufficient finances and removing the outrageous restrictions <Col N="802" /> that apply to it.  The net result would be a saving of money.  I welcome this Bill which deals with a service we all hope will be delivered in the most efficient manner possible.  As a result of its passage we will see major advances in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important Bill which, in the Minister's words, aims to modernise the planning and management systems in the health boards.  It sets down new planning, management and accountability provisions which will change the way health boards conduct their business.  The local government audit services was responsible for the audited accounts of health boards for years up to and including 1993 and the Comptroller and Auditor General was responsible thereafter.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the audit of the 1994 accounts of health sector bodies and health boards points out that up to 1993 local government audited reports were relied upon for assurance that moneys had been properly used and controlled by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues were raised by the local government auditor's reports down the years which were common to four or more of the boards.  They include: (a) the formal sanction of the Minister for Health under section 31 of the Health Act, 1970, had not been received in respect of net expenditure by boards in excess of approved allocations for the four years 1990-93; (b) there are a number of unresolved disputes between boards and local authorities involving material sums due on foot of services rendered; (c) the effectiveness of the systems in operation for the collection of hospital charges leaves much to be desired and (d) the eight health boards, as part of a value for money initiative, formed a national purchasing committee which undertook to invite and examine tenders for the supply of certain products and to obtain and agree the best possible price in <Col N="803" /> relation to a decision taken by the committee.</P>
    <P>A High Court action was taken against the board by an aggrieved supplier for an alleged breach of European Union directives and the Competition Act, 1991.  Following lengthy negotiations the action was settled out of court for a sum of £225,000 including costs.  The cost of this settlement, with the board's own legal costs of £133,000, was divided between the eight health boards.  This was a very costly exercise.</P>
    <P>Other issues that came to light were that financial reviews in relation to disabled person's maintenance allowance and other allowances were grossly in arrears with many reviews of cases dating back to 1994 not yet carried out. Staff shortages were the explanation for the huge backlog.  The failure to carry out reviews in a timely and efficient manner increases the risk to allowances, benefits and medical cards enjoyed by claimants who no longer qualify for the relevant scheme.  The possible consequential loss to all concerned cannot be quantified.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that one of the first objects of the Bill is to strengthen the financial accountability and arrangements in health boards.  The Government is determined that the health boards will in future operate for the betterment of service planning and in alliance with strict financial control and accountability.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General with regard to fixed assets of health boards.  The Department of Health accounting standards stipulate that all land, buildings, vehicles and equipment should be accounted for in the balance sheets of a health board.  The boards are directed to use the insurance value of buildings as the basis for determination of the amount to be included in the balance sheet taking into account factors such as age and condition.  Only two of the eight health boards have included values for all fixed assets in their <Col N="804" /> accounts while one health board has not accounted for its fixed assets.</P>
    <P>The valuations used for buildings in the accounts have been computed in all cases.  For instance, one board has shown a value of £41 million for buildings where the insurance valuation amounted to £235 million at 31 December 1994.  Another board has shown the valuation of buildings as being half the insurance value for accounts purposes.  Moreover, the valuation for vehicles and equipment has not been properly stated in the accounts of six of the eight health boards.  Further action is needed to ensure that all fixed assets are correctly recorded in the accounts of the boards.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General also referred to stock control in hospitals.  Stock control is an important element of the management of hospitals.  In the course of audits of health boards and other hospitals it was noted that there was a general absence of proper control of pharmacy stocks. Apart from the financial implications of such poor control, the potential misuse of misappropriated medicines or drugs must also be taken into account.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn the attention of the relevant authorities to this area of stock control weakness.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill is to clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of the members of health boards and their chief executive officers.  One of the key problems identified by the commission on health funding in relation to the present structure is that it confuses political and executive functions to the detriment of both.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate our health care personnel.  They are excellently trained and their tremendous dedication, in many cases working under difficult circumstances, has made a major contribution to maintaining a very high standard in our hospitals.  One can have a certain pride and satisfaction regarding the overall quality of our health services but a number of warning signs indicate that there is no room for <Col N="805" /> complacency in terms of the service. One must be concerned at the high cost of newly developed drugs for the treatment of conditions such as cancer, chronic illness and infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>The current population projection indicates that over the next 20 years the number of elderly people in our society is likely to increase substantially.  This trend towards increased life expectancy will, however, place a further major strain on our health care services, particularly within the acute hospital section.</P>
    <P>The more efficient our health boards become, the more they will benefit our health care system.  The time is now opportune to re-establish the local health committees on a county basis, although it is stated in the Bill that will not be acceptable.  They were of tremendous benefit and it is agreed that the health boards structure helps to devolve power from the centre to the regions in terms of determining the organisation of health care throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general trend towards increased accountability which is the basic purpose of the Bill.  However, in an area of such great importance we must take urgent steps to improve the scope and detail of information and research available on the performance of our health services.  For example, data from the hospital patient inquiry system has tremendous potential to provide anyone involved in health care policy with detailed information on the performance of acute care.  To date, however, this source of information does not seem to be fully exploited.  I expect there is a similar position in relation to many other elements of our health care system.</P>
    <P>At a time when a wide range of factors are combining to create ever increasing demands for resources in the health care sector we must take every possible step to ensure that audit and quality control become an accepted part of the delivery of health care services.  We simply do not have an option in this regard if we wish to maintain and improve the quality of our health care system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> Ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of our health care services is a matter of concern to every family.  Sooner or later almost every individual has to receive medical care either from the family doctor or from hospital based services.  In general we have much to be proud of in our medical services.  As public representatives we frequently receive complaints about undue delay in providing services such as hip replacements and various other surgical procedures.  There is no doubt that such backlogs are the cause of much distress and pain for people dependent on the State for medical treatment.  It is most important that renewed efforts are made to eliminate such problems in our health care services.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern is the weekly hospital clinic and I refer in particular to Tralee General Hospital.  Each week medical card holders are notified to attend clinics at approximately 9 a.m. but some of them are still there at 6 o'clock in the evening.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about these waiting lists.  Patient appointments should be staggered to avoid undue waiting.  That would be most appreciated.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions of the Bill, section 2 requires that health boards, in carrying out their functions, should secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources and co-ordinate their activities with other health boards, local authorities and public bodies.  Sections 3 and 4 clarify the respective roles of the members of health boards and their chief executive officers.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for certain specified functions to be known as reserve functions to be carried out directly by the members of the health boards.  These include the adoption, supervision and amendment of service plans, the appointment and removal of the chief executive officer, the purchase and disposal of land, the borrowing of money and decisions to discontinue the powers of maintenance of any premises.  The chief executive officer will assist the <Col N="807" /> board, as appropriate, in these matters but the board will have the final say in the performance of these functions.</P>
    <P>Any function not reserved to the members will be, subject to some minor exceptions, a function of the chief executive officer and the staff of the board.  The chief executive officer will be advised to provide the board with any information it might require in relation to such functions but will otherwise be autonomous in performing them.  The effect of these changes will be to bring the management system in the health boards into line with the arrangements that have worked well in the local government system for many years.  I welcome the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996.  The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the arrangements which govern the financial accountability of health boards.  That is extremely important because, in the not too distant past, certain health boards simply refused to remain within their budgets which resulted in the creation of huge deficits.  I acknowledge that the previous Government utilised the amnesty moneys to rectify that problem to some extent but we must guard against it in the future and this Bill has a major role to play in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill spells out a number of things we must take seriously.  Health boards have a responsibility to work within their budgets, to ensure proper accountability and good value for money.  There is also a need for the chief executive and staff to ensure they co-operate with the health board and work within the structures.  One must not forget the Minister and successive Ministers have a responsibility here.  There is no point in Ministers deciding that certain functions should be carried out by the health boards and the chief executive if sufficient moneys are not provided.  In this context, I question some Members of the Opposition when they call for extra services to be provided and on the other <Col N="808" /> hand call for major cuts in taxation.  We need a clear indication from parties, especially the Progressive Democrats, as to whether they agree with this Bill and support it.  We need to ensure that whatever Minister is in office provides long-term funding to the health services.  This Bill will have implications for the boards and the chief executives if proper funding is not available to carry out the work they are asked to do.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is £2.4 billion in the health budget means that the Minister and the Government as a whole must ensure there is proper accountability and that proper use is made of that money.  As the Minister stated, the health boards get £1.34 million so there is a need for control, management and openness and accountability in regard to those funds.  A member of the Opposition said the other night that Ministers should get out of their offices and visit the health boards and see where the real problems are.  The Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, made their presence felt in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  They met and worked with the health boards as far as possible.  They were received courteously by all members of the health board.  The North-Eastern Health Board works closely with certain committee groups &mdash; I am sure Deputy Leonard will refer to this later &mdash; and is making good use of the funds available.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the chief executive Mr. Donal O'Shea and his deputy, Mr. McLoughlin, who are trying to work with all the different groups involved in an effort to ensure people are aware of what is happening and what is being done.  Deputy McCormack said that the Eastern Health Board got £5 million from the tax amnesty to bail it out.  The Eastern Health Board had lived within its budget and did not have to be bailed out by anybody.  There were many things which should have been done and could have been done if it had been as reckless as some of the other boards.  In fairness the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, recognised that and gave £5 million towards many different projects which <Col N="809" /> have proved beneficial.  Both he and the present Minister, Deputy Noonan, have provided funding for much needed improvements in the whole region, especially in Cavan-Monaghan.  It is vital for the well-being of the people that the service is provided as near as possible to their homes.</P>
    <P>To that end a health care centre in St. Davnet's complex, in Monaghan town, is nearing completion, a tremendous step forward.  A training and community care centre will be established in the town centre which will bring the services into the main street.  Carrickmacross will have a new hostel for the handicapped in the not too distant future.  In Ballybay the credit union and the health board applied for planning permission to restructure the whole service in that area.  In St. Mary's Hospital, Castle-blayney, some wards are being closed down.  Funds have been made available, a unit for older patients suffering from Alzheimer's is now open and the day centre is almost finished.  These are the types of facilities which health boards, with the aid of funds from the Minister, can provide.</P>
    <P>Much discussion has taken place down through the years about the difficulties at Monaghan General Hospital. Only the other day I was approached once again by scaremongers who tried to suggest the hospital is in danger.  I pay tribute to the board and the chief executive for bringing the Cavan-Monaghan hospital under the one hospital group. Seven new consultants have been appointed there and more will be made available if and when they are needed. A new dialysis unit and a new scan unit, with the help of sizeable funds raised by community groups, has been provided in Cavan and a new scope unit in Monaghan.  All these facilities make and bring health care nearer the homes of the people.  As Deputy Nealon said in his contribution, regional treatment is essential.  The new dental units which have been provided are important.  The need to introduce new treatment centres is one matter but the provision of funds to run them is very important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> For example, in regard to dental treatment, numerous people come to our clinics seeking new dentures and ordinary dental treatment but have no idea when they will get them.  We now have a clear statement from the Minister that the matter is being rectified and that treatment will be available.  Following this statement I ask the Minister to ensure that staff is available in each health board area.  As soon as announcements are made concerning these facilities the people want to see them in operation.</P>
    <P>The North-Eastern Health Board has a good record in its care of the handicapped, as set out in our programme for Government.  Extra funds have been made available for this purpose.  We are fortunate in the Cavan-Monaghan region that we have a special unit in Cootehill for schooling and care of the handicapped.  These special people need our care.  We also have a unit in St. Davnet's complex.  More social housing will have to be provided, especially in County Monaghan, to provide more accommodation for the elderly.  We have a poor record in that area with the exception of one house for the handicapped outside Monaghan at Tierneal and Camphill community.  I look forward to the involvement of the Department of the Environment together with the Department of Health in this issue.</P>
    <P>Care of the aged has been mentioned. This is an extremely worrying matter for health boards and for the Minister for Health and the Department of Finance. With an ageing population we need more and better accommodation not only in homes but at home, if possible. The longer we can keep people in their own homes, with proper care, the better.</P>
    <P>When I first came into this House little or no home help care was available &mdash;the carers' allowance existed in name only.  There are still problems with it but successive Ministers have made a genuine effort to improve the position. Families can now earn £150 without having it taken into account.  This is a major improvement but there is still a <Col N="811" /> great deal of red tape to be removed. The best place to care for the elderly is in their homes.  It is better to pay a carer to give a hand in the home, rather than pay him or her the dole.  We must consider more ingenious ways to tackle this matter, so that those who are prepared to look after their elderly relatives at home get all the help they can.</P>
    <P>When patients go into hospitals for emergency treatment they have to fill forms and answer questions.  It would help health boards if the new charge scheme for the Dublin area was extended.  Form filling and red tape takes up the precious time of nurses and clerical staff.  The Cavan-Monaghan area has one of the best nursing staffs anywhere.  We should do anything we can do to take the pressure off health services whether through negotiations or reducing red tape to save time.</P>
    <P>Health care is of major importance to everyone.  It crosses national and county borders and this is where the benefit of regional treatment is seen.  If we can prevent families having to travel to Dublin or further afield we are doing a good job.  The health boards and the Minister should provide funds to ensure treatment is available at regional level. I am glad the current Minister has been involved in discussions and negotiations with our colleagues across the Border to ensure their health services can be utilised by people in the Border region&mdash; they will be more accessible if peace continues.  This will make the best treatment available and and keep the waiting lists as short as possible for those requiring hip operations, heart surgery, etc.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it can be used to strengthen the health boards. Under the legislation responsibility lies not just with the boards and their chief executives but with the Minister and the Department to provide the funding to maintain the health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill which deals with efficiency and value for money but like most of the legislation and pronouncements we deal with, it is <Col N="812" /> full of aspirations.  There is a continuing increase in demand on the health services under practically every heading. We speak time and again about living within inflation but it is not happening in the health boards&mdash;the demand is astronomical.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a health board for almost as long as I have been in this House, which is nearly a quarter of a century.  The three main objectives of the Bill are first, to improve the financial accountability and expenditure procedures in the health boards; second to clarify the respective roles of members of the health boards and their chief executive officers; and third, to begin the process of removing the Department of Health from detailed involvement in operational matters.  I welcome all those aspirations.  On clarifying functions, members can contribute greatly to the process along with their chief executive officers and they will take up this challenge.</P>
      <P>Health boards are doing good work.  I am a member of the North-Eastern Health Board and we remain quite far behind.  The councils provided health services until the Health Act, 1970 but the Department has seemingly continued funding on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, rather than making a close examination of requirements.  It did not take into account areas which needed more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My health board has devoted much time and discussion in the last few years to advanced planning, with the theme being value for money.  There has been an amazing change in facilities in the geriatric, orthopaedic and child care areas and in general hospitals, etc. Undoubtedly there have been improvements, many of which are due to drawing up the plans in advance.  Treatment within the regions was mentioned and we have laid great emphasis on that. The time has come for health boards to build up as many specialities as possible within their regions.  They will not be able to provide heart operations overnight; however, the NEHB is providing dialysis and ENT in conjunction with <Col N="813" /> Omagh hospital &mdash; they treat our outpatients and consultants come to us. This is to be welcomed from a cross-Border perspective and it has been effective.  Before this dialysis patients had to leave for Dublin at 4 a.m. while other patients were picked up along the way.  For the 12 months this has been in operation it has worked well and the demand is far in excess of what we are capable of providing, not alone in the four counties which from the health board area but also for patients from adjoining counties who wish to benefit from these specialities.</P>
    <P>The first funding for the waiting list initiatives was provided by my party.  In the orthopaedic field it has been a terrific success &mdash; previously we were continually in touch with the orthopaedic hospital in Navan about people who were in severe pain.  The waiting time for operations is not as long now. However, there is still great difficulty with cataract operations.  It is annoying to meet people in their seventies or younger, who may be retired or cannot work, who are unable to watch television or read a newspaper.  Many people have to wait years for cataract operations.  I hope the Department addresses this problem.  As I said earlier, arrangements were made for patients from the Cavan-Monaghan area to go to Omagh Hospital for ear, nose and throat services but, unfortunately, the list for cataract operations in the North is as long, if not longer, than here.</P>
    <P>Funding under the peace and reconciliation initiative should be used to the best advantage.  There is no better bridge building exercise than the development of cross-Border services.  I hope the proposals for joint day care facilities materialise and that people can avail of some services in the North and others in the South.  This would greatly reduce transport costs and bring people, North and South, closer together.  When day care facilities were initiated, people were not inclined to travel to avail of them but that is no longer the case. They are now eager to avail of those worthwhile services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> The system should be geared towards caring for our elderly in the home, not in institutions.  A person is paid a mere £1.40 an hour for providing a home help service.  While health boards have endeavoured to provide training for home helps, the meagre wages are not an incentive to anyone to avail of it.</P>
    <P>County enterprise boards could provide funding for private nursing homes. Two applications for £50,000 were submitted to my local board for building nursing homes.  There is a need for nursing homes in the area and approximately 24 jobs would be created.  Many people from the area are being cared for in nursing homes in, for example, Benburb, Dungannon and Fivemiletown in Northern Ireland.  However, even though the county enterprise board would like to provide the required funding, restrictions on resources do not allow it.  The board's funding was cut to £90,000 per quarter. We are examining the possibility of providing subvention per job to enable the projects to proceed.</P>
    <P>There are also long waiting lists of A, B and C categories for orthodontic treatment, but most health boards are able to take people from categories A and B only.  It is not a pointless exercise to place people in a category from which there is no hope of them being called?  While additional funding has been provided for orthodontic services, it is not adequate and that is evident from the number of representations I receive from people on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about funding per head of population for health boards. Replies to parliamentary questions indicate that the North-Eastern Health Board lags far behind other boards in terms of services.  We do not have as many speech or occupational therapists. A reply to a recent parliamentary question indicated that we receive £330 per head of population compared with £403 for the Southern Health Board, £434 for the South Eastern Health Board, £542 for the North-Western Health Board and £451 for the Midland Health Board. The figure of £290 for the Eastern <Col N="815" /> Health Board is difficult to accept because in 1995 it was £702 per head of population and in 1991 it was £453. There appears to be some discrepancy there.  While in many cases the Department has acceded to demands, resources should be allocated equitably. When politicians query this matter people wonder if they are getting their fair share.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing demand for accident and emergency services in all health board regions at a time when the number of joint GP services is increasing.  A reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last March indicated that the demand for accident and emergency services in the six major hospitals in Dublin has increased by 39 per cent. GPs are developing closer links with hospitals by improving facilities and equipment in their practices, some of which are funded.  Therefore, it is hard to understand this increased use of accident and emergency services, which at weekends can cause serious problems for paramedical and medical staff in some hospitals on top of their normal workload.  Some hospitals in our health board area do not provide those services but leave it to the GPs to do so.  When a charge of £6 was imposed, which was later increased to £12, it did not make much difference because people continued to use the accident and emergency services when they could have attended their GPs.</P>
    <P>Another area which I have continuously pursued is the cost of generic drugs, on which positive action was recently taken.  The health services in the US issue directives to hospitals to use generic drugs, provided they are of proper quality.  Massive savings could be made by doing so.  Admittedly, over the last seven or eight years more of an effort has been made to get value for money from drugs, but it does not happen on a large scale.  Health boards and hospitals should use their combined purchasing power in this area.  The health authorities in the North should <Col N="816" /> also examine how they could gain by this.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem in our health board area with the recruitment of speech therapists.  The Minister stated in reply to a recent parliamentary question that it is a matter for the Higher Education Authority.  He said his Department, in association with Trinity College, Dublin, and the Higher Education Authority, would take steps to remedy the situation by arranging for six extra training places.  This is a matter of urgency which I would like to see attended to.</P>
    <P>There has been a continuous increase in the number of asthma sufferers. Asthma is not a specified disease but public representatives are contacted by many parents whose children suffer from it, complaining that inhalers are very expensive.  The causes and treatment of asthma should be investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a member of a health board but, in common with all public representatives, I am very interested in monitoring how the health board system delivers an appropriate level of service to the people I represent.  The Minister stated that the Department of Health's budget for 1996 is £2.4 billion, a huge sum which, not too many years ago, would have run the entire Government services.  A huge proportion of that £2.4 billion is expended by the health boards and it is important to ensure consumers and taxpayers get the best possible value for money.  Value for money is slightly different in terms of health services from other services delivered by the State because a person's health is of primary importance.  However, while it is probably impossible to tag a precise value to a health service, we must ensure taxpayers' money is spent wisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, unfortunately, stuck with the health board structure.  If a Minister was designing a health system from scratch now we would not end up with this system.  Perhaps the system we inherited suited the Ireland of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was changing <Col N="817" /> dramatically and quickly.  People felt services had to be modernised and rationalised and the county health system was considered unsuitable.  There were difficulties with the county health system but, perhaps, we threw out the baby with the bath water.  There were many advantages to having services determined locally and delivered by people living within the community who knew the problems there.  While removing that level of local service had administrative advantages, it also had disadvantages.  There are arguments in favour of both local and national management but, in retrospect, the regional structure has not worked particularly well. However, we must make the best use of the system we have.</P>
    <P>The first difficulty is the lack of discretion and power at management level in local hospitals.  That has been a big disadvantage.  It is not simply improper but also damaging that every minor management decision in the county hospital network, and some of the regional hospitals, has to be passed to the Department of Health.  Presumably, the passage of this Bill will change that to some extent, which would be welcome.  There has also been a total lack of discretion at regional health board level.  I hope this Bill will also make changes in that regard and allow a greater degree of local and regional discretion.  The greatest weakness has been the lack of control of local expenditure and decision making.  I hope the passage of the Bill will also improve that position.  I welcome the debate and the Bill, which will give greater powers to the health board members, define their role and that of the executive and improve decision making.</P>
    <P>This Bill is in line with policies which are being implemented in other Departments, whereby there is a slow but sure devolution of some degree of power to local offices.  This is the answer of the Department of Health to that devolution.  In so far as it goes, I welcome it, but greater devolution of powers locally is necessary.</P>
    <P>The structure of our health boards <Col N="818" /> leaves much to be desired.  Health board members and representatives of the various medical organisations play equally important roles.  Within the past couple of weeks we had an example of a scare story to the effect that there was not any money left to pay for nursing home subventions.  The story was incorrect, but such stories are often generated by the more media conscious members of the board, invariably Oireachtas members.  I have mentioned before that while the dual mandate has served us well over the years, it warrants reflection as to its usefulness beyond the 1990s.  We have a weird and wonderful electoral system which puts a premium on being on the ground looking into the potholes etc. However, the country is not well served by that system, and health boards are not entirely well served by the fact that quite a number of their members have other jobs to do and do not always have the time and energy to do both jobs properly.  However, this is the system we have, and we must make the most of it.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the role and powers of members.  It defines the members' power to appoint the chief executive and take control of the overall service plan of the health board.  In that respect it is important that members should take their responsibilities seriously because appointing a chief executive and taking control of and directing the service plan of a health board is an extremely responsible job that requires the full co-operation of all the members of the board.</P>
    <P>The distinction between the role of the chief executive and that of the health board members is also defined. Health board chief executives, as a rule, are not as newsworthy as chief executives of semi-State bodies or county managers, etc.  However, in the light of the budget of health boards, one must recognise that the person who holds the post of chief executive in a health board has a major task.  His job is as important as that of a chief executive of a semi-State or major private company.  It is appropriate, therefore, that the <Col N="819" /> responsibilities and duties of the chief executive should be laid down here.</P>
    <P>In 1989 there was an unfortunate difference of opinion between the Southern Health Board and the Department of Health which resulted in officials from the Department being transported by helicopter to &ldquo;seek a head&rdquo; from the Southern Health Board.  Now that the lines of communication are clearer and the roles of the members and chief executive of the health board more clearly defined, we should not have similar difficulties in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Section 2, namely, the section which requires health boards to co-operate fully with local authorities and other public bodies, has always been unofficially in place.  There has been co-operation between the Department of Social Welfare and the Southern Health Board <i>vis-á-vis</i> the return of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to the Department of Social Welfare from the health board. Although funding for such items as rent allowance and supplementary welfare allowance is being passed on to health boards from other Government Departments, it would make more sense and remove another layer of bureaucracy if such items were transferred from within the health board system and streamlined into the local Department of Social Welfare office.  The section also calls for appropriate consultation with local authorities and other public bodies.  I expect under this section there will also be a requirement that health boards have full dialogue with the private hospitals and people involved in private medicine in their catchment area to eliminate duplication of services where possible and ensure that each agency, public or private, is best placed to get on with the job of providing the best possible service to the people in its community.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with multi-annual budgeting.  We have had difficulty enough with annual budgeting in health boards and other areas of public life. We should not, therefore, rush headlong <Col N="820" /> into multi-annual budgeting.  However, there are aspects of health care and health policy which are not always possible to determine and react to within the narrow period of 12 months.  In so far as discretion is now given for multi-annual budgeting, I welcome it, but I hope it will be used with caution and where appropriate.  I look forward to suggestions from health boards.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate where he envisages multi-annual budgeting would be effective.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the dissolution of regional health boards and local health committees in the interest of rationalisation and modernisation. However, health boards are regional and quite large from the point of view of the local community, and local health committees, which were in place from the 1970s until the mid 1980s, played an effective and practical role in their catchment areas.  As a member of a county council, I was appointed a member of a health advisory committee when first elected in 1985, and I found it was possible for members, through the committee system, to put forward worthwhile proposals and suggestions to the health board.  When the health committees were unofficially abolished in the late 1980s the members continued to meet without being paid expenses and in the absence of appropriate health board officials.  However, for a period of over 12 months the members met once a month and continued with their system of meetings because they considered it a valuable vehicle for discussing local health issues and for transmitting problems and suggestions back to the health boards.  It is disappointing that we must now dissolve the local health committees because it was a system that worked reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Section 17 mentions health promotion programmes.  While Irish people are perhaps the best in the world to talk about how ill they are and the best cures available, they are very bad at health promotion and disease prevention. What proportion &mdash; is it less than 1 per cent &mdash; of the health budget of £2.4 <Col N="821" /> billion is spent on health promotion? What level of co-operation exists between the Departments of Health and Education in this area?  Health promotion in the form of newspaper, radio and television advertisements is fine in so far as it can reach communities, but such promotion must begin within the schools.  We need the maximum possible resources at national school level.  The only health promotion I ever see in the educational system is in respect of dental protection.  However, given increasing worries and dangers, we must invest much greater resources in this area.  The Department of Education has a big role to play in this respect.  How are we linking up with the Department to ensure value for money and a successful campaign?</P>
    <P>With regard to section 20, regulations will prevent the creation of unofficial nursing homes.  However, I am not so much concerned with the number of such homes but with the fact that we do not have a sufficient number of official, regulated homes.  It is an issue which we have repeatedly debated.  While the Department of Health has a care of the elderly programme, we cannot claim to be unaware of the fact that, over the next ten or 15 years, we will have a major crisis resulting from our ageing population profile.</P>
    <P>We must prepare now for this problem.  The provision of sufficient nursing home beds must be high on the agenda. While I welcome the measure taken to weed out unofficial nursing homes, I am concerned that we are not yet doing enough to put in place a sufficient number of official homes and beds to deal with the growing problem of an ageing population.  I hope that we will make progress on this over the next number of years.  While it is not our problem today it will be everybody's problem tomorrow.  Now is the time to prepare for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the arrangements governing the financial accountability of health boards and to clarify <Col N="822" /> the respective roles of the members of the health boards and their chief executive officers.  The Bill is welcome because it gives us an opportunity to participate in discussions on accountability and the undertakings made in the health strategy document, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, the purpose of which is to improve the organisational and management arrangements of the health boards.</P>
      <P>The Bill also begins the process of removing the Department of Health from detailed involvement in the operational matters of each board area.  It also dispenses with the need for the health boards to obtain ministerial consent to the purchase and disposal of land and the making of section 65 grants to voluntary bodies.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Eastern Health Board, I wish to be informed on matters of accountability and financial implications.  I have endeavoured, through every avenue available to me, to ascertain the position regarding the proposals for the reorganisation of the Eastern Health Board.  Regrettably, on every occasion I have approached this matter I have been unable to receive satisfactory answers.  In his last response to me on 1 May, the Minister advised that he intends to submit proposals on the future administration of health services in the Eastern Health Board area to Government.  He went on to indicate that the submission will address the financial implications of the proposals and that he intends to make a further statement when the Government has made a decision on this matter.</P>
      <P>I understand there are serious problems regarding the proposals.  If this is the case, a Member should be informed of the situation.  If they prevent the proposals on the reorganisation from being implemented, the sooner decisions are taken the better for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge there is a problem in the Eastern Health Board area with regard to the statutory authority, the EHB, and the other authorities assisting in the provision of needed and worthwhile services.  The ideal solution is to <Col N="823" /> bring all under the one umbrella. However, I am concerned about the cost of the proposals on the new eastern regional authority.  I understand that this is the bone of contention in the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Eastern Health Board for a number of years, I am supportive of the management structures in place and of the provision and delivery of services to people within the catchment area.  The voluntary organisations and other bodies involved in the provision of services could be brought into a system within the Eastern Health Board's existing structure, where they would be satisfied to work.  This would not have the cost implications of the proposals that I understand are before the Government.  I would welcome the Minister or the Minister of State indicating at what stage the proposals are and the hurdles before them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the chief executive officer and management team of the Eastern Health Board on the enhancement of their delivery of ever widening daily services.  I pay tribute to their financial controller, Mr. Martin Gallagher, whose exemplary accountability and achievements by way of his saving plans in recent years have been well recognised.  They ensured continued satisfactory delivery of services while achieving huge savings in the various avenues open to him through purchasing power, group buying and exerting leverage on financial institutions to obtain reduced interest rates and charges.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the principle and objectives of this Bill, I envisage some problems in their implementation. When replying I should be greatful if the Minister would respond to my questions.  With regard to the accident and emergency services within the Dublin area, which have presented many recurrent problems, I have always advocated tackling such problems head on.  Whenever I raised this problem with the Minister he has been inclined to quote precedents, to the effect that this is not a <Col N="824" /> problem confined to Ireland; it is a feature which has developed in other countries and has continued during former Ministers' terms of office.  That is of no assistance to people within the Dublin area who must avail of accident and emergency services.  I assure the Minister and anybody else under a false impression, that people in the Dublin region do not like to go to hospital, to queue for anything between 48 and 72 hours, or to be placed on a stretcher bed.  People are despondent about and dissatisfied with the attention devoted to resolving the problem.  The relevant figures for the year 1995 and the waiting periods over the first ten weeks of this year show an escalation in demand for accident and egmergency services and in the relevant waiting periods.</P>
    <P>Shortly after my tabling a parliamentary question, the Minister launched a campaign advocating greater recourse to general practitioners than to accident and emergency departments, resulting in some slight reduction in attendances at hospitals.  The argument has been advanced for several years that people resort to accident and emergency services more in winter months whenever there is an influenza epidemic or an increase in respiratory complaints.  I understand that last year a number of representatives of hospitals in the Dublin area &mdash; under the chairmanship of the general hospitals programme manager &mdash; met on a number of occasions to determine how best to address these recurrent problems.  My understanding from those involved with the problem is that there is a lack of beds, a need for greater numbers of long-stay, short-stay, acute and day beds in addition to greater post-hospital facilities.  What action has the Minister taken since those problems were brought to his attention?  What detailed examination of their rectification and its associated costings has been undertaken?</P>
    <P>I tabled Parliamentary Question, No. 69, to the Minister on 1 May 1996 as follows:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Health the <Col N="825" /> recent studies or surveys, if any, that have been carried out to evaluate the need for a Dublin city centre general hospital, particularly in view of the large number of people working in the city and the number of dwelling units occupied in the city.</P>
    <P>I asked him to bear in mind the greatly increased occupancy of and numbers of dwelling units in the city centre and the number of hospital closures with resultant loss of beds.  I take it the Minister accepts there have been a number of hospital closures and many more occupants of city centre dwelling units.  I was frustrated by the last sentence of the Minister's reply which read:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am satisfied that people who reside in the city centre and those who work there are catered for to the extent that there is no need to build another general hospital in the centre of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister review that opinion and accept the need for another city centre hospital?  Too many hospitals have been closed.  The Meath Hospital is about to be closed.  Perhaps an existing structure could be developed as a general hospital.</P>
    <P>I have also requested the Minister's opinion on the closure of hospital wards and beds on account of insufficient funding &mdash; which is what this Bill is all about, accountability and funding. Needy people are denied access to beds for that reason.  Perhaps the Minister would furnish me with information on the number of wards and beds involved.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about long-stay hospital accommodation.  I tabled another parliamentary question to the Minister to ascertain what progress, if any, had been made to address the need for post-hospital facilities and community care of the elderly, particularly those living alone.  I am not satisfied that any substantial progress has been made on this matter.  The Minister tends to establish committees, appoint chairpersons to establish facts and figures and then do nothing more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> I hope the Minister will communicate with me on the questions I have raised. There is an army of workers in social services yet we do not harness that good will by addressing the level of pay to home helps and, more importantly, by providing care in the home for people who otherwise have to live in institutions.  The carer's allowance is in the region of £69.50.  If memory serves me correctly subventions are in the region of £70, £90 and £120, we are buying beds in private nursing homes costing anything up to £200 to £300 and in the Alzheimer's unit on the north side of the city a bed costs £420.  I am baffled as to why the Departments of Health and Social Welfare cannot create a package that would encourage a spouse, family or friend who is prepared to give a level of care to somebody who requires it on a constant basis in the atmosphere of a family home.  However, we opt to buy a bed in a private institution for £420, to pay subventions at the levels I referred to or pay approximately £250 for a bed in a private nursing home instead of bringing the carer's allowance into line and tapping the potential that exists.  I look forward to the challenge when some day I may be in the Minister's seat and if something has not been done about it before then I certainly will do it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate how he will address accountability for the demandled free schemes?  His Department failed in recent years to take responsibility for cutting schemes it had introduced, without being prepared to say so publicly.  It put the squeeze on the financial controllers in the health boards by not giving them overruns on demandled schemes.  Is there not a conflict when we talk about an overrun on a demandled scheme?  However, that is the language of the Department of Health and I would like the Minister to comment.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about indicative drug targets.  To save money, doctors are being encouraged by the Department of Health to prescribe cost effective drugs and there is a pay back for those who prescribe them.  Do we realise the huge <Col N="827" /> sums of money drug companies invest in research and development?  Would we even have an antibiotic if they did not carry out this level of research?  The revenue from drug companies is of benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill chief executive officers will be appointed to a health board for a fixed term similar to secretaries of Government Departments. This is a welcome move, however the Minister has not specified the period of appointment.  People employed for a fixed term perform better and I would welcome the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that meaningful talks on the nurses' dispute are resumed urgently to deal with the three issues highlighted by the nursing unions: first, the inadequate increase in pay for ward sisters; second, the proposed reduction in the starting pay of staff nurses; and third, the question of early retirement.</P>
    <P>Finally, if drug addicts are to be treated in the community by the GP, the way to do so, as GPs have indicated, is by allowing them to use the health centres.  I would welcome a note from the Minister on the progress that has been made in making health centres available to GPs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate and I am pleased with the broad welcome the Bill has received.  This important Bill aims to modernise the management system in the health boards and sets down new financial accountability provisions which will change the way health boards conduct their business.  It introduces a planning framework which is linked to specific targets and resources.  In short, the Bill requires health boards to carry our their tasks in a context which <Col N="828" /> emphasises planning, strategic management and accountability.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to all the contributions and there is broad agreement on all sides on the need for the type of change envisaged in the Bill.  A number of Deputies questioned the need for fundamental changes in the administration of the health services, including the possible return to a county based system of administration.  The Government has no plan to move from the system of regional health boards which, by and large, has served us well during the past 25 years.  Given the scale and complexity of the health services in the greater Dublin region, there is a general acceptance of the need for some restructuring of the Eastern Health Board.  In response to Deputy Callely, I reiterate that my colleague, the Minister for Health, intends to submit proposals to Government on the future administration of the health services in the Eastern Health Board area.  He will make a further statement when the Government has taken decisions in this matter.</P>
    <P>In response to the criticisms of the substantial increase in the expenditure on health services, let me make the following points.  Recent Governments have identified health as a priority area for investment.  Additional funds have been provided for child care services, services for the mentally handicapped and nursing homes for the elderly.  The Government has funded additional residential places, additional respite care places and increased the capability of the health services to respond to those most in need.  Value for money initiatives have contributed £20 million towards these developments.</P>
    <P>The health service is labour intensive providing services 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Year on year increases in the Health Estimates include provision for items such as national pay agreements, compensation for general inflation and increases in the various cash allowances paid.  These increases account for almost half the overall <Col N="829" /> increase, a further 20 per cent approximately is accounted for by the community drugs scheme legislative obligations and European Union commitments.</P>
    <P>Once again, I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  This is very important legislation, I look forward to an interesting Committee Stage and to the amendments which will emerge from the Opposition.  Obviously, if the amendments contribute to making the legislation more effective, we will look on them in a positive fashion.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In Kerry we have two successful vocational education committees, County Kerry Vocational Education Committee and Tralee vocational education committee.  My contribution will be parochial and I will deal first with the <Col N="831" /> response of County Kerry Vocational Education Committee to the Government's White Paper on Education.</P>
    <P>In the course of an extensive debate on the White Paper on the future of Irish education the committee evaluated the Government's proposal in the context of its area of responsibility and agreed that the keynote of its response was the rejection of regional education boards as suitable vehicles for educational reform.  The committee considered the proposed boards to be incapable of discharging the functions assigned to them and of meeting the Government's expressed commitment to the democratic management of education at local level.  Their establishment would effectively eradicate the capacity of vocational education committees to continue with the important work they were doing without any guarantee of an adequate replacement.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion members expressed their concern that an opportunity to creat democratic, effective and accountable local education bodies of an integrated nature was being missed while vocational education committees were losing their capacity to function.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a regional board in Cork to cater for the Kerry area was seen as a continuation of regional policies which had worked to the detriment of County Kerry and other areas and was contrary to the majority view of the county that County Kerry needed its own institutions and its own direct avenues to national sources of current and capital funding.  The county area was adverted to as the maximum desirable area for any local education board and the continuation or creation of other entities of a lesser area would be a matter for special consideration.</P>
    <P>County Kerry vocational education committee members were further concerned at the uncertainty created over the long delay in publishing the Green Paper on Education and the absence of a definite timetable for action on the White Paper proposals.  A democratic <Col N="832" /> local body was suggested to manage education and the experience in County Kerry with the vocational education committee was such that members were confident that it was the proper area for future organisation.  It was felt a county based local education management body with a range of functions and powers, outlined for regional authorities in the White Paper, would form a natural progression in the integration of the work of vocational education committees with that currently organised by other authorities.</P>
    <P>The Kerry committee, which has experience of providing education for adults, young travellers, those with literacy problems and in meeting community education needs, was likely to be devalued in the context of a regional organisation and the role of the committee was destined to be reduced to that of a powerless sub-committee.  There was a strong commitment to a county based educational authority which would build on the foundation laid by the vocational education committees and the powers and remit of such a body would be the primary concern rather than any consideration related to title.</P>
    <P>The view that the IVEA should have defended the <i>status quo</i> for the sake of its schools and to show its absolute opposition to local education boards was strongly expressed.  The committees' schools had and continued to deliver important education and social services in a climate where the needs of the underprivileged had been especially acknowledged, but the future of the schools was uncertain.  It was felt that amalgamations would be the order of the day and committees would no longer be in a position to support their schools effectively.  It was also felt that the structural reform of Irish education should not be perceived or dealt with as a political issue.</P>
    <P>Regarding Tralee vocational education committee, since the publication of the 1992 Green Paper, Education for a Changing World, that body has reviewed its policy on education structures on a number of occasions.  This <Col N="833" /> process has been undertaken in conjunction with its representative organisation, the IVEA, and with its neighbouring vocational education committees in Cork county and city and in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>Since 1902 the urban authority in Tralee has had a representative body reviewing planning and resources in education development in the municipal area.  The existence of such an authority has been a major boost to the town and has been directly responsible for the development of foreign institutions and services there.</P>

      <P>A number of pillars are set out in the White Paper such as sensitivity to needs of local and regional communities, value of further involvement of local and regional communities, a desire to release the Department of Education from detailed delivery of services and the need for co-ordination to satisfy the needs of schools.</P>
      <P>The proposals to introduce regional education boards is a direct contradiction of the rationale laid down by the Minister in the White Paper.  Given that it is proposed that one board will represent Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Wexford, what local community will that board represent?  More than 100 local representatives will compete for four or five board places.  Is it the Minister's intention to disregard the opinions of local public representatives?</P>
      <P>How will teacher representations be decided?  Will they be decided on a county or school basis or in some other way?  Such boards will be distant, out of touch, irrelevant and a waste of taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister justify a two province, five-county board?  A board for the counties of Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan will represent more than 70,000 students and 100,000 parents. Who will represent the Mount Hanover three teacher school near Duleek in County Meath or the Cartown four teacher school near Termonfeckin in County Louth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Scotland there are 12 regional <Col N="834" /> boards and legislation was introduced recently to increase that to 32 boards.  In Ireland we are going against the tide and destroying a long established and proven board structure, the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>In Britain reform legislation is introduced year after year to reduce the role of the local education authorities, yet we are prepared to accept the worst elements of foreign boards, their large size and remoteness, high costs and ineffectiveness.</P>
    <P>The proposal to regionalise Irish education has been discussed for many years.  Its main proponents are academics and senior officials in the Department of Education and their motives are praiseworthy.  They wished to find a mechanism to bring together the primary and various post-primary strands of Irish education.  The Minister, in proposing ten regional boards, has accepted the advice and theories of the Irish educational hierarchy to copy systems of other countries.</P>
    <P>In America, Canada, Britain and elsewhere in Europe educational board structures exist to administer primary, post-primary and adult education systems.  The structure of these boards provide that a chief education officer, or chief executive officer in Canada, a superintendent in America and a director of education in Britain administer the schools of the board area on behalf of the board.  In America there are 15,000 boards with the majority of them administering areas of student population ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 students.  This does not compare with our policy of unwisely seeking to adopt the most unsatisfactory and unworkable elements of educational boards.  We are opting for large board areas without a record of educational co-operation, harmony of need or a distinct request for board representation on such a scale. We should build on our strengths and not weaken our structures by copying those adopted in neighbouring countries.</P>

      <P>The Government's decision to establish education boards on the basis set out in the White Paper represents an enlightened and forward looking approach which will command the support of all those who have a genuine interest in the development of our education system.  Members will not need to be reminded of the value which people attach to their education system. Ever since the foundation of the State, the quality of our education services has been one of our key successes and strengths.</P>
      <P>However, we cannot afford to be complacent.  As we approach the 21st century our children are emerging into a world which bears little resemblance to that experienced by previous generations.  They will face new demands with which they must be able to cope and will be presented with new opportunities which they must be able to grasp.  We have an obligation to ensure that they are equipped to face this new world with confidence in their ability to succeed.  Nowhere is this obligation more critical than in the need to ensure that they get the quality of education which they require and deserve.</P>
      <P>The Government's White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>, is intended to put our education system on a modern and dynamic footing.  Its objective is to meet the needs of the next millennium and ensure that every student will have a fulfilling educational experience at every stage in a lifetime of learning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve these aims we need structures which are capable of responding to the rapidly changing demands of today's society.  We need a system which empowers local and regional communities to play an active part in the development of our education services. <Col N="836" /> We also need to release the Department of Education from its involvement in the detailed delivery of the service so that it can revert to its proper role of developing and monitoring the education system at national level.</P>
    <P>The regional education boards will play a key role in facilitating these developments.  By being based in the regions they are intended to serve they will be close to and alert to local needs. They will be in a position to be more responsive to local needs and will bring greater transparency to a system which, for too long, has been highly centralised and remote.  These important developments will be welcomed by all who have the interests of our education system at heart.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Education and others have outlined to the House the major practical benefits which will accrue to our education system through the establishment of the regional education boards and the implementation of the other elements of the White Paper and I do not propose to cover this ground again.  However, as Minister of State with special responsibility for children with special educational needs, I have a particular interest in ensuring that these measures are successful.  I say this because for the first time in the history of the State the Government in its White Paper has shown the necessary commitment and developed the necessary strategies to ensure that children with special needs will finally be given the recognition and support which they deserve.  Under the White Paper each school will be responsible for presenting a school plan which will be required to set out its policy on student assessment.  This policy will provide for the identification of students with special needs and set out the school's proposals for dealing with these needs, in co-operation with the parents of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>Details of each student with a disability will be entered in a national data base, to facilitate the planning of provision for all students with disabilities. <Col N="837" /> Each education board will have a statutory responsibility for all students in its region who have been entered on the national data base.  The White Paper envisages a continuum of provision which will allow special needs children access to a full range of special support services in their areas.  Services will range from special schools, through special classes, to full integration, if necessary on a supported basis.  A further key element is that children will be facilitated in moving between the various support services as their particular needs evolve.</P>
    <P>A number of ordinary primary schools will be designated by the education boards as centres where students with particular disabilities may be educated.  The existing special schools will fulfil an expanded role in dealing with a variety of disabilities and operating as regional resource centres.  Each student with a special need will be assigned to the nearest appropriate special school in the region, regardless of whether he or she attends that school.  If it is decided that attendance at an ordinary school would be most appropriate, the student and his or her parents will still have access to the back-up supports available in the special school.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also provides for a comprehensive scheme of assessment which will facilitate the early identification and ongoing monitoring of special needs children.  This will allow for timely identification of difficulties and appropriate intervention.  I have no doubt that all these developments will be warmly welcomed by the parents of special needs children.  The fact that those parents will also be given a voice in the development of local services in their area will be a further encouragement.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt also that the regional education board structure is essential to the successful implementation of the multifaceted response which is now being put in place in the special needs area.  The case for devolving responsibility for education services to regional <Col N="838" /> education boards is nowhere more convincing than in relation to special needs children.</P>
    <P>By their very nature, these children require a system which is sympathetic and flexible and, above all, capable of responding to needs which are changing and evolving.  It is no longer a tenable proposition to expect the current centralised system to display these attributes.  Our education service has grown in size and complexity to a point where the current centralised arrangements have simply outlived their time and effectiveness.  It is no longer acceptable that some of the most vulnerable children in society should be deprived of an adequate education service because our capacity to respond is being strangled in a great centralised bureaucracy.  We owe it to our children to act now.</P>
    <P>The School Attendance Act, 1926, and subsequent amendments to it oblige parents to ensure that children attend school from age six up to age 15 unless there is a reasonable excuse, for example, through illness, or where the child is receiving suitable elementary education, other than by attending a national or other suitable school.  One of my first actions on my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Education, was to set up the Task Force on Truancy.  At the same time the process of reviewing the existing legislation in this area is currently under way in the Department.  Taking account of these findings, the education boards will be given statutory powers and responsibilities in regard to monitoring and enforcement of school attendance.</P>
    <P>The regional education boards, catering for smaller areas and being more alert to the needs of children in those areas, will be in a position to provide a much more efficient and responsive service to children with special needs.  My experience as Minister of State at the Departments of Education, Health and Justice has also convinced me that by devolving responsibility to the regions we will achieve a much greater degree of co-ordination between the various agencies involved in providing support <Col N="839" /> services at local level.  I also see major opportunities for a much more efficient and effective use of resources under the education board structure.  It seems infinitely preferable to have decisions regarding resource deployment in a particular area made by people based in that area and familiar with its educational needs.  The present situation where decisions of this nature are made at national level is no longer tenable.  I have no doubt that the education boards will ensure a more responsive approach for the future.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to endorse the very valuable role played by the vocational education committees in the evolution of our education system since their foundation.  While I appreciate some of the concerns being expressed at the proposed rationalisation of the vocational education committee sector, I am convinced that the product of this exercise will be a leaner and more efficient structure which is better equipped to cater for today's needs.</P>
    <P>The education boards will have the task of planning and supporting education services in the regions but I have no doubt that the vocational education committees will continue to be central to a successful delivery of the service. Indeed, I am convinced that the experience and expertise which is encompassed in the vocational education committee sector will continue to prove an invaluable asset to our education system in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister and the Opposition agree on one thing at least, that Dáil Éireann &ldquo;recognises generously the very positive role played by vocational education committees in the evolution and development of Irish education&rdquo;.  I compliment the vocational education committees which, since 1930, have done much for education.  I hope the present generation of members and teachers will not take umbrage when I say that 30 to 40 years ago vocational teachers did some marvellous work, especially in rural areas where, at night classes, farmers were given a detailed account of scientific farming methods.  Woodwork classes were also provided.  They did much to brighten the lives of rural people.  I recall the role played by them, when I was young, in Macra Na Féirme in encouraging people to take part in public speaking at a time there were fewer opportunities to pursue education.  The present generation of members and teachers are operating in a more sophisticated environment and at a higher level.</P>
      <P>I pay a special compliment to the chief executive officers who seem to be a race apart in the education sector, they are superb at their job.  It would be wrong to say they are all perfect, but there is no doubt that they have a superb attitude.  On occasion the meetings of vocational education committees are very short because they have everything worked out in advance and streamlined.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the vocational education committees are not in any danger.  She stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> It has been suggested that there is a plan to eliminate the vocational education committees.  Some people have attempted to portray the White Paper proposals as an attempt to do away with the vocational education committees entirely or to deprive them of their powers and functions. Quite simply, this is not true.  The White Paper states that the vocational education committees will be retained and will function as providers of education within the framework established nationally by the Minister for Education and elaborated regionally by each education board.  Exchequer funding and support for vocational education committees will be channelled through the education boards.</P>
    <P>From what the Minister said, it seems as if the vocational education committees will be retained and funded by the regional education boards rather than by the Department of Education as heretofore.  This may ease some of the difficulties which exist.  I would like to see the vocational education committees continue to play a major role as they know what is involved and have the ciall ceannaithe.</P>
    <P>There are question marks hanging over the regional education boards.  We have health boards, development boards and so on.  Will it be easy to blame the regional education boards for the failure to provide money when the blame lies with the Minister and the Government?  Will they be a soft target? I am not supposed to adopt a negative attitude on any of these issues on this side of the House, but would like to think that the boards will be provided with all the money that they need.  Perhaps that is only a dream.</P>
    <P>I accept that the idea that every problem should be dealt with by the Department is outdated.  Those who have to deal with members of its staff, whether in Tullamore, Athlone or Dublin, invariably find that they are run off their feet.  Without giving too many <Col N="842" /> details, in one particular case the member of staff involved was near to exhaustion by the time the problem was resolved having worked throughout the Christmas period processing files.  That is not good enough.  From that point of view, it would be a good thing if regional education boards took some of the responsibility, provided they are given adequate resources.</P>

I am sure that no matter what grouping one decides on for the regional education boards it will be the wrong one, but I hope they will be impartial.  Under the vocational education committees a small school at the far end of a county is treated fairly.  Will it be treated in the same way and receive a fair crack of the whip from a regional education board which may think that big is beautiful, rather than the other way around? There will, therefore, be advantages and disadvantages.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the vocational education committees will be responsible for the second-level schools under their remit, their ownership, the employment of staff and the appointment of boards of management and will continue to provide vocational education and training, including post leaving certificate courses, adult and continuing education, the arts in education, the operation of outdoor education centres and so on.  It appears, therefore, that they will be retained and operate as heretofore.  That is to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>In the Green Paper published by Deputy Séamus Brennan when Minister for Education, Fianna Fáil suggested the introduction of league tables similar to those introduced in Britain by the Tory Party.  Under such a system schools would be judged in isolation and rated according to arbitrary criteria.  If Deputy Brennan had his way, we might be facing the same crisis of confidence among teachers, parents and pupils being experienced in the UK.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil had a majority in Government it promised an intermediate tier for management of first and second level education, but now that it is in Opposition it opposed the Government's proposal to establish an intermediate tier for all schools.  Fianna Fáil rejects the idea of an intermediate tier in all 4,000 schools not currently under the vocational education committees.  In rejecting the ten proposed education boards, it is calling for about 34 illdefined &ldquo;fora&rdquo;.  The seeming lack of logic and reason that has beset that party in Opposition is baffling.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is about playing politics with education and with the future of our children.  As Fianna Fáil states in its motion &mdash; I support this concept &mdash; the vocational education committees have played a very positive role in education.  Their organisation not <Col N="844" /> only of adult education but of innovative schemes such as the much admired Youthreach Programme and VTOS made an invaluable contribution to education.</P>
      <P>I am proud to remind my colleagues from all parties that I was happily employed by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee for a number of years and saw at first hand the incredible and admirable dedication of the teaching staff, from teacher grade up to chief executive officer level.  I do not cease to be amazed at the social conscience that prevails throughout the vocational education committee system. As can be seen from the Youthreach Programme and the vocational training and opportunity schemes, the teachers involved do exceptional work.</P>
      <P>The vocational education committee system however, is not perfect.  Neither parents nor teachers are adequately represented.  There is need to ensure vocational education committee structures are suited to the needs not only of today but also of tomorrow.  Education cannot take place in isolation from the local communities served by our educational facilities.  The education boards proposed by the Government will facilitate an effective partnership among those with an interest in education, whether at national, regional or community level.  They will make it easier to co-ordinate and realise national educational objectives by ensuring that community strengths are mobilised to complement national action.</P>
      <P>The need for an intermediate body between the Department of Education and the 4,000 schools has been very obvious.  At present every grant, sanction of a teacher appointment and minor query must be dealt with by the Department, which is absurd.  Instead of taking a broad, long-term view of education, the Department has to deal with bureaucratic minutiae.  It is interesting that we are having this debate on education because we will very soon have a debate along similar lines on the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, even in its muddled way, <Col N="845" /> seems to agree on the need for some intermediate structure.  It wants to retain the vocational education committees, but it is not clear on how many should be retained.  What does the phrase &ldquo;a modernised vocational education committee system&rdquo; mean?  Does it indicate that Fianna Fáil wants a reduced number of vocational education committees or does it want to retain all 38 vocational education committees?  It is also seeking so-called fora in every county.  Assuming Fianna Fáil wants to retain all 38 vocational education committees and establish fora in each of the 34 county boroughs, it wants a total of 72 local education bodies.</P>

For example, the questions of cost, democratic representation and the potential remoteness of some of the proposed boards need to be addressed.  These questions can be resolved through the process of open debate and discussion under the White Paper.  I hope in the interests of its constituents Fianna Fáil will make an informed and honest contribution to such a debate and will refrain from playing politics with the issue, as is typified by this motion on which we will vote tomorrow night.</P>

      <P>Too often in recent years there have been instances of local public representatives being sidelined. <Col N="846" /> The establishment of regional boards would further erode the role of the local public representative.  Councillors and members of vocational education committees have worked diligently for years to improve the system of education.  We must not forget the very valuable role they played in the provision of education at second level and subsequently at third level, particularly the establishment of colleges of technology and regional technical colleges.  That structure provided access to third level education for many people who would otherwise have been deprived of it. Vocational education committees have been synonymous with the provision of adult education courses, the Youthreach Programme and the vocational training and opportunities schemes.  All those courses provide essential and basic education and training for many young people.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and her Department officials would be much better employed in rationalising the further education area and structuring courses and colleges within a proper regulatory system.  Fortunately, the vast majority of post-leaving certificate programmes have been extremely successful.  Vocational education committee officials and teachers are to be complimented on their initiative in providing courses to meet market demands.  Many of the post-leaving certificate courses on offer are targeted at growth areas of the economy.  The skills learned are essential to the economic sectors involved and improve substantially the employment potential of students.  As well as being finely tuned to the market needs of the economy, the courses generally correspond with the predominant economic activities of the region.  Unlike regional boards, local education structures would be able to respond to local needs and demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 90 per cent of students at the Cavan College of Further Studies obtain employment or go on to further education.  That is an impressive achievement, I urge the Minister to have the whole area of <Col N="847" /> further education properly structured and to give colleges such as Cavan formal recognition.  Centres such as Cavan, which has a proven record and for whose courses there is a strong demand as evidenced by higher annual enrolments, should be established on a formal basis.</P>
    <P>Allied to the unanswerable case for a centre such as Cavan is the low participation by students from the Border counties in higher education.  The regulation of post leaving certificate courses with regard to proper certification, the provision of courses on a specialised basis and the introduction of a maintenance grant system would help to eliminate many of the obstacles that restrict participation in further education.  I instance tonight the case of post leaving certificate courses as the local committees were instrumental in providing education at this level to students who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to gain entry directly to a third level college.</P>

Many of them, as said by previous <Col N="848" /> speakers, were to the forefront in bringing education to the disadvantaged and the underprivileged, long before it became fashionable.  The vocational education committees and their members were the true pioneers in developing education and, while I am sure he did not mean to, Deputy Eric Byrne paid an extraordinary compliment to Fianna Fáil and to its role in developing education.</P>
    <P>It is a grave mistake to relegate the vocational education committees to mere subcommittees of the regional structure.  Education needs an independent local dimension representative of all the partners in education &mdash; parents, teachers, local councillors, management at the various levels and the Department of Education.  The regional model does not have the capacity to deliver an equitable service at local level.</P>
    <P>The education partners in County Clare came together in 1992 and proposed a county structure of which the Minister is aware.  That was quite an unusual development at the time and a number of other counties have since carefully examined it as a model.  The county structure has a number of advantages.  It is an ideal forum to co-ordinate educational services, particularly at second level, in manageable units at county level with representation from all interested sectors.  The county is the recognised traditional unit for the provision of realistic mechanisms for co-ordination and delivery of services.</P>
    <P>Local co-ordination has already been successful in many counties where vocational education committees and religious management have taken initiatives for the common good.  If these managements were formally united as equal partners, major development and rationalisation possibilities would be feasible.  The manageable county scheme ensures equity in the delivery of services to avoid the marginalisation of the disadvantaged.  This was referred to by a number of speakers on both sides of the House and it is an issue about which we must all be concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> There are a huge range of services which have become an inherent part of the education system or, if they have not, they should in the near future.  One of these is the psychological service.  The inspectorial and advisory service should be available at county level.  There is a major role in curriculum development, inservice training and research and development which should be conducted at an intermediate rather than a national level.  Adult education and training for those under 18 who have left formal education, school transport, student grants and scholarships, career advice, outdoor education and youth work can best be dealt with at county level.</P>
    <P>The role of educational planning, the location and type of school, rationalisation, where that arises &mdash; unfortunately, population trends dictate that will arise more frequently &mdash; the introduction of new programmes and the monitoring and evaluation of services provided are all matters which can be dealt with more satisfactorily at county rather than at regional level.</P>
    <P>The question of budget allocation is likely to become a thorny one and Deputy Browne mentioned the manner in which the regional structure at health board level has been a negative factor in this regard.  The question of educational standards and quality will always pose some difficulty and can be dealt with constructively at county level.  In addition, there will also be EU initiatives from which we can benefit.  I argue strongly for the continuation of a county system of education and bringing all the partners together in developing that as the intermediate tier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. If we were to say that the vocational education committees, which were established in 1930, operate now as they did then, the Minister would be correct in saying they should be abolished, but that is not the case.  The vocational education committees have evolved since that time and they have met the various needs as they have perceived them. <Col N="850" /> They have done that in a number of ways including the development of youth programmes, the practical training they now provide, VTOS courses, adult education, post leaving certificate courses, participation in EU education programmes and so on.</P>
      <P>I visited a school in my own area not long ago and I was amazed at the various courses being provided.  They were totally different from the courses provided when I was going to school.  That is an indication of the way the vocational education committees have responded to changing needs.  I cannot understand the reason the Department of Education has such a problem with the vocational education committees whose programmes have succeeded despite, rather than because of, the Department of Education.  For that reason I believe we should devolve more powers to the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>In my area it is proposed that the education boards will cover five counties&mdash; south Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow.  I wonder if the vocational education committee programmes can operate effectively over such a wide area from one regional office.  The areas to which I am referring covers 379 primary schools and 87 post-primary schools; approximately 100,000 students.</P>
      <P>Has this proposal been properly thought out?  For example, there are approximately 150,000 parents from whom to choose two representatives for the new health education board.  How can two people be chosen from such a huge number?  What are the costs involved?  Nobody has outlined those to date.  How will the public representatives on the board be chosen?  We have not yet been told that either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with our spokesperson, Deputy Martin, with regard to the role played by public representatives in the past.  We must remember that those representatives are accountable to the public and I find it extraordinary that recent reports have recommended that that system be abolished.  Those who are <Col N="851" /> democratically elected are the only people ultimately responsible to the public.  The proposal is for additional ministerial appointments which ultimately means more Government influence, but more powers should be devolved to county level rather than increasing the power of the Department of Education.  I strongly support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I complement my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party for tabling the motion and ensuring that this important development in education is fully debated.  I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution.  The White Paper <i>Charting Our Educational Future</i> proposes the establishment of ten regional boards of education which will be introduced in the phased manner to act as an intermediate local tier between the school boards of management and the Department of Education at primary and secondary level.  It also states that the Government has decided to carry out legislative reform for the rationalisation of the vocational education committee system. This will inevitably mean the abolition of a number of vocational education committees, following the report of the commission on school accommodation, when this comes to hand.</P>
      <P>The Minister praises and commends the vocational education committees, and rightly so, for their services to education since their foundation in 1930 to the present day.  They have done sterling work and proved themselves responsive to the needs of the community at all levels in the education field.  They have risen to every challenge presented to them.  Growth in the numbers of pupils from 68,000 in 1981 to 92,000 in 1992-93 bears testimony to the esteem in which their schools are held by the public and the efforts they have made to bring education to the people and extend their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> They co-operated fully with the establishment of the regional technical colleges and community schools in the various locations in which they exist.  They were a fundamental part of the educational infrastructure which underpinned these institutions.  Any praise lavished on them by the Minister was richly and truly deserved.  In her speech the Minister goes on to say that the vocational education committees will actually be strengthened for the future by this process of rationalisation.  Apart altogether from the questionable wisdom of having two intermediate tiers between the boards of management of the various schools and the Department of Education, it is difficult to see how the vocational education committees can be strengthened in the new regime, which transfers so many of their functions such as co-ordinating adults in continued education, vocational education and training, outdoor education centres to the new boards, which will also have a co-ordinating role in publicly funded youth and sport activities. Those vocational education committees that remain will have to report all plans, budget programmes, etc., to the new board for approval.  Clearly it is intended that the remaining vocational education committees will be under the jurisdiction of regional education boards.  Obviously they cannot survive as they have done to date under the new dispensation and their powers, remit and resources will be seriously curtailed as a result of the new policy outlined in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we need new structures that are responsive to the needs of the regions and representative of community interests and not remote from them.  I accept the need and the desirability for decentralisation but the proposed new boards are too big geographically, with perhaps the exception of Dublin City, too unwieldy and will not effectively reflect community interests, promote partnership in education and encourage participation of parents and communities.  They seem to be modelled on the health boards which <Col N="853" /> we debated today on the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996.  We also heard much criticism regarding their size, unwieldiness and remoteness from the community.  Education is the priority of the community.  People spend much time involved in education between going to school themselves and watching their children go to school.  They know much more about education and are more willing to get involved than in health matters.  If they regard health boards as too big and unwieldy they will regard the proposed new educational boards in the same way.</P>
    <P>In my constituency in the west there are only four major hospitals dealing with health boards.  We have 630 schools.  If the Minister is going ahead with the proposal, the new boards should be based on the vocational education committee system where there is already in existence an infrastructure based on the county which &mdash; we all know from our sporting and football experiences &mdash; demands loyalty and would have a greater chance of encouraging participation by the local community.  Also the local community would feel it was closer to them.  In regard to the establishment of the new boards, there is the question of costs which are bound to be considerable. That was also one of the criticisms of the health boards when they were set up &mdash; that costs escalated immediately.  If extra resources are available they should be put into essential and basic services in the existing education system.  For example, a couple of weeks ago I asked the Minister when a large number of primary schools in County Mayo could expect the services of a remedial teacher.  The Minister told me she had no resources at her disposal and could not tell me when this essential service would be made available to the schools.  If extra resources are available they should be spent on essential services in the existing system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled an amendment to the motion, not because I disagree with the motion tabled by Fianna Fáil but because there is another dimension to education which we should stress.  It deals with the quality of educational qualifications of young people and the fact that young people are leaving school early and going straight into long term unemployment.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a network of regional education boards was mooted in the Government White Paper on Education, published last year.  This proposal is the latest move in what might be termed the &ldquo;quangoisation&rdquo; of politics.  There is widespread recognition of the need to reform our structures of Government.  We are one of the most heavily centralised states in Europe with an inordinate amount of power concentrated in Dublin.  A typical example of this is the way in which school buses are run.  The services in every parish are run by a State company based in Dublin.  If we want to devolve power, a structure already exists in the form of local government.  There are democratically elected councils and corporations which are more than anxious to assume additional responsibilities from central Government.  For the most part we have ignored this structure of local democracy.  Indeed, we have increasingly opted for the creation of quangos&mdash; State funded boards that provide the illusion of local autonomy while maintaining centralised control.  We have hundreds of these quangos populating the administrative landscapes.  There are quangos for rural development, local development, urban renewal, tourism and fisheries and we are now to have ten new boards in the field of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of ten new regional education boards is unnecessary.  The new bodies will introduce another layer of bureaucracy to the administration of <Col N="855" /> education and the cost of running the whole system will increase as a result of this new initiative.  We all recognise there will be no administrative savings in the Department of Education.  The whole central edifice will remain intact. The new bodies will not supersede or complement the existing vocational education committees.  This means we will have two sets of local or regional educational bodies standing alongside each other in a system that will still be dominated by central Government.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper the Minister indicated she would rationalise the vocational education committees.  We have not seen detailed proposals in this regard other than the vague outline in the White Paper.  I believe there is already confusion about that.  The vocational education committee structure may not be perfect, and needs some degree of rationalisation, but it has provided a good vocational education service which has responded to the needs of local communities.  The structure functioned with a minimum of bureaucracy, unlike the proposals which are being put forward by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a list of innovative aspects of education which have come through the vocational education sector, such as the establishment of second chance education, literacy education, the development and support of youth structures and particularly PLCs which have revolutionised education for many young people.</P>
    <P>The regional structure envisaged for the educational boards does not fit in with any of the regional structures already in existence.  For instance, it is hard to understand why Dublin should be divided into two regions when it is a single region for all other planning purposes.  All the indications are that bureaucracy will flourish under the new system.  As envisaged by the White Paper, each board will have and executive director and a full-time staff.  The director will be the day to day boss in all executive matters and there will be <Col N="856" /> little or no democratic control of the educational process.  Many of the groups involved in all-Irish schools believe their work will at worst be forgotten and at best be fragmented in the complexities of this new structure.  Even before the new regional education boards are established, the White Paper mentions committees and sub-committees working under individual boards, commissioning reports and consultancy studies.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provides no estimate of the cost of running this new bureaucracy; that is its missing chapter. From her evasive replies to questions on the issues, it appears the Minister has no idea how much it would cost to implement these proposals.  During last week's debate there was speculation about this &mdash; I wonder how accurate is Deputy Couglan's guestimate of £25 million?  Whatever the true figure, by the time each board has set up its headquarters, equipped its offices and hired its staff, the regionalisation of education administration is not likely to come cheap.</P>
    <P>The growth in bureaucracy will not be confined to the new regional education boards.  We are also to have a further education authority and a national certification authority as well as a teaching council.  All these will be worthy bodies in their own right but would it not have been possible to come up with a more streamlined administrative system?  The taxpayer will be left to pick up a substantial tab and money that could be better spent improving the quality of education will go to increase bureaucracy.  Where will this end?  It is difficult to see administrative logic in the arrangement.  The new boards will undoubtedly create further scope for ministerial patronage in appointments but they will not do much to enhance the quality of our education service.</P>
    <P>I moved the amendment because it is a pity that we are discussing bureaucracy and structures when we should be talking about education; there is much to be said about how our education system operates.  The recent reports on <Col N="857" /> educational disadvantage make disturbing reading.  One study concluded that 26,000 students leave school every year officially classed as educationally disadvantaged.  This means they have no recognised qualification of any sort, not even the junior certificate, and may have major problems with basic literacy and numeracy skills.  Those 26,000 students represent 40 per cent of the annual cohort of school leavers.  If the education system is failing to satisfy the basic needs of 40 per cent of its clients the State is getting poor value for the £1.6 billion spent on our schools every year.</P>
    <P>There is a major social cost arising from the failings of our education system.  It is well established that educational disadvantage translates into employment disadvantage and those without educational qualifications or the essential basic skills face an uphill task in finding jobs.  The 1994 Labour Force Survey showed the unemployment rate for those who left school without qualifications was 45 per cent. Equally, of the long-term unemployed aged 35 and over, more than 60 per cent had no qualifications and 88 per cent had not achieved leaving certificate standard.  Surveys of school leavers show that, for those without qualifications, the likelihood of gaining a job decreases over time.  We have succeeded in creating a system which delivers disadvantaged school leavers straight into a life of long-term unemployment, with all its attendant problems.  Education does not create jobs but it ensures everyone in society has a fair chance of securing the job opportunities which become available.</P>
    <P>The danger of suffering educational disadvantage arises early in life.  International research has shown that children who are delayed in their language development at age three have a 70 to 80 per cent chance of experiencing serious learning difficulties throughout their schooling and beyond.  It is clear, therefore, that early experiences are vital in laying the foundation for success in later learning.  This is a hobby horse <Col N="858" /> of mine but it must be stressed &mdash; the lack of pre-school facilities means that children in more deprived areas may be permanently disadvantaged before they even enter the formal schooling system. This issue needs to be tackled far more urgently than the creation of new quangos.  It is an area which falls into the cracks between the Department of Health and the Department of Education, with neither assuming its rightful responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister &mdash; there is a wide area which is not being addressed.  I do not argue for a huge increase in spending or for the creation of new boards or layers of bureaucracy.  With the expenditure of a relatively small amount, we could learn a great deal from what has been achieved in other countries.  We should see what worked in other jurisdictions and look at the quality of our education, the provision of better pre-school facilities and direct funding of local community groups, encouraging them to use existing facilities.</P>
      <P>It is also important to look at the school curriculum if we are to deal with educational disadvantage.  Our present system is geared towards third level education.  It has a strong academic orientation, the points system plays a dominant role and, while it serves many people well, it does not meet the needs of all our children.  We need a stronger vocational element in the syllabus.  We should consider including subjects like basic computer skills, and we should avoid training young people in outdated skills for which there is a declining demand in the work place.</P>
      <P>There are many initiatives in our system which can be examined without expending any money.  Giving vast sums to the bureaucratic nightmare which will be the regional education boards will not serve our education system well and will do nothing to improve its overall quality.</P>

      <P>This is a timely motion which will clarify the issues concerning the establishment of regional education boards.  This move comes as no surprise to me and to most Members who have kept a close watch on developments in education and the consultative process the Minister has engaged in over a long period.</P>
      <P>Under the European model of drawing down money for various programmes during the period of the Structural Funds and after 1999, there will have to be more regionalisation of decision making.  Similarly, Government policies will have to be discussed and decided more at the regional level than at the centre in order to draw down ESF funding for the vocational education sector, regional colleges, etc.  There will be an onus on whatever Government is in office to demonstrate to the EU Commission that education functions are being devolved.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance recently made the case to the EU that this country still needs substantial resources for education and training and he said we would focus on these areas after 1999 when the present round of Structural Funds is completed.  He made a very cogent case to ensure that the young people who require training at second and third levels will have the resources and support from the EU to make inroads into unemployment.  Education and training will give young people a better opportunity to get permanent employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the great contribution of the vocational education committees to education.  It has been indicated over the last few years that there would be a diminution in the responsibilities and powers of the vocational education committees.  The Minister set out clearly in her statement to the recent vocational education committee congress and in <Col N="860" /> the Dáil that the vocational education committees are here to stay.  The Government has no plans to abolish vocational education or the vocational education committees.  There are plans for greater co-ordination between secondary, community and voluntary schools and to bring everybody together to see what policies and structures are required regionally.</P>
    <P>In the south-east region there are two regional technical colleges, one in Carlow and another in Waterford, which aspire to university status.  Those regional technical colleges offer an outreach programme to towns such as Kilkenny and Wexford which have no third level colleges.  The Department of Education should not deny those regional technical colleges the opportunity to set up outreach facilities and courses.  There seems to have been some unease recently about Carlow regional technical college's courses in Kilkenny city.  It appears there may be resistance from the Department of Education to the future development of these facilities because it may have had representations from another area.  I would like the regional technical colleges to be allowed to exercise greater autonomy to provide extra third level courses in surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>The concept of regional education authorities is a logical extension of the regionalisation that has come about in health, agriculture and other sectors of the economy.  A substantial removal of powers to regional and central levels would not fit with the devolution of power from the centre.  The fears expressed about the competing tiers that may develop are unfounded.  I am glad the Minister has given the necessary assurances recently.</P>
    <P>Vocational education committees will continue to act as statutory committees and will provide services in the areas of Vocational education and training, adult and continuing education, the arts and the operation of outdoor education centres.  It was stated that the introduction of the education Bill proposed by the Minister would downgrade the <Col N="861" /> importance of vocational education. The White Paper on Education actively and explicitly recognises the importance of vocational education and training.  It sets out a comprehensive and detailed policy aproach for the future development of vocational education and training.  I hope the Minister will continue her support for the concept of vocational education and the vocational education committees which have done an excellent job throughout the years. The regional education boards will be the co-ordinating bodies for the good work done in the vocational, secondary and regional college sectors.</P>

      <P>The 1992 Green Paper on Education, which was produced by a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, clearly set out to do what Deputies Martin and Coughlan complained about, but which the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, has no intention of doing, namely, to abolish the vocational education committees.  It was Fianna Fáil who wished to take away the management of schools from the vocational education committees and it was also Fianna Fáil who tried to take the responsibility for the employment of teachers from the vocational education <Col N="863" /> committees.  Most damning of all, it was Fianna Fáil which intended to gut the vocational education committees by a so-called streamlining process.  In 1992, in my local authority area, a Fianna Fáil Minister took our six third level colleges out of the vocational education committee sector.  There have been many arguments in favour of the latter course but it ill behoves Fianna Fáil, particularly Deputy Martin, to try to portray itself as the guardian of the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>Whether Deputies Martin and Coughlan like it, the Minister's proposals come at the end of the widest ever consultative process engaged in by any Minister for Education.  In 1993, prior to calling the national education convention, the Minister sought and received over 1,000 detailed submissions on the future of Irish education.  In 1994, she held the equally historic round table talks.  Last year she produced &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; a remarkable White Paper which was in many ways an historic first for the future of Irish education.  This process involved widespread consensus among the key actors in the education process &mdash; the owners, trustees, vocational education committees, teachers' unions and, perhaps most importantly, parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, Ireland is one of the most centralised providers of education in the developed world. That point could be made about any facet of Irish administration.  One of the key tests for any party concerned about the creation of a modern Ireland is its preparedness to devolve powers away from the centre to the community.  It appears that Fianna Fáil intends to fall at this first hurdle in the education area. So much for its modern identity.  Ireland Incorporated has often worked well for Fianna Fáil in the past but it appears Fianna Fáil has no intention of changing to meet the future education needs of the public.  I welcome the Minister's intention to develop the new system in a carefully phased manner.  It is intended to move the key education <Col N="864" /> functions to the new regional boards in a five year phased period.</P>

      <P>Some of the more interesting developments for the boards include the development of educational plans for each region with key strategic priorities and objectives.  It is a hallmark of the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, that she has announced such plans will be open for public inspection and debate.  Contrary to the Opposition's allegations last week, this process will mark a new maturity in local democracy.  Perhaps, that is what Fianna Fáil is truly afraid of.  There will also be an annual programme and budget for each regional board and it is very appropriate that these budgets will be laid before this House.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I have been struck by the lack of accountability in many areas of education spending over the years.  The Comptroller and Auditor General under the 1994 Act has, at last, been given the power to scrutinise all aspects of education spending.  It was with dismay, however, that recent meetings of the Public Accounts Committee learned that the financial reports of a small minority of vocational education committees had to be qualified by the local government auditor.  I do not want to spend too much time tonight on the financial affairs of the County Westmeath vocational education committee, with which Fianna Fáil, particularly some of its ex-Ministers, are very familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there were serious inequalities in education spending and provision in the past.  The proposal of a local block grant to be transmitted through the regional boards to provide for all the students in their catchment area is, therefore, attractive.  The budgetary provisions of the new boards will be based on nationally determined criteria to ensure fairness, including important provision for minorities and those with learning disabilities.  Another <Col N="865" /> very attractive aspect of the creation of the regional boards is the scope which they give for integrated provision of new curricular development and school support services.</P>
    <P>A considerable achievement of this Minister and, to be fair, some of her recent predecessors, has been the expansion of areas such as remedial education, the psychological service and home-school liasion.  I know from experience that teachers who have been retrained to take up these posts can often feel isolated within individual schools or small groups of schools.  I look forward, therefore, to the creation of the special committees promised by the Minister at regional level, to facilitate and expand these important new services and developments.</P>
    <P>A Member of this House could not deny the enormous contribution to education of the 38 vocational education committees in the past 66 years.  Far from weakening the vocational education committees, the Minister has given a firm pledge in chapter 14 of <i>Charting our Education Future</i> that there will be a strong role for vocational education committees.  The new legislation she is planning will strengthen their statutory base and give them clear recognition as important providers of education at all levels.  The commission on school accommodation needs, which the Minister established, will try to ensure the smaller less well resourced vocational education committees will retain their character and integrity in any new developments.</P>
    <P>I have been deeply impressed by the tremendous vitality of the Dublin City vocational education committee, especially in the past few years under the chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Costello.  The huge expansion of adult and second chance education through Dublin city's 22 vocational education committee colleges has been an enormous resource for the people of Dublin, particularly our constituents who have been trying to retain and educate themselves and could not avail of second and third level education in the <Col N="866" /> earlier part of their lives.  I am certain this wonderful progress is not endangered by the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, Coláiste Dhúlaigh in Coolock has given thousands of northsiders a platform to develop recreational and vocational skills.  Like Deputy Ring, I will be parochial for a moment and put on the record my strong support for granting regional technical college third level status to Coláiste Dhúlaigh.  Its two Coolock campuses would be an ideal base to develop a junior third level college for the northside of Dublin.  There is a growing movement across the northside, which has a population of 350,000 people, for an regional technical college, in addition to the national university which has many students from areas such as the western seaboard and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county. Students from the northside of Dublin are not always able to attend that university.  Therefore, I make a plea for a northside regional technical college.</P>

Sheer dishonesty and brass neck was shown here by Deputy Martin last week on the cost issue when he shed crocodile tears for the parents of children with special needs.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter.  I extend the condolence of every Member to the family of Bernadette O'Brien who tragically died following injuries sustained at a rock concert at the Point Depot on Saturday night last. What began as a joyous occasion for Bernadette and her friends has become a terrible nightmare for her family.</P>
      <P>The events that occurred at the concert in question are every parent's nightmare.  Young people enjoying themselves suddenly discover they are in a dangerous and life threatening situation. It is essential that the events of Saturday night are examined in detail and we must obtain results as quickly as possible from the two inquiries under way.  I request that the Minister of State commission an independent report to inquire into the exact events that took place on Saturday night and identify new recommendations for the management and safety of indoor pop concerts. It is clear that this type of event is becoming more attractive to young people who attend such concerts in increasing numbers at venues throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A series of concerts are already being promoted for the summer months.  As a parent I wish to be assured that if my children and others attend such events, they do so in the knowledge that every possible safety precaution has been taken.  As a legislator I would like to pose a series of questions.  Has a recent audit of the Hamilton Committee recommendations of 1990, a very good report on public safety and crowd control been carried out?  What was the outcome of such an audit?  The extraordinary picture which seems to be <Col N="869" /> emerging is that there is a code of practice for sporting events and outdoor concerts, when held in sporting arenas, but there is no code of practice for indoor concerts.  There is a clear need to develop such a code.</P>
    <P>We must ask if a voluntary code of practice is enough or is it time to lay down a statutory framework?  Do the Fire Safety Regulations, 1981, currently in place need to be updated and strengthened?  What is the appropriate ratio of security personnel to numbers of customers attending such concerts? Were 110 security people enough for an attendance of 8,500, clearly not in the way they were deployed?  Is there a clear line of responsibility during such concerts which can ensure that prompt action is taken if the situation escalates out of control as opposed to simply leaving such action to the performers on the night in question?</P>
    <P>If the same configuration used at this concert is ever to be used again, we must clearly understand what went wrong on this occassion.  If a crowd surge such as that which occurred on Saturday night can lead to death, what number of people can be permitted to stand in front of the stage during a concert? Stricter laws and procedures are necessary to deal with this evolving situation. The nature of public concerts is changing and can present special problems which impinge on safety.  The Hamilton Committee considered that all major public concert promotions at indoor venues should require a special individual licence from the District Court and this should apply to all concerts where the audience exceeds 2,000.  Is it time to bring this into effect?  A number of further recommendations were made with regard to crowd pressure at the front of the stage.  These included suggestions that consideration should be given to the padding of barriers to prevent injuries from pressure on individuals and to curved barriers with areas for overspill at each end.  What has happened to these recommendations?</P>
    <P>An adequate technical code of practice for front of stage barriers must also <Col N="870" /> be considered and implemented.  There must also be clear guidelines and rules for use of public address systems for emergency announcements during pop concerts.  These are some of the urgent questions which must be answered in the light of this tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the family of the late Bernadette O'Brien in Shanagarry, County Cork.</P>
      <P>It is clear that security inside the hall at the Point Depot was not effective. The crowd of 8,000 people was largely composed of teenagers between ten and 18 years of age.  Security was lax.  Teenagers sitting on the ground in the upstairs lobby were completely ignored by security.  Alcohol and cigarettes were readily available to everyone in attendance.  The main hall area was seriously overcrowded, with little or no security in place.  There was a free for all and the event became a shambles.</P>
      <P>I request that new legislation to deal with safety at rock concerts be put in place, as suggested by the Chief Fire Officers' Association.  I support the call made by the National Parents' Association that the serving of alcoholic drinks to people under 18 years of age at rock concerts should be banned.  We are now in the rock concert season and the Government should take these suggestions on board as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>This tragedy begs the question of whether the Point Depot, or any hall or concert area, is adequately equipped to cater for people attending concerts given by such musical groups as the Smashing Pumpkins.  Is a permanent hall such as the Point Depot which hosted a concert by the New Zealand opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa an appropriate venue for a concert by a group such as the Smashing Pumpkins who encourage their young audience to &ldquo;mosh&rdquo; and &ldquo;crowd surf&rdquo;?  We were very lucky there was not another Stardust tragedy.  All rock concerts should be banned from indoor arenas until the necessary legislation or statutory measures are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bernadette O'Brien's tragic death <Col N="871" /> could have been avoided.  I have heard reports of other teenagers who attended the concert on Saturday night who experienced respiratory problems, bodily bruising and spinal injuries, which can be very serious for people of that age.  I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for sharing time with me and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, for his attendance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by expressing sincere sympathy to the bereaved parents and family of the late Bernadette O'Brien of Shanagarry, County Cork. Bernadette died tragically at 17 years of age&mdash;apparently as a result of crush injuries received during a rock concert at the Point Depot in Dublin last Saturday night.  I appreciate that expressions of sympathy, however genuine, offer little real comfort to the grief stricken family, relations, friends and schoolmates of Bernadette.  It is horrific that attendance at a rock concert &mdash; an innocent pleasure safely enjoyed by thousands of young people every year&mdash; should have resulted in this shocking tragedy.</P>
      <P>The holding of such concerts at the Point are already governed by a number of different legislative codes, involving the supervision of different aspects by the courts, the Garda, local authorities and the health boards.  I understand that the Point Depot holds licences under the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1890, in respect of music and singing an under the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, in respect of dancing.  Conditions attached to these licences are enforceable in the normal course by the Garda Síochána.  I also understand that the Point Depot is required to be licensed under the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950 to 1989, for the service of food, and under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, 1924 to 1983, for the service of alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How then could such a tragedy happen?  This is currently the subject of a number of investigations by the Garda <Col N="872" /> Síochána, Dublin Corporation, the promoters of the concert and the owners of the Point Depot.  A number of factors have been listed in the media as causing or contributing to this fatal accident&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I do not wish to list them or comment on their possible contribution to this tragedy.  To do so could prejudge the outcome of the investigations to which I referred and, furthermore, might prejudice the outcome of any civil or criminal proceedings which may result from the investigations or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The question of public safety and crowd control was examined some years ago by a committee chaired by Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton.  The committee made a series of recommendations in 1990 on all aspects of public safety and crowd control, following which the Department of Education published a code of practice for safety at outdoor pop concerts and other events in recent months.  While the code was designed for outdoor events, it states clearly that the parameters for the good organisation of an indoor pop concert are basically similar to outdoor events.  It has been reported that the promoters claim the concert in the Point Depot last Saturday was arranged in accordance with this code.</P>
      <P>If the investigations show that there is a deficiency in either the existing legal provisions which govern any aspect of pop concerts or in the code of practice for safety at pop concerts published by the Department last January, the Government will not be found wanting in moving quickly to remedy any such deficiency.  At the same time I must emphasise that, ultimately, primary responsibility for the safe running of concerts rests with the concert promoters and the venue owners.  Those attending concerts must also ensure that their behaviour does not endanger the health and safety of others.</P>

      <P>I raise this issue to seek a full explanation from the Minister as to how a box containing the practical work of eight engineering students from Kilmuckridge vocational education committee, County Wexford, submitted as part of the leaving certificate examination, 1996, ended up near a bog in County Roscommon.  It is unacceptable and inexcusable that errors of this nature should continue to occur in our public examination system.  Following last year's debacle in the leaving certificate art examination, it further undermines the integrity of the public examination system and reduces public confidence.</P>
      <P>This incident has caused unnecessary trauma and upset to the students, parents, teachers and school involved.  They have prepared well for this examination and deserve better treatment.  It is regrettable that the Minister personally has not conveyed her apologies to the students concerned or that somebody on her behalf did not contact the students directly, apologise and explain the situation to them.  This has not yet happened; there has been no direct contact with the students or their families from either the Department or the Minister.  That is regrettable and unacceptable.  A more person friendly approach from the Minister and her team would be appreciated.  Apologies via the media are not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also regrettable that the Department was slow to admit that an error had again taken place.  The principal of <Col N="874" /> the school involved was informed last Thursday at approximately 2 p.m. that a package had been found.  He instructed An Post to forward it to the Department of Education and he then contacted the Department to alert it to the fact that a package had been mislaid. However, we only found out today, from newspaper reports, about this bizarre episode.</P>
    <P>It is equally difficult to understand the Minister's incapacity to ascertain what happened in her Department and to obtain information on this matter. For example, she was unable to state on the RTE radio programme &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; today whether the box in question was signed for in her Department.  It was either signed for, checked in and received or it was not.  Why was the Minister not in a position to answer this simple question?  I hope she will be in a position to answer it here.</P>
    <P>The procedures governing the transferring and delivering of leaving certificate artwork and practicals appear to be extraordinarily loose.  When one takes into account that the leaving certificate is crucial to the future careers of young people, it is incredible that episodes like this should continue to happen.  I understand that a joint statement issued on the &ldquo;Six One&rdquo; news on RTE television by the Department of Education and Iarnród Éireann suggests that the box simply fell off the truck.  Is the Minister seriously standing over this statement?</P>
    <P>Will she further elaborate on it?  Is there any checking procedure within the Department to ensure that all packages dispatched by schools arrive safely?  We are not dealing with thousands of entries in this case.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain why she considered it necessary to involve the Garda in the investigation of this episode?  What are the implications of this move?  Is she suggesting that somebody, somewhere, was behaving in an illegal or criminal manner?  The Minister should clarify this issue thereby restoring confidence in the system over which she presides.</P>
    <P>We do not want to wait another six <Col N="875" /> months for answers to these questions. It is the Minister's responsibility to restore confidence to a public examination system, the integrity of which is badly shaken.  She should convince the thousands of students involved in these examinations that their work will be handled with the care, respect and integrity it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The latest episode in the loss of examination material is causing much disquiet among students parents and teachers.  At a time when tens of thousands of students are preparing for their examinations, incidents such as this hardly inspire confidence in the examination system.  The indifferent attitude shown by the Minister and her Department to this and to previous losses of examination material is appalling.  It is unacceptable to students whose futures, both academically and career wise, depends so much on the results they receive following the sitting of the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>The statement issued this evening by the Department of Education and Iarnród Éireann that the parcel containing the examination projects may have fallen from the back of a truck is regarded by the public as no more than a joke.  Surely examination projects, which have been prepared by students after hours of study, deserve to be treated better than to be thrown on the back of an open truck, giving rise to the possibility of them being stolen or lost. It is an insult to students, parents and teachers to be treated in this way by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When did the Department first become aware that Kilmuckridge Vocational Education Committee examination projects were missing? Was it only last Thursday, when the principal so informed it?  When did the Minister become aware of the missing box, or was she kept in the dark by her Department until yesterday?  If the media had not become aware of the missing examination projects yesterday, would there have been a cover up in the <Col N="876" /> Department?  How could the examination box be lost from the back of a truck when, according to my information, the box was signed for by the Department of Education examination centre in Athlone?  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this.  Students studying for the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations this summer have lost faith in the ability of the Department or the Minister to oversee examination results properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Every parent facing into examinations is very concerned about this incident, and every student sitting them is fearful.  The revelation concerning the discovery of the completed practical work for this year's leaving certificate is an extremely serious matter.  It is extraordinary that the eight students from County Wexford had to rely on the observation powers of the County Roscommon turf cutter who luckily realised the importance of the parcel he found and brought it to the post office ensuring that it would arrive safely at the Department of Education's examination branch in Athlone.</P>
      <P>A number of serious questions must be answered by the Minister.  The first question she must address is why had a week elapsed before we learned about this blunder.  What assurance can she give students that other such blunders will not arise?</P>
      <P>The Minister said she already has fail safe measures in place.  Given the previous blunders involving misplaced and lost examination submissions these are very necessary.  The Minister should publish immediately the Price Waterhouse report on the investigation into the debacle in Sligo so that any steps she has put in place can be measured against the recommendations of that report.  Does she intend to publish the Price Waterhouse report immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister believe that the assurances she has given today are sufficient to allay the concerns of students and parents?  Last February she promised the publication of the Price Waterhouse report within weeks but we still <Col N="877" /> have not seen it and we have no gauge against which to measure her fail-safe mechanisms.  The Minister must also explain why Iarnrod Éireann insists that each box delivered to the examination centre in Athlone was signed for.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to act quickly to reassure the thousands of students who will sit the junior and leaving certificate examinations this year that none of the work which they submit will be mislaid or lost.  She must reassure these students, who are all facing the most stressful examination of their lives in a matter of weeks, that the Department is being run in an efficient manner and that they can be confident that the results they will be awarded later in the year will based on analysis of all the work they have submitted.</P>

      <P>Since my initial statement, Iarnrod Éireann has actively assisted my Department in investigating this matter.  I am now in a position to outline to the House the likely sequence of events which led to the discovery of a package of leaving certificate engineering work on a County Roscommon roadside.</P>
      <P>An assorted delivery of 27 packages addressed to the Department was checked by Iarnrod Éireann at Athlone railway station, and then placed on a truck for delivery to my Department's Athlone office.  On arrival at the Athlone office, the itemised consignment was signed for as a unit.  It now appears that the most likely occurrence was that only 26 of the packages were delivered.  Following Iarnrod Éireann's examination there was found to be a gap at the side of the canvass sided truck which would allow a package of that size to fall out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Athlone delivery, the truck travelled the road on which the package was eventually found.  Immediately upon clarifying the likely sequence of events, Iarnrod Éireann informed my Department of the outcome of the investigation which I have now brought to the attention of the House.  I thank <Col N="878" /> Iarnrod Éireann for their full co-operation in clarifying this matter.  Arising from this incident, my Department and Iarnrod Éireann will be consulting further.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on the record my sincerest appreciation and thanks to Mr. Joe Fallon who found this package and ensured that it was safely transmitted to the Athlone office.  The school has been notified that the work for all its candidates is now in the Department's examination centre, and the Department has reassured the school authorities that all candidates' material is secure and will be examined in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the leaving certificate examination is enormous in scale.  It involves over 60,000 candidates and the assessment of 700,000 scripts and practicals.</P>

      <P>It is sadly ironic that my constituency colleagues and I are forced to raise an issue relating to our constituency on a day on which the Minister, with much fanfare, presided over an announcement of 1,200 jobs in north Dublin in Gateway 2000 when within the next few days, our town will receive some very bad news.  Some might suggest that our economy is booming but they should check Dundalk.</P>
      <P>County Louth has a population of 90,000 of which 10,500 are unemployed. Neighbouring County Meath has a population of 120,000 and the unemployment figure for that area is 4,500. The unemployment rate in Dundalk alone is 4,700, way ahead of that of County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our deputy leader, Deputy O'Rourke, and I raised the issue of these two companies in January and I raised the general issue of unemployment in the greater Dundalk area on the Adjournment last week.  We warned in <Col N="880" /> January of the difficulties these companies were experiencing.  In view of the good news the Minister announced today in relation to Gateway 2000, I suggest that some consideration be given to those people who are, unfortunately, about to lose their jobs in the Dundalk area.  Perhaps they could have first preference of the new jobs or the Minister could use his influence with the Gateway 2000 company.</P>
    <P>Much attention was paid to the Dundalk area in the early 1990s.  We had new companies such as Quantum and AFL/Stribel but unfortunately the eye has been taken off the ball since.  I wonder why.  I am not just mentioning the Government in this respect.  I suggest that the Minister and his Government pay exactly the same attention to the Dundalk area as was paid to the Tallaght area.  I ask him to establish immediately a task force, similar to those in Tallaght and Galway, to oversee the horrendous unemployment in Dundalk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a few remarks about the serious escalating unemployment problem in Dundalk.  My constituency colleague has outlined the statistical position.  The recent announcement by Harris Corporation to lay off a significant number of staff and the rumours in relation the Keytronic Europe plant make difficult and dismal subjects for discussion in the town of Dundalk.  I am glad the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is here to take this motion. We would be delighted if he could tell us that he will be announcing a new industry for Dundalk to compensate for the job losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a perception that there is plenty of money in various funds for industrial development in the Border counties. Recently I spoke to officials in the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise and Employment about the peace initiative. It is depressing that money appears to be made available for everything other <Col N="881" /> than what should be a priority.  There is a serious deficiency in the industrial infrastructure of the Border counties and it is estimated that about £10 million would be required to develop that infrastructure from Louth to Donegal.</P>
    <P>Some months have passed since the Washington Conference but there is no tangible evidence of benefits arising from it.  There might be some in the pipeline but at present there is nothing tangible.  Perhaps the Minister would also refer to the political initiative being taken in America to provide special trade concessions for American companies in Northern Ireland and in the six counties south of the Border.  Clearly that would be beneficial to the industrial base.</P>

It has decided to ride every wind of public discontent, from the unfortunate peace process which is now stalled to the job situation in Dundalk.  Deputy Ahern, in particular, does not need to do that.  He should be above it.</P>
      <P>This is a total farce.  The matter was raised one week ago and there was an assurance from the Minister that he would do all in his power to alleviate the distress in Dundalk.  Happily, not all the news is gloomy as I hope the Minister will demonstrate when he makes an announcement at the weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for again giving me the opportunity to speak about the very important topic of employment in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>First, I wish to clarify the position in relation to the task force on industry adjustment.  Deputies will recall that I established this group last year to advise me on policy directions in respect of industrial adjustment and competitiveness issues, particularly in light of the needs of traditional sectors facing the winds of change.  This group comprised representatives from my Department, the industrial development agencies, the Labour Relations Commission and the social partners.</P>
      <P>Arising from the task force's deliberations, I launched last December a new EU-funded initiative designed to assist companies in traditional sectors of industry to adjust to increasingly demanding conditions of competition.  A support package will be available over the next four years to help companies implement change programmes that will result in an overall strengthening of the Irish manufacturing sector.  Total expenditure will amount to £17 million, of which 50 per cent will be provided under EU Structural Funds and the remaining 50 per cent by industry itself. The measure is designed to provide financial support and advice towards helping traditional manufacturing sectors adapt to increasing levels of competition.  Arising from the objective to help small and medium enterprise in traditional sectors, such as clothing, this programme is being administered by both Forbairt and Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>That was not adverted to by either Deputy but it was referred to in the initial adjournment matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Change programme is targeted at SMEs with 25-100 employees in traditional sectors who are <Col N="883" /> most in need of assistance.  Bigger companies are not eligible for support under this measure.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specifics of employment in Dundalk, I am aware that the companies referred to by the Deputies have been experiencing difficulties; we dealt with these in the House previously.  I assure the Deputies that the IDA is keeping in close touch with them and is doing everything possible to assist them.</P>
      <P>I will outline the present position in relation to both companies.  Keytronic has experienced difficulties in the marketplace over the last 12 months and is reviewing its business structure.  I expect this review to be completed very shortly and the company has confirmed to its workers that it will discuss the position with them in the first instance at the end of this week.  This is the correct approach by the company and, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>
      <P>The position in Harris Ireland is that the company placed some of its staff on a three day week in March 1996 as a result of a global downturn in the semiconductor industry.  Following a review of this system, the company returned to a five day week.  Unfortunately, this has resulted in the announcement of approximately 40 temporary layoffs. The company has indicated that when business picks up, the staff will be reemployed.  IDA Ireland is well aware of the difficulties within the semi-conductor sector and has recently been working with Harris in developing its R &amp; D facility for a new product line in Dundalk.  The manufacture of these new products, currently at the design stage, will enhance the plant's longer term outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to visit Dundalk on Thursday to have a meeting with the various agencies under the aegis of my Department. I am happy to extend an invitation to local Deputies to meet me on Thursday <Col N="884" /> evening.  I intend to impress on the agencies the urgency of promoting employment in Dundalk.  I am confident that additional jobs can be created in other investments in Dundalk and the pipeline of potential projects for the town is strong.</P>
    <P>The north-east region has a significant base of high technology companies which is a key factor in attracting overseas investors.  It is important that I again outline what is happening in the region.  There is an impressive array of over 40 overseas companies in Louth, including Quantum, ABB, AFL/Stribel and National Penn.  In addition, the announcement last November that American Power Corporation is to locate its uninterruptable power supplies project in Drogheda will result in a £14 million investment and will employ 300 people at full production.</P>
    <P>With regard to indigenous industry, Forbairt, through its north-east regional office, continues to actively promote the area for industrial development.  During my visit to Boston with Forbairt officers last November, for example, I announced three specific business partnerships between Irish and US companies, including one from County Louth. This was between Creative Media Training Services Limited in Drogheda and Paradign Inc. of Florida.  Forbairt is also working with Dundalk Regional Technical College in seeking to source potential technology based start-up companies.  In addition, I draw the Deputies' attention to the recent opening of Potato Cuisine Limited in Drogheda which will create over 60 jobs.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that both IDA Ireland and Forbairt will continue to build on the developments in Dundalk and County Louth which I have outlined.  Furthermore, the local employment service and the county enterprise board will play an active role in employment promotion in the area.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 May 1996.</P>

      <P>Work is currently in progress on the preparation of the 1996 annual school leavers' survey focusing on 1994-95 school leavers.  I am not, however, yet in a position to give any indications as to the outcome of that survey.  The 1995 ESRI annual school leavers' survey which focused on 1993-94 school leavers will be published very shortly and preliminary data from the survey indicates there has been a substantial decline in the number of leavers with no qualifications from a figure of 3,300 in 1992-93 to 2,200 in 1994-95.  The overall number of Youthreach places was increased to 2,000 at the end of 1994 and a further 450 places are being provided in the current year.  This will bring the total provision in the education sector to 2,450 places, and this is complemented by approximately 900 additional Foundation places funded by FÁS in community training workshops.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of educational policy is to encourage and facilitate students to continue in full-time education up to the end of senior cycle. As outlined in the White Paper on Education, the target is that the percentage of the 16-18 year old age group completing senior cycle will increase to at least 90 per cent by the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, since taking office, persistently pursued a range of strategies to reduce early school leaving including major curricular reform particularly in the senior cycle; increased <i>per capita</i> grants for disadvantaged schools; the free book <Col N="606" /> scheme for necessitous students; alleviation of examination fees for necessitous students; concessionary teaching posts; expansion of the home school community liaison scheme; links programmes between disadvantaged schools and third level institutions; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; increased investment in in-career training of teachers.</P>

      <P>The question of discontinuing the provision of temporary school buildings is not being considered by my Department at present.  Temporary accommodation is provided mainly as a result of a short-term increase in pupil enrolments or where it is evident that enrolments will decrease in the longer term despite a temporary shortage of classroom space.  In such circumstances, temporary accommodation in the form of prefabricated buildings is considerably less costly than the building of permanent classrooms.  Prefabricated accommodation can be provided at very short notice and it can also be transferred to alternative locations when it is no longer required at one particular school.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 40, 43, 50, 51, 54, 60, 66, 67, 70, 72 and 78 together.  The current quota of 800 for admissions to the Higher Diploma in Education was set on the basis of a recommendation by the Higher Education Authority.  The HEA's advice was based on recommendations of a working group composed of representatives of the universities, the Department of Education and the authority.  The working group took account of the best available data on the demand for second level teachers.  I do not propose to alter the quota for the 1996-97 academic year.  However, the working group will be reconvened shortly supported by an analyst and statistician to undertake an in-depth review of needs for second-level teachers, in total and to the extent feasible by subject grouping.  It will take account of any recent changes in the demand for second-level teachers.  The quota arrangements for 1997 will be determined in the light of the findings of the working group.  Deputies will also be aware that I announced last week I will be introducing a further post-graduate course for the training of primary teachers.  The present post-graduate course, which ends in June 1996, provided for 180 graduates.</P>

      <P>Since I took office, I have increased substantially the number of entrants into the colleges of education each year.  Furthermore, in January 1995, I introduced a special 18 months course for graduates for 180 students in the colleges of education. All this will mean that a total of over <Col N="610" /> 600 newly qualified teachers will be available for employment in schools this September, 335 more than last year.  The Deputy will no doubt be aware that I announced on last Tuesday that I intend to further significantly increase the intake to the colleges of education in September 1996, and that I will be introducing a new post-graduate course for training of primary teachers, commencing this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, I announced last week that the existing supply panel scheme will be extended in September 1996 by assigning a further 20 posts to the scheme.  This will increase the size of the panel to 50 posts.  It is widely acknowledged that the supply panel scheme, which I initiated in September 1993, is of immense value in assisting boards of management to recruit qualified replacement teachers to cover for colleagues on absences of short duration.</P>
      <P>The initiatives outlined above, together with the projected reduction in overall pupil enrolments at primary level &mdash; from over 478,000 at present to approximately 444,000 in 1998-99 a decrease of more than 34,000 &mdash; will ease the difficulties in September and will create a better balance between the supply and demand for teachers in subsequent years.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the present difficulties are of a temporary nature only.</P>

      <P>Allocations in respect of youth services for 1996 are currently being finalised in my Department.  The increased level of funding made available this year enables consideration of a number of initiatives, in addition to allowing some scope for increased <Col N="611" /> grant-in-aid to voluntary youth organisations under the youth service grant scheme.  Of particular concern in this regard is the possibility of developing additional community-based projects for young people in disadvantaged areas.  Other areas for consideration include enhancement of existing disadvantaged projects and extension and upgrading of the network of youth information centres.  I hope to be in a position to approve the allocations shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 38, 52, 138 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>History and geography is a core subject for junior certificate pupils in secondary schools.  It is not a core subject for pupils in vocational or community or comprehensive schools.  However, in 1995, history was provided in 200 of the 247 vocational schools and in 73 of the 76 community and comprehensive schools.  Geography was also provided in 200 of the vocational and in all community and comprehensive schools.  92 per cent of the junior certificate examination candidates presented for the history and geography examinations in June 1995.</P>
      <P>The White Paper <i>Charting Our Education Future</i> states that all students should have studied, by the end of junior cycle, seven broad areas which would include &ldquo;knowledge and appreciation of their social, cultural and physical heritage and environment&rdquo;.  That means an awareness and understanding of both history and geography by all students.  These are demanding objectives but they are enormously worthwhile.  The White Paper specifies that each student should study Irish, English, mathematics and science or a technological subject.  It also states that at least three further subjects from a range of full courses and short courses should be studied.  It will be necessary to ensure that our students achieve all that we wish without overloading the curriculum.  It raises a number of critical questions which need to be addressed.  These questions include: should the same set of subjects be compulsory for all students in all types of school, should students of varying abilities be required to take the same set of compulsory subjects, should compulsory subjects consist of a variety of full courses, short courses and modules, and how much flexibility should remain with schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the National Council for <Col N="613" /> Curriculum and Assessment, the curriculum advisory body to the Department of Education, to respond as a matter of priority to the debate on the issue of core subjects at junior certificate level.  I wish to state that no discussion has taken place, no decisions have been made and no instructions have been issued which will change the position of history and geography within the junior certificate curriculum at present.  I will not make any decisions until a full debate has taken place and until I have received the advice of the NCCA.  History is not a compulsory subject for the leaving certificate examination.</P>

      <P>The White Paper <i>Charting our Education Future</i> indicates that it is a major objective of the Government to promote equality of access to higher education, irrespective of social class, age or disability for all who have the capacity to benefit from it.</P>
      <P>The free fees initiatives and the third level student support schemes facilitate students with limited means who wish to progress to third level.  I consider that the abolition of undergraduate fees, in particular, will have very important material and psychological effects in encouraging greater equality in access.</P>
      <P>There is already evidence in the report for the Higher Education Authority by Professor Patrick Clancy entitled <i>Access to College: Patterns of Continuity and Change</i> that a significant reduction in inequality of participation at third level occurred between 1980 and 1992.  A reduction of 36 per cent has been calculated.</P>
      <P>Ensuring greater access to third level by students from disadvantaged backgrounds is not, therefore, solely a matter of costs at third level.  Fuller participation in third level depends on ensuring retention of students in full-time education up to the age of 18.  To achieve this I have taken a range of initiatives.</P>

A dialogue has been under way with the heads of the universities, in their personal capacities, since last summer.  A position paper on university legislation was published in November 1995 which set out my intentions in relation to university legislation.  All the responses provided have received careful consideration and have been very helpful in the preparation of the draft heads of legislation.  The Government has now approved the draft heads and the parliamentary draftsman is preparing a Bill.</P>
      <P>There are continuing contacts between officials of my Department and the universities in relation to this particular important policy development for higher education.

      <P>An industrial relations dispute has arisen in Trinity College, Dublin, which has been closely monitored by the Higher Education Authority and my Department.  Trinity College Students' Union wrote to me on 25 April 1996 requesting that the Department of Education immediately get involved in facilitating an end to the dispute.  Under the auspices of the informal industrial relations forum for agencies funded by the Higher Education Authority, officials from my Department have been involved in ongoing discussions with the Higher Education Authority and college management with a view to resolving the issues involved. I sympathise with the student union's concerns and my Department has been informed by college management that, in the event of the dispute continuing, every effort would be made to minimise disruption to students' examinations.</P>

    <P>Responsibility for the management of industrial relations and the administration of examinations in Trinity College clearly rests with the college authorities.

      <P>My Department has no plans at present to introduce Swedish as part of the curriculum of post-primary schools.  The position is that French, <Col N="624" /> German, Spanish and Italian are the modern European languages which are part of the curriculum of post-primary schools in Ireland.  My Department provides official syllabuses and related examinations in connection with these languages.</P>
      <P>Examinations in other languages of the European Union are provided from time to time but admission is restricted to native speakers of those languages. Written examinations at higher level only are provided.  Examinations in Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Modern Greek and Portuguese have been provided in this mode on request in recent years.</P>
      <P>A most important distinction has to be drawn between languages which are part of the school curriculum and other languages.  The courses and examinations in French, German, Spanish and Italian are provided on the basis that they are not the mother tongues of the vast majority of candidates and that they are being studied as second or additional languages.  The examinations in the other languages, such as Swedish, are of the candidate's mother language. The latter tests are not specific to any particular syllabus but are general tests related to the competence of the candidates in their first language.  The standard of language use is in general far more sophisticated than anything that could be expected of candidates who would have followed a school course in a foreign language.  In conducting examinations such as those in Swedish, the standards used are linked to international standards in mother-tongue competence rather than to our national standards in foreign language acquisition.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme was established in 1989 to cater for long-term unemployed people.  It was on this basis that EU Structural Funds support was obtained. The scheme was broadened in 1993 to include lone parents, disabled people and their spouses for whom adult dependant allowances under the relevant schemes are paid.  An overall quota of up to 10 per cent of places applies to these categories.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the VTOS is to provide a second-chance education opportunity to long-term unemployed persons who have demonstrated through the signing on process that they are unemployed and seeking employment and whose disadvantaged status is shown through a system of means testing.

      <P>Returns for the 1995-96 academic year, from the authorities of second-level schools, show that the transition year programme is being offered in 497 schools to a total of 24,036 students.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided that a six-year cycle of post-primary education would be made available for students commencing their post-primary cycle in 1991. Accordingly, a restructuring of the senior cycle programme began which gave a three year senior cycle option from September 1994 consisting of a one year transition year programme and a two-year leaving certificate programme with three orientations, the established leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for the authorities of individual schools to decide whether to offer the transition year programme.  In making <Col N="627" /> this choice, schools are subject to the same constraints as apply to their general curriculum choice.  Schools cannot always, for example, provide a range of curriculum or programme options to suit the wishes of every student.</P>
    <P>Each year, my Department issues a circular letter to school authorities, inviting those schools wishing to provide a transition year programme in the following academic year to register with the Department.  To date, 558 schools have indicated to my Department that they propose to provide the programme to a total of 28,162 pupils in the 1996-97 academic year.</P>

      <P>The organisation of the field work at a local level and the publication of the results at small area level for censuses of population are based on district electoral divisions-wards, which are defined for electoral purposes.  The definition of these areas and their naming are matters for the Minister for the Environment.  Statutory Instrument (S.I. No. 12 of 1986) made by the Minister for the Environment on 12 April 1986 resulted in extensive revisions to the DED-wards in the Dublin county borough area.

      <P>A jeep is a mechanically propelled vehicle designed, constructed and suitable for use on roads as currently defined in Section 21 (15) of the Finance Act, 1935.  There is no legislative provision which allows for the use of rebated diesel as motor fuel in such vehicles, including jeeps.  Accordingly the use of rebated fuel in a jeep, even when used exclusively for agricultural purposes is prohibited and any such use would constitute an offence under the above legislation.</P>
      <P>In the wider context, provision already exists for use of rebated oil for agricultural purposes which includes the use of marked gas oil in agricultural machinery and vehicles designed for agricultural use such as tractors.  As jeeps are designed for road use it would not be feasible to enforce any restriction of use of rebated oil to agricultural purposes and a relief of this nature would be open to widespread abuse.</P>

      <P>An undertaking was given in the 1994 <i>A Programme for Partnership Government</i> to review and assess the performance of section 35 film relief which was due to end in 1996.  As the Deputy is aware, an independent consultant was engaged to carry out an extensive study involving consultation with the various interested parties.  As a result of that review it was decided to renew this incentive for the film industry in a more targeted and focused manner.  The new section 35 relief is designed to reduce the overall cost of the relief to the Exchequer and encourage indigenous film making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main recommendations of the consultant's report was that the 100 per cent relief should be reduced to 80 per cent.  The reduction from 100 per cent to 80 per cent relief should be considered in the context of the change in the shareholding requirement from three years to one year.  As a result the annual percentage return on investment for the individual will increase, not <Col N="634" /> decrease and film investment remains an attractive investment opportunity.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the new section 35 relief has been structured to include elements favouring low budget productions.  For example, section 35 finance is permitted in respect of up to 60 per cent of the total cost for films with a budget of £4 million or less.  The permitted level of finance for productions over £4 million is 50 per cent with a sliding scale adjustment for films costing between £4 million and £5 million.  In addition, there is a new total corporate investment limit of up to £6 million in respect of which investment in any one film cannot exceed £2 million and the excess up to £6 million can only be invested in film projects with a budget of less than £4 million.  I do not intend to make any further changes to the structure of the new film relief.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that tax statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would enable the calculation of the proportion of the total public sector pay bill which returns to the Exchequer through direct and indirect taxation and social insurance.  Where superannuation payments are concerned, the 1996 Revised Estimates provide for nearly £77 million as appropriations-in-aid to the Exchequer in 1996 in respect of superannuation and pensions contributions by public servants.  However, this figure <Col N="636" /> does not reflect the full level of contributions made by public servants, e.g. in the health sector, contributions are retained by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The most recent OECD data on public sector employment as a percentage of total employment relates to 1994, and is set out in the following table. However, this data is not strictly comparable as definitions vary from state to state.</P>
      <P>The table sets out the proportion of earnings paid in income tax and employees' social security contributions at the income level of an average production worker in each OECD country in 1994, the most recent year for which such data is available.</P>
      <P>Headage payments and set-aside payments form part of a farmer's income for tax purposes.  All other agricultural income also forms part of a farmer's income unless it is specifically exempted in the taxes Acts, e.g. the exemptions provided for in section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969, which deals with profits from the occupation of certain lands and exempts from income tax the profits arising from stallion stud fees and from the occupation of commercially managed woodlands.</P>
      <P>Expenses in respect of the management of set-aside land are allowable as a deduction against the set-aside payments &mdash; management rules for set-aside land are published by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>Withholding tax is not deducted from either headage payments or set-aside payments.  However, tax clearance procedures are applied to the payment of certain payments, e.g. headage payments in excess of £500.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 95, and 96 together.</P>
      <P>On the basis that the 20 per cent rate would apply to the first £2,000/£4,000 etc., of the existing 27 per cent rate band, the estimated full-year cost arising from the changes mentioned by the Deputy are as follows:</P>

    <P>If, however, the existing 27 per cent band of £9,400 single and £18,800 married were to apply in addition to the 20 per cent bands described above, the cost would be substantially higher, at least £200 million and up to £450 million extra.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that, unlike other tax regimes where an introductory rate of 20 per cent applies, there are substantial income tax exemption limits in the Irish tax system which effectively remove many low income earners from the tax net, thereby reducing the necessity for, and the impact of, a low rate starter tax band.</P>

      <Quest>the exemptions, if any, currently in force for cross-Border workers; and the plans, if any, he has to alter the status of Government workers.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9635/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A cross-Border worker to whom the Deputy refers may either be a resident of the State for tax purposes who works in Northern Ireland or the reverse.  As regards both the above categories, their taxation is governed by the domestic laws of each jurisdiction and by the Ireland-UK Double Taxation Convention.  Exemption from taxation in one or other jurisdiction may occur in the following circumstances: where a person is present in the other state for a period not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days <Col N="655" /> in the fiscal year concerned; and where a person is paid by the State or a local authority thereof for services rendered in the discharge of functions of a governmental nature.  In all other cases, the income from the employment will be taxable in both jurisdictions. However, the country of residence will grant a credit for the tax paid on the income in the other state.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, early in 1995 I established a special interdepartmental committee, made up of officials from my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, to look at the issues involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers resident in the State and working in Northern Ireland.  The committee reported to me in January of this year and made a number of recommendations on what action should be followed regarding the tax treatment of cross-Border workers.</P>
      <P>One of the main findings of the committee was that the treatment of cross-Border workers for the purposes of income tax is fair and reasonable <i>visá-vis</i> other Irish taxpayers.  However, the committee did recommend that cross-Border workers should be exempted from paying the 1.25 per cent health contribution and the 1 per cent employment and training levy on their Northern Irish income.</P>
      <P>Having studied and accepted the findings of the committee, I announced on budget day that from 6 April the Northern Irish earnings of cross-Border workers will be exempted from the payment of the health and employment and training levies.  For a person with a yearly earnings of £15,000, the saving from this exemption which is now in force is £337.50 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 18 of the Ireland-UK Double Taxation Treaty relates to the taxation of Government workers.  The interdepartmental committee recommended that the relevant authorities should try to resolve the differences of opinion which exist as respects the categories of workers covered by the Government services article.  I understand that there <Col N="656" /> have been recent negotiations between the Irish and UK Revenue authorities for the purpose of reviewing the article in light of recent judicial decisions which affect it.  It is not possible at this stage to say what the outcome of the discussions will be.</P>

      <P>There are no international agreements, EU Directives, international treaties or other such agreements, within the remmit of my Department, which are yet to be ratified or signed by Ireland.</P>
      <P>The following is the position of the Revenue Commissioners which is an agency under the aegis of my Department.  The OECD Council of European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters, which entered into force on 1 April this year, has not yet been signed or ratified by Ireland.  To date, only four EU member states and two other countries have ratified this convention.  Given the wide-ranging scope of the convention and the legal and administrative requirements that have to be provided for before signature by Ireland would be possible, there are no immediate plans for accession to the convention.  The convention on the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises was signed on 21 December 1995 and it is hoped to have it ratified by the end of 1996.</P>

    <P>The Convention on Temporary Admissions (done at Istanbul, 26 June 1990) was signed by Ireland on 28 June 1990 and ratification was approved by <Col N="657" /> the Government on 27 July 1993. However, there is agreement at EU level that instruments of ratification should be lodged at the same time by all the member states.  Ireland will complete the ratification process as soon as all the other member states are ready to do so.</P>
    <P>A Memorandum for Government requesting the authority to arrange for accession by Ireland to the Covention of Customs Treatment of Pool Containers used in International Transport which was done at Geneva on 21 January 1994, is currently in preparation.</P>
    <P>The Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes that is, the CIS Convention was signed by Ireland on 26 July 1995.  In order to ratify the convention, it may be necessary to introduce legislation to give effect to one of its provisions; this issue is currently being considered in conjunction with the Attorney General's Office.</P>
    <P>The agreement on the provisional application between member states of the EU of the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs purposes was signed at the same time as the CIS Convention, which is mentioned above, and domestic legislation may, in this case also, be required before ratification can take place.</P>
    <P>A draft of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ireland regarding Mutual Assistance between their Customs Administrations was initialled on 22 February 1996 and it is anticipated that signature will take place later this year.  A draft memorandum for Government, seeking approval for signature, has been circulated to relevant Departments and Offices for clearance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are the details of EU directives, regulations and conventions, in respect of which my Department has responsibility, which have not yet been transposed into or made part of Irish law, and the timescale for the completion of the work in respect of each instrument.</P>
      <P>Directive 95/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amends Directives 77/780/EEC and 89/646/EEC in the field of credit institutions, Directives 73/239/EEC and 92/49/EEC in the field of non-life insurance, Directives 79/267/EEC and 92/96/EEC in the field of life assurance, Directive 93/22/EEC in the field of investment firms and Directive 85/661/EEC in the field of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), with a view to reinforcing prudential supervision.  The Department of Finance is drafting regulations to transpose the above directive in so far as it relates to credit institutions and investment firms. The directive must be transposed by 18 July 1996.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Council Directive 94/74/EC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty was due for implementation on 30 June 1995.  The main provisions of the Directive were implemented in the Finance Act, 1995 (sections 99 to 102).  The remaining applicable provisions are to be implemented by regulation very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only outstanding issue in relation to direct taxes is the ratification of the Convention on the accession of the <Col N="662" /> Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises.  The convention was signed on 21 December 1995 and it is hoped to have it ratified by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>The Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes, that is, CIS Convention was signed by Ireland on 26 July 1995.  In order to ratify the convention, it may be necessary to introduce domestic legislation to give effect to one of its provisions; this issue is currently being considered in conjuction with the Attorney General's Office.  It is not yet possible to give a timescale for ratification.  The intention, however, is that it should be ratified as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on the provisional application between certain member states of the EU of the Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs purposes was signed at the same time as the CIS Convention which is mentioned above, and domestic legislation may, in this case also, be required before ratification can take place.  Until the matter has been clarified with the Attorney General's Office, no deadline for ratification may be set.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome is made usually on the basis of new onset of fatigue, a characteristic pattern of symptoms, including those psychiatric illness, and the exclusion of other illness.  The treatment for the condition is non-specific and is aimed at alleviating symptoms and helping patients to adjust to the chronic nature of the illness.</P>
      <P>I am glad to report that awareness of ME is increasing among practitioners and the general population through such useful initiatives as ME awareness week.  As agreed at a meeting with the ME Trust last year, my Department gave detailed information on ME provided by the ME Trust to the Irish College of General Practitioners for circulation to its members.  Greater awareness of the condition should lead to faster diagnosis and more effective treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is significant international research being carried out in relation to the problems involving a wide range of disciplines which reflects the multi-factorial nature of the illness and the difficulty in identifying a cause for it.  My <Col N="670" /> Department does not directly grant aid individual research projects.  The agency established for this purpose is the health research board which has an open application policy regarding applications for research funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The 1996 allocation for Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, which is the only hospice service directly funded by my Department, is £5.964 million.  St. Francis Hospice, Raheny, which is funded through the Eastern Health Board by my Department, will receive an allocation of £950,000.</P>
      <P>Funding for other hospice services is channelled through the local health boards and discussions between my officials and the health boards regarding their allocations for their 1996 overall service-development plans were recently completed.  Details of 1996 funding for in-patient hospice services notified to my Department are set out in the following schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in some instances health boards do not specifically allocate funds towards hospice in-patient care but make resources available in respect of this form of care within the overall budgetary allocations <Col N="671" /> of acute and long-stay hospitals in their region for the provision of this service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Policy Agreement for a Government of Renewal (PAGR) noted that Sellafield poses a serious and continuing threat to the health and safety of Irish people.  Other hazards include the ever increasing traffic on the Irish Sea and the number of aging nuclear reactors on the west coast of Britain and Europe.  The agreement sets out a series of actions which the Government is pursuing in relation to Sellafield.</P>
      <P>As these proposals relate to a number of different Departments, a Ministerial Group on Sellafield and the Irish Sea was established under my chairmanship in April 1995 to co-ordinate action on these matters.  The Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications, Foreign Affairs, the Marine and the Taoiseach are represented at Minister of State level.  In addition, senior officials from these Departments and the Department of the Environment attend the meetings, as do senior representatives of the Attorney General's office, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has met on three occasions to date and its work is to co-ordinate and monitor measures in pursuit of the relevant PAGR commitments.  In addition, the group provides a forum to review and agree strategy in relation to <Col N="675" /> developments generally on nuclear matters including accidents and nuclear testing.</P>
    <P>The group is also supervising the investigation of options open to Ireland as a non-nuclear country to do everything possible to ensure that the Irish population and environment are not unduly exposed to nuclear risks and to strive in the international arena for reduced dependence on nuclear, both as an energy source and as a military deterrent.  The situation in relation to the key issues within the co-ordinating remit of the group is as follows.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has written on several occasions to the UK Minister for Energy and to the Secretary of State for the Environment outlining in the strongest terms the very deep concerns of the Irish Government about the adequacy of safety in the UK's nuclear industry, including concerns about the safety and reliability of the UK's aging Magnox reactors.  At a recent meeting with the British Ambassador, the Minister expressed grave concern about the number of incidents which had occurred in the recent past at Sellafield and other aspects of the British nuclear industry including in particular the ongoing pollution of the Irish Sea which is unacceptable; the Nirex proposals for an underground nuclear dump near the Sellafield complex; the continued operation of Magnox reactors beyond their design life and the need for their decommissioning, as well as concerns about the safety implications of privatising the British nuclear industry.  He also arranged to have the matter raised at the next Ireland-UK meeting of the contact group on nuclear safety matters.</P>
    <P>The Government is opposed to the proposed NIREX nuclear waste facility near Sellafield and in January 1996 the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications presented a submission, on behalf of the Government, to the Public Enquiry in the UK which is investigating a preliminary proposal in this regard.  The <Col N="676" /> Government's concerns, as outlined at the inquiry, centre on the proximity of Sellafield to the Irish Sea, the uncertainties about the geological and hydrogeological nature of the area and doubts about whether the building of a radioactive waste repository near the marine environment was compatible with the UK's commitments under EU and international law.  The Irish delegation called on the inquiry to recommend against the NIREX proposal and suggested that the choice of location was being influenced not so much by nuclear safety, radiation protection or environmental matters, as by cost and transport factors and a degree of acceptability of the nuclear industry and its ancillary operations on the part of the local population in Cumbria.</P>
    <P>Shipments of plutonium and spent nuclear fuel are governed by the requirements of the International Maritime organisation Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuels known as the INF Code.  This code is considered by Ireland to be deficient in a number of very important respects and many of the basic requirements for dangerous cargoes, from which nuclear fuels are exempt, are absent from the INF Code.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine raised these deficiencies at a recent meeting of the International Maritime Organisations (IMO) and secured agreement to the Irish resolution instructing the IMO's Marine Safety Committee (MSC) and the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) to consider extending the INF code to include the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash; route planning</P>
    <P>&mdash; notification to the coastal state</P>
    <P>&mdash; marking of flasks</P>
    <P>&mdash; protection and salvage plans in the event of emergencies</P>
    <P>&mdash; the designation of sensitive areas in which nuclear shipments must not take place.</P>
    <P>At the request of the ministerial group, the Attorney General, with the <Col N="677" /> assistance of the Departments concerned, is conducting a further assessment of the possibilities for legal action against the Sellafield-THORP facilities. The options being considered include possible recourse to arbitration under the existing Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources as well as possible scope in this regard under the more recent OSPAR Convention which Ireland will ratify shortly.  The Government remains committed to legal action against Sellafield if a sustainable case for it can be shown to exist based on sufficient evidence of environmental or public health impact.</P>
    <P>The Government's concerns about the incident at the Wylfa Magnox reactor in 1993, its potential seriousness and the failure of Nuclear Electric to react promptly have been conveyed by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication to the UK Minister for Industry and Energy and the Secretary of State for the Environment.  The Minister also questioned the reliability of the Wylfa plant and similar Magnox reactors operating in the UK and called on the UK authorities to phase out all such reactors as soon as practicable, in the interests of public safety and environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has consistently used all appropriate and available opportunities both bilateral and multilateral, including meetings within the framework of the EU and UN to raise the issue of French nuclear testing.</P>
    <P>The possibility of a review and update of the Euratom Treaty, which governs EU policy in relation to nuclear issues, so as to place greater emphasis on health, safety and environmental aspects has been raised by Ireland in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference which is considering amendments to the treaties of the Union.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment, I avail of all appropriate opportunities to promote the Government's concerns about the risk to the environment from nuclear installations.  I did so at the EU <Col N="678" /> Environment Council on 6 October 1995 and at the ECE Ministerial Conference, Environment for Europe, held in Sofia from 23 to 25 October.  On these occasions, I emphasised that risk of nuclear accidents is rightly perceived by the European public as a leading environmental concern but that current policies were not sufficiently responding to this concern by proper application of the precautionary and other environmental principles now well established for non-nuclear activities.</P>
    <P>The work of the group is supported by officials of each of the Departments and agencies represented, while secretarial support is provided by officials of my Department across a range of grades, as part of their general duties relating to environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The group will continue its role in ensuring good co-ordination of strategy on nuclear matters and in overseeing the work of Departments in response to the relevant provisions of the PAGR.</P>

      <P>During the adjournment debate of 5 March 1996, Deputy Martin stated that he had evidence that my Department had received a letter from the management of St. Mary's school in October 1995 at the same time as my office received a letter from a group of parents.  I asked for an immediate <Col N="690" /> search of my Department, a search which failed to find any such letter.</P>
      <P>Following an inquiry with the school authorities, a copy of the letter was sent to the Deputy chief inspector of my Department by the principal of St. Mary's on 14 March.  This was in turn sent to the examinations branch, which conducted a further search.  On 20 March the letter was found to be in the possession of the senior officer who had mislaid other papers.  I referred to these papers in my reply to the priority question on 28 March 1996.</P>

    <P>At a case conference in November 1995, the health authorities undertook to provide a residential placement for this child early in 1996.

      <P>The level of grant payments to schools is periodically the subject of representations and letters received.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have secured substantial increases in the level of capitation grant at primary level since taking office.  The standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from £28 in 1992, £33 in 1993, £38 in 1994, £40 in 1995 to £45 in 1996.  This amounts to a total increase of over 60 per cent for the period in question.  Furthermore, I have introduced special higher rates of grant for schools serving areas which are designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that some schools are experiencing financial difficulties, I am satisfied that these increases represent a positive step towards improving the financial position of primary schools and are a considerable achievement in light of the tight budgetary situation.  The Deputy may be assured that the funding of primary education is the subject of ongoing review by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also fully aware of the ongoing demands for increased funding by second level schools.  However, the Deputy will agree that there have been <Col N="711" /> significant increases in the level of funding to second level schools over recent years.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 the level of capitation paid to voluntary secondary schools has increased from £150 in 1992, £158 in 1994, £165 in 1995 and £177 in 1996, an 18 per cent increase over the period.  In addition, an additional capitation grant of £15 per pupil payable to schools designated as disadvantaged was introduced from January 1994.  This additional grant was increased to £30 from January 1996.</P>
    <P>Corresponding increases have also been made to the budgets of the vocational education committees and community and comprehensive schools. In addition, substantial support has been provided towards the provision of secretarial and caretaking services at both primary and second level.</P>

      <P>A grant of £1.5 million was allocated to Westmeath County Council, towards the cost of providing a regional sports centre in Athlone under this Department's major sports capital programme and the announcement of the grant was made by the then Minister for Education Deputy Mary O'Rourke, in March 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> Planning for the project is being undertaken by a design team, commissioned by Athlone Urban District Council, as client for the project, in consultation with my Department.</P>
    <P>The original brief for this project included a multi-purpose indoor sports hall and outdoor playing pitches.  Following a planning process by the local authority it was agreed in 1990, in consultation with my Department, to invite proposals for the project from the private sector on the basis of a design, construct, finance and manage package. Only one private sector proposal was received and this was subsequently found to be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Due to the length of time which had elapsed since the initial grant allocation Athlone UDC undertook a feasibility study which concluded that the project should comprise a new 25 metre swimming pool to replace the existing swimming pool which was built in the late 1970s in view of the fact that a multi-purpose indoor sports hall had, in the meantime, been provided by my Department in the Athlone regional technical college.</P>
    <P>This revised brief, including the outdoor pitches, was agreed with Athlone UDC in late 1994 and my Department confirmed that the grant of £1.5 million was still available for the project.  In April 1995 Athlone UDC submitted drawings and a cost plan for the project which indicated a total estimated cost of £3.5 million and an additional grant of £1 million was sought.</P>
    <P>Provision has recently been made in the context of the 1996 funding arrangements for the major facilities scheme to increase the grant for this project by £1 million which increases the total grant to £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>My Department is in communication with Athlone UDC to progress the project through the remaining planning stages with a view to construction of the regional sports centre at the earliest possible date.</P>

The strength of Rathdrum Garda station was increased by one garda in February 1996 bringing it to its current strength of one sergeant and three gardaí.  The patrol car allocated to Rathdrum station is utilised in patrolling the sub-district including the Glendalough area.  Policing of the area is augmented as required by personnel from the adjoining stations of Roundwood, Avoca and Aughrim.  Attention is also paid to the area by the divisional traffic corps and detective unit patrols from Wicklow Garda station.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to establish local Garda authorities as described by the Deputy. However, it has always been the policy of my Department and the Garda authorities to encourage all law abiding and responsible citizens to assist <Col N="724" /> the gardaí in law enforcement.  To achieve that, there is a central section at the DMA headquarters, Harcourt Square, which has responsibility for the implementation of the juvenile liasion officer scheme, overseeing neighbourhood watch, community alert schemes and business watch, development of the schools programme, community/neighbourhood policing, crime prevention initiatives and the crimeline programme.  All of these programmes are based on the concept of the gardaí and the community working together to prevent and detect crime. Staff attached to the community relations section are involved in community relations work and give talks to and attend meetings with residents associations, community groups, schools, clubs etc.</P>
      <P>Last October, I announced some new structures to fight the drugs problem. Among these was the introduction of drugs strategy teams in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, which could include, for example, representatives of the gardaí, the probation and welfare service, the health boards, the Department of Education, local authorities as well as the local community. These teams will assess the drugs problem in these urban areas and draw up action plans to deal with the problem, having regard to local circumstances. When these teams are fully operational local community representatives will have a vital say in the strategies to be followed.</P>
      <P>I will continue to initiate, encourage and support all programmes that aid the local community to assist the Garda in the performance of their duties.</P>

      <P>All murders are fully investigated by the Garda and every possible effort is made to bring the prepetrators to justice.  In this regard, the Garda allocate optimum resources to the investigation of all murders.  The primary task, of course, is to identify those responsible and to assemble evidence to support the institution of legal proceedings.  In addition, special attention is also directed to the motivation involved.</P>
      <P>Crimes of this nature are investigated by divisional investigation teams, the membership of which includes detective gardaí who have been trained in the investigation of serious crime.  The gardaí involved in these investigations know the local community and they work in close proximity to sources of intelligence.  The divisional investigation teams are assisted by gardaí from the garda technical bureau who provide specialised services such as ballistics, photography and fingerprints.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing assistance to the divisional units, the serious crime squad at the central detective unit has the task of gathering intelligence and information on all serious crime.  Every effort is made in the examination and collation of this material to establish if the crimes are linked in any way.  This includes, in the case of murder, trying to establish if there is a common perpetrator for two or more offences.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that maximum resources are deployed to solve all murder cases including the identification of possible so-called contract killers.</P>

      <P>The review was undertaken in response to representations concerning the special scheme for optional contributions for share fishermen employed under a contract for service whose employment was ruled to be <i>ultra vires</i> the social welfare legislation regarding ordinary insurance under a High Court judgment in February 1992.</P>
      <P>As a result of the ruling, employment as a share fisherman is only insurable as a self-employed person.  The optional scheme was introduced in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1993, and provides cover for certain short-term benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia,</i> have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961. The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to self-employed persons in the same way it applies to all insured people. Accordingly, self-employed people, who become insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They are, of course covered for survivor's and orphan's pensions.</P>
      <P>However, self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributory for any period prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When social insurance was extended to the self-employed, detailed consideration was given by the Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  The net cost of paying old age <Col N="729" /> contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 was estimated at £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension was estimated at 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years' contributions to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on any basis, including a lump sum payment, would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> puts forward, <i>inter alia</i>, a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions, including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime.  However, it also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension be increased from 156 (three years) to 520 (ten years) contributions. The report and its recommendations are being studied within my Department at present.</P>
    <P>While I, in principle, favour a <i>pro-rata</i> pension approach, I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>

No. 241 of 1994) excluded CE scheme workers from being regarded as being engaged in remunerative full-time employment for FIS purposes.</P>
      <P>As the number of CE scheme workers who would qualify for FIS, in the event of FIS being extended to such workers, is not available, it is not possible to estimate the additional costs that would be involved in FIS payments.  In any event, I do not consider that FIS is an appropriate mechanism for improving the income of CE workers.  The level of allowance payable to these workers is a matter for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  As a general principle we should avoid where possible having one Department subsidising payments being made by another Government Department.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 206 and 207 together.</P>
      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme has been a major success since it was introduced in 1993.  The scheme has grown considerably since then and last year over 15,800 students participated. It has proved to be of significant benefit to local communities and voluntary groups while providing valuable work experience for the students at the same time.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the scheme is to provide income support for the less well-of third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and unable to obtain summer work.  The scheme was never intended for third level students who are entitled to claim unemployment assistance during the summer if they cannot find work.  Therefore, the question of what might or might not be more beneficial to the Exchequer does not arise.  To include such students would squeeze out the more needy students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> Taking account of the upward trend in the number of students participating in the scheme since its inception, priority this year is being given to enabling the maximum number of eligible students, who have no other means of support, to take part within the allocation for the 1996 scheme which is £10.2 million.  The main focus of the scheme this year therefore is to provide places for students who are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>As the person concerned will complete a course of studies at the regional technical college in Cork in June he is entitled to claim unemployment assistance if he cannot find work during the summer period.  For the reasons already stated his application for the scheme has therefore been rejected.</P>

      <P>The relevant Bill is currently with the parliamentary draftsman and I will be seeking Government approval to publish the Bill when it has been cleared by the draftsman and the advisory side of the Attorney General's Office.</P>

      <Quest>the concerns, if any, he has that there may be duplications of services between Forbairt, private laboratories and third-level institutions in this country.</Quest>

      <P>Forbairt was established in 1994 as an organisation devoted to the development of Irish industry.  In addition to its direct funding activities, Forbairt provides technology based services to clients on a fee paying basis.  Forbairt also administers and manages, on behalf of my Department's Office of Science and Technology, a wide range of EU programmes and works closely with third level institutions to enhance their linkages with Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment, Forbairt has commenced a fundamental review of all its programmes and services to ascertain <Col N="737" /> the existing and future demand for those services and how the demand can best be met.  In carrying out this review, Forbairt is concerned that any duplication of its services with services available elsewhere, where it is found to exist, is eliminated or minimised as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>A significant number of Forbairt's programmes and services have been in existence for many years.  In the case of its technology services, for example, many of them were initially developed over 20 years ago under the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, at a time when such services were not provided by the private sector.  These services have a major contribution to supporting Irish industry in its efforts to meet international standards and to comply with international best practice.</P>
    <P>While some of the reviews of Forbairt's services are still ongoing, a number have been completed and the recommendations are being implemented.  For example, as a result of a review of its environment programme, Forbairt has decided to concentrate its resources on a combination of awareness raising and training/education services, specialised consultancy and technical services, and advanced monitoring and analytical work.  These activities will take place within a very rapidly growing market environment and will ensure the best &ldquo;match&rdquo; between Forbairt's services and the needs of companies.  Forbairt has also decided to introduce an environmental audit service for companies which will be managed by Forbairt but carried out, to a significant degree, by private consultants.  As a result of other reviews, Forbairt may wind down services which it no longer needs to provide to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Forbairt both co-operates with the third level sector and facilitates co-operation between the sector and industry. The principle of minimising or preventing duplication also applies throughout this process.</P>

      <P>In 1992, a target to create 2,000 jobs in the teleservices sector by 1997 was set.  Already there are approximately 2,000 people employed in this sector.  Most of the jobs are in the Dublin area.  However, significant teleservices centres have also been located in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Dundalk and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>While the majority of the jobs have been provided by overseas companies assisted by IDA Ireland, Forbairt have also been working with Irish companies to develop an indigenous telemarketing sector and projects involving some 266 jobs have already been approved in Irish companies.  Ireland is well positioned for the future attraction of new teleservices jobs.  Negotiations are ongoing with new teleservicing companies and existing companies, already located here, wishing to add teleservice jobs to their facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current review of disadvantaged areas was initiated by the appointment of the Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The panel requested submissions from individuals and groups who wished to have their areas considered for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas.  A survey of all areas for which appeals were received was carried out in 1992, and the panel made recommendations on the basis of data returned by farmers <Col N="748" /> who were surveyed.  These recommendations were forwarded to the EU Commission in November 1993.  I am satisfied that the appeals panel, with support where necessary from my officials, carried out a thorough examination of all areas appealed, and that their recommendations covered all land which satisfied the Commission's criteria for designation of areas as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>After a lengthy and complicated series of technical negotiations with Commission Officials, agreement was finally reached in February 1996 on the areas to be designated as disadvantaged.  During this negotiation period, I had a number of meetings with Commissioner Fischler to ensure that there was no undue delay in reaching agreement.</P>
    <P>Following on from this agreement, the Commission had to prepare a dossier, in all the official languages, which was then issued to various Commission Services (Legal, Financial etc.) for observation and approval.  The submission is now with the Commission itself for approval and this is expected within the next week.</P>
    <P>Following Commission approval, the dossier will be presented to the Council of Ministers who will consult with the European Parliament before adopting the proposal.  This procedure will give legal effect to the designation of the new areas as less favoured.  However, I expect to be in a position to release details of the new areas once Commission approval has been received.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that once the areas were agreed with the Commission Services in February, the passage of the proposal was entirely a matter for internal Commission procedures and was completely outside my control or that of my officials.</P>

      <P>The Government has decided that the transport strategy recommended in the Final Report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative will provide the general policy framework for the future development of the transport system in the Greater Dublin Area.  The DTI strategy recommended the development of the existing rail service to Maynooth including doubling the track from Clonsilla to Maynooth.  The investment is being considered as part of the proposals for development of the mainline rail network with European Union assistance under the Cohesion Fund.  Earlier this year I approved the allocation of funding under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 for a package of investment in DART and other suburban rail services.  This included the reopening of Drumcondra station on the Maynooth line at a cost of approximately £1 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235, 236 and 237 together.  The Irish Energy Centre is a joint initiative of my Department and Forbairt, and was established under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, 1994-1999, to co-ordinate and deliver a range of energy conservation and efficiency measures, including the administration of a number of grant schemes.  The budget for the centre, over the Operational Programme period, is £21 million approximately and is made up of Exchequer and European regional development fund moneys.  The centre was built around the former energy programme structure and staffing in Forbairt, and eight additional staff have been hired on contract for the duration of the Operational Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no conflict between the activities of the Irish Energy Centre and the demand side management and energy efficiency promotional work of <Col N="755" /> the ESB.  Both organisations are represented on the Energy Advisory Board, whose role, <i>inter alia,</i> is to ensure that the activities of the main sectoral actors are mutually reinforcing and do not overlap.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 239 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of representations relating to the extension of the period of validity of the licences which issued to Glencar Explorations plc and Andaman Resources PLC.  The correspondents were opposed to the extension of the validity of the licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the issue of prospecting licences does not involve a right to mine any minerals.  The issue of mining is, in the first instance, a matter of land use policy for which I have no <Col N="756" /> responsibility.  Opposition to any particular project proposed is one for consideration in the context of the planning process, which as the Deputy will be aware, involves a comprehensive environmental impact assessment.  A State mining facility under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, which is required for mining development, can only issue when planning permission and other permits are in place.</P>
    <P>Renewal of the licences is still under consideration in my Department. However, I should point out that if licences in respect of which all financial and technical targets have been met are not renewed, it could possibly result in damages being claimed by the relevant companies.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to parts of the Westport electoral area being closed to mining under the Mayo County Development Plan.  I presume that the Deputy is referring to the County Development Plan adopted by Mayo County Council on 17 February, 1992 where it is stated in paragraph 3.6.1 that:</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Council that no development and/or works shall take place in relation to minerals (as defined by the Minerals Development Act, 1940, as amended) in the areas shown dotted on Map 10A.</P>
    <P>The area identified on the map covers some 300 square miles of the Westport electoral area.</P>
    <P>If this is the issue referred to by the Deputy, I am advised that in the judgment given by Judge Blayney in the High Court on 13 November 1992 he said that the county council had no power to prohibit such development. The companies concerned have given notice of their intention to claim against Mayo County Council for damages as a result of the council's action.</P>
    <P>Essentially, what is at issue in the case of prospecting is the identification of any mineral deposits together with an assessment of the size, quality and commercial viability of extracting those deposits at a future date.  As I have stated, the issue of mining any deposit <Col N="757" /> discovered is one to be dealt with, <i>inter alia,</i> under the planning process.  I trust that this explains the situation for the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the licensed cable television provider for Cork city uses a system which effectively precludes the full use of modern video recording equipment, charges over £60 per annum for a decoder which is necessary to make even minimal use of video recorders and declines to provide any television channel, including RTÉ, in stereo sound; and if he has satisfied himself that such a service is of a similar standard to that provided by other service providers and is in accordance with the licence issued by his Department.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork Communications Limited have, for a number of years, been encoding all channels on their cable system, except for RTE 1 and Network 2.  Subscribers require a decoder to view coded channels, and this is provided by the company, and the cost is covered by the ordinary rental charge.  Coding was introduced primarily to prevent piracy, which, apart from the effects on business, interferes with the service to legitimate subscribers.  I recognise that it would be preferable if basic services were not coded.  If a service provider decides to use an encoded system, I expect that it will be done in a way that will not degrade the facilities offered to viewers in the original broadcast signal.</P>
      <P>The problem is that, generally, only one channel at a time can be decoded by the appliance provided.  This is also true of MMDS and satellite TV decoders.  This does not preclude the use of video recorders &mdash; there is no problem viewing and recording the same channel in the ordinary way. However, one coded channel cannot be videotaped while another is being watched.  RTE channels, however, are not coded and so a coded channel can be taped while an RTE channel is being watched or vice versa.  To use two scrambled channels simultaneously an extra decoder and output are necessary, and these are available from the company for a charge of £60 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the availability of stereo TV, I understand that Cork Communications Limited are installing equipment to transmit RTE in stereo to their cable subscribers.  In fact, RTE 1 has provided a stereo service in the Cork area only recently, and service will <Col N="759" /> be available on Network 2 before the end of next year.  It seems, unfortunately, that the decoders currently used in Cork do not allow stereo on coded channels, even when it is already broadcast.</P>
    <P>In the light of these limitations, I would expect the company concerned to look at ways of modifying their system so that their customers can enjoy the full range of services that are open to users of other systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 244 together.</P>
      <P>I have gone on record before to indicate that the Government has encouraged and will continue to encourage Aer Lingus to develop appropriate strategic alliances with other airlines as part of its overall development strategy, where they are judged to be in the best interests of the airline and the economic development of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent agreement between Aer Lingus and Delta whereby Aer Lingus have joined Delta Airline's &ldquo;Worldwide Partners&rdquo; programme is not an equity based agreement.  It is more in the nature of a co-operative marketing arrangement and is in line with Aer Lingus transatlantic strategy which <Col N="760" /> seeks to ensure a strong year round service for business and leisure passengers on a commercially viable basis.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the agreement are: Delta will block book seats on the daily Aer Lingus Dublin-New York and Shannon-New York services in both directions; these flights will operate as code-sharing flights i.e. each flight will be shown separately as a Delta and an Aer Lingus flight on reservations systems; Delta will code-share from beyond points in the US which they serve i.e. 246 cities; joint co-operations on frequent flyer/Tab programmes and further discussions to share certain services e.g. handling, maintenance etc. are ongoing.</P>
    <P>While the issue of code-sharing between Irish and US carriers on Ireland-US services is not specifically addressed by the Ireland_US bilateral Air Services Agreement, the Delta/Aer Lingus arrangement has been approved by both the Irish and US authorities on the basis of comity and reciprocity.  I believe that the nature of the agreement is consistent with the aims of the bilateral Air Transport Agreement and with Irish aviation policy generally.  The new agreement will have benefits for both airlines and consumers.  From an Aer Lingus perspective the agreement will serve to underpin the year round viability of its transatlantic services in the coming years, will give access to Delta's US-wide network and marketing infrastructure and offer further potential financial benefits through sharing of services.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the detail of such an alliance between specific air carriers is commercially sensitive by its nature and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on such detail. In approving this type of alliance, my main consideration relates to the broad strategic and regulatory issues.  It is neither necessary or appropriate for me or my Department to involve ourselves in the detailed working arrangements between the two airlines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>National waters are not currently used by States as a basis for the compilation <Col N="768" /> of fisheries statistics or stock assessments.  Ireland compiles sea fishery statistics in respect of Irish fishing vessels and landings by foreign vessels into Irish ports, based on the statistical areas defined by the International Counil for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).  The Irish EEZ including the Irish Box is encompassed within ICES Areas VI and VII.</P>
      <P>The ICES areas are designed to reflect the actual distribution of fisheries resources and do not correspond to national waters or zones of economic interest.  The basis therefore for firm statistics on the value and volume of total catches in Irish waters in the format sought by the Deputy is not currently available.</P>
      <P>I am arranging for our own landing statistics 1986-1995 to be forwarded to the Deputy.  The statistics give the volume and value, of landings by Irish fishing vessels into both domestic and foreign ports.  In 1995 catches landed by Irish boats was 387,822 tonnes valued at £129 million.</P>
      <P>While details of the volume of landings of each of the member states are available monthly from the European Commission, information relating to the value of landings is not published by the EU and would have to be requested from each member state on an individual basis.  It is clear that there is still much to be done to establish a reliable common data base for all aspects of fisheries including catches, landings and sales.  A comprehensive statistical basis is needed at EU level to fully inform decision making and analysis and I hope to achieve progress during the Irish presidency towards this essential objective.</P>

    <P>Notwithstanding the present statistical difficulties, the Department has made an estimate of the total value of catches in the Irish EEZ which is calculated to be of the order of IR£700 million.  This estimate is based on assumptions made about the percentage of each fleet's catch in ICES areas VI and VII which can be attributed to the Irish <Col N="769" /> EEZ and also on the basis of: the number of vessels of all member states fishing in Ireland's EEZ; the percentage of allocated quotas which each State takes while fishing in our EEZ; the non-quota stocks taken in our waters; the catch per unit effort for the various fleets and the information obtained from inspections of log books and landing declarations of vessels fishing in the Irish EEZ.</P>

      <P>A firm commitment to put in place a system of monitoring and management of the Beaufort's Dyke dumpsite was secured by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, at a recent meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Scottish Office, Lord Lindsay and Secretary of State for Defence, Lord Howe in London.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that the Scottish Office would undertake a new study on the Beaufort Dyke munitions dumpsite in order to re-map and re-chart the extent of the dumpsite and the distribution of munitions within the site.  It was also agreed that UK and Irish scientists would co-operate on the methodology and methods of analysis for the study and they will jointly review the data emerging.  UK scientists and scientists from the Marine Institute have been in discussion in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study will take place in three phases.  The first phase was completed in March; the second and third phases will take place during April/May and July respectively.  UK scientists and scientists from the Marine Institute will <Col N="770" /> be liaising during the period of the study.</P>
    <P>When the 1996 study of the Beaufort Dyke dumpsite is completed there will be a further meeting in Dublin with the two UK Ministers to assess the results and to discuss what further steps are required at that stage.</P>

      <P>Preparations are under way for the completion of an environmental quality status report (QSR) for the entire area covered by the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) to which Ireland is a party.  For the purpose of the report the convention area has been divided into five sub-regions. Ireland and the UK are responsible for the preparation of the report in respect of Region III which includes the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, the area to the west of Ireland and the area to the west of Scotland.</P>
      <P>Overall responsibility for the preparation of the report in respect of Region III including the synthesis of Irish and UK contributions, has been assigned to a joint Irish/UK Regional Task Team (RTT) that will meet periodically to review progress.  Ireland is represented on this team by officials from the Departments of the Marine and Environment and the Marine Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish contribution to the QSR is being co-ordinated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Departments of the Environment and the Marine.  For <Col N="771" /> this purpose, arrangements are in place to establish a national QSR Office, consisting of a core group of scientists.  The national team will commence operation in July.  Work is on target to have the report in respect of Region III completed in time for the year 2,000 deadline.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Terms of Reference</i>
    </P>
    <P>The QSR will consist of: a compilation of existing knowledge of the area; an evaluation of this information in relation to agreed criteria of environmental quality and a statement of the prevailing condition of the area.</P>
    <P>The report will cover all relevant fields of natural science (e.g. geography, human activities, physical hydrography, climatology, marine chemistry and marine biology) on coastal zones, near-shore and off-shore areas.</P>
    <P>The structure, scope and content of the QSR will be largely in accordance with the United Nations Guidelines for the Marine Environment Assessments taking into account the OSPAR Joint Monitoring and Assessment Programme and related guidance from appropriate OSPAR working groups.</P>

      <P>The International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF) is a worldwide intergovernmental organisation which was set up for the purpose of providing compensation for oil pollution damage resulting from oil spills from tankers. The IOPCF operates within the framework of two international Conventions namely the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC Convention) and the 1971 International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (Fund Convention).  Ireland ratified these two conventions by way of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>The CLC Convention deals with the liability of ship owners for oil pollution damage.  This convention lays down the principle of strict liability for ship-owners and creates a system of cumpulsory liability insurance.  The shipowner is normally entitled to limit his liability to an amount which is linked to the tonnage of his ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fund Convention, which is supplementary to the CLC Convention establishes a system of compensation for victims when the compensation <Col N="773" /> under the CLC Convention is inadequate.  In cases where the polluter cannot be identified but where it is clear that the pollution has been caused by a tanker, the IOPCF will pay compensation.</P>
    <P>A special office has been set up at Milford Haven to process all claims for damages resulting from the <i>Sea Empress</i> incident.  Claims are being examined jointly by officials from the IOPCF and insurers of the <i>Sea Empress.</i> Indications are that total claims will amount to £60 million.  Irish local authorities will be claiming between £120,000 and £150,000 in respect of clean-up of beaches.  The claim, which is being co-ordinated by Wexford County Council, is being formulated and will be submitted to the special claims office shortly.  Indications from the executive of the IOPCF are that all claims will be met in full by the insurers and any deficit will be met from the IOPCF.</P>

      <P>I am advised that when it was noticed that the crewman concerned was missing at about 23.15 p.m. on the evening of 19 September 1994, an initial search of the vessel was undertaken by the <Col N="774" /> crew at the direction of the Master.  The vessel departed from Pembroke at 2.45 a.m. on 20 September, and the view on board at that stage was that the individual was still on board.  A second fuller and more complete search of the vessel was subsequently undertaken, which proved to be unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>Following the docking of the vessel at Rosslare, the disappearance of the person was reported to the Garda in Wexford who, in turn, notified the Police at Pembroke.</P>
      <P>The coastguard at Milford Haven in Wales initiated a sea and air search at first light which was terminated later the same afternoon without success, having failed to locate the missing person.</P>
      <P>Investigations into the disappearance of an individual in these circumstances are the exclusive responsibility of the Garda authorities, whose investigations I understand are still ongoing.</P>
