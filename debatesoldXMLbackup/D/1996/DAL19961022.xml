      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether it is appropriate that a former public servant (details supplied) should continue to represent Ireland on the European Commission for Democracy through Law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was nominated as an independent expert to the European Commission for Democracy through Law on its establishment in May 1990 by the then Taoiseach on the recommendation of the then Attorney General.  He was renominated by my immediate predecessor in March 1994 for a further four year period.  His term of office is due to end in May 1998.  He serves in a personal, not a representative, capacity.</P>
      <P>The Commission meets four or five times a year, usually for two days on each occasion.  The person concerned receives no payment from the Exchequer or otherwise for his work at or in preparation for the meetings, but is refunded normal travel and subsistence expenses by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe has made it clear that it does not favour member governments replacing their independent experts in mid-term.  None of the almost 50 member governments now involved has ever done so.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that this Commission is purely a body of independent legal experts.  The President of the Commission, in July 1995, in requesting that the person concerned continue his functions as a member, stated that he has been most active and valuable.  In all the circumstances, it is not considered appropriate or proper that he should be removed from the position to which he was appointed as an independent expert.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach happy that this person, given the circumstances surrounding his resignation from the public service, should continue to represent this country, albeit in an independent capacity, as the Government's nominee on this body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not represent the Government on the body and he does not represent the Irish people either.  He is an independent expert serving a European cause and, while each member government is invited to nominate individuals to serve, once they are appointed they no longer serve at the behest of the government of the country in question in the same way, for example, Commissioners of the European Commission cease to serve the interests of any one country once they have been appointed.  The same principle applies here; once they are appointed they serve the interests of Europe as a whole.  In the immediate aftermath of the retirement in question, we were specifically asked by the Council of Europe not to interrupt this person's service during his term.  I have in my possession a letter addressed to the Government by the relevant people in the Council of Europe specifically requesting that this service be not interrupted.  I have already made the point that there has not been an interruption of the service of any member of this body from any of the 50 countries since it came into existence in 1990, notwithstanding that some of the independent legal experts are former ministers and former parliamentarians and changes of government may have occurred in those countries in the meantime. None of the 50 countries, however, has interrupted the service during term of the relevant legal experts because they are considered, once appointed, to be acting in an independent capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach told the House on 30 May 1995 &ldquo;We got a clear admission of error on Mr. Russell's behalf&rdquo;.  When I first became aware of this matter from a journalist with the <i>Sunday Independent</i> I felt it was very offensive and highly inappropriate that this person, who got £138,000 in a lump sum and £35,000 in an annual pension from this State should continue to represent this State in any official capacity, as I believe he is doing.  Since the Government nominated him, the Government can remove him.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to do that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe his service should be interrupted, for the reasons I have given.  He is appointed as an independent legal expert.  Many of those involved in this body are former politicians and none of the 50 countries, despite the fact that changes in Government have occurred in virtually all of them since 1990, has removed its independent legal expert in mid-term. We were specifically requested by the Council of Europe not to do so.  While there are and were concerns at the way in which the Attorney General's office was administered, there has not been a questioning of the legal competence of the person in question.  The issue has been fully debated here and judgements have been made on all sides of this House about the individual in question that he would not welcome.  They were made nonetheless.  No great service is performed by further pursuit of this matter in view of the fact that the person is receiving no payment for this work, merely travel and subsistence expenses for work which is independent of his previous service.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to an unnamed source in a newspaper story. I cannot speculate as to who that source may have been.  I know the person is described as &ldquo;senior&rdquo;.  That is the only clue.  I would not want to be any more specific than that.  I take only one Sunday newspaper.  I have no comment on that.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach replied to Deputy Harney, he stated he had correspondence from officials in the Council of Europe recommending that this person be retained in his present position.  Does the Taoiseach accept that may be part of the old boys' network, or wheels within wheels?  Does he accept that this was an arranged correspondence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if a body of the repute of the Council of Europe would allow <Col N="684" /> any correspondence to go out in its name that did not represent the considered opinion of the relevant body concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>How many reports have we received from the European Commission for Democracy through Law and what exactly do they report on?  What work is involved in it? Knowing the incidents in this House, democracy was not enhanced by some of the advice from law officers of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be partisan but one of my predecessors, Deputy Haughey, appointed the man in question to the body in 1990.  Another of my predecessors, Deputy Reynolds, reappointed him.  These two predecessors both belong to the Deputy's party and both had sufficient belief in the man in question to nominate him on the advice of the Attorney General.  It is not appropriate, for reasons already given, that his term of office be interrupted in mid-term.  He has been appointed as an independent expert and, once appointed, serves the interests of Europe as a whole rather than Ireland's interests.  His responsibility is to the Council of Europe through the European Commission for Democracy through Law.  He does not have a reporting relationship to the Irish Government while on this body.</P>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a detailed outline of the work of the European Commission for Democracy through Law at present but if a separate question is put, the information can be obtained.  This body was established because of the need for expert assistance at a time when democracy under law was being extended in eastern Europe in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall.  It was felt that the Council of Europe, expanding its membership to include eastern European countries, should provide assistance on legal and parliamentary systems to those countries.  This body was established as a small but important part of the overall work of the Council of Europe in promoting democracy through law in eastern Europe.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept, in the interests of accountability and as a gesture <Col N="685" /> to the victims of Fr. Brendan Smyth who got nothing for what they suffered, that this man should not continue to represent Ireland in any capacity at home or abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained to the Deputy, this man does not represent Ireland or the Irish Government.  He is on this body as an independent legal expert.  The only role the Irish Government has in this matter is that of nominating him.</P>

      <P>He was nominated by my predecessor, Deputy Haughey, in a Government of which the Deputy's party was part.  That was in 1990.  He was renominated by my immediate predecessor, Deputy Reynolds.  Both of them obviously felt he had the relevant legal competence.</P>
      <P>There is little to be gained from the pursuit engaged in by the Deputy.  The person is no longer in the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overseas tourism and travel statistics published by the Central Statistics Office are based primarily on two very large sample surveys of passengers carried out at the major air and sea ports.  The surveys cover about 322,000 inward and 374,000 outward passengers on an annual basis and are used in conjunction with total passenger movement figures supplied by the transport companies to provide estimates of all visits and related expenditure by overseas visitors to Ireland and Irish visitors abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new EU Directive 95/57/EC which was adopted on 23 November 1995 will require the introduction of additional statistical inquiries to measure both the capacity and utilisation of tourism accommodation in Ireland as well as the demand for both domestic and outbound tourism. <Col N="686" /> In this regard, two new surveys are being developed by the Central Statistics Office for introduction in 1997.  The methodology of the existing surveys will not be affected by this additional work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a distinction made between visitors and tourists by the Central Statistics Office? Are people who enter and leave the country on the same day included in the visitor figures?  In view of the importance of tourism to the economy, will the Minister agree that there is a need for accurate estimates of the number of tourists who visit the country as distinct from visitors who arrive and leave on the same day, and as distinct from people visiting friends and relations, of which this country has an exceptionally high number? The new phenomenon of regional airports means that there are people in the Minister's constituency who reside in Mayo but who travel to work in London on a Sunday night and return on a Thursday or Friday.  Is it true that those people are also included in the figures?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The overseas tourism and travel statistics published by the Central Statistics Office are based, first, on the returns from transport companies which give the total passenger movement by route of travel, second on the &ldquo;country of residence&rdquo; survey which is used to estimate the distribution by country of residence for each route &mdash; this survey covered 185,000 inward and 209,000 outward passengers in 1995 and the &ldquo;passenger card inquiry&rdquo; which is used to estimate for various areas of residence, for example, the reason for the journey, the length of stay, expenditure and fare costs.  This last survey covered 137,000 inward and 165,000 outward passengers in 1995.</P>
      <P>These three sources are then combined to provide quarterly and annual estimates of the number of visits to Ireland by persons who are usually resident overseas and the number of visits abroad by Irish residents.  Information is provided on the reason for the journey, the length of stay and related expenditure for both categories.  In particular, it should be noted that the respondent selects from a four-way classification for the reason for the journey which distinguishes clearly whether he or she is here for business purposes, as a tourist, to visit relatives or, last but not least, for a variety of other reasons under the heading &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A visitor must be here for a minimum of 24 hours and less than one year to be categorised as a tourist.  In relation to the gross number of people travelling inwards and outwards, a reasonable cross-section is surveyed.  I am not here to defend Bord Fáilte, but when the two sets of statistics are compared, there is little difference <Col N="687" /> between them, even though Bord Fáilte uses a different methodology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to the distinction between visitors and tourists.  A person coming home at weekends from a job in London would turn up as 50 visits under the terms of the Central Statistics Office calculations.  Such visits are subsequently counted as visits by tourists, giving an inflated estimate of the number of tourists who come here.  Given that tourism is such a valuable industry, it is important that we should have accurate figures.  Countries outside Europe where tourism is important calculate their tourist numbers on information supplied by incoming and outgoing visitors, no matter what the purpose of their visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey is carried out on a random cross-sectional basis.  Questionnaires are handed out on a random basis to 322,000 inward and 374,000 outward passengers on an annual basis to arrive at a reasonable estimate of inward and outward movements, and the results are reasonably accurate.  When these figures and Bord Fáilte's figures are compared, there is very little difference between them.</P>
      <P>A new survey will come on stream in 1997 as a result of an EU directive.  A sample number of households will be surveyed on a quarterly basis, commencing in January 1997.  A questionnaire will be used to conduct a survey of all trips away from home, including all holiday, business and other trips involving stays abroad, and will gather the following information: details of household numbers, the number of participants, particulars of each overnight trip &mdash; time, duration etc., country, region, purpose of trip, main type of accommodation used, main mode of transport, organisation of trip, expenses incurred and a survey of accommodation establishments.  From the point of view of honing and refining the figures, this will add to the body of information available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that the turning point in tourism here was in 1987 when the Fianna Fáil Government gave priority to it?  The full report shows that visitor numbers increased by 135 per cent from 1.8 million to 4.2 million while overseas tourists, using the narrower definition in the report, have quadrupled from 640,000 in 1986 to 2.3 million.  Will the Minister of State agree that since the ceasefire in the North we have had a 16 per cent growth in the number of tourists and that this has been the result of the successful policies pursued by Fianna Fáil Government?</P>

      <P>The Task Force on funding arrangements in the Border region made a number of recommendations to ensure that people are generally aware of the programmes available in the region and to make it as clear and simple as possible for people to apply for funding.</P>
      <P>A pre-application form is being prepared for use in local offices.  A guide to sources of funding and a newsletter will also be published.  The newsletter will include information on projects from all the programmes in the region.</P>
      <P>These recommendations which were agreed by Government, are now being put in place by the Department of Finance.  A seminar on all funding programmes in the region is being organised so that people working on individual programmes are aware of and will be able to advise on the programmes available.</P>
      <P>The task force will monitor the implementation of these measures and make regular reports to the Government.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of Stateaccept that after six months a report of 26 pages containing two recommendations is unacceptable?  One recommendation is that there should be no integration of the multiplicity of agencies in the Border region.  The other recommendation is that more information should be made available, which will consist of a newletter and, as the Minister of State informed the House today, a seminar.  There is a multiplicity of agencies and more are to follow.  This morning saw the launch of a new regional authority, the Irish Central Border Area Network.  Does the Minister of State not accept that the Border counties are entitled to something more than the two recommendations in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is not confined to two recommendations.  The task force was established as a result of a parliamentary question from the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Leonard, last February.  It started its work immediately and reported to the Government in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that there should be a one-stop-shop, the Deputy cannot have it every way.  I cannot see how simply setting up one office in a location along the Border could service the greater Border area.  One cannot call for more information and greater dissemination of information <Col N="689" /> on the one hand and, on the other hand, demand that it all happen in one location.  We are trying to ensure that all offices along the Border will be adequately equipped so that callers will be given clear information about the range of funds, options and projects available.  I agree there are many.  It is important that staff are fully briefed with the relevant information to ensure they are up to date on programmes when a person calls to the offices.</P>
    <P>With regard to streamlining the programme, a pre-application form has been introduced.  When a person calls to an office with that form it will be immediately possible for the member of staff to see which is the appropriate fund or agency to deal with the person's specific problem.  We are trying to demystify the programmes available by giving a greater body of information to staff in existing offices to ensure that people calling to the offices will be channelled in the right direction in terms of going to the appropriate agency and making the appropriate application for the scheme or project they have in mind.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the serious concern among people who might avail of the funding?  A large amount of funding is available thanks to the Fianna Fáil Party and its leader, who negotiated the programme for peace and reconciliation.  However, when the programme was introduced it took the Government 18 months to prepare the facilities to implement it.  Is the Minister of State aware of the concern among different agencies who could benefit from the funding about the difficulties they have encountered? It is not sufficient to say that a preliminary form will channel them in the right way. There is a need for closer integration and I would have thought a committee chaired by a Minister would have seen that and would have made such a recommendation.</P>

      <P>With regard to the amount of money spent and in the context of the disbursement of political credit, it is worth looking at the figures for 1994-95.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry received £88 million, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, £16 million; the Department of Education £34 million; the Department of Enterprise and Employment, £52 million; the Department of the Environment, £102 million; FÁS, £90 million; local development, £5 million; the Department of the Marine, £4 million; the Department of Tourism and Trade, £10 million; the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, £31 million; INTERREG, £7.4 million; the programme for peace and reconciliation, £140 million; and the International Fund for Ireland received £6 million for the Border regions.  There is a total of £451,931,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the task force nor the Government is in a position to change how the money is spent under the various funding programmes.  The <Col N="690" /> arrangements for putting these funds in place were agreed with the European Commission and the agreement of the Commission would be required if it were thought necessary to change the implementing structures or the agencies.  We do not have the discretion the Deputy envisages in this area.</P>

      <P>What was the cost of the report of the task force?  Could the Minister of State name its members?  Were any local authority officials on the task force?  Did the task force seek submissions from the public or from Members of the Oireachtas?  I was not contacted by anybody on the task force for my opinion and I doubt that any other Member of the House was asked for their opinion.  I am glad the Minister of State gave credit to a Member on this side of the House for the genesis of the task force.  Deputy Leonard's question prompted the Taoiseach to establish it.

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report shows that the overall cost of the property portfolio has not been monitored in a systematic way and that there were weaknesses in the structures for the implementation of policy.  Compared to a commercially run operation there has been a negative return on the portfolio over the past 30 years of £56 million accounted for in explicit subsidy and £377 million in a short fall in receipts compared to that necessary to yield a commercial return.</P>
      <P>Reasons include low occupancy, low rental income, high maintenance and a broad geographic spread throughout the regions.  Some of the costs involved are a direct consequence of the development role that the property portfolio is designed to achieve in terms of employment generation and regional dispersion.  However, the report demonstrates that the incurring of these costs was not sufficiently linked to policy objectives. To put it in context the scale of the negative return over 30 years represents 10 per cent of the accumulated grant payments at current prices by the industrial agencies.  However, grant supported manufacturing and international services employment now stands at 257,000, generating £16.4 billion annual spending in the economy.  This puts the figures in context.</P>
      <P>The Forfás report provides a very valuable basis for setting new policy directions.  I have made the following decisions to sharpen the focus in this area.  IDA Ireland is responsible for the property portfolio since January, 1996; the private sector will, from now on, have a lead role for the future in the provision of industrial buildings; existing properties will be offered for sale, using commercial criteria, to sitting tenants; if sitting tenants are not in a position to purchase in the short to medium term then the property will be offered for sale to third party investors, individually or as part of a portfolio; for vacant properties, where there is a low expectation of occupancy by incoming investment, IDA Ireland will examine other potential employment uses of such buildings, up to and including sale.</P>
      <P>This new approach will release taxpayers' resources currently tied up in buildings for other, more productive uses.  Furthermore, it has the advantage of strengthening industrial development through companies putting down deeper roots in the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Property will remain an important instrument in competing for foreign direct investment and in regional development.  Our industrial property needs can best be provided by partnerships between the IDA, the private sector and local authorities.  The more tightly run property management function now being put in place will ensure that this policy instrument is most efficiently used for development purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main feature of the report relates to the identification of current best practice in supplying and managing industrial property <i>vis-á-vis</i> our competitor countries.  There are no specific implications <Col N="695" /> from it for locations outside large urban areas.</P>
    <P>In this context, I have asked IDA Ireland to work in partnership with local authorities and the private sector to ensure the provision of suitable sites across the country for industrial development. The primary objective is to ensure that serviced sites are available so that we continue to be highly competitive in the attraction of foreign investment and to achieve a balanced regional spread, thereby providing local employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I will ensure that such sites are aggressively marketed to provide locally based employment opportunities and contribute to the Government's objective of achieving balanced regional development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing primarily with buildings but each case will be decided on its merits. The IDA could retain some of the ground rights and sell the building.  If the site is part of an industrial estate the IDA, in managing the overall estate, will obviously maintain certain interests even if it decides to sell individual lots.  This is an issue for the IDA to decide as it executes its broad policy directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not make myself clear.  Will the IDA sell its portfolio of land as distinct from its portfolio of land with buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of buildings with sitting tenants, it is proposed to invite the sitting tenants to purchase the property they occupy.  If they decline the IDA will consider selling it to those interested in managing it.  In such cases the IDA will decide whether to sell the building only or the entire site.  A specific model is not being advocated by the IDA and each case will be decided on its merits.</P>
      <P>The central thrust is that the IDA, as a huge landlord for sitting tenants, does not serve a great interest in industrial development.  It is, therefore, better for it to withdraw, so to speak, from being a landlord and to concentrate on the more important role of identifying those areas where property will be needed in the future to meet growing needs and on how it can promote regional development by using its resources and how, in conjunction with local authorities and private investors, it can develop the necessary plants and advance factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the cyclical nature of this issue.  During the bad old days there was not a shortage of advance factories, many of which fell into partial ruin or were vandalised, thereby causing further headaches.  We do not want to return to those days but in many <Col N="696" /> areas outside Dublin, Cork and Limerick there is a shortage of IDA owned serviced sites which can be offered as a carrot to foreign industrialists to set up here.  Whereas there was an oversupply of sites 20 years ago there is a shortage of decent serviced sites in the ownership of the IDA which could be offered to incoming industrialists and which would enhance regional development, which is the remit of the IDA, as distinct from urban development.  Smaller rural towns, particularly in the west, midlands and south, will lose out if the IDA does not maintain a supply of decent serviced sites.  It is up to the Minister to make a positive rather than a negative statement on this matter.  Will the Minister consider making a positive statement in this regard, thereby giving the green light to more widely dispersed urban and rural industrial development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of regional development is very much part of the IDA's remit and it uses its portfolio sites as part of this. The report found the IDA had a good supply of sites but pointed out that it must always be attentive to new opportunities.  I know from comments made by her outside the House, the Deputy is genuinely concerned rural areas might lose out. However, I am satisfied this will not be the case and there are many examples to back this up. These include the SRAM factory in Carrick-on-Suir which was developed by a private developer and the developments in Letterkenny, Mitchelstown, Waterford and Carlow.  These developments are increasingly backed by the BES concession available for advance factories outside Dublin.  I am satisfied the partnership between the IDA, local authorities which have a very important role to play in ensuring site availability, and private developers is a good mix which will ensure the even spread the Deputy is eager to see.</P>

      <Quest>the industries he had in mind when he told the media on his return from a recent trip to the United States that companies were in danger; the changes, if any, he has made to improve his Department's early warning system for companies in difficulty and the employment protection unit of his Department; and the number of firms with which the unit is currently working.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now operating in a competitive global market where products have life cycles and certain industrial processes become uncompetitive as technology migrates to the emerging low-wage economies.  Accordingly, in a dynamic, open economy, companies must constantly review their products and processes and be prepared to restructure and retrain in response to global competitive pressures.  In certain cases it is regrettable but inevitable that closures or <Col N="697" /> scaling back will result from addressing the effects of the global marketplace.</P>
      <P>My recent trip to the US demonstrated strongly to me that companies must be truly global in their approach.  In this context, they plan the location and restructuring of production to maintain a cost advantage over their competitors.  Failure by firms to do so will inevitably lead to their demise. Ireland is gaining from the process of globalisation as very many companies have recognised the competitive advantage of Irish skills and our business environment.  However, there will also inevitably be certain job losses in this global restructuring process.</P>
      <P>Information about individual firms in difficulty or likely to be in difficulty is both sensitive and confidential and it could be potentially damaging if it were to be publicised.  For that reason it would not be desirable or prudent of me to mention specifically the cases I had in mind following my comments on my recent trip to the United States.</P>
      <P>As regards the early warning system in my Department, it has been improved by introducing a more systematic review of problem cases where the State bodies consider there is a particular risk to the maintenance of jobs or the continuance of the business.  The Deputy can rest assured that every effort is made to identify and help firms to take remedial action where that is possible with a view to improving competitiveness and maintaining employment to the maximum levels possible. There are some 24 firms included on the early warning system operated by my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department, including its employment protection unit, plays a central role in co-ordinating and overseeing the early warning process.  There is a close working relationship with State agencies and other interests involved with a view to ensuring that any assistance possible is made available in the most effective and efficient way.</P>
      <P>It should be recognised that, despite the best endeavours of my Department and State agencies, responsibility in the final analysis for decisions on employment, and their timing, rests with the companies.  Furthermore, it must be understood that the best early warning system will not in itself save companies in light of my earlier comments on competitiveness.  A realistic approach to rescue activities has to be taken by the industrial development agencies.</P>

I agree it would be insensitive to give the names of the firms.  However, when he returned he brought the situation into the open by saying on television that many firms faced closure or rundown.  He invited comment and queries on the matter.  In an already dismal situation where a firm faced closure it was highly insensitive and inappropriate to spread the load of shame and <Col N="698" /> blame by talking about other firms also facing disaster.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the early warning protection unit within the Department is now dealing with 24 firms.  Can the Minister explain how this works?  I dealt with it for a short time and am interested to know.  Who triggers the early warning system and what is their aim?</P>

      <P>It was not insensitive to refer to the fact that closures continue to occur.  At the time we were dealing with particular closures, for example, Semperit, Tambrands and Scheisser. There was natural interest in all of those instances.  I was asked how these circumstances developed and whether it is a feature of industrial development.  It is a feature of industrial development and the Deputy knows that.  Twenty four firms notified us of their difficulties through early warning out of 6,500 or more firms on the Forbairt and IDA lists.  This is not a big problem.  It is an ongoing situation with which we always deal. Redundancies are running about 5,000 lower than they were two years ago.  We have a good record in maintaining a low level of job loss.  Nonetheless, we must be attentive and have an effective early warning system.  The system works well.  A high level group of senior executives from the agencies work with officials in my Department who respond to the early warning reports and act accordingly.</P>

      <P>Job start, launched at the end of May, was introduced by the Government as one of the measures to combat the difficulties faced by the long-term unemployed in getting back to work.</P>
      <P>Under the Job start programme employers are encouraged to look positively at hiring an unemployed person by providing a direct cash subsidy. Employers are paid a recruitment subsidy of £80 per week for one year when filling new or existing vacancies with persons who are unemployed for more than three years.  Also, workers employed under Job start may retain eligibility for secondary social welfare benefits subject to an income limit of £250 per week.</P>
      <P>As Job start has only been in existence for a short time, it is too early to make any pronouncement on its success or otherwise.  Past experience has shown that recruitment incentives require a lead-in time before becoming established.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with the initial take up, and I have arranged to have steps taken to raise the profile of Job start and improve the promotion of the scheme by actions such as: radio advertising at peak times; targeted newspaper and business magazine advertising; high profile regional launches with attached publicity.  For example, on 29 September 1996, I relaunched the programme for Dublin north at a breakfast briefing with business people and FÁS personnel taking opportunities to address local business associations.</P>
      <P>Last week I had discussions with the various employer organisations, including IBEC, ISME and the SFA, and with ICTU and the INOU, to discuss how best they could assist in promoting this programme.  All of these organisations reaffirmed their full support for the programme and agreed on a range of further measures to promote it.  The cost to date of additional promotions is £71,057.</P>
      <P>As of 11 October 1996, 346 jobs had been approved for Job start, with 222 participants recruited.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept this was one of the Government's central planks in their so-called &ldquo;pro jobs budget&rdquo;?  Does he agree that only £1 million was given for apparently 5,000 jobs which meant that from the beginning this scheme would be a disaster?  Does he accept there was never any intention to have 5,000 people recruited into this programme this year?  The Minister said 346 jobs had been approved for Job start.  Does he accept it is an expensive way to get 346 people back to work and that this disastrous scheme should be withdrawn?</P>

      <P>I answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; to all four of the Deputy's supplementaries.  I indicated repeatedly in the House, despite the Deputy's party's protestations that it would take time to build up this programme and the provision made was based on an assessment of how quickly we would build up to the ultimate target of 5,000.  There is difficulty in promoting a programme as a lead-in time is needed.  There is, and was, an absolute intention to make this scheme a success.  I have had discussions with John Lynch, Director General of FÁS who is confident FÁS will achieve its target of 1,200 to 1,400 on the scheme at the end of the year.  We will successfully build from this.  Any scheme like this takes a great deal of promotion. We have introduced a preference and allocated a subsidy for people who have not received good opportunities in the labour market, who employers typically pass over.  It will take time for that programme to succeed.  That has always been recognised by me and I have repeatedly said so in the House.</P>

I am encouraged that the labour force survey figures published earlier this year, indicated that the number of long-term unemployed declined by 25,000 last year.  We have been making an impact on the number of people unemployed for approximately one year, but we need a special scheme, such as this, to assist those who have been out of work for three years and for whom the probability of getting work is limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I refer to my reply to a related question by the Deputy on 25 September 1996, as reported in volume 469(1) at columns 435-438 of the Official Report, when I reiterated that the only investigation initiated by me in the case of the products concerned relates to the retail prices of magazines imported from the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>As regards magazines, I informed the Deputy in reply to Question No. 151 on 10 October 1996 that I had asked the Director of Consumer Affairs some months ago to undertake an investigation into the prices of magazines imported from the United Kingdom because of the widespread perception that the benefit of the appreciation of the Irish pound <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling was not being reflected in lower cover prices.</P>
      <P>On that occasion I enumerated the principal findings in the Director's report to me, which were that the two main importers-distributors determined the retail prices for such magazines on the basis of a variation of a formula first agreed by the National Prices Commission in 1983; in contrast to the inclusion of an &ldquo;uplift&rdquo; of 5 per cent agreed by the National Prices Commission, to compensate for the additional costs associated with the distribution of these magazines here, the distributors had in the meantime increased the uplift to 10 per cent; it was no longer valid for the distributors to rely on a formula which is 13 years old, and which had not been reviewed, to justify current prices; the operation of the complex formula operated by the distributors resulted in the retailers charging the same price, and newsagents are given a guaranteed margin on each magazine and do not compete on price.</P>
      <P>I also recalled the circumstances, arising from my consideration of the Director's findings and the outcome of consultations with the two main importers-distributors and retail newsagent interests, culminating in my decision to make a maximum prices order for imported magazines on 9 July 1996; the action by the principal distributor &mdash; which in an affidavit had claimed the order would result in an annual loss of profits of £1 million and the consequential loss of 200 jobs on the distribution side of their business &mdash; in conjunction with one of the retail newsagent interest, in applying to the High Court seeking an interlocutory injunction, before the order could take effect, and a judicial review; and that the legal advice available to me, was that I should revoke the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I revoked the order on 14 October 1996.  I have also arranged that the consultancy unit in my Department would undertake an investigation of the cost structure, both wholesale and retail, and operating margins for Irish as well as imported <Col N="702" /> magazines.  This investigation is now in progress and comprehends the practice by the distributors of imposing delivery charges, the distribution arrangements for such magazines and the extent to which they are connected with those for newspapers.</P>
    <P>May I draw the attention of the Deputy to the recommendation on page 10, paragraph 4.7 of the report by the Director of Consumer Affairs which states &ldquo;The Directors view is that there is enough to be concerned about in this matter to justify an investigation by the Director of Competition Enforcement...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Director of Competition Enforcement is now seized of the matter.</P>

      <P>It would be sexist if he did, but I am allowed to do so.  This matter has been dealt with in the House on a number of occasions and I acknowledge the manner in which the Minister of State was determined to take on the big players. He asked the Director of Consumer Affairs for a report, which he duly submitted.  On foot of that report the Minister of State made a maximum prices order and, following legal advice, revoked it.  That appears to be the position from his long reply.  The Minister of State claimed credit on many occasions for his predatory raids on cartels and, to ensure that consumers, who are being massively overcharged, pay the proper price for magazines, he made a maximum prices order.  Why did he revoke it? Does he still believe that consumers are being ripped off by a cartel?  The retailers are not to blame, they merely get stick from the consumers. Are consumers being ripped off and, if so, what does the Minister of State intend to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not impute words to me that I did not use.  The term &ldquo;rip off&rdquo; is peculiarly the Deputy's unique creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs recommended that the matter be referred to the Director of Competition Enforcement as soon as such an appointment was made.  The Deputy will be aware that legislation has since passed through the House and an announcement was made yesterday to appoint a Director of Competition Enforcement.  I am now in the process of referring the matter to him.  A formula was agreed between the National Prices Commission and the Department in 1983 which allowed an uplift of 5 per cent to compensate for what was seen to be peculiar about the distribution of magazines here. That 5 per cent became unilaterally 9.8 per cent and I made a maximum prices order to restore the 5 per cent formula agreed with the National Prices Commission.  One of the distributors concerned, <Col N="703" /> joined by one of the newsagent associations, challenged this by way of injunction of judicial review, if necessary.  On the basis of legal advice available to me I revoked the order.  The assertions in the affidavit of the distributor concerned claimed the order would result in an annual loss of £1 million in profits and 200 jobs and the report of the Director of Consumer Affairs did not contain economic data to challenge that.  The economic consultancy unit of the Department is carrying out a scientific comparable economic assessment of the matter, which I hope will be available within two months.</P>

      <P>The maximum prices order was made arising from the findings of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It was, however, challenged in court, which the distributor concerned was entitled to do.  Before the action came to hearing the legal advice available to me, based on the assertions in the affidavit which the report of the Director of Consumer Affairs did not rebut, was that it should be revoked.  The purpose of the assessment being carried out by the economic consultancy unit is to establish the facts in terms of either the implications of that decision or the price of British magazines here compared to the United Kingdom.  No such economic assessment has been done in recent years.  The Director of Consumer Affairs carried out a survey of the facts of the matter, but the economic basis asserted for the change in Eason's affidavit was not dealt with in the report of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>

      <P>In the uncomfortable radio interview between the Minister of State and Mr. Brian Farrell, which I was lucky enough to catch one Saturday morning, the point was made regarding costs that it is as far if not further from London to the Hebrides as it is from London to Dublin.  There is no satisfactory explanation as to how or why the Minister or others, and I rather suspect others, bowed to pressure from outside influences in making this extraordinary change from introducing a maximum prices order and then revoking it when the big boys barked.  Was the same legal advice not available to the Minister when he introduced the maximum prices order as when he revoked it?

Claims have been thrown around like confetti at a wedding about the extent to which, to use one of Deputy O'Rourke's terms, the consumer is being fleeced. If the consumer is being fleeced as alleged, and I have an open mind on it, then the economic evaluation will bear that out.  I can assure the Deputy that I will deal with that when it comes in.</P>

      <Quest>if he will appoint an official from the insurance division of his Department to investigate whether the current increase in the cost of motor insurance premiums is justified.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19159/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent announcement by Guardian PMPA Group that it will increase motor insurance premiums by 5 per cent on average with effect from 1 November 1996.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the Guardian PMPA Group cited deteriorating road accident statistics as a factor in its decision to increase premium rates.  The National Roads Authority report for 1995 indicates that road fatalities increased by 8 per cent over the 1994 figure.  As I have already recently indicated to the House, in a written reply on 25 September last, the further reported escalation of road accidents during 1996 has caused the motor insurance industry to anticipate a rise in the number and cost of claims and to make provision to meet this rising cost by increasing premiums.  The consistent view of the industry &mdash; and I am having this examined at the moment &mdash; is that the major factor driving up the cost of insurance claims, leading to premium increases for the motorist, is a rise in injuries resulting from drunken, careless driving or speeding.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the recently published Deloitte and Touche report on insurance where the consultants concluded, in relation to private motor insurance, that the key factors affecting the premium rates offered to Irish motorists are the individual driver's maturity and safety record, and that motor insurers in Ireland quote widely different premiums for similar risks.  The report also indicated that drivers with good claims experience have seen their insurance premiums reduced in real terms since 1990.  In this regard the Deputy may be aware of recent reductions to the order of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent announced by insurers during 1995 and early 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> My Department has no function in relation to prior approval or prior systematic notification of increases in motor insurance premium rates. There is no longer a statutory requirement on insurers to seek prior approval of such rates since the abolition of price control in 1986, nor are insurers required to justify increases to my Department.  Prior approval is now also prohibited under domestic insurance legislation (S.I. No. 359/1994) following the implementation of the Third Non-Life Insurance Framework Directive in 1994.</P>
    <P>It is a recognised principle on an EU-wide basis that, to meet stringent solvency and reserves requirements, insurance companies must be allowed freedom to set their insurance rates in the light of their underwriting experience without seeking prior approval from the supervisory authority. In this regard the motor insurance market in Ireland has suffered underwriting losses for many years, according to the industry.  For example, the underwriting losses for 1994 amounted to £47 million and while figures for 1995 are not yet finalised, it is anticipated that underwriting losses for 1995 will be of the same order.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy, however, that following implementation of the Insurance Undertakings Accounts Regulations earlier this year, the insurance annual report for 1995, will provide on a company by company basis details of attributable investment related to specific classes of insurance. This will enable my Department to examine for the first time the performance of individual insurers in terms of their overall profitability in the context of insurance premium levels.  The Deloitte and Touche report, in alluding to this matter, suggested that the supervisory authority might review the relevancy or the efficacy of taking into account investment income and its bearing on insurers underwriting targets and their consequent effects on insurance costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the large number of new cars on the road this year and last the incidence of accidents is high.  For that reason, should insurance not become more profitable? Some time ago I raised with the Minister of State the fact that certain companies are cherry picking business, yet the underwriting policies of many companies are not properly directed.  They are making substantial money in that area.  The Minister of State has a role to play in the domestic market where the 5 per cent increase has met with widespread resentment from the motoring public.  While it is easy to say that this is because of the high level of accidents, there are no statistics to back up that argument.  The Minister of State mentioned the maturity of drivers.  Can he provide evidence of the number of young drivers who have got into difficulties and as a result created substantial costs for the insurance industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, I draw Deputy O'Keeffe's attention to the fact that a separate question has been tabled for my attention from his colleague Deputy Callely.  My answer to that sets out statistics on the particular point he raises. Perhaps the Deputy can bear with me until we reach that question.  In any event, the figures will be distributed and I am afraid that in the case of young drivers they do reflect the pattern of claims.  That is a regrettable factor in terms of the Irish situation.</P>
      <P>The two main questions posed by Deputy O'Keeffe concerned safety and the fact that the economy is now performing so well that there are many new cars on the road.  I agree with the Deputy that one would have thought that should contribute to the level of road safety.  Nevertheless, figures quoted by the industry suggest the number of accidents has increased.  The Department has figures that support those claims only to some extent.  While figures we have received from the Garda authorities are not in alignment with the figures quoted by the industry, there has been, nonetheless, an increase in accidents on Irish roads.  That is a factor.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's third point concerned cherry picking.  I referred to the new regulation which requires more transparent presentation of figures than the global figure we received heretofore in the blue book.  Those figures, which will enable us to examine the issues by class of insurance and company by company, will prove to be illuminating. As regards the review now under way in my Department arising from the findings of Deloitte and Touche, there may be some salutary lessons for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent Deloitte and Touche report referred to the Canadian system of assessment for young drivers.  Does the Minister intend to implement that section of the report to assess young drivers as they are unfairly assessed? Three companies, the Guardian Royal, Guardian Insurance and PMPA, all part of the one organisation are competing for business.

      <P>I am close to Deputy O'Keeffe's assessment on this matter.  I am somewhat puzzled by it as it is difficult to understand commercially.

      <P>The &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; system that operates in the industry has aggravated the high cost of motor insurance and the increase in claims.  Can a regulation be put in place to <Col N="707" /> prevent that type of operation by the legal profession? There is a vague reference to that in the Deloitte and Touche report.  Does the Minister envisage that legislation could be introduced to outlaw the use of that type of system by the legal profession as it is affecting the insurance market, especially motor insurance where there has been an increase in claims?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I published the Deloitte and Touche report a number of weeks ago.  I apologise if a copy of it has not been furnished to him and I will correct that. The report deals with the point he raised, about the &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; phenomenon.  It did not find evidence internationally or domestically to justify that it contributes to the higher costs associated with insurance in Ireland.  It does not recommend that legislative action is warranted in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two legislative provisions to regulate financial intermediaries: the Insurance Act, 1989, which regulates the activities of insurance brokers, and the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, which regulates the activities of investment intermediaries or investment brokers.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the Insurance Act has worked reasonably well.  The Investment Intermediaries Act, which was only introduced in mid-1995, allowed my Department to take quick and effective action in relation to the activities of Mr. Tony Taylor and, in particular, to put in place mechanisms to protect existing investors' funds. Prior to the introduction of the Act last year no such action would have been possible.  I made a detailed statement on this to the House recently when I appeared before the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy which is investigating the affairs of the Taylor group of companies.</P>
      <P>My Department's authorised officers are continuing their investigations into the activities at the Taylor group of companies.  Clearly, the report of the authorised officers, when it becomes available, will provide important lessons for us in regard to the regulation of investment intermediaries. In addition, I have ordered a general review of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995 to see what improvements should or could be made to the approach to and method of regulation, and in particular with regard to self-regulation.</P>
      <P>The authorised officers' report and my Department's review will provide a clear guide for improving the regulation and supervision of both investment and insurance intermediaries.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister make inquiries about what I said and inform me of the outcome? I have been led to believe that the accountant auditor drew attention to serious irregularities that were not acted upon because of a breakdown in communications or whatever, but I accept what the Minister said.  I am not making an allegation. I have spoken to a person who knows a good deal about this.</P>
      <P>Unlike insurance houses which accept liability for the activities of their insurance brokers, that is not the case in regard to investment houses. Does the Minister propose to amend part of the 1995 Act, which has not been brought into effect, to ensure that investment houses are made as liable as insurance houses for the activities of their intermediaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in so far as section 28 (4) of the Investment Intermediaries Act provides the protection to which she referred.  It makes the producer company liable in the event of something like the Taylor affair happening.  It appears this was the subject of inadequate discussion in this and in the other House when my Ministerial colleague, Deputy Coveney, put through the Investment Intermediaries Bill. Trenchant representations about that section were made to him by Members of all parties.  As a result it has not been implemented and it is being considered as part of the review I ordered.  There are implications for the independent advisory sector that must be carefully examined.  One of the main complaints of the industry was that if a producer company or a fund manager in Britain, Ireland or elsewhere were to be made responsible for the activities of a broker and that broker could conduct business with impunity and would bear no element of the costs of mistakes, not to mention fraud, then, according to the submissions <Col N="709" /> made to him, it appears to most rational people that we would no longer have an independent advisory sector.  The companies would make their arrangements to sell directly to the marketplace and the role of the independent advisory sector would no longer be required.  There are some difficult questions that were not teased out sufficiently at that time and we are now considering them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the accountancy or legal professions which have a long tradition of self regulation, does the Minister of State accept that is not the case in this sector?  Does he consider self regulation is appropriate given what has happened or could happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from the tenor of remarks I made on this affair that I am sceptical about whether self regulation in the Irish context in this regard can be made to work in a fashion that will attract the confidence of the public.  There are serious questions about that because it did not work in the Taylor affair.  We received the first report from the liquidator yesterday and the authorised officer's report will not be available for some weeks.  I gave Deputy O'Rourke a date of end November at a meeting of the Select Committee.  Therefore it is somewhat early for me to be prescriptive on this issue. If we were to implement a self regulatory system which would be as stringent and rigorous as it appears all sides of this House require, there may be questions about the capacity of the present regulator to put such a system in place and fund it.  They will have to make up their minds on that. Discussions are taking place on a regular basis with the Department and sooner or later &mdash; it will be sooner if I have my way &mdash; they will have to state their position on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's doubts about self-regulation.  However, we have not fully explored how a proper statutory framework could regulate the selling of financial products. That is the difficulty as regards self-regulation.  In the Taylor case, although we are not dealing with that matter now, the IBA was not adequately informed about its duties under the self-regulatory framework and regulations were not put in place.  It is still impossible to tightly curtail this area if people who have a will to do wrong proceed to do it.  Perhaps we should consider self-regulation backed up by a proper statutory framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing that.  I remind the House that prior to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, there was no regulation of any kind apart from the normal prescriptions of the companies legislation.  Against a background of years of no regulation of the financial services sector, this Act is an imposition.  If, as Deputy O'Rourke said, a tightly curtailed regime was imposed <Col N="710" /> immediately in the wake of no regulation, there would be serious questions about the ability of the industry to adapt to it.</P>
      <P>A limited number of options confront us.  Probably at the heart of the matter is whether a compensation regime can be put in place to restore confidence in the broker system.  I am not commenting on the particular case because the studies to which I referred may show that nothing could have been done legislatively, supervisory or regulatory wise to prevent the abuse which took place.  I do not know if a compensation regime adequate to the circumstances can be put in place.  This was examined by the Department at the time against the background of the compensation directive, which is being finalised in Europe.  However, there is a ceiling on what compensation will be available under that directive and for investors who have large amounts of money at risk.  Even if that directive became law, it would only provide a minimum reprieve for large scale investors.  It would be a great source of comfort for small investors but it would not provide adequate compensation for large investors who, for reasons best known to themselves, make their own choices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Non-Nationals was established by the Government in 1993 to examine all matters relating to non-nationals in the State.  This committee was chaired by the Department of Justice and comprised senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and my Department.  The committee's first report, which dealt with asylum seekers and refugees, was submitted to Government in November 1993.  The second report, which deals with policy and practice relating to admission and residence, has not yet been completed, so I am not in a position to comment on its contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the work permit policy operated by my Department is currently undergoing a major review.  Regular meetings have been taking place at official level between my Department and the Department of Justice which has responsibility for all immigration matters, to discuss the practical implications involved.  In addition, my Department has met interested bodies to discuss the practical effects of work permit policy and the <Col N="711" /> possible improvements which could be made.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Aliens Orders, 1946 and 1975, are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  However, on completion of the review of the work permit policy I may well consider the possibility of introducing separate legislation in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the final report will be completed in the near future.  We need to protect the increasing numbers of Third World workers who are working without permits in this country. Has the Minister considered a form of indemnity to allow these workers, who are being exploited by employers who know they have no work permits and are therefore vulnerable, to expose their working conditions and the unscrupulous nature of their employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not considered any such proposal.  The difficulty in that situation is that the employment is not illegal, but the people involved are illegal residents.  If an employer is in breach of LRC minimum wage rates and is exploiting immigrant workers, we could pursue them under legislation.  The general policy, as the Deputy knows, is that we do not grant work permits unless it is demonstrated that there are no EU nationals or Irish nationals who could do the job or that the job has been advertised and made open to them.  I take note of the Deputy's concern that there may be exploitation of workers.  When we approve permits, we are satisfied with the working conditions.  Perhaps there is scope for tightening up the way we oversee that.</P>

      <P>There is a commitment in the programme for Government in regard to a third banking force which would involve the sale of the Trustee Savings Bank.  In light of the new Standing Orders introduced a fortnight ago, it is now in order to ask the Taoiseach on the Order of Business about statements made outside the House.  Given that the Tánaiste announced to members of the Labour Party that it is no longer proposed to sell the TSB, will the Taoiseach reconsider his reply to Deputy Harney and say whether a proposal will be put forward regarding the TSB?  As reported in last Sunday's newspapers, the Tánaiste told Labour Party Deputies that, owing to objections by certain members of the Cabinet who do not agree with the proposal put forward by the Minister for Finance, this idea has been dropped and that will remain the position for the lifetime of this Government.  Is the commitment in the programme for Government still valid?</P>

    <Title>Employment Equality Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is the most significant contribution to the fight against discrimination in employment since the first Employment Equality Act of 20 years ago.  It fulfils our commitment to introduce broad ranging legislation to outlaw discrimination in employment on the grounds of gender, marital and family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  The scope of the Bill is comprehensive and deals with all employment related areas from vocational training to access to employment and employment conditions generally, including training, work experience and promotion. It draws on developments in working towards equality over the past two decades and will, when enacted, give Ireland one of the most modern equality codes in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Bill responds to the radical change that has been taking place and continues to take place in society.  Our society which until recently had adopted a relatively closed and homogeneous outlook is rapidly taking on a new open, pluralist and strongly European identity.  I am very much aware that this new identity is increasingly evident in working life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world of work is no longer peopled predominantly by married men with full time permanent jobs.  The emerging work environment includes many employment options, from part time employment to job sharing and teleworking. It is peopled by men and women, some of whom are the sole breadwinners, while others contribute, in equal measure with a partner, to the economic support of home and family.  Increasingly, people with disabilities are demanding their right to a full role in economic life, including a place in this more flexible world of work.  A more open approach to issues of sexual orientation, changes in family status and an increase in ethnic and religious diversity leave members of some of our minority groups more visible, and perhaps vulnerable, in the workplace.  The fact that few people <Col N="719" /> are guaranteed a job for life, coupled with the high levels of unemployment, means that more older people than ever before are seeking work.</P>
    <P>In this emerging labour market, employment equality must be seen as an essential element in labour protection legislation.  Discrimination is not a theoretical problem.  For too many it is an unacceptable reality.  Take discrimination on the grounds of age.  A brief scan of the situations vacant columns in any daily newspaper provides ample evidence of outright discrimination.  Labour force statistics show that older workers, once unemployed, are likely to remain unemployed for longer than their younger counterparts.  The Report of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment shows that alongside the increasing incidence of long-term unemployment among older workers, other motivational factors are at work.  A study in Tallaght by Ronayne and Creedon in 1992 reported that two out of three people who were long-term unemployed and over the age of 45 expect never to get a job again.  The perceptions of these individuals are confirmed by the reality.  Statistics show that a man aged over 45 and two years unemployed has only one chance in ten of being re-employed.</P>
    <P>Discrimination on the grounds of disability is unfortunately widespread.  An official report, prepared for the European Commission in 1991, represented the number of people with disabilities in Ireland as 240,000, or 7 per cent of the population. The National Rehabilitation Board, together with other agencies, has been working over the years to ensure the integration of people with disabilities into employment.  An EC labour force survey in 1989 indicated that &ldquo;the chances of someone with a disability being unemployed are significantly higher than someone without a disability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a common truth that success in today's internationally competitive business environment involves utilising the talents of all employees, without regard to ability-neutral characteristics such as sex, disability or sexual orientation. Employers and managers who overlook able employees because of traditional prejudices are guilty both of injustice and waste in deploying the human resources available to them.  They may even jeopardise the viability of their enterprise, because there is nothing more certain than that there are other enterprises which have succeeded in tapping the energies and abilities of their employees.  I am convinced that we must relinquish outmoded preferences that perpetuate narrow discriminatory practices if our society is to prosper in the emerging economic pluralism and if we are to work towards true social equity.</P>
    <P>Apart from any economic imperative there is an obligation on all of us, Government, employers and trade unions, to work towards the development of social justice.  Equality is a fundamental human right, which is especially important in the economic sphere.  Individuals in society have a basic right to seek and secure gainful <Col N="720" /> employment and to advance in that employment without being discriminated against because of personal characteristics unconnected with work performance.</P>
    <P>Discrimination in employment often weighs disproportionately on those who are already marginalised in our society, such as members of the travelling community, older people and people with disabilities.  Employment equality legislation is one essential tool to help redress disadvantage. In addition, non-legislative measures, both State-sponsored and voluntary, also have a role. Reviews of progress to date in relation to gender equality illustrate the limitations, as well as the importance, of legislative action.</P>
    <P>Employment equality legislation for women has been on the Statute Book for 20 years.  In the summer of 1974 the then Minister for Labour, Michael O'Leary, presented the first employment equality legislation ever before this House.  Opening the Second Stage debate, he stated that &ldquo;much needs to be done to improve the status of women in employment&rdquo;.  It is disquieting to note that, despite some significant achievements in the intervening 20 years, this statement is also true today.  The position of women has advanced, but substantial equality in employment for the vast majority of women remains an elusive goal.</P>
    <P>There has been progress.  In 1974 two women Senators contributed to the debate on that first employment equality legislation.  One of them, Mary Robinson, is today President of Ireland and the other, Evelyn Owens, holds the chair of the Labour Court.  Both positions would have been regarded clearly as men's jobs 20 years ago.  Attitudes in Ireland have progressed but we need still more progress.</P>
    <P>Across the EU today women earn substantially less than men.  In Ireland the average hourly earnings of women who work in manufacturing industry are only 70 per cent of those earned by their male counterparts.  The situation outside manufacturing is not much better.  An ESRI study published in 1994 entitled &ldquo;Male-Female Wage Differentials: Analysis and Policy Issues&rdquo; examined the earnings of men and women workers in all sectors.  The study found that women's earnings were only 80 per cent of those of men.  The study also found that half of the 20 per cent difference could be attributed to factors such as skill, hours worked, length of service and experience.  It is quite likely that the remaining 10 per cent of the discrepancy is the result of pay discrimination.</P>
    <P>Like other European countries, Ireland has experienced a strong increase in labour market growth.  Employment in Ireland has grown by 8.5 per cent in the period 1991 to 1995.  The increase in female employment has been even higher, of the order of 20 per cent.  There are more jobs for women, but growth in jobs has been concentrated in low paid, part-time and other atypical work and it is to these jobs that many of the new entrants to the workforce, primarily women, are recruited. <Col N="721" /> So far as gender equality is concerned, we are at a crossroads.  The days are long past when it is socially or politically acceptable to justify unequal treatment by reference to differences in biological or social function.  Acceptance of the principle of equality, however, does not appear to have been matched with practical action to achieve it.</P>
    <P>I know from meeting the two sides of industry, employers and trade unions, whether in the public or private sectors, that there is support for the principle of employment equality.  In almost all cases, these organisations fall short of achieving equality of opportunities in practice.  There is need for continued vigilance by women, their representative organisations, employers and State agencies to ensure that acceptance of the principle of equality is matched by a real will to eliminate discrimination.</P>
    <P>The number of women in key decision-making roles in our public and private organisations is conspicuously low.  Women are under-represented at board level in our major manufacturing and industrial concerns and on the boards of our service and financial institutions.  Below boardroom level, the world of work is segregated both vertically and horizontally with men occupying the majority of management, professional and supervisory positions and women by and large responsible for the delivery of routine clerical and support services.  Women are also segregated in the low paid sectors of the economy such as the clothing, assembly and services sectors.</P>
    <P>We all know that the issues involved in the development of full gender equality at work are complex and, like most complex issues, can only be addressed over time and in response to a broad-based programme.  For my part, I have taken steps to facilitate the reconciliation of work and family life through the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995.  I have supported adoption of the Directive on Parental Leave at EU level.  The transposition into Irish law of this directive can be expected greatly to ease the child rearing burden for many new working parents.  Allied to these developments, facilities for child care support for working parents are being promoted through a pilot scheme for disadvantaged areas funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>To broaden the decision making role of women, I have moved to ensure an increase in the number of women on State boards.  In 1992 only 15 per cent of positions on State boards were held by women.  In 1993 the Government, on my proposal, decided to work towards a target of a minimum 40 per cent representation level for women on State boards.  By July last 26 per cent of all members of State boards were women.</P>
    <P>Trade unions and employer interests have a serious obligation to assist in the achievement of gender equality in the workplace.  It would be good if employers seized the occasion of this Bill to audit their workplaces and put in place targets to ensure the removal of any remaining barriers <Col N="722" /> to equal opportunities.  I hope that some employers will take the opportunity afforded for the first time by this Bill to introduce schemes of positive action, geared to help eliminate existing inequalities that may affect their employees of either sex.  Trade unions must intensify efforts to help women, collectively and individually, to achieve equal pay and equal treatment.  I am confident this Bill will give the issue of equality in the workplace a considerably greater profile and, following its enactment, I look forward to an increasingly active role being taken by more and more individual women in defending and advancing their own interests and rights in the workplace, either in the trade union movement or in other ways.</P>
    <P>In developing this Bill to cover the new discriminatory grounds, I have had regard to the individual rights-based approach in existing gender employment equality legislation.  I have also taken note of UK racial equality legislation and the various approaches adopted to deal with discrimination in other EU member states, in Australia and in the United States.  The Australian model, in particular, has proved a fruitful source of inspiration.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the gender equality provisions in Part III of the Bill have been tightly drawn in accordance with the requirements of EU law.  The Bill transposes into Irish law the Equal Pay and Equal Treatment Directives, following repeal in the Bill of the substantive provisions of the 1974 and 1977 equality Acts.  The Bill also meets Irish obligations with regard to equal pay under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome and builds on the substantial body of case law that has been handed down by the European Court of Justice in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline to the House some of the main features of the Bill.  The Bill is divided into six parts as follows: Part I contains standard and technical provisions; Part II sets out the prohibited discriminatory grounds and establishes the scope of the Bill; Part III deals with discrimination on ground of gender and gives effect to EU law in this area; Part IV deals with discrimination on grounds other than gender, namely marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community; Part V provides means of redress and compensation for persons who may have suffered discrimination; Part VI gives new powers to the Equality Authority which will replace the present Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill, comprising sections 1 to 5, provides for the powers to make orders and regulations in section 3, a provision in relation to expenses in section 4, repeal of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the substantive provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 in section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains the necessary definitions. Some definitions which should be noted are the definition of advertisement which includes every <Col N="723" /> form of advertisement whether to the public or not and whether in a newspaper or any other publication, on television or radio or by display of a notice or by any other means; the definition of contract of employment which covers all employees in both the public and private sectors as well workers employed through employment agencies &mdash; this broad definition of contract of employment is in line with that contained in recent labour legislation.  Other definitions are the definition of disability which is broad enough to give protection from discrimination to all people with a disability; the definition of family status which encompasses both care of the elderly and child care responsibilities; the definition of remuneration which includes any consideration in cash or in kind which an employee receives, directly or indirectly, from the employer in respect of employment.  Pension rights are excluded from this provision and my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, will bring forward any legislation necessary to ensure discharge of our obligations under Article 119 of the Treaty of the European Community and the various equality directives, including the Equal Pay Directive.  I understand he will deal also with equal treatment in pensions on a wide range of other grounds in an amendment to the Pensions Act. 1990.</P>
    <P>Part II comprises sections 6 to 17 of the Bill. Section 6 sets out the grounds on which discrimination is prohibited in the Bill.  They are gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  The scope of the Bill is also established in this Part.  Section 8 outlaws discrimination in relation to access to employment, conditions of employment, training or experience, promotion or regarding or classification of posts.  Section 10 prohibits the publication or display of discriminatory job advertisements. Section 11 prohibits discrimination by employment agencies.  Section 12 prohibits discrimination by providers of vocational training. Section 13 prohibits discrimination by trade unions, employer organisations, professional bodies, trade associations and by any body which controls entry to or the carrying on of a profession, vocation or occupation.  The procurement or attempted procurement of discrimination is prohibited by section 14.  The extent of the liability of an employer or any other person for actions of employees and other agents is set out in section 15.</P>
    <P>Other provisions in this part are the definition of like work; general exclusions form the provisions of the Bill where a person is unwilling, unsuitable or unable to perform the duties of the post in section 16, and where acts are done in compliance with statutory requirements in section 17, and the making null and void of provisions in collective agreements that are discriminatory in section 9.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> Part III, comprising sections 18 to 27, deals with discrimination on the gender ground and gives effect to EU law in this area.  Sections 19 and 20 provide an entitlement to men and women to equal remuneration in respect of like work where both are employed by the same or an associated employer.  Discrimination in relation to other conditions of employment are prohibited in sections 21 and 22 of the Bill.  Section 23 contains a definition of sexual harassment and explicitly provides that sexual harassment amounts to discrimination.  Section 24 allows for positive action to eliminate the effects of past discrimination. It is a broadly couched provision and may be interpreted to include all forms of positive action, subject only to any limitation imposed by European Court of Justice case law.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 to 27 allow exemptions from the principle of equal treatment.  These exemptions include an exemption for the purposes of authenticity in entertainment; an exemption for certain jobs abroad; an exemption for special advantageous treatment of women in connection with pregnancy, maternity and adoption; an exemption for personal services, such as for the care of an elderly or incapacitated person.  There are limited exemptions for the Garda Síochána and the prison service for purposes related to privacy and decency; the control of individuals and riot situations; and for gender-based height requirements.</P>
    <P>Part IV, consisting of sections 28 to 37, prohibits discrimination on any of the following grounds &mdash; marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community. Sections 29 to 31 provide for equal pay for like work and for the prohibition of discrimination in relation to other conditions of employment. Section 32 outlaws harassment in employment, on the basis of each of the discriminatory grounds set out in this Part.  Section 33 allows positive action in favour of people with disabilities, people above the age of 50 and members of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>Section 34 allows for the retention by employees of certain family and seniority-related benefits that would otherwise be made unlawful under the Bill.  It allows for the continued fixing of retirement ages and for the phasing out of agerelated pay.  The section also permits the setting of a maximum retirement age, on training-related cost grounds, and for an exemption from the terms of the Bill where there is clear actuarial or other evidence of significantly increased costs for the employer.</P>
    <P>Section 35 is focused primarily to require an employer to make special provision for a person with a disability, unless it can be shown that such provision would cause the employer undue hardship. Section 36 allows for the continued application of residency, citizenship and Irish language proficiency requirements in the public service and establishes criteria for the setting of educational and other qualifications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> Section 37 allows exemptions from the principle of equal treatment.  The exemptions include exemptions for religious, educational and medical institutions run by religious bodies; an exemption for the purposes of authenticity in entertainment; an exemption for jobs in circumstances abroad where people of a particular religion could not reasonably be expected to operate effectively; an exemption for employment in a private household; and an exemption for the security forces on the age and disability ground.</P>
    <P>Part V, consisting of sections 38 to 68, deals with procedures for resolving disputes in relation to entitlements under the Bill.  In an effort to assist in the speedy and informal resolution of disputes, section 42 allows for binding mediation where the Director of Equality Investigations or the Labour Court considers that the dispute could be resolved in this way and the parties to the dispute do not object to such a course of action.</P>
    <P>Section 41 provides that a person who considers that she or he has been discriminated against, victimised or has not received equal remuneration may in the first instance refer the matter to the Director of Equality Investigations, with provision for an appeal to the Labour Court. In the case of a dismissal, the case would be referred directly to the Labour Court, with provision for an appeal to the Circuit Court (sections 41 and 54).  Where a case is referred to the director of Equality Investigations or the Labour Court, the director or the court may, in accordance with section 46, make an order for equal remuneration or equal treatment.  In addition, the director or the court may order an employer to pay up to three years' arrears of remuneration or to order compensation for other acts of discrimination or victimisation up to a maximum of 104 weeks' remuneration.  In a case where the person concerned was not in receipt of remuneration, there is provision for an order for compensation up to a maximum of £10,000.  In a case involving the dismissal of an employee, the Labour Court may also order reinstatement or re-engagement of the employee, if that is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Arising from recent European Court of Justice case law, I have provided means of redress without limit on the amount of compensation in gender equality cases.  A person who may have been discriminated against on this ground may opt to seek redress through the Circuit Court.  In such a case, the only limit on the amount of compensation or arrears of remuneration which may be ordered, is a six-years' time limit on the backdating of any compensation or arrears of remuneration &mdash; section 46(3).  This limit on backdating is the maximum such limit enshrined in the generally applicable Statute of Limitations.</P>
    <P>Sections 40 and 45 provide a right to seek information for all persons who may have been discriminated against and set out the consequences for an employer of failure to supply such information.</P>
    <P>Sections 58 to 61 give strong investigative powers to the Director of Equality Investigations and <Col N="726" /> to the Labour Court to enter premises, to obtain relevant information, through interview or otherwise, and to ensure the imposition of sanctions in the event of failure or refusal by persons to co-operate with an investigation.</P>
    <P>Under section 49, the Equality Authority is empowered to refer disputes to the Director of Equality Investigations.  The Authority has the sole right to initiate proceedings in cases of discriminatory advertisements, including power to seek an injunction to prevent the filling of a job advertised in a discriminatory manner.  The Authority may also refer a case to the Director of Equality Investigations on behalf of an individual where it would not be reasonable to expect an individual to refer the case, for example because of its complexity or because of the individual's fear of victimisation.  The Authority may also seek an injunction in respect of persistent discrimination.</P>
    <P>Sections 50 and 51 empower the Authority, or a person affected by a collective agreement, to refer the agreement to the Director of Equality Investigations, or on appeal to the Labour Court, where it is considered that the agreement contains a discriminatory term or does not provide for equal remuneration.  The purpose of a referral or appeal under these sections will be to identify which provisions, if any, of a collective agreement are null and void, and, where appropriate, to suggest how alternative provisions might be devised.</P>
    <P>Sections 55 to 57 allow a person who has been awarded compensation under the Bill to enforce the award through the Circuit Court, if the employer fails to take payment within a specified period.  Sections 62 to 65 deal with offences under the Bill and with certain incidental provisions.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill, consisting of sections 69 to 73, is concerned with the Authority.  Section 69 gives new powers to the Authority to prepare codes of practice that will have statutory recognition. Sections 70 and 71 give a new statutory role to the Authority to carry out equality reviews and devise action plans.  Sections 72 and 73 contain technical amendments to the provisions in the 1977 Act in relation to the Authority necessitated by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the implementation of a comprehensive programme to advance equality through a broad range of actions.  The Employment Equality Bill is a central element in that programme and an essential step in the process towards the elimination of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that some sections of the Bill are particularly complex and difficult. However, I will keep an open mind on possible constructive suggestions for improvement, bearing in mind submissions received from interest groups and others, and particularly the contributions of Deputies in the House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Employment Equality Bill but we have serious reservations about some of the Government's proposals and <Col N="727" /> its deliberate omissions.  As drafted, the Bill is cumbersome, legalistic and complex.  The Minister admitted the complexity of the Bill in his final remarks.  Practitioners will find it difficult compared with present practices which are simpler and more user friendly.  With 73 sections and deep concerns being expressed about many of them, the Bill will require substantial amendment on Committee Stage if it is to fulfil its promise in the fight against discrimination in both private and public sector employment.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that there was no explanatory memorandum with the Bill.  That was quite a disadvantage for everybody, given the complexity of the legislation and the number of sections.  A brief guide was distributed subsequently but it was brief, did not deal with the sections in great detail and was not particularly helpful in analysing the Bill.  It is vital that Bills which are large and complex should include an explanatory memorandum to ensure that people know exactly what the Government has in mind.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil is firmly committed to the elimination of inequality for all those who suffer from disabilities, disadvantage or discrimination in society.  This important Bill, which began its life in the Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-7, was to be a major step in the fight against discrimination and inequality in the area of employment. It was to fulfil a long-standing commitment made in successive national programmes to update our employment equality legislation on sex and marital status and to extend it to cover discrimination and employment on grounds of age, disability, family status, race, religion, membership of the travelling community and sexual orientation.</P>
      <P>The Bill addresses each of these areas but, in many instances, it fails to take decisive action to break out of fixed and stereotyped mind sets and give the decisive leadership we need in tackling exclusion as we approach the new millennium. Instead of the bold and imaginative steps which people need from their leaders at this critical time we are presented with the confused and uncertain compromises of a divided rainbow coalition.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill's extension of the scope of equality legislation to provide protection for people who were discriminated against on grounds other than gender or marital status. However, I am concerned the Bill will reduce the existing level of protection under the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  The type of discrimination that has proved most difficult to eradicate is indirect discrimination.  This is not the obvious and clear-cut discrimination that occurs when women are, for example, refused access to particular categories of jobs or promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> Indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement that seems neutral but which is harder for women to satisfy than men, for example, the minimum height requirement to which the Minister referred.  That sets the bar higher than many women can reach and can discriminate against women.  Under existing legislation an employer can only impose such a requirement when it is absolutely essential for the job in question.  This Bill proposes to allow such requirements if they can be objectively justified by an employer.  The Minister will say that such a provision is the European standard, but it is a lower standard than the Irish one.  In effect, the Bill lowers the present standard in Irish law. After nearly 20 years of equality legislation this would be a serious retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be a disappointment for people with disabilities.  It fails to address the key employment issues which confront them.  More than 80 per cent of people with disabilities are unemployed.  This is a national disgrace and a scandal.  Now is the time to take positive steps to redress this awful discrimination and to face down the begrudgers in our society, many of whom are doing well from Ireland's progress and prosperity.  Now is the time to take a bold and progressive step to remove discrimination and to help people with disabilities to overcome their exclusion from employment.  In this context, Fianna Fáil will put down an amendment to provide that the 3 per cent quota which already applies in the public service will be extended to the private sector.  The implementation of the quota will be discussed with the social partners but within a time limit.  It is disappointing that the Government has not taken this opportunity to extend the quota to the private sector. Members of the House have spoken often enough about the need for it.  This is legislation of major importance for the future and this is the time to do it.</P>
    <P>Deep concern has also been expressed that the medical definition of disability adopted by the rainbow coalition will lead to medical assessments for all disabled people seeking employment. This approach is contrary to the principles of non-discrimination and will perpetuate discrimination against people with disabilities in employment.  It uses a medical definition of disability rather than an employment focused one.  It has caused widespread concern since it effectively covers the entire workforce.  It will also undermine existing agreements and codes of practice, introduced after years of practical experience, which are currently working and being implemented very well.  Those who took the initiative in introducing and adhering to those codes of practice are disappointed with the proposals in the Bill.  Why did we not build on their experience and on the codes of practice?</P>
    <P>The Government is also introducing new provisions through which employers may claim exemption from the requirements of the legislation on the grounds of undue hardship.  The <Col N="729" /> emphasis on undue hardship in the provision of facilities and other arrangements for people with disabilities runs contrary to the concept of reasonable accommodation which has wide support. Most recently, in report No. 10 of the National Economic and Social Forum on equality proofing issues, this approach is seen by many to be more positive and preferable.</P>
    <P>The Minister should scrap the medical model of disability.  It is dangerous and wrong and Fianna Fáil opposes it.  It will affect every member of the workforce.  It has been widely criticised because it focuses on the health of a worker rather than on his or her ability to do the job. Second, it will lead to the introduction of medical assessments for all people seeking employment, even where they have no bearing on their ability to perform.  Third, it will perpetuate and extend discrimination against people with disabilities, making the situation even worse for them. Fourth, it will cover everybody because it includes (a) the absence in the body of organisms causing or likely to cause chronic disease or illness and (b) a disability which presently exists or which previously existed but no longer exists or which may exist in the future or which is imputed to a person.</P>
    <P>These insidious clauses could and will be used to exclude from appointment, training and promotion people who have had an illness of almost any kind, even though they may be fully recovered. A former tuberculosis patient, for example, will be seen to have a disability which previously existed or an organism in the body likely to cause future illness even though it is fully treatable.  That can be regarded as a return to the dark days not so long ago.  Many of us remember when people were excluded from jobs not because they had serious tuberculosis but because they had more minor infections and were regarded as having had that disability.</P>
    <P>If the Government's definition was carried to its logical conclusion, few people in the workforce would escape a health witch hunt.  It would be better to use the ILO definition which measures disability as the impact on an individual of a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment which affects or substantially reduces their prospects of securing, retaining and advancing in employment.  We will propose an amendment of this type on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Although discrimination on grounds of sex or marital status is already precluded under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, many of the issues covered in this Bill affect women.  Women still face man made barriers in recruitment, promotion and admission to training which can lead to advancement.  They also find themselves locked out of State-run training schemes and work options, especially if they are homemakers who are endeavouring to re-enter the paid workforce. If we are to tackle inequality we must deal with these important issues.  For example, widows cannot get access to community employment schemes or FÁS schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> Women are disappointed the Bill does not require comparison in equal pay with a hypothetical male, according to the National Women's Council.  The National Women's Council and others have argued that if equal pay legislation is to succeed and have real effect where there is a high propensity to use women as cheap labour, it must ensure that all women are able to secure what would be the male rate for the job.  The European Court of Justice has ruled out any comparisons which are not made on work performed by employees of a different sex within the same employment.  Community law does not require comparisons with a &ldquo;hypothetical male&rdquo;.  The Employment Equality Bill does not extend the equality legislation beyond our obligations under Community law.  Clearly, there are implications for industries and businesses which employ all female staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern when Minister for Labour, and his successor, Deputy Brian Cowen, proposed the introduction of a hypothetical comparator if no actual comparator existed.  That is still our position.  Why has the Rainbow Coalition dropped that proposal?  In the Netherlands women may make a comparison on an industry wide basis.  They can choose someone working for another employer in the same industry if their own employment is single sex.  This is an alternative approach.  It appears the Minister has thrown in the sponge on this issue.  It seems he has been compromised by his position in the Rainbow Coalition.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is also disappointed that &ldquo;a hypothetical comparator&rdquo; has been deleted from the Bill.  It says one of the key criticisms of the current legislation is that it does not afford an opportunity to workers in segregated employments to achieve equal pay.  Ireland still has a highly segregated workforce, with many workers confined to low pay and low status jobs.  Ireland is the only country in the European Union that has signed the social Protocol and has not got a statutory minimum wage.  The minimum wage provision in other European countries affords some protection and opportunity for segregated and low paid workers to achieve equal pay.</P>
    <P>Congress recommends that the legislation should provide a mechanism to achieve equal pay for workers in segregated employments where there is no comparator.  It says this could be done by means of an hypothetical comparator, by the extension of the joint labour committees to cover such employments, or by the introduction of minimum wage legislation, which was one of the key recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women.  So far, the Minister has not adopted any of these recommendations and the issue will have to be pursued further on Committee Stage.  Congress also recommends that the definition of &ldquo;like work&rdquo; currently contained in existing legislation should be included in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>IBEC objects strongly to any attempt to introduce the concept of the hypothetical comparator <Col N="731" /> with regard to equal pay.  In its view it has no place in law as it does not clearly indicate to an employer whether he or she has a liability.  The objective of any legislation should be to specify as precisely as possible the rights and obligations of both employers and employees under an Act. This will not be possible where a hypothetical employee is involved and will result in many more cases being processed through the courts resulting in many more delays than currently experienced.</P>
    <P>IBEC also sees the concept of the hypothetical comparator as an attempt to boost the pay of traditionally lower paid jobs filled by members of a particular sex.  It says the purpose of equal pay legislation is to determine whether a woman should be paid the same as a man or <i>vice versa</i> or whether members of both sexes are performing &ldquo;like work&rdquo;.  Accordingly, both the employer and worker organisations want &ldquo;like work&rdquo; as the criterion for equal pay and it is difficult to see why the Government has ignored both sides.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Government proposes to exclude the Naval Service from the provisions in so far as they relate to gender, until such time as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Defence, may by order provide.  This is not acceptable.  This section should be deleted.  I accept there may be practical difficulties.  A fixed time limit for its introduction can be considered. That is how the Minister should proceed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government has retained the right to discriminate against workers on grounds of political affiliation or belief, or membership of a trade union.  The emphasis should be on performance and ability to do the job.  There are far too many instances where workers are denied promotion or even an appointment because of political or trade union affiliation.  Such discrimination should be stopped now.  It is unconstitutional, immature and wrong.  One would have hoped the Rainbow Coalition would have tackled trade union or political affiliation problems and would have been open to change to ensure people are not discriminated against.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statutory protection from discrimination of people aged 18-65.  Why stop there?  Surely it would be better to ban discrimination on age grounds entirely.  Otherwise, the present proposals could lead to discrimination against workers aged under 18 or over 65.  The Minister has just told us more and more people are seeking work and in future many of those will be over 65.  Why leave those people open to discrimination? Some adjustments will need to be made but I do not see why we cannot entirely remove discrimination on age grounds.  That is a matter we can discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is widespread discrimination on age grounds within the public service.  This can be seen in newspaper advertisements for posts where age limits vary widely.  I call on the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission to <Col N="732" /> stop this discrimination from today and to readvertise the posts for which interviews or exams have not been held.  I have brought a number of these to the attention of the Minister.  The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission discriminate on age grounds.  The public sector should lead by example rather than change only when forced to do so by this legislature.  The Government undertook in its programme for Government to take specific action to end discrimination and to ensure equal opportunity for all our people.  Now is the time to stop the age discrimination in the public sector without further delay.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil welcomes the introduction of an express statutory provision dealing with sexual harassment.  However, the provision as formulated is very technical with an emphasis on legal definitions.  It is regrettable the Government did not choose to take a more positive approach. Instead of focusing only on liability for sexual harassment we need more proactive measures to prevent it occurring in the first place and to ensure that every workplace fosters an atmosphere that respects the dignity of all employees. I will propose an amendment that will require every employer to introduce a policy statement on sexual harassment with regard to his or her workplace &mdash; somewhat similar to the safety statements which are mandatory under the health and safety legislation.</P>
    <P>It is a serious concern of the National Women's Council, the Congress of Trade Unions and the Equal Opportunities Network of Practitioners, who are already successfully operating codes of practice, that the Government proposes to change the definition in a way which removes &ldquo;the concept of the impact on the complainant&rdquo; in cases of sexual harassment.  They fear that if the perpetrator has reason to believe the victim would not find the act or conduct sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating then sexual harassment will be deemed not to have occurred. They believe that the references in the section to &ldquo;reasonable person&rdquo; are unacceptable in that they purport to introduce an objective test into what is essentially a subjective matter.  Since 1985 the Labour Court has relied on a subjective test as to what constitutes sexual harassment and it sees no good reason to depart from this position. It views the Minister's proposal as a cop-out. These are the people operating the codes of practice and they deserve our praise and congratulations for taking the initiative and setting up clear codes of practice which work well.</P>
    <P>A major difference has arisen with regard to the exclusion of certain religious, educational and medical bodies from the provisions of the Bill.  If an employer can show that discrimination is essential for the maintenance of the religious ethos or is reasonable then he or she can discriminate on the grounds of religion, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, race and membership of the travelling community.  The National Women's Council considers this provision <Col N="733" /> to be excessive and open to abuse.  It says that all voluntary hospitals and the vast majority of schools receive public funding regardless of whether they are managed by religious institutes. It believes there is no balance in the Bill between the rights of an employer and the rights of an employee.  The only protection is that an employer must show that discrimination is essential for the maintenance of the religious ethos or is reasonable to avoid offending the religious sensitivities of their members or clients.  The council believes this provision will be open to abuse.</P>
    <P>ICTU has also expressed strong disagreement with the exclusions contained in section 37.  It states:</P>
    <P>Congress is totally opposed to a provision in national legislation which could allow single parents, separated people, gay, lesbian and people of no or different religious beliefs or viewpoints to be discriminated against by educational, health and religious institutions on the basis that their employment may offend members, clients, pupils or customers of these institutions.</P>
    <P>Congress wants the provisions in section 37 deleted from the Bill.  The Minister must answer these deep concerns and say how he proposes to meet these objections and avoid the introduction of new abuses.  A report in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> on the INTO's special conference in Galway at the weekend stated that members were particularly upset and irate about this section.  It stated:</P>
    <P>The exclusion of religious schools from new equality legislation amounts to an unfair intrusion into teachers' private lives, the special INTO conference in Galway at the weekend has been told.</P>
    <P>Speaker after speaker denounced the exemption of denominational schools from the Employment Equality Bill published earlier this year by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Taylor.</P>
    <P>The union is to urge the Government to drop the exemption.  It is currently taking legal action on the options open to teachers to oppose the provision... which represented &ldquo;a step back into the dark ages&rdquo; which would provide teachers working in religious schools with almost no protection.</P>
    <P>The INTO members regard it as a very tightly drawn exemption and believes the Bill will allow employers to discriminate on the grounds of religion, marital status, family status, sexual orientation or race.  It believes the only grounds on which employers cannot discriminate are gender, age or disability.  There is widespread concern outside the House about this section and the reasons for its inclusion in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The issue of religious conscience has been dealt with in other jurisdictions.  The Minister referred to the Australian legislation in this area which he had examined.  The Equal Opportunities Bill, <Col N="734" /> 1995, introduced in the Australian state of Victoria makes specific provision for conscience and religious beliefs.  It also makes provision for the direction and control of institutions in accordance with religious beliefs.  This important issue will require substantial debate and consideration on Committee Stage and I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in the time available to refer to all the provisions which merit consideration and comment.  Fianna Fáil welcomes the Bill and will co-operate on Committee Stage in helping to make it an important instrument in removing discrimination from our society.  I hope it will greatly improve the position of people with disabilities and women at work and make a major contribution to the removal of discrimination in the work place.  We hope the legislation will represent a major leap forward in this area, and in this respect the Minister can be assured of our co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the publication of this long awaited legislation I find myself in something of a dilemma in that I cannot accept it in its present form.  I was glad the Minister said he would listen carefully to any constructive suggestions for improvement and bear in mind submissions from interested groups and others.  I sincerely hope he will do this.  This Bill is one of the cornerstones of the legislative framework promised by the Minister and, while it has been a long time coming, it is nonetheless welcome.</P>
      <P>Like many others, particularly those groups which up to now found themselves on the margins of our society, I looked forward to the introduction of inclusive and wide ranging legislation.  The legislation is wide ranging in that it extends employment equality legislation to cover equality between employed persons, prevents discrimination in connection with employment, vocational training and membership of certain bodies, prevents harassment in employment and the work place, changes the names and constitution of the Employment Equality Agency and repeals the Anti-Discrimination Act, 1974. However, it also contains some serious flaws.  Not only is it very cumbersome and complex but it has already so alarmed many groups, especially those concerned with disability, that they are beginning to wonder if they would be better off without it.  I was initially faced with a similar dilemma but I hope to improve the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its attempts to be all-emcompassing the Bill is a minefield for some and, paradoxically, a disappointment for others because of what is omitted. The Minister said the Bill deals with a very complex and difficult area.  This is all the more reason to have a Bill which is sufficiently clear and user friendly for employers and employees alike.  It is interesting that IBEC and Congress were equally concerned that the Bill, as drafted, was overly legalistic and not at all user friendly. To illustrate the cumbersome nature of the <Col N="735" /> approach adopted in the Bill, Congress has pointed out that the expedient of repealing sections of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, while retaining others will mean that those using the legislation will still need to refer to that Act. It recommends that the Employment Equality Act, 1977, be repealed in full and re-enacted, where required, in this legislation.  This would avoid the necessity of dealing with two Acts in tandem, which is what will happen if the Minister proceeds in the way proposed.</P>
    <P>If everyone from employers' organisations to trade unions, the National Women's Council, the Disability Federation of Ireland and many other organisations, as well as practitioners in the field, are signalling their disquiet then the Minister should heed their voices and take on board Opposition amendments which will improve the Bill.  I am sorry the Bill is so difficult for people to understand.  I agree it was a great hindrance to the many groups who were trying to mentally digest it that the explanatory memorandum was not available until this morning.  I appreciate the Minister's apology for this.  I realise there was a huge amount of work involved but it is unusual to put a Bill before the House without an explanatory memorandum.  A comprehensive user's guide should be produced so that not everyone would have to go through the labyrinth of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are major areas of concern about the Bill, notwithstanding that I welcome it as a significant contribution in the fight against discrimination in employment.  I will put forward an extensive range of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 2 defines the meaning of terms used. The Minister rightly said there is still a huge amount of discrimination on the grounds of disability. It is unbelievable, that contrary to the advice and expectations of practically everyone concerned, the Minister has insisted on a medical definition of disability.  Last night, the Irish Union of Supported Employment, a national umbrella organisation committed to the promotion of integrated employment of people with disabilities, condemned the Bill on two grounds.  First, the medical definition of disability is inappropriate in an employment context and second, the Bill does not require employers to make reasonable accommodation, as agreed in the NESF report on equality proofing mechanisms and institutions. The report said that continuance of discrimination on the grounds of undue hardship or excessive cost should only be considered in the context of a requirement to reasonable accommodation, that is, taking account of the cost to, and needs of all parties affected.  I will refer to that again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We should examine the definition agreed by IBEC and ICTU, which focused on the functional aspects of the person undertaking work.  The International Labour Organisation Convention defines disability for employment purposes in a <Col N="736" /> functional sense, as distinct from a medical sense. As the Disability Federation of Ireland point out, Ireland ratified this convention in 1986.  The Bill should be amended to incorporate this employment oriented definition, as set down in the ILO definition.  Why is there such intransigence about something that everyone else agrees on?  Where does the Commission stand on the status of people with disability in relation to this aspect of the Bill?  What is its recommendation?  Does the Minister as yet have that recommendation on this most fundamental aspect of the Bill?  Surely, having waited this long, the least we can expect for people with disability is that they have a mode that will not perpetuate discrimination.  I cannot understand the mind set that arrives at a conclusion so much at variance with what people actually want.  I will put forward an amendment, which I believe is a compromise most people will find acceptable.</P>
    <P>There is similar disquiet about other definitions. For instance, there is no statutory definition of what constitutes sexual orientation.  This must be clarified.  Does it include transsexual or bisexual people?  Discrimination against a person who is believed to be of a different sexual orientation should be as unacceptable as discrimination against a person who declares he or she is of a different sexual orientation.  For example, discrimination in recruitment against a woman for having what an employer believes to be a lesbian lifestyle, compared with what the employer believes to be a non-lesbian lifestyle, should not be permitted in law.  The definition of marital status does not include annulled, nor does it extend to a co-habiting couple.  However, our recent domestic violence legislation extends the provision of barring and safety orders to co-habiting couples.  We must have consistency in our legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 which outlines the nine grounds on which discrimination is outlawed, should be expanded to include discrimination on the grounds of political opinion.  This category has been incorporated into such legislation in other countries, including Northern Ireland, and is crucial to ensure that minority political opinions as well as religious beliefs do not form the basis for discriminatory employment related practices.  In the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act, religious belief is defined to include religious background or outlook.  A similar definition should be incorporated in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 7, deals with equal pay and like work. It does not allow for comparison with a hypothetical male.  I agree with the National Women's Council, who say if equal pay legislation is to succeed and have real effect where there is a high propensity to use women as cheap labour, it must provide a mechanism for ensuring that all women are able to secure what would be the male rate for the job.  It also says the European Court of Justice has ruled out any comparisons which are not made on work actually performed by <Col N="737" /> employees of different sex within the same employment.</P>
    <P>Community law does not require comparisons with a hypothetical male.  This Bill does not extend the equality legislation beyond our obligations under Community law.  This means there are huge implications for industries and businesses which employ all female staff.  Unless we change this, we will perpetuate the situation where women are trapped in low paid employment.</P>
    <P>In section 7, the use of the term &ldquo;is employed to do&rdquo; raises a contractual issue.  A person may be contracted to do a particular job and do something quite different.  We must refer to what already exists.  Why do we need to change the current definition?</P>
    <P>Section 9 refers to discrimination on grounds other than gender.  This does not include marital status, which is covered in the original legislation. In effect, the current legislation is weakened and I am sure that is not the intention.</P>
    <P>Section 12, in respect of the reservation of places on a pre-registration programme in a school of nursing which provides for training for nurses under the auspices of religious orders, can be used to ensure schools have reserved places for trainees of their own religious denomination. This could have the effect of excluding, or reducing to nominal numbers, those who are not members of that denomination.  I agree with the view of the ICTU that trainees should be recruited on the basis of their ability to do the job, not on the basis of their religious beliefs.</P>
    <P>Section 16 (4) is an important one which deals with sexual behaviour exclusion.  If that section is intended to combat paedophilia, it should do so in conformity with other legislation on Statute, for instance, child care legislation or other guidelines from the Department of Health.  Its sweeping terms lay it open to constitutional challenges which could damage its overall intent.  By encompassing non-criminal sexual behaviour and personal relationships of adult women and men, to which the public may object, it detracts from the intent of protecting minors from the criminal and predatory actions of paedophiles.  It threatens to open a major loophole based on reasonable customer or client preference, which could translate into prejudice against homosexual people.</P>
    <P>This section is far too broad and is open to abuse.  In the absence of a definition of sexual orientation, and regarding the reference to &ldquo;any form of sexual behaviour to which the employer might reasonably object&rdquo;, there is every reason to anticipate that dismissal of an employee on grounds of sexual orientation could be lawful. Given this situation, a repeat of the decision in the Brookfield Leisure Centre case, where an employee was dismissed on grounds of sexual orientation, is more than probable.  This section effectively negates the protection intended to be provided by the Bill, that an employee or prospective employee may not be discriminated <Col N="738" /> against on the grounds of sexual orientation. Reliable information is not defined in the Bill and may be entirely subjective and open to abuse.  A definition of &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; is vital so that the form of sexual behaviour the legislation intends to protect is clear.  People analysing the Bill are concerned that the intent of this section is not provided for.  Will the Minister re-examine the section?</P>
    <P>Another major concern relates to section 23, which deals with the question of sexual harassment. The Bill introduces new tests of sexual harassment despite well established jurisprudence and exemplary practices by employers and unions in Irish workplaces with codes of practice.  It is a step backwards from the trend in Irish jurisprudence. It will allow questioning of a complainant's lifestyle.  The new tests include a reasonability test and a test on the intention of the alleged perpetrator. These tests will make it harder to pursue sexual harassment in the workplace because of the fear that questioning a complainant's lifestyle might demonstrate that the accused had reasonable grounds to believe the offended person would not take offence.  One can imagine the type of argument that would be used in such circumstances. The key feature of sexual harassment is its unwanted and unsolicited nature.  Whether it is deliberate or unintended is of no importance.</P>
    <P>As it stands, section 23 contravenes the European Council of Ministers' recommendation on sexual harassment, the European Commission's guidelines on how to combat sexual harassment at work and the 1996 proposals to implement a Council directive on sexual harassment, which is being pursued by the Irish Presidency in Brussels this month.  Ireland supports a 1996 directive in Brussels based on the concept of &ldquo;unwanted behaviour&rdquo; while introducing at home a Bill based on the concept of &ldquo;what the perpetrator intended&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since 1985 the Labour Court has relied on a subjective test as to what constitutes sexual harassment and there is no good reason to depart from that approach.  Section 23 may be in breach of the 1996 directive if and when passed under the Irish Presidency.  The new provisions are likely to deter complainants from taking cases and this would be a step backwards.  As I do not believe that is the Minister's intention, I ask him to re-examine this section because it is fundamentally flawed.  It is pointless introducing a provision that makes matters worse rather than better.</P>
    <P>On section 25, it is extremely difficult to envisage employment or training being conditional on accepting communal sleeping arrangements, as opposed to shared accommodation in hospital, hotels or other such workplaces.  If this section is intended to exempt the Navy, it should be stated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 35 concerns financial and other exemptions for employers from providing certain services to permit disabled people to take up employment.  It is difficult to discuss these matters in the absence of the report of the Commission <Col N="739" /> on the Status of Persons with Disabilities.  Following publication of that report, which is expected shortly, such exemptions as are appropriate following the hundreds of hours of consultation and studies by the Commission could be inserted by way of amendment in the legislation.  It is unrealistic to dwell on them before the report is published.</P>
    <P>Under section 37, religious, educational and medical institutions are entitled to discriminate if it is essential for maintenance of the religious ethos of an institution or reasonable to avoid offending the religious sensitivities of its members or clients.  This opt-out clause does not apply when discrimination is on the basis of gender, age or disability grounds but does apply to discrimination on the grounds of family or marital status, race, membership of the travelling community, religious beliefs or sexual orientation. The Bill refuses to allow discrimination on certain grounds only.  This provision permits a religious school or religious-run hospital to discriminate against a person on the grounds of religious ethos or sensitivity on the basis of the marital or family status, race, sexual orientation or other characteristics of a teacher or health worker.  There is no justification for providing equality for some and not for all or for discriminating against some and not against others.  There is no historical, cultural, psychological, social or other reason hospitals and schools directed or controlled by a religious body should be allowed discriminate against persons because they are married or black while Dunnes Stores is not allowed to discriminate.  That merely creates inequity between employers.</P>
    <P>Many people were surprised at the reaction of teachers at the INTO conference.  A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> states that the exclusion of religious schools from new equality legislation amounts to an unfair intrusion into teachers' private lives and that speaker after speaker denounced the exemption of denominational schools from the Employment Equality Bill published by the Minister.  It also states that teachers will urge the Government to drop the exemption and will take legal action on the options open to them to oppose the provision.  The General Secretary of the INTO went so far as to say that it represented a step back into the dark ages and would not provide teachers working in religious schools with any protection.  That is a serious charge and the Minister must examine it carefully because in a desire to protect minorities, he may place himself in a difficult position.</P>
    <P>Also in regard to section 37, since disability is widely defined in the Bill and the disability ground prevents a wide range of discriminations any exemption on disability conversely allows for large numbers of people to be excluded from protection. This is another anomaly in the Bill.  The Army could lawfully discriminate against a person with a slight blemish, physical impairment or distant disability in his or her history.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Section 38 refers to the change in name of the Employment Equality Agency to the Equality Authority.  It also establishes a new statutory office of Director of Equality Investigations in the Labour Relations Commission and covers the appointment of equality officers and equality mediation officers.  The Minister is well aware of the concern about the future role of the newly named authority.  Members of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights fear that, even though it may not be the Minister's intention, the role of the agency in regard to women's equality will be diluted There is also grave anxiety about funding for the agency, particularly during the transition period.  Under its expanded role, the agency will be put to the pin of its collar to deal with all the matters that confront it.  It is vital that it has the ability to plan for the future and is not stymied because of a lack of resources.  I hope the Minister's commitment in that regard will be fulfilled. The Minister also said he has secured additional funds to be allocated for the authority in the context of the new responsibilities.  I hope they will be sufficient.  I have no doubt that they will be badly needed.  In the context of the proposed equal status legislation we will have to have a properly funded and expanded authority.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 39, it has been brought to my attention by equality practitioners that the notion of mediation in general is anathema where the claimant has legal entitlement.  They say the process will ultimately deter someone from making a claim and that the timescale will be severely extended taking account of the current progress in Circuit Court cases.  They believe the cost of legal representation will be a deterrent for the claimant and perhaps employers and unions. They also fear the requirement for equality officers of the Labour Court to act as witness would compromise their independence.  That must be examined.</P>
    <P>While the title &ldquo;equality mediation officer&rdquo; is supposed to have the same meaning as in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, this Act does not define &ldquo;equality mediation officer&rdquo;.  It is important to address that issue.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not provide for legal aid in cases referred to the director of equality investigations. Civil legal aid can be obtained through the civil courts but the Bill does not allow for legal aid in cases of discrimination using each means of redress.</P>
    <P>Submissions have been made to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform concerning the provisions of sections 41 to 45 by equality officers who operate the current Acts.  Their concerns relate to the uncertainty as to how a complainant will eventually obtain a determination from a deciding forum, be it the director, Circuit Court, Labour Court or High Court, without the case being referred along several parallel routes to obtain redress.</P>
    <P>Remedies in section 46 are severely limited in most instances.  Successful equal pay cases may be dealt with by an order for compensation in the <Col N="741" /> form of arrears of remuneration in respect of so much of the period of employment as begins not more than three years before the date of referral. In other cases, compensation of up to a maximum of two year's pay or £10,000 is specified.  In unfair dismissal cases, the Labour Court may order reinstatement or re-engagement as well as financial compensation.  In gender cases referred directly to the Circuit Court, no ceiling applies and the Circuit Court orders compensation appropriate to the case.  The capping of compensation at such a low level undermines the potential impact of the proposed legislation in deterring discrimination.</P>
    <P>Section 70 provides for an equality review &mdash; that is an audit of equality of opportunity and an examination of the practices, procedures and other relevant factors of, in, and material to employment &mdash; as well as the preparation of an equality action plan by a particular business, group of businesses, industry or sector by or on the initiation of the proposed equality authority. There is grave concern, however, because these powers do not cover businesses with fewer than 50 employees.  Given the large proportion of companies employing fewer than 50, particularly in the services sector where women are predominantly employed, the exclusion of firms of this size from equality review and action plan preparation is not acceptable.  I would envisage a much lower threshold of perhaps ten employees.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this complex and lengthy Bill which is, unfortunately, flawed.  I hope the Minister will deal generously with the many areas we wish to cover in amending it on Committee Stage.  It is important to have legislation that works.  There is no point in having complex legislation with which those affected are not happy and which does not do the job intended.  In all the instances I mentioned there is considerable room for improvement.  This is particularly the case in relation to disability and sexual harassment.  I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept my amendments on these areas.  The Progressive Democrats will support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reminder to Members that he has an open mind and will look at constructive suggestions for improvements to the Bill.  There is room for improvement in parts of the Bill which is intended as part of a package of anti-discrimination measures necessary to enable Ireland to ratify a variety of UN and EU conventions and agreements.  Other parts of the package include the Equal Status Bill due to be debated in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who could be other than in favour of equality in employment?  Could anyone say they do not favour it?  The Bill has the potential to be good but, unfortunately, in practice it will fall far short of what is needed by way of radical change.  More than two decades have passed since women finally won the right to serve as jurors following <Col N="742" /> a court challenge led by Mairín de Burca.  Similarly, 20 years have passed since women were first allowed to remain in the Civil Service following marriage.  Yet women, people with disabilities, ethnic and religious minorities, gays and others still face a wall of discrimination when seeking employment or equal treatment in employment.</P>
    <P>While this legislation is welcome in that it knocks several bricks from the wall of discrimination, I would like to see the wall demolished. Equality is indivisible and cannot be drip fed here and there.  I am concerned about a Bill which outlaws discrimination on nine grounds and then exempts institutions under religious control from all but three of these grounds although I understand the background to this section.  I am particularly sensitive to concerns that institutions with a minority ethos should be allowed to maintain that ethos.  I come from a strange mix of religious ethos in my own background.</P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted effectively permits institutions under religious control to discriminate on grounds of marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, race, nationality or even membership of the travelling community.  In trying to save the position of religious minorities this legislation proposes, for the first time, to enshrine in law discrimination against various other minorities.</P>
    <P>Everyone in the House is sensitive to the concerns of minority religions and is anxious to ensure legislation passed by the Oireachtas will not militate against them.  However, the position of one minority should not be ringfenced in a way which limits the rights of other minorities.  The Bill as framed is specifically inadequate in the way it deals with discrimination in hospitals and, especially, in schools.  It requires revision in that and, perhaps, other respects.  I am concerned that the areas excluded from the scope of the Bill are far too wide.</P>
    <P>If we are to agree, as this Bill suggests, that discrimination is allowable in certain circumstances, I argue that those circumstances need to be clearly spelt out.  They need to be justifiable and require third party determination of every instance of such discrimination.  It would be completely unacceptable to give a blanket authorisation to certain institutions to discriminate without adequate in-built checks and balances.  It is unacceptable for us as legislators representing the electorate, which includes taxpayers who pay for publicly funded institutions, to give any absolute right of discrimination and to allow large areas of employment to have a type of offshore status as regards employment equality.</P>
    <P>Section 37(1) appears to go much too far in allowing discrimination in schools and hospitals. I am aware that the Minister has described those provisions as tightly drawn exemptions.  After a close reading it appears that section 37(1) exempts almost every primary school on all discriminatory grounds other than the three listed, age, disability and gender.  That is because more than 90 per cent of all national schools are institutions <Col N="743" />&ldquo;under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes&rdquo;.  As we are aware, the patrons of those schools are bishops and they appoint the majority of members to school boards of management and to teacher selection boards.  Sadly, parents have secured only recently the right to participate on school management boards.  Having opened up access, I hope this legislation will not allow the wagons to be drawn again in a circle.</P>
    <P>What are described as <i>de facto</i> denominational schools are publicly funded institutions and the teachers employed in them are paid 100 per cent out of State funds paid for by taxpayers.  Often parents do not have a real alternative as between one denominational school and another.  I am seeking to raise a matter on the Adjournment concerning the lack of choice and difficulties faced by parents who have chosen to send their children to multi-denominational schools.  Crumlin multi-denominational school has been served an eviction notice to vacate the premises in Kilmainham it is temporarily occupying on a short-term lease.  The teachers and students of that school are like the wandering Jews &mdash; they have occupied four temporary premises &mdash; and then we talk of discrimination.  It would be interesting to hear the views of parents who are attempting to offer their children multi-denominational education.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that there is an important democratic question at issue here.  Are we prepared to allow workers paid out of public funds to be discriminated against on six grounds, including that of religion?  I am concerned that we may establish a right in law which until now has been only implicit.  It may be argued that discrimination allowed under section 37(1) must be essential or reasonable under the terms of the Bill.  I am seriously concerned about the &ldquo;reasonable in order to avoid offending&rdquo; criterion.  That could turn out to be a licence to discriminate.  There is no indication of the number of members or clients who must be offended for discrimination to be subject to sanction.  The &ldquo;essential&rdquo; criterion refers to the ethos of the institution.  I do not believe there is a definition of the word &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; in the Bill.  I understand that the education Bill dealing with schools and their management will include a definition of the ethos concept. I also understand it may include the parameters within which ethos is to be defined.  I would have thought that the details concerning ethos and its influence, if any, on teacher employment should be dealt with solely under that Bill.</P>
    <P>However, that Bill will not deal with hospitals or non-teaching staff in schools.  Because it is possible that non-teaching staff could be severely and adversely affected by provisions in this legislation in its present manifestation, this Bill could conjure up an appalling vista of a school where potential employees fail to get three positions funded out of the public purse.  X could fail to get a teaching job because of legal discrimination on <Col N="744" /> grounds of religion, Y could fail to be appointed a school secretary because of legal discrimination on grounds of marital status and Z may not be considered for the post of caretaker or grounds-man because of legal discrimination on the grounds that he is a member of the travelling community.  Sections 6 and 36 could constitute a charter for discrimination and this aspect of the Bill needs to be revisited.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the wording of section 16(4) which ostensibly deals with the need to protect children from sexual abuse.  Like all politicians and decent citizens, I share the mounting public concern about the possible access of paedophiles to children.  I welcome the provision that an employer shall not be constrained to hire someone with a conviction for such sexual behaviour. If there is any doubt, the interests of the children must be paramount.  However, the Bill goes a great deal further and I refer to that part which allows an employer on the basis of &ldquo;other reliable information&rdquo; to refuse to employ a person because that person has a propensity to engage in any form of sexual behaviour to which a client or customer of the employer might &ldquo;reasonably object&rdquo;.  I ask Members to consider what forms of sexual behaviour might be envisaged. Would a gay person, a heterosexual who is cohabiting or a person involved in an extramarital relationship, each in its own right a legal form of sexual behaviour, possibly be legally discriminated against if an employer could find a person to object to the potential employee on those grounds?  I fear there is scope for collusion to secure dismissal in such cases.  I suggest that section be reworded to include the phrase &ldquo;illegal sexual behaviour&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome another protection in the Bill, the establishment of an objective independent authority to rule authoritatively on every case of alleged discrimination, including the types apparently allowed under the sections I mentioned. Part V provides for the appointment of a Director of Equality Investigations and under section 38(3) the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 is to be amended to allow the LRC to appoint a member of its staff to that office.  The provision states that the commission may appoint such a person, but I argue that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be used.  That can be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is no requirement to have a director appointed, but a great deal of Part V depends on such an appointment.  There are a number of other key areas where further work needs to be done in regard to that measure.  Section 12(4) provides that the prohibition of discrimination on religious grounds shall not apply in respect of places in a school of nursing in certain defined circumstances.  This proposal is tighter than that provided for in section 37.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the circumstances in which such discrimination is necessary.  Section 36(1) refers to local authority workers and to teachers in primary and post-primary schools.  The provisions <Col N="745" /> referred to in subsection (1) relate to residence, citizenship and proficiency in the Irish language. Perhaps the Minister will explain why provisions relating to residence and citizenship in particular are included for teachers and local authority workers.</P>
    <P>I regret having to raise so many questions about the Bill, but I am sure the Minister will listen to constructive criticism.  A lot of work must be done on Committee Stage to improve this important and historic anti-discrimination charter for employment.  We have come a long way since the debates in this House on the mother and child scheme.  To allow discrimination in over 3,000 schools under religious patronage and in many State funded hospitals appears to tip the balance in favour of religious institutions at the expense of the citizen.</P>
    <P>We all agree a balance must be struck between individual rights, such as the right to work, good employment conditions and promotional opportunities, and the sensitivities of authority and those whom they serve.  This Bill has not struck the right balance.  I look forward to the Minister's assurance that my concerns will be taken into account and that he will amend the legislation accordingly.  I welcome the intention behind the Bill, which will be viewed as a dry run for the long promised equal status legislation.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in balancing conflicting constitutional imperatives.  However, the mix is not adequately balanced.  After decades of discrimination, minorities deserve progressive legislation. Our legislation cannot and should not provide for large equality free zones.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of this long awaited Bill.  Nine years ago, as Minister for Labour, I published a discussion document on unfair dismissals, employment equality and the payment of wages.  Following its publication, I began working on draft legislation in each of those areas.  I was responsible for the subsequent enactment of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991. This work was continued by my successor as Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, and was finished by Deputy O'Rourke during her time as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for labour affairs when she published the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993.  When Deputy Cowen left office in 1992, he was within days of having the Employment Equality Bill debated in the House.  After the election, responsibility for that Bill transferred to the new Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  Some of the ideas the Minister has included in the Bill since then will be of benefit.  However, I question his delay in bringing this important legislation to the House, as well as his decision to omit a number of important provisions suggested in the original discussion document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not always agree with Deputy Eric Byrne but he made a number of valid points.  The Minister should outline the thinking behind his <Col N="746" /> decisions.  If the Minister outlines the agreements he has made with various people and institutions about this and other legislation, then we will know the answer.  The Minister must give us his reasons because the goalposts seem to have moved.  I ask the Minister to outline in detail why these decisions were made because we are entitled to know the reasons.  I have no doubt other people were involved in these decisions, such as the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>This is complex legislation, which has taken almost ten years to prepare.  I grappled with it and other legislation for five years.  However, only a few people will speak on it because we do not have the time or the capacity to examine it.  I am advised it is poorly drafted.  However, I am more concerned about its omissions than its drafting. Perhaps this is not the fault of the Minister because I am sure he is only interested in introducing good legislation.  However, good legislation is not drafted when other people and institutions have a vested interest in it.  I am afraid we will end up with many sections but little content.  I ask the Minister to outline his reasons for section 37.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment of the Fianna Fáil led coalition of 1992-3 to tackle discrimination against minorities, this Bill seeks to combat discrimination on a wide range of grounds.  My party colleagues welcome this development which can only be of benefit to both the workforce and employers.  The Minister can rest assured that he will have the support of the Fianna Fáil Party in his attempts to eliminate discrimination against individuals on the basis of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not without flaws.  Despite the inordinate amount of time apparently devoted to its preparation, many of its provisions fail to achieve their desired objectives.  On occasion the right to equal treatment is unnecessarily limited by sweeping defences.  My Front Bench colleague, Deputy Woods, will pursue these matters on Committee Stage when he will propose a number of amendments which I hope the Minister will accept because they are based on our knowledge of this matter over many years.</P>
    <P>There have been remarkable developments in employment equality law since Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community in 1973.  During the 1970s the Oireachtas passed two landmark Acts which significantly improved the legal position of female employees.  The Anti Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, was designed to tackle the problem of gender-based discrimination in regard to pay and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, made it unlawful to discriminate between individuals on grounds of sex or marital status in recruitment for employment, conditions of employment, training or work experience and in opportunities for promotion. While the 1977 Act was aimed primarily at eliminating discrimination by employers, it also made <Col N="747" /> unlawful discrimination in activities related to employment such as discrimination by organisations providing training courses, trade unions and employment agencies, as well as prohibiting the display or publication of discriminatory advertisements.</P>
    <P>These two Acts went some way towards improving working conditions and eliminating gender discrimination in the workplace.  Over time, however, certain inadequacies became apparent.  For example, there was no redress for women in low paid employment where there was no male comparator.  There was no legislative provision dealing expressly with sexual harassment. It became clear that discrimination in the workplace was based not only on gender but on grounds such as age, disability, race, family, marital status and so on.  A legislative response and an extension of the remit of relevant agencies became necessary.</P>
    <P>In 1987 I proposed that existing legislation be amended to ensure that individuals discriminated against in terms of pay could base their case on a hypothetical comparator if no comparator existed.  Deputy Cowen, as Minister, supported that amendment.  The Minister, however, has abandoned that critically important idea and I would like to know why.</P>

      <P>The legislation was ready when we left Government and there was no difficulty with it.  The Minister either ran away from it or one of his colleagues forced him away from it.  He should tell us which option he decided.  According to Industrial Relations News of 4 July 1996, the Minister abandoned the idea under pressure from the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I would be grateful if he would clarify whether his Cabinet colleagues, Deputies Quinn and Richard Bruton, are responsible for the decision to sideline an idea which has been supported by numerous noteworthy commentators, trade unions and women's groups.  Some of the principles underlying the legislation for a decade have been abandoned, resulting in fudged legislation which will not have the desired effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised the Minister feels that he has to make special provision for the Defence Forces. Why should members of the Defence Forces not be protected against discrimination in the same way as the rest of the population?  Given the Tailhook scandal in the United States and numerous high profile anti-discrimination cases in the US and the UK in regard to their defence forces, is the Minister for Defence blocking the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Taylor?  Is there disagreement <Col N="748" /> within the Cabinet on this matter or has the Government simply decided to ignore the calls of PDFORRA for the protection of members of the Defence Forces from discrimination?</P>
    <P>Why does Part II of the Bill not apply equally to the Naval Service, the prison service and the Garda?  Are the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Law Reform of the opinion that female members of the Garda Síochána, for example, are incapable of arresting violent criminals or of dispersing violent crowds?  The Bill seems to suggest that is so.  Ironically, some sections seem to be imbued with the paternalism which they should seek to dismantle.  That is unacceptable, and I cannot believe that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform does not find it unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago the Labour Court held that freedom from sexual harassment was a condition of work which an employee of either sex was entitled to expect.  The court held that a denial of this freedom was discrimination within the meaning of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  I welcome the fact that for the first time sexual harassment is being addressed specifically in legislation. There are, however, a number of questions which I would like the Minister to consider between now and Committee Stage &mdash; Deputy Woods will put some of these questions but I wish to ask three.  Why does the Bill not protect employees against sexual harassment perpetrated by their employers outside the workplace when the employees in question are not working?  Why does the Bill fail to outlaw homosexual harassment in the same way that it outlaws heterosexual harassment?  Why does the Bill seek to cap the levels of compensation payable to employees who have been discriminated against, despite the decision of the Court of Justice in the Marshall case?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to examine more closely the various exceptions relating to family, age and disability.  There is a danger that these are drafted too widely and could facilitate a small number of unscrupulous employers to avoid their obligations under the legislation.  We are trying to close the net, not make it easier for people to practise discrimination. If we do not do that, the Government will be remembered for making broad sweeping promises and failing to abide by its own rules and standards.  We are lectured about openness, transparency and accountability and told about government from behind a pane of glass. When the going gets tough, however, the window cleaner always seems to go on holidays and the door to open Government slams in the public's face.</P>
    <P>The Government is asking employers to eliminate discrimination in the workplace, but it is worth looking at the Government's record in this area.  Why do many public agencies still impose maximum age limits when recruiting staff?  Why are many public buildings, including the Employment Equality Agency, not easily accessible to people with disabilities?  Why do almost all <Col N="749" /> Government Departments and State agencies not have crèches or crèche facilities?</P>
    <P>We are debating this Bill as the 20th century draws to a close.  We can look back on this century as one in which great progress was made in the workplace, progress which was matched by major developments in labour law.  Thanks to the efforts of Ministers such as Patrick Hillery, Gene Fitzgerald, Michael O'Leary, Deputies Cowen and O'Rourke and others, we have a range of labour legislation which will serve us well as we face up to the challenge of the 21st century.  In the coming weeks we will have an opportunity to make a real impact in the battle against discrimination in the workplace, and the Fianna Fáil Party is determined to play its part and assist the Minister in that battle.  We will propose a number of important amendments to this Bill, which I hope the Minister will take on board.</P>
    <P>I fear an effort will be made not to supply speakers from the Government benches.  The debate could quite easily have collapsed.  When I entered the Chamber there was not a long list of speakers despite the fact that this Bill dealing with discrimination in the workplace, a subject we have been discussing for 30 years, is phenomenally important.  Practically every Member of the House has dealt with such cases in their constituency. It is over nine years since I, as Minister for Labour, published a discussion document. Despite this there is a danger that the Bill, which will affect the lives of thousands of workers, could drift through.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be the subject of a long debate on Second Stage.  Although it was published on 1 July the explanatory memorandum only appeared today.  As not all Deputies are legal experts, parliamentary draftsmen or constitutional lawyers and they do not have the facilities to relate Bills to other legislation, they work from the explanatory memorandum.  When it is not available they cannot prepare adequately.  Even though the number of speakers will be limited, some very good points have been made from both the Opposition and Government benches.  These matters will have to be fleshed out if we are serious about tackling this issue.</P>
    <P>While I do not doubt the Minister's intentions, his colleagues in other Departments have ignored the excellent suggestions put to them by the Minister and his officials who I know want to deal with this matter comprehensively.  If that continues to happen, as in the case of so many other matters, the Bill will not be worth a penny candle.</P>
    <P>Why is the Bill so restrictive?  Why are there so many contradictions, limitations, exclusions and changes?  I would welcome answers to these questions. Decisions have been made by the Cabinet. I am not arguing with him but the Minister has to outline the reasons they were made and what happened.</P>
    <P>I have had an interest in this matter for a long time.  I made my first speeches on the issue at trade union conferences in 1970 and 1971.  I hope we are enacting serious legislation, not mere <Col N="750" /> words.  The Bill, as it stands, cannot be described as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Ahern said, this is an important Bill.  It is the first time in 20 years that employment equality legislation has been brought forward.  I am glad it has been introduced on the Government's initiative and that we were not directed by the European Union to do so.</P>
      <P>I will not pretend I am an expert in relation to the Bill's contents.  Deputy Ahern said he made his first speeches on this issue at trade union conferences in 1970.  I have never been a member of a trade union but was self-employed.</P>
      <P>There are two issues I would like the Government to deal with.  A number of weeks ago an unemployed man came to see me at my clinic.  He had applied to Westport Urban District Council for a job as a traffic warden, an important position, but it wrote back to say that he was not eligible as he was too old.  The council set up a panel of nine or ten people not one of whom accepted the position.  My attitude is that if someone has the ability to do a job well, be they 50, 60, 70 or 80 years of age, they should not be debarred on age grounds.  The council now finds itself in the position where it has to readvertise the post.  I ask the Minister to look at the matter before Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I represent a rural constituency and in the course of my work deal with people with disabilities, many of whom feel they will never have an opportunity to enter the workplace.  County councils and other State agencies have failed to reach the quota of 3 per cent specified.  The least any company which is grant aided by the IDA should do is employ a number of people with disabilities. This should be laid down as a condition.  If a company employs 100 or 200 people there should be a quota of two.  I ask the Minister to look at this matter also.</P>
      <P>A campaign is being conducted by a man called Michael Corbett on behalf of people with disabilities who are seeking the services of personal assistants.  I am talking about people with severe disabilities, those who are blind, confined to wheelchairs and totally dependent on others.  I ask the Minister to work closely with the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, to ensure money is made available in the forthcoming budget to enable personal assistants to be provided.  Under FÁS schemes such assistance is provided for up to one year.  The service should be placed on a statutory footing.</P>
      <P>There are 240,000 people with disabilities, a percentage of whom require personal assistance. Unlike people with disabilities, those seeking grant aid and tax incentives in respect of pilot schemes have the power and wealth to lobby Government to get what they want.  A number of weeks ago on a wet and miserable day people with disabilities from Belmullet, Castlebar and Westport protested outside Leinster House for 12 to 13 hours looking for their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> There is no point in being hypocritical in introducing this Bill.  Many other issues should be dealt with first.  I am talking about people with disabilities.  I ask the Minister to consult his ministerial colleagues on the question of the personal assistants and in that way help people who are unable to look after themselves.  There was never a better time to do this because there is money in the kitty.  The Irish people are well known for helping agencies outside this State experiencing difficulties but it is time we helped our own people.  They are simply looking for a little independence but able bodied persons do not think about these matters.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an incident I raised in the House 12 months ago which was dealt with by the Minister for Social Welfare and his Minister of State.  A group of people with disabilities travelled from Mayo to Dublin under the free travel scheme, but on leaving Dublin they were required to again queue to get their return tickets. Iarnród Éireann, which is losing a great deal of money, examined this problem and I understand it now proposes, on a six months' trial basis, to allow people with disabilities to buy return tickets.  The taxpayers are keeping Iarnród Éireann on the road and the least it can do is make it easy for people with disabilities to travel by allowing them to purchase return tickets.  One can imagine the difficulties experienced by people who travel to Dublin for specialist treatment. They spend the whole day in a hospital and are then expected to queue in Heuston Station for a return ticket.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is time we looked after people with disabilities instead of just talking about the problem.  Action, as well as funding is needed.  We now have the opportunity to help these people and I hope that will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that this is complex legislation.  I admit I have not read the Bill and did not expect to be called upon to contribute to the debate.  However, I was sorry to hear Deputy Ring join others in criticising Iarnród Éireann, although the point he made about people with disabilities being unable to buy return travel tickets is valid.  Such a policy should not have been put in place but I am sure Iarnród Éireann would say it was acting on instructions from the particular Department.</P>
      <P>The explanatory information on the Bill was made available only in the past day or two.  Prior to that I understood the legislation would deal with discrimination in employment but the Minister, in his opening contribution, referred to discrimination because of age, gender, marital status, disabilities, etc.  Is such discrimination widespread?  I agree there is discrimination in some areas but it appears somebody is working off a socialist international agenda of 20 or 30 years ago.  Life has passed us by in regard to many of those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> Legislation should be progressive; it should not try to catch up with custom and practice in society.  There is not a great deal of discrimination in the areas referred to in the Bill; much of it has been dealt with already.  I am not saying discrimination does not exist.  Geographic discrimination is widespread in Dublin but it is not mentioned in the Bill.  It is not based on one's gender, marital status, age or sexual orientation but on where one lives.  This problem is not referred to in the Bill because the international guidelines, from which I presume this legislation is proposed, do not refer to it.  We know geographical discrimination exists in African townships but it exists here also and we are turning a blind eye to it.</P>
    <P>Much of what is contained in the Bill is pseudointellectual and theoretical.  It does not address the problems in the real world.  The Minister of State is smiling but I am exaggerating to make a point.  Geographical discrimination may not be a problem in Wexford or other country towns which have much more of a social mix but that is not the case in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I realise this is a broad area with which Government Departments are dealing but I would have expected employment equality legislation to recognise the problem of geographical discrimination.  The legislation is politically correct in that it refers to excluded sections of our society, including travellers, but it does not address the problem to which I refer.</P>
    <P>People applying for jobs in Dublin are afraid to use their own addresses because they know they will not get even an acknowledgement of their application.  They use the address of a relative or a friend simply to get beyond the first stage of the process.  The Minister of State may say this problem is covered under a particular section in the Bill, and if so that is welcome, but it must be recognised that the problem exists and must be addressed.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 or 30 years people moved out of the city to estates in the suburbs, many of which now have a bad name.  The majority of people living in those areas are decent and hard-working although there are some trouble-makers.  Unfortunately, if an area gets a bad name it becomes an obstacle to employment for the people living in it.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill are intended to address the problems of minorities.  Although those problems are real, they relate only to a small minority.  I hope the issue to which I refer can be dealt with in some way.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>For the umpteenth time we are discussing BSE because every farmer, meat factory worker and haulage worker is concerned with the beef industry.  They are particularly concerned with the Minister's action of last week, which amounted to a major <i>faux pas.</i> It was the biggest cock-up in the agricultural industry since the foundation of the State.  The BSE crisis is on everyone's mind and it has worsened since 20 March.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry getting any support at Cabinet?  He seems to be left on his own and his efforts are weak. That there is neither a Minister nor a Minister for State present to hear this debate is an absolute scandal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a Minister present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Deputy Doyle's move to that portfolio would be an improvement. On Sunday, 20 November there was a damning comment from the Minister for Social Welfare on &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;They are rolling it in out there.&rdquo;  He was referring to farmers.  That Minister, who is part of this Government, and two other back bench snipers from Democratic Left <Col N="754" /> are constantly embarrassing the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, condemning the agriculture industry and playing to the gallery. They use this narrow political agenda, ignoring the fact that the beef industry is much more than farmers.  Thousands of workers, in factories, haulage and services, are involved in the beef industry.</P>
      <P>Why does the Minister not point this out to his colleague in Government?  I am not surprised he has made so little progress, apart from his disastrous mistakes.  At a time when a section of our largest industry is in trouble, nothing can persuade Minister De Rossa or the Tánaiste to set aside their grudge match with the beef trade.  Do they imagine that their supposed urban constituencies will somehow benefit from hardship elsewhere? It is the political hostility of this Government toward the beef trade and its indifference to what they narrowly perceive as a rural agenda that has set the tone of its response to the BSE crisis since 20 March.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be judged on his response to the problem rather than the &ldquo;spin&rdquo; he puts on it. Farmers and others in the agricultural industry are not fools.  Since 20 March, Fianna Fáil has repeatedly called for a concerted political response from the Government.  A Cabinet sub-committee, headed by the Taoiseach, was to address the vital issue of consumer confidence and to campaign politically to keep our foreign markets open.  The failure to do either led to the debacle in the departure lounge of Dublin Airport, where the Minister said the gun was put to his head.  There he signed the deal that brands 25 per cent of our beef output not good enough for Russia.  Some would ask if it was a water pistol that he was talking about.</P>
      <P>I hold the Minister and the Government politically responsible for allowing themselves to be put into that position.  The repeated warnings about serious trouble in the Russian market have been voiced on many occasions here.  The salient political point is that this looming crisis met with a pathetically inadequate response from the Government.  The most important contract for our main industry did not merit the attention of either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste.  Have we yet heard them speak on it in this House?  Apart from token representations when matters were already at a dire impasse, no serious political efforts were made to save the integrity of the Irish beef herd. Today's assertion in the Seanad by the Minister that he will hold the line on the three counties partitioned already is too little, too late.  It is also a clear admission that the agreement was a major blunder.  That is no comfort to the counties concerned. The Minister is personally responsible for a major error of judgement and the Government is guilty of the criminal neglect of the industry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumer confidence is at the heart of the BSE crisis.  Much has been made of the Minister's promise of a system of traceability in the aftermath of the latest twist in the saga.  Commentators have <Col N="755" /> failed to point out that the Minister has promised this system for months.  Something he says he can deliver in weeks has not been produced in recent months.  The irony of the Minister's latter-day conversion to consumer concerns is underlined by the cavalier attitude he took to Fianna Fáil's calls throughout 1995 for such a system.  Who, he demanded, would pay for such a system?  He could not persuade his Government to pay and he did not have the political backbone to ask the producers to pay.  It would have been cheap at twice the price and the Minister will have to accept that. If a proper traceability scheme were in place, the regionalisation agreed with the Russians would not have been on the agenda.</P>
    <P>The Minister should state tonight what the status of the much-promised traceability scheme is.  Has he brought definite proposals to Government? Has he secured funding?  If not, what other funding proposals does he have?  Will he steal more from the arable aid scheme?  The tragedy for the beef trade, and all who depend on it, is that events have totally outpaced the Minister's belated efforts.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry cannot command consumer confidence any longer.  There is an urgent need to explore new structures on how the safety of our food can be assured.</P>
    <P>It is with no joy that I commend this motion.  I wonder how the Minister and the Deputies from the constituencies most affected can agree to this amendment, this pathetic response to our motion. It will be interesting to see whether the Ministers, particularly the Fine Gael Ministers and Deputies, will walk through the lobbies and vote with the Minister in relation to what he did last week.  I do not know whether the Minister has had meetings with the IFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme or individual farmers, but I can assure him they are not saying kind things about him. They believe what has been done is a disaster and has put the beef industry and agriculture into their worst state for a long time.  Since 20 March the Minister has made no response of substance to the crisis they face.</P>

Níl dabht ar bith ann ach go gcuimhneofar ar an Aire Talmhaíochta atá againn agus go mbeidh a ainm á lua i ngach tigh in Éirinn de dheasca an botching a dhein se ar an job seo agus é ag deileáil leis na Rúisigh.</P>
      <P>It is with great concern that I address the House on what I believe to be the greatest crisis ever to face our key national industry.  Tuesday last will go down as one of the darkest days ever for the beef industry with the announcement of the Russian ban on beef from three major beef producing counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is disbelief in Cork that the Government and the Minister would accept a deal which partitions the country and classifies beef produced in Cork as of poorer quality.  It is heartbreaking for <Col N="756" /> a county that has worked so hard to build up the industry and become one of the top food producing regions in Europe.  It is outrageous and unacceptable that this deal was accepted by the Minister when there was no basis, scientific or otherwise, to justify a ban on Irish beef, and certainly not on the produce from counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture has had a terrible year since the BSE problem came to a head in March and cattle prices collapsed with losses of up to £200 per animal.  It is a bombshell to the farming community that the Government allowed another country to create internal barriers which bar certain farmers from trading their beef freely on international markets.  This concession by the Minister plays into the hands of competitors in the international marketplace and creates a dangerous precedent for future negotiations.</P>
    <P>I am outraged that anyone should suggest the quality of beef from Cork should be questioned. Food production in Cork is of the highest quality and excellence, based on a natural, clean, green environment.  The Minister has made a huge mistake which must be immediately rectified.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to go to Russia as a matter of urgency and have the deal renegotiated.  The farmers of Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan cannot be sacrificed and their souls sold, as was done in these botched negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has a strong case to go to Russia. Ireland has the most effective and toughest BSE controls.  The Taoiseach must act swiftly if permanent damage is to be avoided.  Foreign competitors may use this ban to undermine international confidence in the Irish industry while consumers at home will be concerned, leading to a further reduction in beef consumption.</P>
    <P>Why were counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan singled out for exclusion when others have an equal rate of infection?  The Minister's blunder must be corrected immediately.  Otherwise it will devastate the economies of the counties involved and signal to the international beef business that 30 per cent of Irish beef, the amount produced by these three counties, is unsafe.</P>
    <P>A major crisis is looming as a result of the Government's botching of the Russian deal. Farmers are concerned about the ability of the Minister and the Government to defend the cause of the agricultural industry.  I again urge the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister to act urgently on this Russian deal.  They have until 1 November to avert a disaster for Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.  Our current Presidency of the EU must be used to the full to restore hope for the future.  Many in rural Ireland feel this Government has forgotten the plight of the farming community.  It would be terrible if this period of the Irish Presidency were remembered as a time when agriculture went downhill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the Minister wonder why a Deputy from Cork South-Central should speak <Col N="757" /> on BSE and the difficulties manifesting themselves in the beef trade in Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, let me remind him that my constituency has a rural hinterland.  I sympathise with the dilemma in which the Minister finds himself, but he must accept that much of it is of his own making. He is obviously aware that he is the subject of quips in bars around the country.  It has been suggested, for example, that given the Minister's party was involved in the deal partitioning this country in the first place, it is ironic that a Fine Gael Minister should have accepted further partitioning of the country by accepting the Russian beef deal.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil can legitimately claim that from 20 March the Minister was being asked whether there was a problem with the Russian deal and indicated there was none.  The Minister also must accept that we sought a more concentrated and concerted effort to deal with the difficulties, of which our spokespersons were aware, but there was no cohesion in the Government to ensure this was made.  It is galling when this country currently holds the Presidency of the EU, an extremely powerful position.  It is particularly galling, given the Tánaiste's travels around the world, that when this problem came to the fore he made no effort to visit Russia to deal with it on a political level.  The Taoiseach as President of the EU did not have the interests of this country at heart when he could not ensure that a visit to Russia was included in his itinerary so that he could look after this country's major industry by meeting his counterparts in Russia.  It is important to realise that the Russian economy is very dependent on the EU for funds to modernise its industry and agriculture.  It is fair to say the Russians were bargaining from a weak position, given the amount of funds being poured into that country by the EU.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night.  He was rather facile about the difficulties in monitoring BSE in Cork, Monaghan and Tipperary.  His comment was, in effect, &ldquo;you can take it in one door and we can put it out the other&rdquo;.  It is not that easy; it will be almost impossible to monitor.  We are left with a real dilemma.  How will this further partitioning of the country be governed by the Minister and his Department?</P>
      <P>One of the today's national newspapers stated that, in giving way to Russia on this issue, we will have problems with Libya and other markets.  If those countries see that Russia has succeeded in banning beef imports from three counties in Ireland, is it not logical that they will demand something similar if veterinary surgeons from their countries deem it the appropriate course of action to assuage the concerns of their consumers? Has the Minister not dug a hole for himself, the Government and the country?  Is he not likely to have to dig deeper as a result of his decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the gun was put to the Minister's head on the tarmac at Dublin Airport and that <Col N="758" /> he had to make a decision.  Being a bookmaker, it is understandable that he opted to offset the odds and take what he could, giving little thought to the dire consequences for the beef industry in the three counties concerned.  Today I spoke to a meat wholesaler from Cork.  He is concerned because the shop owners he supplies are asking him where his meat is sourced.  If that question is being asked by retailers, the question is also being asked of the retailers by consumers.  Not only do we have a difficulty with the Russian market, but an extremely sensitive situation could arise in this country with regard to the three counties.  I hope it will not happen.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has no difficulty with the beef from the three counties, he should have held his ground.  He should have ensured the veterinary surgeon would not be able to decide for his Government.  He should have asked for further discussions with senior personnel in the Russian Government.  That was the main mistake.  Two mistakes were made.  During the preceding period the Government and the Taoiseach had not done their homework.  In the final analysis, the Minister blinked when the water pistol was put to his head.  I am sorry he did that.</P>
    <P>The policy of divide and conquer has always been a disaster and I am sorry it was adopted in this instance.  I envisage a problem arising with cattle prices.  The Minister might say the price of cattle remained stable last Monday, but he cannot give a guarantee that it will remain stable in the marts in Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>In digging a hole for himself, the Minister has endangered a most important industry.  Our fear is that he will dig that hole deeper.  The concerted effort and performance currently required is not evident in the Government.  I listened to the Minister for Social Welfare, Prionsias De Rossa, speaking on television last Sunday night.  His attitude was that the farmers are rolling it in.  His remarks offered us a perception of the animosity in Democratic Left to the farming community and the major contribution it makes to the economy.</P>
    <P>It is a sad day for the farmers in Cork.  Fine Gael Deputies from that county are having a harrowing time and I am not surprised.  I am sorry for them; it is a difficult situation but they deserve it.  Their chagrin should be addressed to the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is a most serious issue for the beef industry.  The ongoing debate about BSE will allow Members to focus their attention on the industry in a wider context.  Clearly, there is a crisis in the beef industry; it has existed for some time.  There are those who believe the structure of the industry, apart from the current difficulties with BSE, is in need of examination.  Recently, when talking about the future of the agricultural <Col N="759" /> industry the Minister said the cattle available were of elephantine proportions.  Those who are dealing with the agricultural industry on a regular basis would find it difficult to disagree with those sentiments.  If we are to produce the type of animal which the industry requires and which the consumer wants changes need to be made as quickly as possible.  The problem is with the breeding programme pursued at farm level, not only by the individual beef farmer but by a large number of dairy farmers and their decisions on an annual basis.  Much of the supplies for the beef industry have their origins in beef farms throughout the country.  The reality is that many of those decisions are incompatible with the best long-term interests of the beef sector within the agricultural industry as a whole.  If an individual dairy farmer decides to use a breed in his herd in a particular year, it will take the best part of three years before it impacts on the beef industry.</P>
      <P>When the Minister made his observation about the animals being of elephantine proportions he should have followed it up and said the time has come when his Department, or the advisory services acting for and on behalf of his Department, should look at the industry in its totality, the dairy industry, the beef industry and the integrated relationship between the two.  If decisions are being taken in the dairy sector which are incompatible with the best interests in the beef sector then they need to be addressed immediately.  I am not blaming the Minister particularly.  The advisory services need to examine this issue.</P>
      <P>The reality is that if dairy farmers are using, for instance, Holstein Friesians and come back into the beef production chain this is perhaps an excuse for the use of angel dust.  It is not possible to produce beef cattle within a certain budget and to make a reasonable margin of profit by using those breeds to produce beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to BSE and the most recent problem, three counties, my neighbouring county of Monaghan and counties Cork and Tipperary have been excluded from the Russian market and are in danger from being excluded from other markets also.  This is a very serious development.  We cannot predict what will happen in the next month or the next two months.  The Minister cannot predict what will happen during that period. God forbid, but if there are outbreaks of additional cases of BSE in some other county what will happen?  Will they be added to the hit list?  Will we finish up with the whole country being banned from all the markets which are essential to our survival?  At a time when the Minister is President of the Council of Ministers of Agriculture and bearing in mind that the BSE crisis affects the beef industry throughout Europe, particularly in Britain, we are not sinners, we are sinned against.  The decision of the then Minister in the period around 1989 to slaughter out was clearly a wise one.  At the time I am sure it was not palatable medicine for individual farmers but it was the right decision.  The <Col N="760" /> decisiveness of that decision should be bearing better fruit for the industry.  I will have an opportunity later in the week to go into more detail on specific points.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Noel Davern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Disbelief is the only word I can use to describe the Minister's actions.  He has presided over the most dangerous precedent ever. He has admitted we have BSE when in factwe had 36 cases this year, one of which is being investigated by the Garda Síochána as being deliberately induced somewhere along the line.</P>
      <P>Wexford has four cases of BSE, the same number as the whole of County Tipperary.  There are 279,000 animals in Wexford while we have 642,000 in north and south Tipperary yet Tipperary is excluded while Wexford is not.  Earlier seven counties were to be excluded.  The Minister sacrificed Tipperary for the sake of expediency so unless we have rodeo shows or make our animals pets there is no future for beef farmers, particularly in North and South Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I support our county council which has implemented the Abattoirs Act since October 1992 when other counties did not, at a cost to our ratepayers of £140,000 a year.  Under the Act every animal is examined before and after slaughter to guarantee to consumers in our constituency that those animals are free from all induced products and antibiotics, yet other counties do not provide this service.  The Minister has done nothing about that despite the fact that we went to the Minister of State two years ago when the Minister would not meet us on the issue but he did nothing about it.  What are we to say to the people?  They have paid money to provide a good service to guarantee our consumers yet the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry cannot guarantee that animals from South Tipperary abattoirs going to the meat factories are BSE free.  The Minister could not give that guarantee to the Russians but I stand over it.</P>
      <P>What will happen if the Iranians say they will not accept beef from Limerick.  If they say they will not accept beef from Wexford, the Minister will certainly do something about it.  There is no case of BSE in south Tipperary.  Veterinarywise, under the County Council Act, we are a different regime.  North Tipperary has four cases of BSE, one of which is being investigated, yet we are all lumped in the same boat.  The Minister has destroyed the name of Tipperary, which we have spent years building up, by his acquiescence and his cowardly act on the steps of the plane &mdash; as I heard one of his backbenchers say &mdash; trying to sort out which papers he would sign quickly before the Russian negotiator would board the plane.  The Minister has destroyed the beef industry in Tipperary, an industry of which we are proud and in which we have confidence.  Will he tell the farmers of the Golden Vale they have no future?  Already he has said there will be 30,000 fewer farmers in 25 years.  He is now ensuring that figure will rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> One of the Labour Party backbenchers said on local radio that the Russians told him they had found BSE in a product from south Tipperary. The Minister said he had no choice, he did.  He represents the Twenty-six Counties, not 23.  I will have an opportunity on Thursday to say a little more about this but the Minister should be aware that he has let down the farmers of County Tipperary. He should come down now and give them the glib talk which he tried to give them previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that you are from Monaghan, Chairman, I look to you to ensure that I am given the opportunity to put my point across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message I want to send to consumers is that the difficulties we experienced with the Russian market &mdash; or could experience in other markets &mdash; were directly linked to the number of cases of BSE.  Last year there were 16 while the previous year there were 19 cases.  To date this year there have been 38 cases, and there will be more.  I want to make it clear that we have put in place the tightest controls in the world.  I very much regret that these controls were not in place five years ago.  They include taking the depopulated meat out of the food chain.  Fianna Fáil in Government did not do this and I introduced this control last January.  We are also taking out the cohorts &mdash; in other words, if a cow in County Cork is infected we trace the animals which were previously in the same herd and which might have eaten the same foodstuffs &mdash; and the progeny. Most important of all &mdash; and people can be reassured about this &mdash; I am satisfied from the <Col N="762" /> veterinary evidence that nearly all these extra cases can be attributed to eating infected meat and bonemeal.  We have had a ban since 1990 and many of the animals now infected with BSE were born after this date.  I have put in place the toughest licensing measures and set up a task force to implement the control, sale, purchase and distribution of meat and bonemeal.  I want people to be assured about the effectiveness of these controls. I do not want the issue to be turned into a political football as it would take from the reassurances which can be given to consumers.</P>
    <P>I move my amendment for two reasons: first, because it is a true and accurate reflection of the real situation and of my actions and those of the Government and, second, because the Opposition motion is naturally opportunistic, unrealistic and self-contradictory.  The statement by Stephen Dorrell in the House of Commons on 20 March last set off a sequence of events which impacted on every aspect of the beef industry.  It raised the spectre, however tenuous &mdash; and in my view it is very tenuous &mdash; of a link between BSE and CJD, generated a wave of consumer hysteria, created an immediate drop in beef consumption and led to a total ban on beef and cattle exports from the UK and the planned destruction, by incineration, of one million animals.  These were dramatic events by any standards.  One would sometimes think that all this was my fault.  However, the truth is that these are internationally acknowledged events.</P>
    <P>Seven months after the event we have reached the position where a ban on the UK remains in place for the foreseeable future, where a flurry of scientific activity is taking place on BSE and related issues and where all aspects of our controls on BSE have been subjected to the most detailed examination.  Last Sunday and Monday I attended SIAL, the largest food marketing event in the world, which this year was held in France. While there are particular difficulties in the French market, I am glad to say that confidence in the product is returning and, although it is down 21 per cent in France, consumption is beginning to increase.  We must recognise that beef as a product has suffered and it is doubtful if it will ever fully recover its primary position within the meat sector relative to pig and poultry meat.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a major producer of beef; it is the largest exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere. We are more dependent economically on beef than any other member state; we are more dependent on it than Europe is on agriculture as a whole.  The other side of the coin is that we have more to lose if there is a backlash against the product.  We, rightly, took considerable time and effort to reassure our consumers.  Much time and attention has been devoted to ensuring that the trade rules in Europe allow full access for our products to European markets.  There are legal rights involved and mischievousness should not give rise to a scare about our exports to Europe. These rights are sacrosanct and are guaranteed <Col N="763" /> under existing rules.  The ring-fencing of the export ban to Britain was successfully achieved.</P>
    <P>Our markets in third countries deserve the same time and attention.  They are entitled to the same assurances and to the same detailed answers to technical questions.  Much of this has been done through direct contact between the respective veterinary services and through our embassies and An Bord Bia.  I wish to point out to Fianna Fáil Deputies that this crisis began in 1989.  However, no Government sub-committee was set up at that stage.  The Iran market was closed in 1990 and remained closed for three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Each third country will make up its mind on the basis of its analysis of the scientific data, on the efficiency of our controls and on its perception of the risks involved.  It is our task to have sound and effective controls and to put forward the scientific and technical agreements to enable them to have confidence in our product. It is generally accepted that we have good controls in relation to BSE, and these have been refined and perfected since the first elements of the system were put in place in 1990.</P>
      <P>The suggestions by Deputy Kirk and others that the depopulation policy is the full answer are naive and we must not lull ourselves into a false sense of security on this point, as some Members on the opposite benches seem to have done.  The control regime on BSE is complex and detailed and requires the proper and full implementation of a series of measures across the different elements of the beef industry.  For example, I have found it necessary to strengthen the implementation of the ban on meat and bonemeal, which is the source of the problem in the first instance.  It has also been necessary to broaden the scope of the depopulation policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have outlined to the House the events in regard to the Russian market.  The signing of the veterinary Protocol was the culmination of a sequence of events over a period of two months. There was a choice between signing or not signing the Protocol, and either decision would have had consequences.  It was not a question of breaking <Col N="764" /> under pressure, of losing nerve or conceding too soon, as has been presented by some quarters.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested I should have played for time and continued discussions up to 1 November.  Anyone with the remotest knowledge of the meat trade will say contracts are negotiated in advance and it takes weeks to organise and supply a contract of the type and volume which goes to Russia.  I would have been faced with the prospect I was faced with last Easter when I had boats bobbing up and down in the bay of Alexandria, trying to get into Egypt which had imposed an overnight ban.  Is that what people in practical terms are suggesting?  No new contracts would have been signed from the moment Dr. Avilov returned, because of their state purchasing system.  The trade needed to know where it would stand after 1 November. The lag time involved meant we were already past midnight in that regard.  By signing the Protocol I protected our position in the Russian market and I have ensured the momentum of increasing exports to that market.  We will continue to sell large quantities of beef to Russia and we have the option of reviewing the condition of exclusion zones in three months.  Contracts are now being signed for the period ahead.  I took the correct decision in signing the Protocol and I believe that events are already proving that.</P>

The relationship the Russian Department of Agriculture, their medical, health and veterinary services have with Ireland is something I value.  I wish to ensure it continues on an amicable and profitable basis in the future.  Countries which import from us want assurances on animal and public health issues.  If someone is seriously suggesting we should not hold these discussions at a technical level, they are not in the real world nor are they acting in the best interests of our industry.  As I pointed out in the Seanad today, if the Irish chief veterinary officer submitted a report to the Minister of Health that a consignment of poultry meat or vodka coming from Russia should be banned, would anyone in this House say the Government should override it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with political intervention and no compunction in involving myself directly in these issues.  However, it must be at the right time, in the right context and in circumstances where political intervention will be helpful.  The reality is that Dr. Avilov holds the responsibility in this area and there has been considerable prior political contact from Prime Ministerial level downwards.  As confirmed by the Russians, the ban would have been in effect but for that political contact.  I am intrigued by the argument that we should have an independent food inspectorate while at the same time criticising <Col N="767" /> the idea that the decision on this issue should be left to the Russian chief veterinary officer.</P>
      <P>This decision should be judged on three criteria, which I am happy to be judged on.  These are, whether other countries follow suit; second, whether differentiated pricing will happen in the counties concerned, relevant to the rest of Ireland; and third, whether we continue to sell large volumes to Russia.  I maintain that on all three scores which are vital to farmers' incomes I will be totally vindicated.  I have no evidence that either of the first two scenarios will happen.  The report in <i>The Examiner</i> that there was a threat Iran and Libya would follow suit is absolute and total nonsense.  They never checked with our Department.  There is no indication of that information and it is mischievous and alarmist in the extreme.</P>

I have made clear on many occasions that Iran had sought regionalisation, which I rejected, before the Russians sought it.  It has been implied that at the last minute there was some arm wrestling.  I have given thought to regionalisation and discussed it with Government colleagues for the last two or three weeks before this decision was made.  It was a cold, calculated decision, made in the national interests of the beef industry.  Anyone who had regard to the national interest would make the same decision.</P>

We would not have to go to extremes to provide assurances to third countries.  The sad fact is that we do have BSE and had more this year than in any previous year.  Discussions with third countries are held in this framework.  They consider that we have BSE, albeit at a low level. We have to be prepared for hard questions and strict conditions.  We may think some of these conditions unreasonable and unscientific. However, we are the sellers and they are the buyers. That fact seems to have escaped a lot of commentators.</P>

Given the nature of this problem, the record of this Government stands up to the most critical scrutiny.  It will stand it against that of any previous Minister who had to deal with BSE, with not a fraction of the level of difficulty I or other countries have faced. Consumption is now recovering in this country and across Europe.  Our beef exports have held up much better than expected.  There have been predictions that we would take at least 100,000 tonnes into intervention this autumn, which has not happened.  There has been a consistent flow of product out of this country over the past few months and it is widely recognised that our beef export trade has been performing very well.  Russia has taken the lion's share but a range of other markets has also performed well.  The Saudi Arabian market reopened last Tuesday.  This is a <Col N="769" /> pivotal and high priced market in the Gulf region. It is worth £50 million per annum.  Producer prices have stabilised over the past few weeks and if anything, the underlying trend has been upwards.</P>

      <P>My objective is to ensure the measures taken are balanced and fair and that they will achieve the desired result.  I will also ensure that we will protect our production base. Given our dependence on beef and on the export outlet we have more to lose from an unbalanced beef market than any other member state.  That argument has been misconstrued and perhaps deliberately misunderstood.  While I am not saying we should accept measures that are against the best interests of our industry, it is in our best interests to address the reality of the market as it stands and if hard decisions are necessary they should be made sooner rather than later so that we can get the necessary benefits.  We will not do farmers or the industry any favours by allowing the problem, the overhang of beef on the market, to spill over into 1977.  I want farmers to know I am not being distracted from this important task, which must be addressed urgently.  A compensation package of more than £70 million has been <Col N="770" /> secured to assist farmers and this money was paid out rapidly and recently.</P>

      <P>It may not cover all the losses but it will go a long way towards relieving the difficulties. There has been a very wide spread of assistance across the different categories of beef producers, with assistance for heifer producers for the first time, and for producers of bulls and live exports.  The deseasonalisation premium has been secured almost in perpetuity and will be worth £16 million a year uniquely to Irish producers.  It will help farmers make decisions and have confidence in the early part of next year.  On 1 January farmers will get £58 more per head because of decisions I negotiated in Brussels.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us deals with the arbitrary ban on the export of beef to Russia from three counties.  Beef exports have been banned from three counties while we are importing junk foreign poultry contaminated with salmonella which could cause serious damage to our poultry industry.  Last Tuesday's announcement by the Minister to ban exports of beef to Russia from Counties Cork, Monaghan and Tipperary set a dangerous precedent which will haunt the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for many years.  By excluding exports from those counties, he is excluding between 25 and 30 per cent of the national herd.  That is selective discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1989 ten counties have had a higher incidence of BSE than County Monaghan and three others had a similar incidence.  In all, 13 counties have had a similar incidence to County Monaghan.  With the exception of five counties, the other 21 had outbreaks since 1990.  We had none from 1990 to 1996 when there were three. <Col N="773" /> Some of those outbreaks were questionable and I do not know whether they have been fully examined by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>It is selective discrimination.  During the early 1980s the Border region was devastated by the rise in fuel prices introduced by the Coalition Government's budgets of 1983 and 1984.  People were taking buses from Cork and Dublin to shop north of the Border.  That caused the closure of filling stations as well as devastating the whole area.  We sent deputations to the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance asking them to help the Border areas which had suffered so much economically through Government decisions to raise the price of petrol and many other products.  The stock answer, however, was that it is not possible to legislate for a region, yet the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has done just that.  Not only did he legislate for one region but for three regions.  For that alone the Minister must be condemned.</P>
    <P>On this occasion the Russians called the tune. With a population of 51,000, County Monaghan has the highest number of people <i>per capita</i> employed in the food industry but only a small percentage of them are in the beef industry.  Most are engaged in poultry production like duck, turkey and broiler hens.  All the ducks produced in Monaghan are processed and exported under a local Monaghan brand.  Some 75 to 80 per cent of turkeys are produced in County Monaghan by Grove Turkeys.  My great fear is that once County Monaghan has been branded it will remain so.  A number of factories in the county make prepared foods for Aer Lingus and other companies and in so doing they create much employment which is important for the economy.  When a county is victimised it has an effect on the meat industry generally.</P>
    <P>Most of the county's food industries, and all of them in the poultry sector, were set up without the support of primary producers and never got a penny of grant aid or other assistance.  The only money that went into the region was through FEOGA for processing plants.  Such industries will be hard hit because they have been branded and are carrying that stigma of the ban.  It is very serious.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about traceability and the movement of animals.  Six years ago TB was at its worst in Monaghan, Cavan and South Fermanagh. At the time we visited the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to have meetings with officials there and with vets in the county. We were told that computerisation was all that was needed.  I suggested the introduction of a stock register similar to that in Northern Ireland where farmers must record the movement of all cattle into and out of herds.  According to my notes of those meetings six years ago we were told that computerisation would be introduced within two years, yet I am informed that computerisation has been on the back burner.  The dust may now be wiped off the proposal and <Col N="774" /> there will be much talk about what will be done but it should have been done earlier.  Our concern was to have closer tabs kept on the movement of animals.</P>
    <P>Questions are being asked about how genuine the outbreaks of BSE are.  The numbers are, admittedly, not high and have not been since 1989.  It is sad to compare these figures with the four digit ones in the North.  Have the Minister's officials and vets examined each outbreak closely and scientifically?  Are they satisfied that they are genuine cases or were they imposed?  That is one of the biggest fears people have about the increase in BSE cases, even if it only totals three in County Monaghan.  There should be a closer examination of such cases to make sure the outbreaks are genuine.  In that case we can make sure it does not happen again.  The Minister mentioned people's concern that since action was taken in 1989 three or four year old cattle are still displaying instances of BSE.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned the increase in cases of salmonella in Cork due to imported foreign poultry. That was reported in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> Salmonella is the most dreaded poultry disease and would prompt departmental officials to consider drastic action like slaughter.  There is no need for such imports.  It is all very well to talk about a common market, but imported products should be of a standard and should be closely examined. We should not have alerts about the high incidence of salmonealla.  We have adequate primary producers able to produce good quality products.</P>
    <P>Since the market opened up I tabled many questions about restrictions or examinations on imported turkey chicks or broiler chicks and asked if the Department was satisfied that adequate controls were in place.  I am not being alarmist but poultry producers are concerned.  I am concerned for producers who have invested a large amount of money in building up their businesses. They did not get grant aid but loans from their bank managers who had confidence in them. As the newspapers reported, junk foreign poultry is replacing on the shelves the produce on which our producers spent so much money in preparing it for the market.  There is a number of areas involved and the Minister should take cognisance of them as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Surveys should be carried out not only of our production but of imports which should be closely scrutinised.  It was proved last week that customers who buy our produce are hard to please and we should be equally hard to please, especially if there is any question of salmonella or other infected imported produce.  There should be close examination of imported day old chicks.</P>

      <P>They have fallen here and the producers are losing money.  From checking the facts and figures and examining the accounts of some of my clients, I am aware that farmers are losing money.  That is the bottom line.  Last Tuesday when the Minister announced that 25 per cent of the beef industry was to be left out in the cold, he stated that a gun was placed to his head and he was forced to accept that counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, were to be precluded from exporting beef to Russia.</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister had to make a decision on the day, but from his speech here I note that he was mulling over it for a few months. That makes it worse.  He does not appear to realise the importance of the beef industry.  The records reveal that my county has quite an exemplary record in terms of the incidents of BSE.  I am informed there was only one incident of BSE in my part of the county and that area holds the majority of cattle in Cork.  During the past few weeks constituents from all political parties have expressed disgust about what has happened and what the Minister has done to the industry in East Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time a Minister has put a question mark over the quality of our beef.  He has given an imprimatur to those who are trying to undermine the industry.  Other people have also undermined it, for instance those who have fed angel dust and growth promoters to animals. However, they are receiving their just deserts from the courts.  The Minister will soon face a jury comprised of the Irish people and his backbenchers, who have been mute in the Chamber, will also face their constituents.  Outside the Dáil they raised the questions we raised.  They questioned the doubtful decision of the Minister.  They realise what the Minister has done and what his supporters in Government have done is not for the benefit of the nation.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, said on the Farrell programme that farmers are rolling it in.  To translate that into simple English he was saying the farmers were making too much money.  As an accountant with a number of farmers on my books, I can tell him they are not rolling it in.  A total of 80 per cent of the farmers are getting less than the average industrial wage.  Senator Sherlock, a member of that Minister's party, who <Col N="776" /> questioned what has been happening recently in the <i>Examiner</i> gets quite a few votes from small farmers.  Would he agree with the Minister, Deputy De Rossa?  We have not heard from the Minister's partners, Deputies Lynch or Byrne. They have been quiet because they do not support him.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there has been a cohesive approach by the Government to this matter.  He has been joined by his ministerial colleague from Wexford, but there is no cohesiveness from Dublin or from any other part of the country.  Where is the rest of the Labour Party?  They are missing.</P>

      <P>The Minister can check the record on everything related to agriculture in this House for the past two and a half years and he will note that he did not receive support from other members of the Government.  The Minister has been left out on his own.  He stated there was no positive suggestion from this side of the House.  The positive suggestion in our motion is that the Government should immediately make direct political and diplomatic representations through the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other senior Ministers at the highest level with all foreign markets to ensure that the sale of Irish cattle abroad and thousands of jobs at home dependent on them are effectively protected and promoted. That is a positive suggestion.  I challenge all the backbenchers who have been speaking with forked tongues to come in here tomorrow night and say what they really feel about the Minister's actions.</P>
      <P>There is a great need to restore the Irish and international customer confidence in beef to increase consumption.  To do this it is necessary to establish a traceability system, the cost of which would be £16 million to £18 million.  I hope in the Estimates the Minister has ensured he will secure the money to put such a traceability system into operation.  Irrespective of what producers do or how clean beef is, if customers do not have confidence in the industry and in the product they will not buy it.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, should row in behind the Minister to secure the necessary money to put such a system into operation.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this topic and I thank the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, for coming here.</P>
      <P>This is another fine mess the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, has got the country into. Almost 100 tonnes of hazardous hospital waste is building up in hospital grounds throughout the country.  This is a needless crisis which should have been anticipated and averted.  In June the UK authorities implemented its national waste management plan.  This gave the Departments of Health and the Environment almost five months' notice that this crisis might occur.  What have they done during those five months to avert it?  Can the Minister guarantee the safety of the refrigeration process used in our hospitals at present?  Is the Department of Health inspectorate monitoring the situation, visiting the hospitals and reporting back to the Minister, who, in turn, will report back to this House?</P>
      <P>Some 100 tonnes of waste is a lot of waste after only a fortnight.  Such clinical waste must be stored in absolute safety.  I am worried that unreliable storage could unleash a public health scare so powerful it could not be contemplated.  The Government must ensure we accept responsibility for dealing with our own waste on a long-term basis.  We have the technology to do it.  Procedures in Cork University Hospital demonstrate that hospitals are capable of dealing with their own clinical waste on site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must put them in every other hospital as well.  Other hospitals must follow the example of Cork University Hospital. It has met all the most critical tests and should be a working model for all hospitals.  However, what has happened in Cork has not happened anywhere else because there is no political leadership to drive it along.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy of exporting hospital waste is short-sighted and short-term.  The Government bears full and direct responsibility for this crisis.  The precariousness of our policy of expecting other countries to take our policy of hospital waste <i>ad infinitum</i> has now been exposed.  Such an arrangement is subject to factors beyond our control.  The British BSE crisis made enormous additional demands on its incineration capacity.  It was not, therefore, surprising that we were left high and dry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost 100 tonnes of toxic clinical waste has built up since the British ban was imposed last October.  Hospital managers have said they will not be able to cope with this health crisis if the ban lasts for another two weeks.  The Minister has put our entire healthcare service at risk by his costly, dangerous, stop-gap arrangement.  There is an onus on the Minister for Health to introduce <Col N="778" /> a proper system of hospital waste disposal as a matter of urgency.  Other hospitals must be given the resources to follow the example set by Cork University Hospital.  The Minister must grasp the nettle.  I appeal to him to put in place a safe and reliable system to deal with our hazardous waste and to eliminate the need to seek overseas disposal units.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, who is unable to be present.  I thank Deputy Quill for giving me the opportunity to respond to this issue.  I hope I can allay her fears and answer the questions she posed.  In doing so, I hope I will be able to clear up some of the misconceptions and misinformation that seem to abound at present in relation to hospital waste.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health is promoting a well formulated and well publicised policy to deal with healthcare waste.  This policy is based on the provision in Ireland of appropriate, non-incineration treatment facilities to deal with all healthcare waste arising here.  The provision of this service is already at tender stage; a contractor is likely to be appointed by December and the service is likely to be fully operational by the end of 1997. This policy is being pursued jointly with the authorities in Northern Ireland.  It was originally intended that this service would be operational by the end of this year.  The timescale for the project was, however, delayed arising from the agreement to develop a joint approach in association with the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland.  I am certain Deputies will readily accept the substantial benefits which attach to the development of solutions to environmental issues on an all-Ireland basis. When this service is in place next year, Ireland will be among the world leaders in having one of the most advanced and environmentally friendly health waste management systems.</P>
      <P>The background to the current temporary problem is that, historically, the waste arising in the health services was incinerated in relatively simple hospital incinerators.  These incinerators could not be brought up to modern environmental standards required for licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Since October 1995, when most hospital incinerators were taken out of use following the introduction of new licensing arrangements, many hospitals contracted with private waste management companies to have their healthcare risk waste processed in Britain.  In June this year the UK Department of the Environment introduced a management plan for export and import of waste which banned the importation into Britain of most healthcare risk waste.  UK contractors with current permits continued importing waste.  Since 9 October the more stringent application of the plan has resulted in some of the contractors not being able to continue this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> There is temporary problem in relation to the disposal of healthcare risk waste.  The facilities available in Ireland are not sufficient to dispose of all the healthcare risk waste.  This situation is being addressed immediately by the provision of refrigerated storage facilities on a temporary basis &mdash; probably no more than a few weeks &mdash; and the establishment of disposal routes to other countries.  The Department of Health has today agreed in principle arrangements for the export of healthcare risk waste to Holland where it will be incinerated.  It is anticipated that exports will commence early next month.  Health agencies will be briefed tomorrow as to the arrangements.  In the meantime, they should continue to store waste on site in refrigerated containers.  I wish to state emphatically that these storage arrangements constitute no environmental or public health risk.</P>
    <P>I could not support any proposal to revert to the use of the outdated incineration facilities which existed up to 1995.  I fully support the actions of the Minister for Health and I am confident that the current temporary difficulties will be quickly resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for selecting this subject and I thank the Minister for being present &mdash; Ministers of State are sent in too often to reply to these issues.  The attributed statements of Jean Francois Verstrynger, director of the Cohesion Fund, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Thursday, 17 October were received in Mayo with deep shock and dismay.  He stated that he is about to withdraw Cohesion Fund financing for two waste water sewerage schemes, in Waterford and Tramore. He stated that while the details have been agreed for years the location and other issues still have not been finalised.  He went on to say: &ldquo;it is only two plants out of a total of 40 plants but still...&rdquo;.  It appears Mr. Verstrynger is more concerned with budgets and the number of projects seeking Cohesion Funds than with the long-term environmental damage that will ensue if work on the Westport sewage plant is further delayed, which will most certainly be the case if Cohesion Funds are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night Mayo County Council unanimously supported a motion calling on the Minister not to allow the withdrawal or suspension of Cohesion Funds for a scheme which would treat 750,000 gallons of raw sewage a day which flows into Clew Bay.  The council awaits the Minister's decision on the CPO proceedings and public inquiry held more than five months ago.  Last week the Minister informed me that he intended <Col N="780" /> to make a decision soon.  While he must act in a quasi-judicial role, the time is long past for a decision on the matter.  The Minister's officials informed me that they were aware from informal discussions of the Cohesion Fund Monitoring Committee that the Westport scheme was under threat, and the sole reason relates to the delays.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Mayo County Council and the people affected, I ask the Minister to make a decision on the inspector's report relating to the CPO inquiry and not to allow any scheme to be deselected by non-elected, non-resident Eurocrats.  Mayo County Council has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in processing this scheme to date.  An EU directive states that by the year 2001 all bathing waters must be free of untreated discharges.</P>
    <P>Westport and Westport House demesne depend on a vibrant tourism industry, on which millions of pounds are spent.  As a result of planning permission granted in the area, flows of untreated waste into Clew Bay will be substantially increased.  Recognising the importance of the tourism and pharmaceutical industries &mdash; nearly 800 persons are employed in Allergan in Westport &mdash; I am satisfied that the location for the sewage treatment plant, chosen after prolonged investigation by experts employed by Mayo County Council, is the optimum site. Rather than have an adverse effect on Westport House demesne, it will enhance its stature because the sewage plant would be located at a vicinity where at present untreated sewage is discharged.</P>
    <P>The hoi polloi of urban sophistication who signed a petition objecting to the proposed site can feel justly proud that Clew Bay, a premier tourist resort in Connacht, is threatened with the loss of £14 million in European funding, money which could be used to upgrade our infrastructure. While there is little or no Labour mandate in Mayo, there is a substantial Fine Gael mandate and I ask the Minister to exercise the authority vested in him and his Department and use whatever mechanisms are at his disposal to reverse the threat of immediate withdrawal of funds.  I make that request in the full knowledge that there are more applications for Cohesion Funds than there are funds available.  It will be most interesting to see what will happen in this case.  I speculate on whether Westport's difficulties will become another constituency's opportunity to have its scheme moved up the priority ladder, thereby obtaining funding.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, when replying, will not read a speech prepared several hours before I made my contribution.  He should use his authority, which I respect, and his spontaneity in answering my question.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Hughes, for giving me an opportunity to put on record my concerns about the proposed sewage treatment plant in Tramore.  The blame for this problem lies fairly and squarely with Waterford <Col N="781" /> Country Council and the Department of the Environment, which put forward a plan with which the Department of the Marine was not happy.  It was evident that a foreshore licence would not be granted in the area specified by Waterford County Council.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment as far back as 3 March 1993 and a decision is still awaited on the matter.  In the past two months or so the Department of the Marine turned down the foreshore application, a decision which should have been foreseen three and a half years ago.  It would have been prudent at that stage to examine the alternative, to extend the present outfall pipe into the bay.  I ask the Minister to ensure this money is not lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite for raising this question and giving me the opportunity to explain the current position in regard to these important schemes and the recently reported comments to which the Deputies have referred.  I am greatly impressed by the expectation of Deputy Hughes that hours of preparation are involved in these matters.  I assure him that the frenetic pace of action in Departments does not allow such a level of preparation.  I wish to give the Deputies a frank and clear answer to the questions they posed.</P>
      <P>Applications for Cohesion Fund assistance for stage one of the Westport and Tramore waste water schemes were submitted to the European Commission in June 1993.  Approval for these applications, which covered initial planning of the schemes, was given by the Commission in March 1994.  However, a number of unavoidable delays, well known to the Deputies opposite, have since been encountered in completing planning.  In the case of the Tramore scheme the application for a foreshore licence for the outfall was refused by the Minister for the Marine after a lengthy examination. I did not submit the application, it was submitted by Waterford County Council, with which I presume Deputy Kenneally has some influence.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The council is now considering alternative outfall arrangements and I have approved its proposals to undertake site investigations which will facilitate this.</P>
      <P>The planning phase of the Westport scheme included the acquisition of sites for the treatment plant and pumping stations.  Mayo County Council was unable to acquire the site for the treatment works by agreement and decided to proceed by way of compulsory purchase order.  A local public inquiry has been held into the objections made to me in regard to the CPO and I will give a decision on the matter as soon as possible. There are legal procedures involved and the objectors have a right to have their voice heard and their views properly considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> Because of the delays in finalising the planning of the two schemes, the European Commission has indicated that the current approvals, which relate to the planning phases only, should be closed off.  This process does not affect the submission of applications for Cohesion Fund assistance for the construction of the schemes.  A further Cohesion Fund application to cover all further stages of the Tramore scheme has been submitted to the Commission and work is under way on identifying suitable alternative outfall arrangements.  The completion of planning, including the preparation of a new environmental impact statement and the necessary foreshore licence application, will take some time to finalise, but I am satisfied these matters are being advanced as quickly as possible.  In the case of Westport it is proposed to submit a further application for Cohesion Fund assistance when the outstanding planning matters, including the acquisition of a suitable site, have been completed.</P>
    <P>The need for both schemes is fully accepted and I appreciate the Deputies' concerns regarding the possibility of losing EU funding.  In the final analysis, it will be a matter for the Commission to allocate funding between the eligible projects submitted by the Government, and there will be sufficient eligible projects to draw down every available pound.  Every step is being taken by my Department, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, to have the outstanding planning issues resolved as quickly as possible with a view to securing Cohesion Funds for these two important schemes.  The Commission is being fully informed of progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and while I have nothing personal against the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, I regret that neither the Minister for Justice nor the Minister of State at her Department is present.</P>
      <P>Several months ago Garda management issued a secret directive which provides that, in the case of most indictable offences, the alleged perpetrator cannot be charged until a file has been prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions who issues a direction as to whether a prosecution should take place.  If the alleged perpetrator has been arrested, he is to be released until the Director of Public Prosecutions decides whether to prosecute.  This represents a fundamental change in procedure.  It was never publicly announced or debated in this House and nobody, so far as I am aware, has accepted accountability or responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of this directive people who are suspected of having committed the most heinous crimes have to be released for an indefinite period until the Director of Public Prosecutions decides whether they should be charged.  The consequences of this were graphically illustrated <Col N="783" /> in the Murray case heard by the Central Criminal Court last Thursday.  Murray was arrested for violently raping a woman in her apartment but had to be released until a file was prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Director of Public Prosecutions issued a direction.</P>
    <P>On this occasion the Garda were certain that they had an unanswerable case against Murray and they were right.  Murray was subsequently convicted and received ten concurrent 18 year sentences.  He had a long history of sexual offending, including previous convictions for rape, indecent exposure and indecent assault.</P>
    <P>While the file was being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions Murray raped, assaulted and stabbed five more women.  When sentencing Murray last Thursday Mr. Justice Lavin pointed out that the lives of these victims had been shattered, perhaps irreparably.  Some of them could not face the ordeal of appearing in court.  All these victims have cause to take an action for aggravated damages against the State.</P>
    <P>This further centralisation of power in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions at the very least warrants the allocation of sufficient resources to enable him make a decision as to whether to prosecute and to do so without delay. In reply to a question tabled by me last week the Taoiseach stated: &ldquo;A random sample of 354 files which had been received in the DPP's office in 1986 showed that, on average, a direction issued 15 days after receipt of the files in cases where further investigation or information was not required from the Garda investigators&rdquo;.  This is misleading and disingenuous.</P>
    <P>The average period of 15 days referred to by the Taoiseach includes cases where a direction was issued within a few hours and cases where it took several months to issue a direction.  It does not take into account the length of time it takes to prepare the file.  Neither does it take into account the delays which occur in the many cases where further information is requested from the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>At the end of November the people will be asked to enable the bail laws to be changed so that dangerous criminals can be incarcerated during the period between being charged and being tried.  It now appears, however, that Garda management, at their own initiative, have ensured that dangerous criminals are free to walk the streets during the period between being arrested and being charged.  The Minister for Justice should insist that Garda management withdraw this directive without delay.  It has potentially adverse consequences for taxpayers and in five cases it has had devastating consequences for victims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, who unfortunately cannot be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> I am informed that there has been no recent change in procedures.  In November 1992, nearly four years ago, the Garda authorities, on advice received from the Director of Public Prosecutions, issued general directions in relation to the preferral of charges in respect of indictable offences.  The Director of Public Prosecutions was concerned to avoid problems which could arise if charges are preferred prematurely.  Such problems may include: a premature charge could result in an injustice to the accused if fresh evidence comes to light which casts doubt on the guilt of the accused or perhaps shows him to be innocent and the preferring of a charge effectively puts the accused outside the scope of investigation and questioning, thereby reducing the chances of procuring further evidence.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions is, by statute, responsible for the prosecution of criminal offences and prosecutions are normally initiated by the Garda Síochána acting on his instructions. As the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in the exercise of his functions, it would not be appropriate for me or any member of the Government to comment on any advice given by him in relation to the initiation of prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The instructions issued by the Garda authorities in 1992 provide for instances where the prior directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions are required and, because of urgency, the submission of a completed investigation file is not possible within the time constraints.  In such cases directions can be obtained by telephone and the accused charged, as appropriate, without delay.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the role of the Garda Síochána is to fully investigate matters, gather whatever evidence may be available and submit a report on the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions whose primary role is to decide whether a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence.  The Director of Public Prosecutions will make this decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and-or statute law.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this most important issue.  I am disappointed, however, that neither the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry nor the Minister of State at his Department is present.</P>
      <P>The history of vegetable growing and processing in east Cork dates back to the early 1960s. It has been an important source of business for farmers and employment for hundreds of people in the area which includes Midleton and Mallow. The plant in question has been owned by several companies &mdash; Erin Foods, Findus, Campbells, Fresh Bake and now Universal Foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the last remaining vegetable freezing plant in the country.  The permanent workforce is around 150 while the number of farmers in the <Col N="785" /> area contracting to the company is in the region of 200.</P>
    <P>The decision announced last night to shut down the air drying, that is, mechanical dehydration, plant will have a devastating effect on the area and will mean the loss of 50 to 60 jobs among the permanent workforce.  It will also affect the number of temporary jobs, which are of great importance to students in particular, during the summer season when the harvesting of peas and beans takes place.  It will also mean that up to 2,000 acres out of a total of 4,500 acres will not be needed for vegetable growing.  That is a great loss in this time of restrictive quotas in milk, grain and beet in addition to the problems being experienced in the beef industry, particularly in light of the Minister's decision last week to ringfence Cork.</P>
    <P>Since February 1995 the company has acquainted the Minister with the problems facing the mechanical dehydration process and the need for aid for vining peas, similar to that which is given to cereals, to ensure the viability of the plant.  To his eternal shame, the Minister did not meet the management despite numerous requests over the past two years.  He must take his share of the blame for the decision made yesterday to ringfence Cork for beef sales, in addition to this body blow to the vegetable industry which is turning Cork into a severely disadvantaged area.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to act now to save this important industry which is worth approximately £6 million, much of which benefits the economy of east Cork.  I understand the Minister is meeting some of the executives of the company tomorrow. I hope that meeting will be productive and help to save the jobs under threat as well as the livelihoods of approximately 50 per cent of the farmers who have been producing vegetables for the factory in Midleton for the past 30 years.</P>

      <P>I respond to the debate on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. The company's decision to discontinue the air-dried function at its Midleton plant from next spring is a commercial one.  It has been taken on the grounds that this part of the business has never been profitable in Ireland.  The company points out that some 50 jobs will be affected but it is hoped that many of these will be saved.</P>

    <P>The Minister is aware that the ineligibility of vining peas for area aid has been advanced as a compounding reason for the closure of the air-drying facility.  The position is that area aid under the EU arable support system is confined in the case of peas to those harvested in a dry state.  Vining peas, which are harvested at a green stage and subjected to air or freeze drying, are not eligible for area aid.  While the Minister vigorously pursued their inclusion, Commissioner Fischler explained, in a detailed written response, the reasons this was not possible.  These were that as vining peas had never been covered by a previous support regime, payment of compensatory aid <Col N="786" /> under CAP reform was not justified unlike the case with cereals and other eligible arable crops for which previous price support were either reduced or abolished; the inclusion of vining peas in the arable support system would create distortions in the market and had been opposed by producers in the major production regions of the EU; and the introduction of an end use obligation such as dehydration would jeopardise the protected status of arable area payments under the GATT.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to emphasise that, while the exclusion of vining peas from area aid was an issue for the company, the fundamental reason for the planned closure of the air-dried function is its non-profitability.  the freeze dried-frozen divisions of the firm provide direct employment for up to 115 people in Ireland and continue to be profitable.  The company has identified growth opportunities for this segment of its business.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Forbairt remain at its disposal to discuss its plans with a view to possible assistance.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 23 October 1996.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation &mdash; the first ever White Paper on this subject in the history of the State &mdash; will be published within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>The White Paper will represent the culmination of debate and discussion on a policy area which is of increasing significance to our national economic and social development.</P>
      <P>That debate can trace its origins back to National Economic and Social Council Reports in 1992 and 1993, on innovation and competitiveness. The Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (STIAC) brought the debate into a more science and technology-focused consideration of the issues in the course of 1994.  The STIAC report entitled &ldquo;Making Knowledge Work for Us&rdquo;, which was published in March 1995, was the first totally indigenous &mdash; and most comprehensive ever &mdash; review of science and technology policy in Ireland.  The report dealt with science and technology policies and programmes in the context of a &ldquo;national system of innovation&rdquo;&mdash; that is the collection of institutions and mechanisms, and their inter-relationship, which stimulate and support innovation in the national economy.  The key conclusions of the STIAC report were that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" />&mdash; there is a low level of research and development in Ireland, particularly among the indigenous business sector;</P>
    <P>&mdash; there is a need for sufficient resources for those involved in &ldquo;knowledge generation&rdquo;, such as third level colleges, to fuel the innovation capacity of the economy;</P>
    <P>&mdash; there is a need for a more coherent strategy for State investment in science and technology and for prioritisation of research activities;</P>
    <P>&mdash; there is a need to increase the level of public understanding of science and technology in the innovation process.</P>
    <P>Within three months of the publication of the report, the Government decided to accept the basic precept that a strong national system of innovation, based on the creative application of science and technology, is a key element in achieving sustained industrial, social and economic development, and the creation of high added-value exports and skilled employment. The Government established a Cabinet committee, which I chaired, and also an interdepartmental task force to prioritise and examine how best to bring forward the STIAC recommendations for implementation.  The task force and Cabinet committee concluded its work in December 1995 and made a presentation of its findings to the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Since then I have been engaged in a process of discussion of the major issues arising with relevant interested bodies.  I have also engaged in a more fundamental examination of the philosophical rationale behind science and technology policy, and its contribution to national development. My concern has been to encapsulate in a coherent fashion, all the factors which contribute to the capacity for scientific and technological innovation in the country.  The White Paper, therefore, will not only include the Government's response to the STIAC recommendations, it will define the full agenda of actions to be pursued and the strategy to be implied over the long-term, if we are to be successful in this critically important aspect of national development.</P>

Substantial work has been done and I hope to be in a position to report to Government shortly on progress in respect of the recommendations.  As I indicated at the launch of the report, I accept the assessment by the Commission of the important role of the indigenous newspaper industry to reflect our national identity and provide for plurality and diversity of opinions and I indicated my support in principle for their recommendations in regard to the matters within the remit of my Department, such as regulation of ownership changes, merger control and assistance from the Labour Relations Commission.  I hope to be in a position to quickly act on many of these.</P>
    <P>In some instances there are complex legal issues that have to be assessed before definite decisions can be taken in relation to the recommendations. This work is receiving priority within my Department.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that he raised the issue of increasing tanning capacity in a written question on 26 June 1996.</P>
      <P>The development of the tanning industry is a matter for which Forbairt has day-to-day responsibility.  In this regard, I should point out that within the past three years significant investment in the industry has been made.  This has resulted in a substantial increase in the capacity to process hides.  The increase in tanning capacity has taken place against a background where there has been some fall-off in the level of hides available. I have been advised by Forbairt, that apart from seasonal peaks, the capacity exists to process the majority of hides available on a continuing basis.</P>
      <P>Forbairt has assured me that it is actively continuing to seek viable opportunities to add further to the processing of Irish hides and any proposals will be considered on their merits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 26, 260 and 261 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the updating and consolidation of the body of legislation dealing with credit unions, which dates in some cases from 1893, are well <Col N="790" /> advanced.  The heads of the Bill were cleared by the Government on 22 March 1994 and were sent to the Attorney General's Office three days later. The scope of the Bill has necessarily required detailed attention on the part of both my Department and the Attorney General's Office. However, I am pleased to say that on arrival in office, I was able to persuade both my colleagues in the Department and in Government that the Credit Union Bill should be given priority status. As a result, I am pleased that a first draft of the Bill, which involves up to 200 sections, has recently been received from the parliamentary draftsman, and it is at present being examined in detail by the Minister concerned, the Minister with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology, and the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who has overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of credit unions.  The text of the Bill will be finalised in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman in the coming weeks, after which Government approval to publish the Bill will be sought.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate existing credit union legislation and to provide an updated framework for the development and regulation of the credit union movement.  While safeguarding the ethical principles to which the movement is dedicated, the Bill will provide for the development of the range of services which credit unions may offer to their members.  As a complementary measure, the supervisory powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies are also being expanded.  Although the Credit Union Bill is the Department's priority for legislative action and while I am not able to give a precise date for publication at present, I assure Deputies that every effort is being made to have the Bill published during the current Dáil session.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cost differential that exists between providing a place for an unemployed <Col N="791" /> person on the programme and paying social welfare, the net cost of each place this year works out at approximately £2,962 per person and arises in respect of the following additional costs: (1) the difference between basic social welfare rates and the basic allowances available on CE e.g. weekly UA rate of £64.50 compared with the basic CE allowance of £83.75, (2) grants to sponsors to employ supervisors, (3) grants to sponsors for materials/overheads, (4) grants to sponsors and participants in respect of training/ development modules.</P>
    <P>Community employment (EC) is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payments.  Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities together with some training that would enhance the employment prospects of those at whom the programme is targeted.</P>
    <P>With regard to specific provision for married persons who wish to return to the work force, FÁS from time to time offer return to work course and in addition all unemployed people are eligible to participate in FÁS mainline training/specific skills training programmes.</P>
    <P>The present eligibility criteria for CE only came into effect earlier this year following a detailed review of CE and in response to the recommendations of the task force on long-term unemployment.  Accordingly, I do not propose to widen the eligibility criteria further.</P>
    <P>Both men and women (married or single) who fulfil any of the following criteria can now participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>Part-Time Integration Option</P>
    <P>&mdash; Those over 21 years and on unemployment benefit (UB) or unemployment assistance (UA) for at least 12 months</P>
    <P>&mdash; Those over 21 years and on lone parent's allowance for over 12 months</P>
    <P>&mdash; Special categories such as those referred by the NRB or travellers on the live register or on lone parent's allowance for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>Part-Time Job Option</P>
    <P>&mdash; Those over 35 years and in receipt of unemployment assistance (UA) or unemployment benefit (UB) for over three years</P>
    <P>&mdash; Those over 35 years and on lone parent's allowance for over three years</P>
    <P>&mdash; Special categories such as those referred by the NRB who are over 35 years or travellers who are over 35 years and on the live register or on lone parent's allowance for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>Also married unemployed people can swap their social welfare entitlement to qualify for participation on the programme and persons with children who are in receipt of survivor's contributory pension (SCP) or deserted wive's benefit (DWB) can apply to revert to lone parent's allowance <Col N="792" /> (LPA) and if awarded same, they would then be eligible to participate in CE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties contains suitable provisions to provide for co-operation between suitable cross-Border science and technology projects.</P>
      <P>To date, however, most such co-operation has been supported under the International Fund for Ireland which finances a special science and technology programme aimed at putting in place a capability and infrastructure that will lead to innovation and technology transfer for the benefit of Irish industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>Up to 1995 the programme concentrated primarily on supporting the establishment of technology innovation centres.  These represent partnerships between industry and third level colleges, North and South, to help companies to become more competitive by encouraging innovation and research.  The centres are directed by industry-led boards who make sure that the research work has a commercial focus.  In 1996 the fund also established a new programme of financial assistance called RADIUS (Research and Development between Ireland and the United States) modelled on the successful US/Israel Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Programme.  The new scheme will seek to stimulate, promote and support joint ventures in product and process development between manufacturing or internationally tradeable service companies based in Ireland and the United States.  Conditional grants of up to 50 per cent of the total eligible and approved project costs are available under the terms of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the question refers, I presume, to the draft EU 5th Framework Programme discussions which were launched under the Irish Presidency.  The formulation of the 5th Framework Programme is a complex and challenging task and there are many elements to be considered.  The European Commission has produced a Strategy Paper &ldquo;Inventing Tomorrow&rdquo;&mdash; Europe's Research at the Service of its People. At the Research Council on 7 October, which I chaired, Ministers had a first political orientation debate about the key guidelines which will serve as the basis for a detailed proposal for the 5th Framework Programme and which will determine European Union action in this area into the next <Col N="793" /> millennium.  At this stage the debate is about the fundamental building blocks &mdash; the design and architecture of the 5th Framework Programme &mdash; whether it should be more relevant to European industrial needs, provide value for money, be more focused, concentrated, flexible, responsive etc.  It must clearly respond to the competitive challenges facing European industry; it must recognise the contribution which SMEs can make to greater European innovation; it must move Europe's consciousness to the front-line of the information society.</P>
    <P>Science and technology also impinge on other aspects of our lives, in relation to the environment, agriculture, food, industrial technologies, health, transport, marine and even to the preservation of our ancient monuments.  The framework programme, therefore, should be relevant to all these needs in society.  Inevitably resources will be limited and there will be a need for prioritisation.</P>
    <P>The present process will culminate in the Commission producing a formal detailed proposal next spring.  Detailed negotiations will then start on the individual constituent parts.  Within the nuclear fission safety area, radiation protection research should get a priority and in particular the improvement of our understanding of the effects of low-level radiation.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996.  I propose to bring the Act into operation shortly when regulations necessary to give the legislation full effect have been made (following approval, in draft, by both Houses).</P>
      <P>The inspectors in the Labour Inspectorate of my Department will be appointed as inspectors for the purposes of the new Act.

      <P>The Act will provide for the first time that young people will have an avenue of redress against employers who penalise them for not working longer hours than the legislation allows.

      <P>The most recent statistics published by the National Roads Authority show that: (a) almost 38 per cent of the motorists involved in fatal and personal injury accidents were young drivers and that (b) 41 per cent of the road casualty victims in 1995 were between the ages of 18 and 34.  The analysis provided by the sixth report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board showed that claims frequency declines with age of policyholder for all types of cover.  The analysis also showed that, in terms of relative claims cost, the 17 to 24 year old policyholder is a greater risk than those aged 25 to 30, who in turn are a greater risk than those aged over 30.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte and Touche report on an evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland provides further evidence of the high cost of claims associated with the young driver.  The consultants found that the average cost of an insurance claim for a 17 to 24 year old driver is over twice that for a 36 to 40 year old driver and that motorists in the younger age group are responsible for over 3½ times the claims costs of motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.  Given the facts, it is not surprising that young drivers may experience difficulty in obtaining quotations for motor insurance and that from an underwriting and solvency perspective insurers will quote relatively high premiums to young and inexperienced drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte and Touche report concluded that the inculcation of safer driving standards in young drivers is the key to reducing their high accident rate and to obtaining lower premium quotations. In this regard, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the specific recommendations by Deloitte and Touche in relation to the introduction of a <Col N="795" /> graduated licensing system for learner drivers and of a driving-related course of education for secondary school students.  Following action in relation to these recommendations will be the responsibility of my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment and Education.  I also understand that an insurance incentive scheme is currently being established by agreement between the Irish Insurance Federation and the Driving Instructors Register (DIR) whereby insurance discounts will be offered to young drivers who have completed an agreed number of driving lessons over a calendar year.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte and Touche report found that the Irish market for private motor insurance is competitive in terms of the number of insurers operating in the market, the range of premium quotations available and the fact that premiums reduce in line with maturity and safe driving record.  The consultants found that claims-free drivers have seen reductions in insurance premiums in real terms since 1990.</P>

      <P>The statistics on jobs created in 1996 are not yet available.  The annual employment survey for 1996, which is conducted by Forfás, is under way and data should be available in the near future.</P>
      <P>Employment in grant-aided companies in the electronics (hardware) industry in Ireland increased from 23,014 at the end of 1994 to 29,130 at the end of 1995, that is a net increase of 6,116. The percentage of these employees who were in part-time, temporary or short-term contract positions rose from 16.2 per cent in 1994 to 16.8 per cent in 1995.</P>
      <P>In grant-aided companies in the software sector there was a net increase in employment of 1,438 from 6,165 in 1994 to 7,603 in 1995.  The percentage of part-time/temporary/short-term contract employees in grant-aided overseas software companies increased from 7 per cent in 1994 to 12 per cent in 1995.  This breakdown is not available for grant-aided indigenous software companies but, at the end of 1995, 13 per cent of employees in the whole indigenous software sector, including companies not grant-aided, were in temporary contract positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> There are no figures available regarding the number of people working in these industries who are not directly employed by the companies in receipt of the grant-aid.  Very few temporary-part-time or subcontract jobs would have been grant-aided as it is policy only to do so where it is necessary to secure a project.  In 1995, out of a total of 114 projects approved, only four had an employment content in the subcontractor and temporary categories, with implications for the grant agreement.</P>

      <P>In 1995, there were 64 announcements of new investments by IDA assisted companies. Together these projects are investing in excess of £1,230 million and are expected to generate 12,239 jobs over the next three to five years.</P>
      <P>A total of 11,500 new jobs were created and filled by IDA supported companies during 1995. In 1996, up to 17 October 68 IDA backed projects involving £615.6 million investment and projected employment of 11,008 jobs over the next three to five years, have been announced.  Data on the progress of actual job creation to date this year cannot be confirmed until IDA completes its annual census of employment in November. However, based on the mid-year partial survey by IDA and an update on companies by IDA executives, it is clear that the actual job creation-recruitment levels in the projects announced is in line with expectations.  While a small number of projects have not proceeded in line with projections, the activity this year in the companies supported by IDA indicates that at least 11,000 first time jobs will be created in 1996.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am informed by IDA Ireland that there is no direct correlation between the number of jobs announced and those created in a particular year.  The latter figure can derive from projects commenced several years previously, since very few projects could come on stream fully in any shorter period, and since the actual pace of coming to projected capacity will naturally vary with economic and other conditions.</P>

      <P>As in any sector, pay and working conditions in tourism-related employment are matters for negotiation and agreement between employees and employers and or their representatives. Where disputes arise the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are available to the parties.</P>
      <P>Under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946-90, trade unions or other organisations claiming to represent a category of workers may make application to the Labour Court for the establishment of a joint labour committee known as a JLC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of a JLC is to draw up proposals for fixing minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for the workers involved.  When proposals submitted by a joint labour committee are confirmed by the Labour Court, through the making of an Employment Regulation Order, they become statutory minimum pay and conditions of employment for the workers concerned. <Col N="798" /> There are already three JLCs in operation which impact on tourism-related employment, two cover the catering area and the third covers hotels.  In the case of the hotel JLC, Cork City, Dublin City and Dún Laoghaire are not included.</P>
    <P>EROs are enforced by the labour inspectorate of my Department.  Routine inspections are undertaken to ensure that employers comply with the terms of the EROs.  In addition, inspectors pursue reported breaches of these EROs.</P>

      <P>The Forfás 1995 employment survey relates mainly to manufacturing industry and internationally traded services, has been published and shows that 14,000 jobs were lost while 24,000 jobs were created leaving a net gain of 10,000 additional jobs in these sectors.  As regards 1996, notified redundancies for the first nine months of this year amounted to just over 10,000.</P>
      <P>On the question of job losses generally, the Deputy will be aware from my earlier reply to Deputy O'Rourke that my Department has an early warning system, which is kept under review, and aims to identify as early as possible firms in difficulty.  This allows appropriate assistance to be offered to help address those difficulties and thereby do our utmost to try and maintain existing jobs.  However, as information about companies in difficulty comes to my Department's attention confidentially and often contains commercially sensitive information it is not possible, as the Deputy will understand, for me to provide the information sought on individual companies. Decisions by companies to reduce their workforces, production or shut down operations are ultimately the responsibility of the companies themselves.</P>
      <P>As regards job losses generally, I would refer the Deputy to a detailed reply which I gave his colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke on Wednesday, 25 September 1996 (Official Report Vol. 469, No. 1 col. 432 and 433).</P>

      <P>I am taking the Deputy's question to <Col N="800" /> mean all research and development in this country, including that carried out by the business sector, the higher education sector and the State sector.</P>
      <P>According to the latest Forfás estimates, total R and D spending in 1995 amounted to £584 million. Of that sum, £142 million, or 24 per cent was funded through the Exchequer, mostly on research carried out by the HE sector or by Government institutions.</P>
      <P>The business sector, which is the largest performer of R and D, accounted for £400 million of the total in 1995.  Of that figure, only £19 million was accounted for by R and D grant-aid.</P>
      <P>It is not accurate therefore to say that R and D in Ireland is grant led.  However, that is not to say that Government programmes, whether in the form of grants or otherwise, are not necessary to promote and stimulate the level of business R and D in Ireland, about which I remain concerned.</P>
      <P>Despite encouraging growth in business R and D over the past five years, at an annual rate of 17 per cent, there are still underlying weaknesses in this regard in Irish industry.  Foreign-owned companies account for two-thirds of spending, although only one-quarter of multinationals here undertake large scale systematic R and D.  More worryingly, however, the majority of domestic companies in most sectors undertake no research and development.  A key objective of STI policy, therefore, is to increase the number of firms, both indigenous and foreign, performing R and D in Ireland, as well as to increase overall business spending on R and D.</P>
      <P>These are among the issues which will be addressed in the soon to be published White Paper on science, technology and innovation &mdash; the first ever White Paper on the subject in this country.  A central theme of the White Paper will be to address all of the factors contributing to the capacity for technological innovation in this country in a coherent fashion, thus adopting an integrated strategic approach to research and development.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose shortly to publish a detailed review of the activities and expenditure of CEBs in the period from their inception in 1993 to the end of <Col N="801" /> 1995.  This publication at national level will complement the reviews and reports which are published by each county enterprise board as a means of informing the public about their activities.  One of the purposes of the national review is to serve as a means of sharing the lessons of specific experience in developing programmes to assist new and existing enterprise and identifying models of good practice that can be considered by other boards and local development bodies.</P>
    <P>In addition to the monitoring of activity undertaken by my Department, the external evaluator appointed under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99, has commenced, as part of the mid-term evaluation of the Operational Programme a critical review of the Local Enterprise Sub-Programme under which county enterprise boards are funded. This will involve a through assessment of the efficiency, effectiveness and impact of the activities sponsored by county enterprise boards.  It will also consider whether the initial strategy is still relevant to the achievement of the objectives set for the overall initiative, and recommend any adjustments that require to be made.</P>
    <P>I have put in place a method of allocating resources to county enterprise boards which takes account of such factors as: the population, overall size and relative needs of each area; the capacity of each area to successfully utilize enterprise funding and to create employment; the quality of the enterprise plan prepared by each city and county enterprise board.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted in determining allocations each year will also have regard to the overall expenditure pattern of boards and their record in programme development.  This process of continuing assessment is designed to improve the impact of the overall programme.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent report of the Institute for International Management Development (IMD) titled The World Competitiveness Yearbook 1996, where Ireland is placed 22nd.  Furthermore, I take it the Deputy is comparing this with our 9th place in an earlier 1992 report.  I should mention at this stage that the World Economic Forum is no longer associated with this report.</P>
      <P>It would be misleading to attempt a direct comparison between the 1992 and 1996 placings as there have been changes in both methodology and in the countries being compared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> The IMD has given the 1992 placings in the 1996 report, recalculated according to the 1996 methodology and this is the appropriate basis for comparison.  Analysis on this basis suggests that, since 1992, Ireland has not been passed out by any country and that we have passed out one other country &mdash; Malaysia.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also note the two countries not previously covered are now ranked above us &mdash; Chile and Luxembourg.  Ireland's relative ranking has actually moved from 24th place to 22nd.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the problems of measuring relative competitiveness, I would, of course, share the Deputy's concern that we might be perceived to be losing ground, especially at a time when the economy is generally acknowledged to be doing so well.  Not only do domestic commentators agree on our economic success but this view is also shared by the EU and OECD.  Growth in exports, employment and the trend in foreign direct investment all reinforce the argument that Ireland is a very competitive location for enterprise.</P>
    <P>I personally believe that we should set ourselves the aim of achieving a place at least in the top 10 by the year 2010 and I am sure that I have the Deputy's support in this view.</P>

      <P>Appointments to the board of Shannon Development are made by me in consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  There is currently no vacancy on the board of Shannon Development, and the next vacancies are not expected to arise until April or May of 1997 when, in accordance with the company's articles of association, the two longest serving directors will be required to retire on the occasion of the company's annual general meeting.</P>
      <P>I have made no decision as yet regarding future appointments to the board of Shannon Development, but I believe mid-west tourism interests are well represented on the board.</P>

      <P>Jobstart, which was launched at the <Col N="803" /> end of May was introduced by this Government as one of the measures which set out to combat the difficulties faced by the long-term unemployed in getting back to work</P>
      <P>Under the Jobstart programme employers are encouraged to look positively at hiring an unemployed person by providing a direct cash subsidy. Employers are paid a recruitment subsidy of £80 per week for one year when filling new or existing vacancies with persons who are unemployed for more than three years.  Also, workers employed under Jobstart may retain eligibility for secondary social welfare benefits subject to an income limit of £250 per week.</P>
      <P>As Jobstart has only been in existence for a short time, it is too early to make any pronouncement on its success or otherwise.  Past experience has shown that recruitment incentives require a lead-in time before becoming established.  While I am disappointed with the take-up to date, I have taken steps to raise the profile of Workplace and improve the promotion of the scheme on the ground by actions such as advertising regional promotions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to boost participation in Jobstart, I met last week the various employer organisations, including IBEC, ISME and the SFA, and with ICTU and the INOU, to discuss how best they could assist in promoting this programme.  All of these organisations reaffirmed to me their full support for the programme and agreed on a range of further measures to promote it.</P>
      <P>As of 11 October, 1996, 346 jobs have been approved for Jobstart with 222 participants recruited.  At the end of September, the cost of the programme was £198,895.</P>

      <P>The survey mentioned in the question refers to a recent report entitled Survival and Growth of High Potential Firms in Ireland by Teresa Hogan and Anthony Foley of Dublin City University.  The survey reviewed 239 companies approved under Forbairt's Enterprise Development Programme (EDP) over the period 1978-92.</P>
      <P>The review concluded, <i>inter alia</i> that 54 per cent of these firms did not survive over the 15 year period and 9.2 per cent of the companies in question grew to employ more than 50 people. This group, which made up the 9.2 per cent fell into the category of fast growth firms and accounted for 62 per cent of the surviving firms' employment.  These fast growth firms (22) grew from 242 jobs at start-up to 2,888 jobs in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> The DCU report has been examined by Forbairt and, consistent with other internal reviews carried out on the programme, not only do the overall results reflect well on the programme but there is a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the programme over recent years. Some of the more important points to note are that failure rates of companies approved under the programme have significantly reduced since the early years of the programme.  Thirty four per cent of companies approved under the programme in 1987 failed within three years as compared with 56 per cent of the companies started in 1984 closing within three years.  The failure rate of companies approved over the past five years, 1991-1995 has fallen to 14 per cent; the programme support for the significant number of companies that now employ 50+ people i.e. 9.2 per cent compares favourably with 1 per cent of all start-up manufacturing companies started between 1973 and 1989 growing to employ over 50 employees or more by the end of 1989; the improved performance of the programme in recent years is the result of action taken on foot of reviews of the programme carried out in 1987 and 1990.  Among the measures taken were a greater level of external equity investment being required in companies; a greater focus on encouraging management teams in companies as opposed to companies involving a single promotor; encouraging greater use of specialist external advisers by companies; encouraging a larger number of companies to form strategic alliances and joint ventures with other companies in their industry; the average survival rates quoted in the report are in line with international experience. Ireland is second best in survival rates of companies after five years in the SME range.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to a similar question from Deputy Harney on 26 June last, the Forfás report, Shaping our Future, presents a wide-ranging examination of long-term strategy. As a framework document, it sets out what we as a society can achieve in terms of economic and social development over the next 15 years if we adopt the right policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was prepared by Forfás in the context of its statutory function to advise the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on matters relating to the development of industry in the State. While Forfás engaged in widespread consultation in preparing the report, including consulting with my own Department, it published the report under its own name and without any official <Col N="805" /> imprimatur from either myself or the Government. The status of the report is, therefore, that of an advisory one which is a valuable contribution to policy development in a wide range of areas which span several Departments.</P>
    <P>As also indicated in the earlier reply, in adopting any new policies or altering existing ones, it would be my intention to use the Forfás report as a key input.  That is what I am currently doing in the preparation of a statement of enterprise strategy, which I hope to bring to Government shortly.  That strategy statement will then represent official Government policy on industrial development.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, there are already extensive controls on the safety of food exercised by a number of Government Departments and agencies.  These controls address in a comprehensive manner all stages of the food production cycle from primary production, through processing to retailing; stipulate an array of exacting standards which must be observed at different stages of the cycle; and provide a wide apparatus of inspections, sampling and scientific testing, supported by a regime of stringent penalties, deployed to enforce standards.</P>
      <P>The Departments and agencies concerned are as follows: the Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Department of the Marine, the Department of the Environment, the Food Safety Advisory Board, An Bord Bia, the Irish Medicines Board, the Radiological Protection Institute and the veterinary services of local authorities.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is also aware, I established the expert advisory group on beef products last March for the specific purpose of advising the Government, consumers and traders regarding the safety of Irish beef in the context of the then recently imposed EU ban on UK beef exports. This objective was achieved with the promulgation by the group of the <i>Guidelines on Beef and Beef Products,</i> a copy of which is in the Official Report, vol. 464, cols. 110-119, of 17 April 1996.</P>

      <P>On foot of recommendations made to date by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee, I have recently advised Galway, Mayo and Donegal county councils of funding for priority projects included in their programmes of work.  Details of Cork County Council's priority access project are currently being assessed by the interdepartmental committee and I expect to be in a position shortly to confirm funding for this project also.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of £242,250 has been made available to the relevant local authorities for access projects.  A number of priority access projects are still under consideration and I hope to be able to announce further funding from the financial envelope shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, the local authorities have been asked to identify further access projects, which have been agreed by their islands committees but may not have been included in their programmes of work and which could be completed this year and would, therefore, be appropriate for consideration by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee for funding this year.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate at this stage exactly how much of the £1 million, if any, will remain unallocated at the end of 1996.</P>

      <P>Information of this kind was first collected in 1986.  In that year the percentage of materials used by manufacturing industry in Ireland that were Irish-produced was 50.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>For 1990 the corresponding percentage was 52.9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1991 onwards the question was rephrased to refer to materials &ldquo;purchased&rdquo; rather than materials &ldquo;used&rdquo;.  In 1993, the latest year for <Col N="809" /> which provisional results are available, the percentage of materials purchased by manufacturing industry in Ireland that were Irish-produced was 57.8 per cent.</P>

    <P>(b)  it is known that persons on the live register are not always classified as unemployed in the Labour Force Survey and, therefore, it would not be meaningful to express the live register as a percentage of Labour Force Survey categories.</P>

      <P>The annual Labour Force Survey report gives information on persons who classify themselves as unable to work due to permanent sickness or disability and includes classifications by age, gender, marital status and region. Similar information in respect of counties and small areas is compiled from the five-yearly Census of Population.  A new quarterly multi-purpose household survey, replacing the annual Labour Force Survey, will begin in June 1997.  The survey will include a range of social as well as labour force topics and this may provide the opportunity to occasionally collect more detailed information relating to people with disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>In January of this year the Commission initiated an investigation of forced labour practices in Burma in the context of the European Union's Generalised System of Preferences. The investigation was initiated on foot of a complaint lodged by the European Trade Union Conference and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Regulation (3281/94), the investigation must continue for at least one year.  The Commission has received submissions on the case and hearings have been held.  The report of the investigation is expected early in 1997.  The Council of Ministers can be expected to take an early decision on any recommendations contained in the Commission report with regard to the continued application of the benefits of the GSP to Burma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of restrictive measures have already been adopted by the European Union following its great concern at the failure of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to respect the results of the May 1990 elections and the subsequent maintenance of military rule.  The <Col N="819" /> military regime has yet to demonstrate convincingly its intention to establish civilian democratic rule within a credible timeframe.  Restrictive measures already adopted include:</P>
    <P>Expulsion of all military personnel attached to the diplomatic representations of Burma in member states of the European Union and withdrawal of all military personnel attached to diplomatic representations of the member states of the European Union in Burma;</P>
    <P>An embargo on arms, munitions and military equipment;</P>
    <P>Suspension of development co-operation with Burma, with the exception of humanitarian assistance.  Exceptions may be made for projects and programmes in support of human rights and democracy as well as those concentrating on poverty alleviation and, in particular, the provision of basic needs for the poorest sections of the population, in the context of decentralised co-operation through local civilian authorities and non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>Moreover, one of the conclusions at the General Affairs Council on 15 and 16 July 1996 was to invite the appropriate institutions to consider further restrictive measures in co-operation with other countries.  Since then the European Union has requested the UN Special Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and Imprisonment to visit Burma; the UN Special Rapporteur on Burma to investigate the circumstances of the death of Mr. James Leander Nichols; that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights take action on Burma.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers gave further consideration to the matter of Burma on 1 October 1996. The Council was seriously concerned at the widespread detention of members of the National League for Democracy and the blockading of the road leading to the residence of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  The European Union called for the immediate and unconditional release of all those who have been detained and to allow for the resumption of normal activities by the National League for Democracy and emphasised the need for a genuine dialogue to commence without delay between SLORC and the National League for Democracy as being the only possible credible way forward for national reconciliation in Burma. The Council also noted that the EU Commission was completing its inquiry into possible future suspension of the Generalised System of Preferences trade benefits for Burma.</P>
    <P>The European Union is already closely monitoring the situation in Burma and is actively considering the adoption of further restrictive measures.</P>

      <P>I refer to my replies to Questions No. 86 of 10 October and No. 123 of 15 October 1996 wherein I informed the House that the Government is seriously concerned about the continuation of hostilities in Afghanistan and urges all parties to the conflict to seek a peaceful resolution of their differences through negotiation.</P>
      <P>The Government has also expressed its concern at the interpretation of Islamic law being advanced by the Taliban whereby women are restricted from working outside their homes and girls, according to some reports, will no longer have access to education.  The Government has called upon the Taliban Interim Council to respect basic human rights and to ensure that, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, its policies avoid gender discrimination.</P>
      <P>The current situation in Afghanistan is both complex and fluid: there have been reports to the effect that the Taliban have come under attack by rival factions which have forged an anti-fundamentalist alliance.  The European Union is actively considering its response to ongoing developments in Afghanistan.  On 16 October 1996 the issue was also addressed by the United Nations Security Council, on which occasion the Presidency intervened on behalf of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The delegation of Ireland to the current 51st Session of the United Nations General Assembly has already been in consultation with the promoters of the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan in the Third Committee. Ireland is in favour of highlighting the situation of all women throughout Afghanistan in the resolution and in particular the deprivation of their rights by the Taliban.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the statement by the EU at the Third Committee on the situation on human rights throughout the world will be delivered towards the end of November and it is the intention of the Presidency to include in this statement a call on all the parties in Afghanistan to cease immediately all violations of the human rights of women and children and to allow international aid agencies the fullest possible access to those in need of assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of media reports about an alleged sale of nuclear weapons-related equipment by China to Pakistan.</P>
      <P>As stated in the White Paper on Foreign Policy, the fundamental objective of nuclear nonproliferation is to ensure that those who possess nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technology do not pass on such weapons or such technology to non-nuclear weapons countries.  If any sale of prohibited nuclear weapons technology by a nuclear weapons state to a non-nuclear weapons state were to be confirmed, the Government would naturally be extremely concerned and would pursue its concerns actively.</P>
      <P>A key issue in this case is whether the alleged sale, if confirmed, would place China in breach of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  This would be a matter of very serious concern.  All five acknowledged nuclear weapons states are parties to the NPT and none has been found to be in breach of its non-proliferation obligations under the treaty.  The House will be aware that a formal finding of non-compliance with the treaty has been made in the case of one state party only, Iraq, which as a non-nuclear weapons state party to the NPT was nevertheless found to have pursued a nuclear weapons programme.</P>
      <P>All states parties to the NPT, especially the nuclear weapons states, have an obligation to exercise particular care in supplying any nuclear technology to a country such as Pakistan which is not party to the NPT and whose nuclear installations are therefore not under international Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.  Adherence to the export control guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is an important means of demonstrating a practical commitment to the full discharge of this obligation.  All the nuclear weapons states, except China, are members of NSG (as are all EU member states, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, other OECD states and a number of other countries such as Argentina, Brazil and the Republic of Korea). The NSG attaches considerable importance to developing a constructive relationship with China on export controls and to encourage China to adhere to the guidelines.</P>
      <P>I have no evidence at my disposal that China has sold prohibited nuclear technology to Pakistan and that both China and Pakistan have denied that any illegal transfer has taken place.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to another question on 15 October, Ireland and its EU partners support China's membership of the WTO in the context of the restructuring of China's economy.  WTO membership will consolidate China's economic reform process, include further reforms, and integrate China into the world economy.</P>

      <P>In June 1995 the EU Council of Ministers mandated the Commission to negotiate a long-term relationship with South Africa.  This relationship is to be built on two complementary elements; a bilateral trade and co-operation agreement with South Africa and a Protocol to provide for qualified accession by South Africa to the Lomé IV Convention.</P>
      <P>The 1995 mid-term review of the Fourth Lomé Convention introduced provisions to facilitate South Africa's accession to the convention. Under the revised convention, South Africa can formally accede to the convention, without further ratification by the states party to it, if the terms of accession are agreed prior to entry into force of the agreement amending the convention. Under the proposed terms of the qualified accession, South Africa will not benefit from the trade terms of the convention or be eligible for the use of European Development Fund resources, with the exception of refugee assistance. Separately, the Council is currently considering a draft regulation to finance development co-operation with South Africa.</P>
      <P>The negotiating mandate agreed by the Council of Ministers provides for a comprehensive framework for trade and co-operation with South Africa.  In this context, the principles of partnership and dialogue, that are the basis of the ACPEU relationship, will underpin all aspects of future EU-South Africa relations.</P>
      <P>Ireland, both nationally and as current holder of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, fully supports the proposed free trade agreement and South Africa's qualified accession to the Lomé Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the renewal of fighting in northern Iraq, which has resulted in the recapture of the city of Sulaimaniya by forces loyal to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).  Iran has publicly denied that it has been involved in the inter-Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq, or that it has supported the PUK in its drive against the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP).  In recent days the KDP has recovered territory which it previously lost to the PUK.  The military situation in northern Iraq remains unstable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> The most recent upsurge in fighting has also brought new fears of an exodus of refugees from northern Iraq.  The Union has already undertaken a number of steps to alleviate the humanitarian plight of refugees in northern Iraq, and will continue to closely monitor the humanitarian situation and co-ordinate closely with its EU partners, and NGOs operating in the area, to assist in alleviating the situation of the Kurdish population.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to his Questions Nos. 111 and 113 of 25 September 1996, the Foreign Ministers of the Union, meeting informally in Tralee on 7-8 September, outlined general principles on the situation in the Gulf which form the basis for a strong common policy in relation to Iraq.</P>
    <P>The Union is willing to pursue contacts with the neighbouring countries in the region with a view to de-escalating tensions in northern Iraq. Partners are also all agreed on the need to ensure that steps are taken to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi civilian population, and children in particular, through the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 986 which would allow the sale of Iraqi oil to pay for food and medical supplies, and which it is envisaged will enter into force shortly.</P>
    <P>Diplomatic efforts now must focus on convincing the parties to end the current round of fighting and to enter into negotiations.  I support the talks currently being held by a senior US official with the leaders of the two main Kurdish factions with a view to establishing a ceasefire.  This would increase security and stability in northern Iraq and help both parties to resolve their differences on their own.  Ireland, as Presidency of the EU, will continue to work closely with its European partners and other countries so that the Union can exercise all its influence in order to ensure that international order and stability are maintained and calm is restored to the region.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there have been two incidents in recent months involving the closure of the political offices of Mrs. Megawati Sukarnoputri, the desposed leader of the Opposition Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).  In the first of these incidents, following Mrs. Megawati's dismissal from the leadership of the PDI in June 1996 at a Government-backed congress called by a rival party faction, riots erupted in Jakarta on 27 July 1996 after the police raided the PDI headquarters to evict Mrs. Megawati's supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> Shortly afterwards, the EU carried out a démarche to the Indonesian authorities which expressed concern at the events of 27 July 1996 and sought a satisfactory explanation of the whereabouts and condition of those arrested during the raid on the PDI headquarters.  The EU also sought information as to how long those arrested were to be detained and on what grounds, and details of the judicial procedure which would apply.  The EU called upon the Indonesian authorities to exercise maximum restraint in protecting and restoring public order and urged them to uphold fundamental democratic rights such as freedom of speech and assembly and to ensure that universally accepted human rights were not violated.</P>
    <P>More recently, Mrs. Megawati has been forced to leave her temporary PDI headquarters as the Jakarta municipal authorities have taken action against her on the basis that she was allegedly using a residential building for unauthorised business purposes.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Megawati has issued a series of separate legal proceedings regarding her ousting from the leadership of the PDI and the actions which have been taken against her by the authorities.  On 11 October 1996, the Central Jakarta State Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear a suit filed against the Indonesian Government by Mrs. Megawati: this judgement is the subject of a possible appeal while the other legal actions have yet to be heard in the courts.  The European Union is continuing to monitor all of these developments.</P>

      <P>The recent disturbances and tragic deaths are matters of deep concern to the Irish Government and the European Union.  The Irish Presidency issued a statement on behalf of the European Union on 16 October which strongly condemned the killing of an unarmed Greek Cypriot civilian on 13 October and repeated its call for restraint on all sides, to avert further such tragic deaths.  The European Union deplores this latest death, as it does all the violent deaths which have occurred recently in Cyprus.  The European Union fully supports the principle that deadly force must not be used by the either side against persons who cross the respective ceasefire lines or enter the United Nations buffer zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These events have led to an increase in tensions between both communities on the island and the immediate objective is to restore calm and move forward efforts to establish a political dialogue between the two sides.  These incidents have highlighted the urgent need to intensify efforts <Col N="825" /> towards promoting a comprehensive political settlement under the aegis of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Ireland's nuclear policy objectives place a heavy emphasis on nuclear safety and radiological protection.  At every opportunity we have conveyed our serious concern about the risks inherent in nuclear power at EU level, at the International Atomic Energy Agency, at the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD and at other international fora.  In the context of the European Union, four of our partners, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, are members of the G7.  In addition, the European Commission, in the person of the President of the Commission, participates in meetings of the G7.</P>
      <P>With regard to Chernobyl, Ireland has participated fully in the work of the European Union in seeking to address the consequences of the nuclear accident there in 1986 and in seeking to ensure the early closure of the plant.  The European Council at Corfu in June, 1994 recommended that the Chernobyl plant be closed definitively and as early as possible.  The European Union also proposed, in co-operation with the G7, an action plan providing for closure of the plant.  A memorandum of understanding was signed on 20 December 1995 which commits the G7, the EU and the Ukraine to work jointly towards the closure of Chernobyl by the year 2000 and the G7 and the EU have pledged funds to assist in the closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union is committed to developing its relations with the Ukraine and a partnership and co-operation agreement was signed with that country in 1994.  The Union's relations with the Ukraine, including the issue of <Col N="826" /> nuclear safety, are discussed regularly within Council fora.  In the context of these discussions Ireland has, in contributing to the formulation of the Union's policy with regard to the Ukraine, placed a high degree of emphasis on the nuclear safety issue.  I am satisfied that all our partners, including those whom I have mentioned earlier, are fully aware of our position.</P>
    <P>At the summit meeting on nuclear safety and security held in Moscow in April this year, the participants, who included the G7 leaders, and Commission President Santer and President Yeltsin, discussed the question of the closure of Chernobyl with the President of the Ukraine, Mr. Kuchma.  The importance of President Kuchma's decision to close Chernobyl by the year 2000 in accordance with the memorandum of understanding was recognised.</P>
    <P>In the context of our Presidency of the European Union we have, wherever possible, impressed on our partners, including of course those who are members of the G7, our views on the need to ensure closure of Chernobyl.  In New York last month, in the course of the EU-Ukraine Ministerial Troika, I had the opportunity to put forward to Foreign Minister Udovenko of the Ukraine, the position of the European Union on the issue of nuclear safety.  My colleagues at that meeting were, of course, the Foreign Minister of Italy and the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands.  I am pleased to report that Foreign Minister Udovenko reaffirmed the Ukraine's commitment to close Chernobyl by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>We shall continue to ensure that our views on this most important of issues are understood by our EU partners, by the authorities in the Ukraine and by the international community generally.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for the implementation of measures in two areas under the Cross-Border Development Sub-Programme of the EU Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties.  A provision of £1 million has been included for this purpose under subhead F.3 of the Foreign Affairs Vote in the 1996 Estimates.</P>
      <P>Measure 1 is concerned with business and cultural links and is being administered on both sides of the Border by an intermediary funding body, Co-operation North, in association with the business representative organisations IBEC and the CBI (NI).  My Department's role under this measure is primarily as a channel to Co-operation North of the EU and Government matching funds which will total approximately £7.3 million over the period of the programme.  As of 30 September 1996, Co-operation North has issued letters of offer in respect of sixty (60) projects with a grant value of £1,013,288.  These projects will involve total expenditure of £1,966,907.  To date £182,700 has been provided from subhead F.3 in respect of these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's primary imvolvement under the EU programme is in the implementation of measures 3 (A) and 3 (B) concerning co-operation between public bodies.  The rationale behind this measure is the adoption of co-ordinated approaches by public bodies to common problems in the eligible areas, North and South.  Total funding of approximately £5.33 million will be administered by my Department under these measures.  The first tranche of applications was considered during the summer <Col N="828" /> and six projects were approved for funding.  The six projects approved will involve total grants of £2.744 million, which will be paid equally by both Governments, and total expenditure of £3.36 million.  The second and final tranche of applications were received in September and are currently being processed and evaluated.  Funds for approved projects will be drawn down in 1996 and in 1997, but we are not yet in a position to forecast accurately the breakdown between the two years.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the question of moneys being returned to the European Commission at the end of 1996 does not arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 81 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As President of the EU, Ireland has the task at EU level of carrying forward the preparations necessary for the commencement of economic and monetary union (EMU) and the introduction of the single currency, the euro, with effect from 1 January 1999, the date agreed by the European Council in Madrid in December 1995 and confirmed by the European Council in Florence in June of this year.  These preparations include work on the new Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) to help promote orderly relations between the euro and the currencies of member states not participating in economics and monetary union at the outset; on the proposals for securing budgetary stability in economic and monetary union, the so-called &ldquo;stability pact&rdquo;; and on the legal framework for the use of the euro.  The Deputy will be aware that very satisfactory progress was made on these three items at the informal meeting of ECOFIN, the Council of Finance Ministers, which I hosted in Dublin on 20-22 September last.  On foot of that progress, on 16 October the European Commission adopted and published draft Council Regulations on the stability pact and on the legal framework for the euro.  As Presidency, Ireland will be <Col N="830" /> ensuring that as much progress as possible is made on these items over the coming weeks so that substantive conclusions can be put to the European Council in Dublin in December.</P>
    <P>At national level, the most important preparation being undertaken is of course aimed at ensuring that the convergence criteria for entry to economic and monetary union set out in the treaty continue to be met.  As regards the general Government debt and deficit criteria, Ireland has been adjudged not to have an excessive deficit in each of the three years in which the excessive deficit procedure in the treaty has been in operation, and indeed our deficit has been well below the treaty reference value of 3 per cent of GDP every year since and including 1989.  Our interest and inflation rates also meet the relevant criteria, while the Irish pound trades comfortably in the ERM.  The Government intends to ensure that Ireland continues to meet the treaty criteria.</P>
    <P>A further vital aspect of our preparations for economic and monetary union is to ensure that the Irish economy is as strong and competitive as possible.  As the Deputy will be aware, the current economic climate in Ireland is characterised by high economic growth and high employment growth, low inflation, a declining debt-to-GDP ratio, a balance of payments surplus, interest rates close to historically low levels, moderate wage developments under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and substantial investment under the Community Support Framework.  Economic prospects are bright and the Government is committed to continuing its sound management of the economy with a view to ensuring that Ireland remains competitive in the single market.  The implications of economic and monetary union are being taken into account in the ongoing formulation of policy in relation to the economy and the public finances.  In this way the Irish economy will stand ready not only to qualify for economic and monetary union but also to take maximum advantage of its benefits.</P>
    <P>On the practical level, in summer 1995 my Department circulated to all Departments the European Commission Green Paper on the Practical Arrangements for the Introduction of the Single Currency and asked each Department to appoint a single currency officer.  My Department chairs regular meetings of the single currency officers team, whose remit is to alert Departments to the advent of the single currency and to help ensure that they make appropriate arrangements for the changeover to it.  The SCOT also includes representatives from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office. The SCOT meets regularly to discuss the preparations necessary for the introduction of the single currency and to plan for them.</P>
    <P>A sub-group of the SCOT, comprising the single currency officers of the Departments which are likely to be most affected by the changeover, was set up early in 1996, to help drive forward the work of the SCOT.  The Departments of Finance, <Col N="831" /> Social Welfare, Education, and Transport, Energy and Communications, as well as the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, are represented on it.</P>
    <P>A network of single currency co-ordinators has been set up by the European Commission and my Department participates in it.  Work is also ongoing in relation to planning for the timely provision of public information in relation to the changeover to the euro.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank of Ireland is engaged in ongoing consultations with the banking and financial sector, which will have a key role in relation to the Single Currency from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>As regards the involvement of the private sector generally, an informal technical working group on economic and monetary union has been set up to advise my Department on technical issues in the run-up to the 1998 Council decision on which member states qualify for economic and monetary union.  The Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Irish Bankers' Federation, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Stock Exchange, and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies-Ireland, as well as my Department and the Central Bank of Ireland, are represented on this informal group.  The group would probably from the nucleus of a more formal structure, like the Irish Decimal Currency Board which oversaw the decimalisation of the Irish pound in 1971, to overseas the practical arrangements needed to manage the transition to the euro.</P>
    <P>With regard to the effects of the single currency on various sectors, the ESRI report <i>Economic Implications for Ireland of European Monetary Union,</i> an independent study which I commissioned earlier this year on behalf of the Government, is a comprehensive analysis of the impact of economic and monetary union on the Irish economy.  A primary focus for the study was an examination of the implications of economic and monetary union for the Irish economy, including in a situation where the UK, at least initially, stayed outside the euro zone.  The consultants concluded that membership of economic and monetary union, even if the UK did not join, would be beneficial, on balance, for Ireland.  The ESRI report includes detailed consideration of the impact of economic and monetary union, under various membership scenarios, on the agricultural sector and the agrifood sector, as well as on the financial services, manufacturing, retail distribution and tourism sectors of the economy.  A copy of the ESRI report was sent to all Oireachtas Members shortly after its publication last July.</P>

      <P>The Public Sector Transfer Scheme provides for the transfer of service for superannuation purposes on a reciprocal basis among participating organisations.  The scheme allows for the transfer of any actual service given with a participating organisation which at the time of transfer was pensionable service for the purposes of the organisation's pension scheme.  However, the scheme does not allow the transfer of non-pensionable service.  In the case in question, CIE has stated that the service concerned was not pensionable at the time it was given, nor would it have become pensionable, for normal old age pension purposes, if the individual had remained with CIE.  It cannot therefore be transferred.</P>

      <P>Where an individual is totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity throughout a tax year, and employs a person to take care of him or her, the individual is entitled to a deduction up to a maximum of £7,500 from his or her taxable income.  The relief also applies where the taxpayer jointly assessed for tax employs the carer for his or her incapacitated spouse.  In the 1996 budget this allowance was increased from a maximum of £5,000 to £7,500 per annum.</P>
      <P>Given the level of this allowance the criteria for eligibility applying to it are correctly quite restrictive.  It is available only where a taxpayer or their spouse is totally incapacitated throughout a tax year and the taxpayer employs a carer. While theoretically the allowance could be available to an incapacitated person who employs his or her spouse to take care of him or her, in practice such an allowance is unlikely to be of any real value in such circumstances.</P>

    <P>The register for value added tax does not include businesses which are exempt from that tax, for example, financial services, banking, medical and education services.  These are registered for PAYE/PRSI, corporation tax or income tax &mdash; non-PAYE &mdash; as appropriate. Statistics are not available which would enable the numbers of businesses classified as multinationals to be provided.</P>
    <P>The number of tax units which are identified on income tax records as being in receipt of farming profits is estimated at 102,000, and this number is included in the figure of 268,000 given above for income tax, non-PAYE.  It includes some 19,200 farmers who are not formally assessed to tax annually because their incomes are clearly too low to attract a tax liability.  Farm units are not classified by size.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware that there is a delay in the reporting of cervical smear tests in St. Luke's Hospital.  A backlog of smears has built up since January 1995, when the cervical smear laboratory charge was removed.  At present an opportunistic, as opposed to an organised, cervical screening service is available to all women through their general practitioners, family planning clinics, maternity hospitals and special clinics in health boards.  This has resulted in a demand led service and, in the case of St. Luke's Hospital, has resulted in an increase in smears being analysed. This has brought the overall volume of smears for analysis well over the limit which is manageable under present staffing and resource levels.  The capacity of the laboratory is approximately 30,000 and this year it is expected that the number of smears to be analysed will be in the region of 40,000.</P>
      <P>The backlog in St. Luke's Hospital is approximately 12 weeks for routine screening. However, the hospital management has stressed that urgent or special cases are dealt with immediately.  The hospital has reached agreement with staff to carry out additional work in order to reduce the backlog by at least 50 per cent by the end of the year.  The hospital is also looking at other options in the short term to totally eliminate the backlog.  It also intends to provide additional space and facilities, so that it will be in a position to cope with additional smear test workloads in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department carried out an analysis of the cervical screening system in 1995 and there has been a notable increase in the number of smear <Col N="839" /> tests being measured in most publicly funded laboratories, relative to previous years.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to address specific issues in relation to cancer services. Cancer was identified in the health strategy Shaping a Healthier Future as one of the three major causes of mortality in the under 65 age group in Ireland.  The strategy set a target of reducing the death rate from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15 per cent in the ten year period from 1994.  For these reasons I have circulated a draft of a national cancer strategy to other Government Departments for their observations. When these observations have been received I intend to bring the strategy to Government for approval.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> The determination of eligibility for a medical card is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers use income guidelines in deciding on eligibility and will take account of the medical circumstances of the person concerned.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board in the case referred to by the Deputy and I understand that when the application was assessed the board found that the person's family income was in excess of the medical card income guidelines.  The board concluded that the financial means at the disposal of the person's family should enable them to meet their medical costs, that is, general practitioner fees, cost of any medicines not covered by the drugs refund scheme at this time.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any information relating to a change in the person's circumstances which would have implications for eligibility for a medical card, perhaps he could relay same to me and I will gladly have the matter followed up with the Southern Health Board.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> Acute hospitals are funded to provide acute hospital services for those patients who need them.  Many patients, including elderly patients, may require acute hospital care initially but much of their recovery period could be spent in step down sub-acute accommodation.  For a number of years now there has been a shortage of sub-acute beds, particularly in Dublin.  This has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough, to cater for new patients who urgently need the services.  This sometimes results in patients having to be placed on trolleys in accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>When a patient is admitted to an acute hospital bed it is each acute hospital's policy to immediately instigate a planned care programme for the discharge of that patient to the appropriate care setting.  The care plan decided upon is arrived at having taken into consideration the medical and social needs of the patient and could involve any of the following: discharge home to families; discharge home with community care support; discharge home with additional community care support, that is, community ward team; convalescent care; respite-intermittent care; welfare care; rehabilitation care; and long stay care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already provided details to the House of the significant improvements which I have put in place to improve the sub-acute sector since I came into office and I hope to put additional facilities in place for the winter of 1996-97.  It is vital that patients who are medically assessed as no longer requiring acute hospital treatment be discharged as quickly as possible.  It is essential <Col N="844" /> to ensure that acute hospital beds are utilised as effectively as possible in the interests of patients who urgently need acute hospital services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> As the Deputy will be aware, the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia, including Alzheimer's Disease, and their families.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Additional funding was made available to the health services to implement key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care, respite services and nursing home places has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's Disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  This is reflected in the ongoing progress being made to improve further health and welfare services for the elderly and their carers, including the development of specialist assessment and community support services for people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.</P>
      <P>My Department allocates £80,000 annually in core funding to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in recognition of the contribution the society is making to the development of services for people with dementia throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which commenced on 1 September, 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Just over £16 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to mention the conference, entitled Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders &mdash; Practical Management and Prevention, which is being held in Limerick on 20-22 November.  This conference has been organised by my Department, in association with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and with the support of the European Commission.  The purpose of the conference is to exchange information and to evaluate the success of <Col N="845" /> practical advice and management and prevention strategies currently employed in relation to Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders.  I am confident that the conference will be thought provoking and that the papers presented will provide a useful database for policy makers, health professionals, hospital managers and carers working with sufferers of Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias.</P>

    <P>To coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month the Irish Cancer Society has arranged, in association with health boards, the staging of a play on breast cancer in a number of venues throughout the country.  The play aims to increase the public's knowledge and understanding of the importance of early detection of breast cancer and the role of self-examination and breast cancer screening.  Admission is free and the organisers encourage men and women to come along.  The performance is followed by a workshop session where a breast cancer nurse and a cancer specialist answer any queries which are raised.  In the North Western Health Board <Col N="848" /> four performances of the play have taken place, two in Donegal, one in Sligo and one in Leitrim.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, breast screening is one element of a national cancer strategy which I have circulated to other Government Departments for consideration.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The World Health Organisation through the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has investigated antimony trioxide and has concluded on the basis of its research that there is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of antimony trioxide in humans.</P>
      <P>On that basis it has designated antimony trioxide as an agent which is possibly carcinogenic to humans.  It has therefore been designated as being a member of group 2B in accordance with WHO criteria.  This category is generally used for agents for which there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans in the absence of sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.  It may also be used when there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans or when human data are non-existent but there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.  In some instances, an agent for which there is inadequate evidence or no data in humans but limited evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals together with supporting evidence from other relevant data may be placed in this group.</P>
      <P>I would not therefore have a justification to seek a prohibition on the use of antimony trioxide to fireproof mattresses.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Wexford who is living in the South Eastern Health Board area and in receipt of a medical card cannot have an appointment with her orthopaedic surgeon until September 1997 in spite of the fact that she is in very bad health.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand from the South Eastern Health Board that the person in question is scheduled for an out-patient appointment with a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, in September 1997.  The appointment date was based on the general practitioner's referral letter which gave no indication of any urgency of any nature.  The scheduling of appointments is a matter for the clinical judgement of the consultant concerned and <Col N="853" /> is based solely on the patient's condition. Emergency cases are given priority.  The patient's general practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>

      <P>My Department's scheme of grant-aid to voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling has been extended this year to include voluntary organisations providing counselling to children whose parents' marriages have broken down.  Expenditure for the year to date is £502,400.

The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by Area Development <Col N="856" /> (ADM) Limited.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 155 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National policies and measures for the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions are set out in the National CO 2 Abatement Strategy and the National Communication under the UN <Col N="861" /> Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC; copies of these documents are in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The principal measures designed to support the objectives of Irish climate change policy are: intensified promotion of energy conservation and of alternative/renewable energy management policies; demand side management of electricity consumption; improved insulation standards for new buildings; improved public transport and traffic management policies and increased afforestation.</P>
    <P>The UNFCCC allows that, among developed countries, there will be differences in starting points, approaches, economic structures and resource bases and that there is a need for equitable and appropriate contributions by developed country parties to the convention. Similarly, EU policy acknowledges that certain member states, including Ireland, are entitled to have CO 2 targets and/or strategies corresponding to their economic and social development, while improving the energy efficiency of their economic activities.</P>
    <P>In according with these considerations, Ireland's national policy is based on the objective of limiting CO 2 emissions in the year 2000 to not more than 20 per cent above their 1990 level. Provisional estimates are that CO 2 emissions in 1995 were 10.45 per cent higher than in 1990; this indicates that the limitation target is within reach, despite considerably higher economic growth than was originally foreseen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has paid a grant of £60,000 towards the administrative and general expenses of RRI in respect of their housing-related activities in 1996.  It is not possible to indicate, at this stage, the level of funding that might be available to RRI in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> RRI has been granted approved body status for the purposes of the voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes and are providing a number of houses under these schemes.  Households moving under the RRI programme may be eligible for local authority house purchase loans or shared ownership, and the deposit requirement under the latter scheme has been eased in these cases.  The mortgage allowance and improvement works-in-lieu schemes can also be used to assist families wishing to resettle in a rural area.</P>
    <P>A new resettlement mortgage jointly funded by the Housing Finance Agency, through the local authority, Bank of Ireland and RRI was introduced on 1 July 1996 on a pilot basis.  This new mortgage will assist qualifying families to resettle permanently by purchasing and restoring, where necessary, existing houses.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting with the Minister for the Environment, RRI proposed that resettlement should become a new local authority housing option and that an additional &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; grant be provided to a family vacating a local authority house.  The significant support provided by my Department to RRI means that their programme can already be regarded as one of the range of social housing options now available.  However, as indicated previously, there are no proposals to provide for an additional &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; grant along the lines proposed by RRI at the recent meeting.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163, 169, 195 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the cases which have been made to my Department for the introduction of a remedial teaching service in the areas in question.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools. When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the areas in question will receive every consideration.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.  However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider <Col N="873" /> range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 139 of 10 October 1996 which gives details of funding to the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) over the last three years.</P>
      <P>My Department does not specifically designate the level of funding to be expended on an olympic sport.  The funds allocated to the OCI are to assist the Irish team with their preparation for and participation in the Olympic Games and to meet the cost of international competition/ programmes of its affiliated sporting organisations.</P>
      <P>Annual grants are also allocated by my Department to those national governing bodies of sport recognised by the Irish Sports Council and my Department, including those which are affiliated to the OCI.  Details of grant allocations are published in my Department's annual report <i>Sport in Ireland.</i> Details of expenditure by the OCI are shown in the annual audited accounts which are forwarded to my Department by the OCI.</P>
      <P>It would not be normal practice for my Department to interfere in the internal affairs of sports organisations.  However, the working group established to prepare a national strategy for sport in Ireland is carrying out a wide-ranging and detailed review of all aspects of sport, including the funding of sports organisations.  The group is due to complete its work later this year and the matter of future funding will be considered in the light of the group's report.</P>

      <P>My Department provides school transport for children attending special schools and classes on either scheduled or special services.  However, in some cases, this is not possible due to particular circumstances such as excessive cost, too long a distance, or the inability of a child to avail of the service because of the nature of the disability.  In such cases, my Department offers a grant to the parents to help defray the cost of private transport arrangements.

Within the available resources, each qualifying organisation is provided with a block grant on the basis of information supplied in its application regarding its youth work programme, staffing and administrative expenses, and on the basis of the Department's assessment of its ongoing effectiveness.</P>
      <P>The funding provided under the youth service grant scheme is a grant-in-aid in respect of the youth work programmes and services of the organisation as a whole and it is a matter for the organisation itself, subject to compliance with Departmental requirements concerning ongoing effectiveness etc., to decide on issues such as the numbers and salaries of its staff.  The Department considers, therefore, that the allocation of separate grants for the salary and programme costs of an organisation is not warranted.</P>

      <P>Under <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for a Partnership (PPG) Government 1993-97 it was agreed that the statutory apprenticeship scheme would be improved by developing a &ldquo;standards-based&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;time-served&rdquo; approach.  A new apprenticeship training model, comprising of four on-the-job training modules and three off-the-job training modules, was developed.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental working group representative of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, FÁS, the regional technical colleges/DIT and the Department of Education agreed on the basic operational principles underlying the arrangements between FÁS and the colleges for the delivery of the off-the-job training of apprentices.</P>
      <P>In general the first off-the-job training module will take place in FÁS training centres and the second and final off-the-job training modules will take place in regional technical college/DIT institutions.  The new apprenticeship system is being implemented on a phased basis and will result in the rationalisation of craft apprenticeship programmes.</P>
      <P>When the new system is fully operational and the traditional day and block release courses are phased out, some colleges involved in the delivery of day release motor apprentice programmes will no longer be required to be providers of such programmes.  These colleges, including the college referred to by the Deputy, have been notified of this situation.</P>
      <P>However, as a result of representations made to me by the college management and members of the local motor industry I have arranged that the situation will be kept under review in the light of recruitment patterns in the motor apprenticeship area.</P>

Consideration of this application must be in the context of the report of the steering group of the <Col N="884" /> Commission on School Accommodation Needs on the rationalisation of the vocational education committees which I received recently.

      <P>Under the terms of the school transport scheme, the pupil to whom the Deputy refers is eligible for concessionary fare paying transport only, as she resides less than two miles from her nearest national school.  The most that may be offered, therefore, is concessionary fare-paying transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> The granting of the fare-paying concession is subject to there being no extra State cost incurred in facilitating the child.  The extension of a smaller bus would be a breach of these guidelines, particularly since another bus which could transport the child passes her home.</P>
    <P>I regret, particularly in view of the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, that it is not open to my Department to alter the route of the service as requested, to cater for a concessionary fare-paying pupil at extra cost.</P>

      <P>The reports of the technical working group and the steering group of the Commission on School Accommodation Needs on the rationalisation of the vocational education committees recommended the amalgamation of five urban district vocational education areas with county vocational education areas.  This recommendation included the amalgamation of the Town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee with County Wexford Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept in principle the recommendations for rationalisation contained in the report of the steering group.  I intend to make the amalgamation order in relation to the five town vocational education committee, including Town <Col N="886" /> of Wexford Vocational Education Committee, early in 1997 to take effect from 1 January 1998. At the same time, I will put in place a process of facilitation to ensure that the amalgamation proceeds smoothly, while retaining local committees representing the five towns, including Wexford, until the next local elections.</P>

      <P>There is currently one psychologist from my Department's psychological service assigned for second-level schools in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>As part of the policy outlined in the White Paper on Education it is stated that the psychological service for schools will be expanded.  It is envisaged that the provision of this service will be a function of the proposed education boards.  In the light of this policy statement it is clear that it is accepted that an increase in the availability of psychological services to schools would be beneficial.</P>
      <P>My Department's psychological service was expanded substantially in 1995, when ten additional psychologists were recruited.  These psychologists were assigned to primary schools with priority given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  When further development becomes possible the needs of children, and of schools, in various areas, including County Donegal, will be borne in mind.</P>

      <Col N="893" /> In the current year, in addition to targeting posts on the breaking the cycle initiative, I am targeting available posts on the following special needs areas; extra resource teacher appointments to assist ordinary primary schools in meeting the needs of children with disabilities who are enrolled in mainstream classes; extra visiting teacher appointments to both the visiting teacher service for travellers and the visiting teacher service for children with disabilities attending ordinary schools; and extra teachers for special classes for children with severe or profound mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the above, my Department is always willing to consider the merits of any individual special project.  If the Deputy has a particular project in mind, he may wish to submit details to my Department for consideration.</P>

      <P>In March, 1994, the Lucan Sports and Leisure Centre applied for a grant of £37,000 under my Department's recreational facilities scheme for the installation of a floor and heating system in the complex, which was estimated to cost £53,000. In view of the very large number of applications received under this scheme and the relatively limited funds available it was only possible to provide a grant of £10,000.</P>
      <P>As the grant was insufficient to undertake the proposed works it was agreed that the grant would be paid in respect of equipment which the complex also required.  All the conditions of the scheme for the payment of the grant were met and to date a total of £9,209 has been paid on the basis of invoices received.</P>

      <P>Under the rules for national schools, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of the school.  The authority of the principal teacher for the organisation and conduct of the school derives from the authority of the board.  Subject to the authority of the board, the overall responsibility for the day-to-day activities of the school devolves on the principal teacher.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the teaching staff, the principal should decide on the organisation of the pupils for teaching purposes.  The board ultimately is responsible for classroom arrangements in the school and the placement of pupils for teaching purposes.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has disadvantaged status.  This entitles the school to a supplementary capitation grant of £30 per pupil in addition to the normal capitation grant of £45.</P>
      <P>Also, by virtue of its inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school has the services of an ex-quota concessionary teacher on a shared basis and is included in the home school community liaison scheme.  The school is also entitled to the following additional supports: grants to provide school books for needy pupils; refund of television licence fee; and 95 per cent building grants.</P>

      <P>My Department receives occasional inquiries from parents and students regarding the delivery of results to their homes.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for issuing results to the schools in the case of candidates entered by schools.  In the first place, my Department wants to ensure that, as far as possible, all candidates receive their results on the same day.  This is most desirable to minimise anxiety on the part of candidates and their parents.  The position is that An Post can guarantee next-day delivery of the results to the 800 second level schools but cannot guarantee next-day delivery to the homes of so large a number of individual students.</P>
      <P>I also stress that a very positive role is played by school principals and teachers in conveying the results directly to their students and in providing support to candidates who may be distressed by the results.  Candidates who are disappointed can be reassured by the principal and teachers that there are options open to them, including the option of applying for a recheck.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at this point to issue results to student's homes in the case of students who are entered for the certificate examinations by their schools.</P>

      <P>My Department has examined the accommodation situation at Kilmurray national school and accepts that an additional classroom with ancillary accommodation is required.  However, due to the current level of contractual commitments on the primary school capital programme, I am not in a position to give a commitment as to when funding will be made available towards the proposed development.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school will be considered when the next capital programme is being determined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together.</P>
      <P>The NCEA was established under the NCEA Act, 1979.  This Act provides it, <i>inter alia,</i> with powers of validation and certification for recognised courses.  The National Council for Vocational Awards was established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in 1991.  It's terms of reference are outlined in the annexe to this reply.</P>
      <P>The considerations leading to the establishment of TEASTAS, as set out in the White Paper <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> included the generally accepted need for a more coherent and effective system of certification for the extra-university sector of higher education as well as for the vocational training sector.</P>
      <P>In giving effect to this recognition, which was welcomed and supported by a wide range of education, training and industry interests, TEASTAS, the Irish National Certification Authority &mdash; was established in September 1995 on an interim basis, pending the enactment of the necessary legislation.  The interim Authority's terms of reference are also outlined in the annexe to this reply.  These include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Terms of Reference of the Interim Irish National Certification Authority &mdash; TEASTAS: <Col N="897" /> to advise the Minister on actions to be undertaken in the interim period and, where appropriate, to undertake any such actions which it considers necessary to assist in putting in place a single, nationally and internationally accepted, certification structure covering all extra-university third level and all further and continuing education and</P>
    <P>training programmes including advice on the plans, programmes and budgets necessary for the carrying out of the function of TEASTAS as decided by the Government and including in particular to:</P>
    <P>&mdash;enter into discussions with NCEA and NCVA and with bodies which provide education and training programmes leading to awards of these bodies to facilitate the process of integrating NCEA and NCVA in the TEASTAS framework having regard to existing legislation;</P>
    <P>&mdash;enter into discussions with other State bodies which provide extra-university third level and further and continuation education and training programmes to facilitate the inclusion of their certification processes within the TEASTAS framework, including CERT, FÁS, Teagasc;</P>
    <P>&mdash;examine and advise on the processes used by bodies to be included in the TEASTAS framework for evaluation, validation and accreditation of programmes and for student assessment with a view to guaranteeing satisfactory standards and ensuring quality of courses and qualifications;</P>
    <P>&mdash;make arrangements for the establishment of clear routes of progression for individuals from foundation award to higher degree through a standard system of graded qualifications which allows for qualifications to be acquired through full-time and part-time courses and which includes provision for credit accumulation and for recognition of experiential and work-based learning;</P>
    <P>&mdash;make proposals for access to the TEASTAS framework by other providers of education and training and/or the credit to be attributed by TEASTAS to certification outside its framework;</P>
    <P>&mdash;enter into discussions with the universities in relation to the credit to be attributed to TEASTAS certification;</P>
    <P>&mdash;provide for the formal involvement of industry and social partners in the <Col N="898" /> developments and assessment of programmes;</P>
    <P>&mdash;encourage the establishment of improved linkages generally between business and industry and providers of programmes which will help to ensure that programmes are relevant to the needs of today and adaptable to changing circumstances in the work environment while at the same time providing for the general development and wider skill needs of individual participants;</P>
    <P>&mdash;promote mutual transnational recognition of qualification acquired under its remit, particularly in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>to undertake any other actions which are necessary to enable TEASTAS to discharge the functions decided by Government.</P>
    <P>to advise the Minister on the legislative framework to establish TEASTAS &mdash; the Irish National Certification Authority &mdash; on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Terms of Reference of the National Council for Vocational Awards</P>
    <P>(a) Subject to the approval of the Minister for Education</P>
    <P>(i) to structure courses in vocational/ technical education and training, as provided by the education system, on a modular basis;</P>
    <P>(ii) to develop an appropriate framework of levels of qualifications for these courses;</P>
    <P>(iii) to develop modular content for the core modules of such courses to be applied at a national level;</P>
    <P>(iv) to review and approve regional specific modules as proposed by Regional Co-ordinating Groups;</P>
    <P>(v) to establish guidelines, criteria and standards for the assessment of participants' performance by individual course providers;</P>
    <P>(b) to monitor compliance with criteria and standards through an ongoing review of national returns on performance and the auditing of individual course providers on a targeted/sampling basis;</P>
    <P>(c) to certify participants performance based on the outcome of assessment by course providers, subject to compliance with assessment criteria and standards;</P>
    <P>(d) to accredit, subject to the approval of the Minister for Education, the awards of a limited number of examining bodies of long standing in the field of vocational/professional education;</P>
    <P>(e) to act as a National Agency for the recognition of relevant vocational qualifications obtained in other member states of the European Community and as an Information Centre for authorities in other member states in relation to NCVA qualifications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> (f) to advise the Minister on actions to be undertaken in the interim period and, where appropriate, to undertake any such actions which it considers necessary to assist in putting in place a single, nationally and internationally accepted, certification structure covering all extra-university third level and all further and continuing education and training programmes including advice on the plans, programmes and budgets necessary for the carrying out of the function of TEASTAS as decided by the Government.</P>
    <P>For this purpose the terms of reference of the interim authority provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that TEASTAS shall enter into discussions with NCEA and NCVA and with bodies which provide education and training programmes leading to awards of these bodies to facilitate the process of integrating NCEA and NCVA in the TEASTAS framework having regard to existing legislation and enter into discussions with other State bodies which provide extra-university third level and further and continuation education and training programmes to facilitate the inclusion of their certification processes within the TEASTAS framework, including CERT, FÁS, Teagasc;</P>
    <P>TEASTAS, since its establishment as an interim body, has been engaged in an exhaustive range of consultations with all relevant interests, including the NCEA and the NCVA.  In this context, it organised a colloquium on 25 September, 1996 to provide a broad-based forum for further consultation with a view to facilitating the board of TEASTAS to advance its proposals and recommendations to me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213, 218 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875 a licence is required to be issued by my Department for the importation of fireworks.  It is long-standing policy that such licences are only issued for organised public displays conducted by professional operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this restriction, it is clear that supplies of fireworks continue to be imported illegally into the country, particularly around Halloween.  The Garda Síochána, who are concerned about the dangers posed by illegally imported fireworks, make a concerted effort at this time each year to control the illegal possession, sale and use of fireworks and bangers.  Special measures are taken in addition to the normal routine policing measures.  These include: the setting up of a Special Garda Unit in Dublin consisting of a <Col N="901" /> Garda sergeant and five gardaí specifically to deal with the fireworks problem; attention to known trouble areas; liaison with other services; and arrangements to have the dangers of fireworks publicised in the media.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Garda authorities monitor the supply and storage of fireworks.  Special attention is paid to ports and the Border areas.  Significant seizures are made each year as a result of their vigilance.  In 1994 and 1995 illegally imported fireworks vlaued at approximately £120,000 and £100,000 respectively, were confiscated by the gardaí over the Halloween period and subsequently destroyed.  In the Dublin area the value of confiscated illegal fireworks was in excess of £86,000.</P>
    <P>I realise that despite the measures the Garda Síochána are taking, there is a very visible flouting of the law by casual traders on our streets.  There are a number of obstacles to stopping this widespread trade including the difficulties of achieving successful prosecutions from which penalties with sufficient deterrence would result.  I have nevertheless asked the Commissioner to give special attention to this problem and to carry out a review as soon as possible of the measures that should be taken to put an end to this trade in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 233 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 45 Garda stations in the Dublin <Col N="902" /> Metropolitan Area.  The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to different areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that the policing requirements of the Dublin Metropolitan Area are continually monitored by the Assistant Commissioner responsible for the area with a view to ensuring that Garda resources are deployed to optimum benefit.  The Garda authorities report that at present they are satisfied that all resources in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, including uniform, detective and specialist units, are deployed effectively and are sufficient to meet current policing needs.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have reviewed their operations in regard to combating the drugs problem in Dublin city and the Garda Commissioner announced a new strategy, Operation Dóchas, which came into effect on 7 October 1996.  The new strategy is in operation in all Dublin districts and involves the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plain-clothes gardaí.  Uniformed gardaí adopt a high profile through both foot patrols and mobile patrols and work to forge greater links with local communities, both community leaders and individual families.  The allocation of resources varies from district, depending on the priority needs of each area.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that this operation has not involved the allocation of additional gardaí to the Dublin Metropolitan Area from other areas but, of course, was facilitated by the return of more than 160 Dublin based gardaí from temporary Border duties earlier this month.  Operation Dóchas is a community based strategic policing operation and while the predominant emphasis of the operation is drugs, it also extends to crime generally and all policing matters.  The Garda authorities are not in favour of detailed disclosure of Garda strategies, functions and so on in relation to this operation on the basis that it would prove counterproductive.  I accept their professional judgment on this score.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a facility to enable members of each recognised representative association for the different ranks in the Garda Síochána to have their association membership subscriptions deducted from their pay.  As of 17 October 1996 the number of members of Garda rank in the force was 8,460.  On the same day subscriptions in respect of the Garda Representative Association were being deducted from the pay of 6,055 gardaí, approximately 1,000 of whom, in four Garda Divisions, while paying their subscriptions, are not full participants in the affairs of the GRA.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that subscription deduction facilities on the Garda payroll system are not made available to the Garda federation which is not a recognised association but the Federation say they have approximately 2,500 members.</P>

This <Col N="907" /> is in addition to the 350 gardaí already being recruited this year and another 350 planned for in 1997.  The anti-crime package also provided for the recruitment of an additional 200 civilians to the force, which will facilitate the release of an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties.  The current Garda recruitment competition covers the period 1994 to 1997.</P>

      <P>Many of the activities managed and funded by my Department, while not focused primarily on the care of children, do include certain services for children.  Examples of the foregoing are the Garda Síochána Juvenile Liaison Service, the Garda Mother and Child Unit, the various youth diversion schemes funded by my Department, the Children's Court in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court and certain services operated by the Probation and Welfare Service.  The remit of each of these services is broader than the care of children.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be practical to extract any meaningful expenditure figures relating directly to the care of children.</P>
      <P>However, if the Deputy wishes to expand on her precise area of interest in relation to the care of children or to put down a question about a particular aspect of services operated by or under the aegis of my Department which have dealings in the area of children, I will endeavour to assist her in providing the information requested.</P>

      <P>The sittings of the High Court on circuit are governed by sections 32 and 34 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, as amended by section 12 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1953 and by section 42 of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  Any amendments to these provisions would require amending <Col N="909" /> legislation.  I have no proposals in that regard at present.</P>
      <P>Sittings of the High Court hearing applications under its original jurisdiction are governed by Order 36 Rules 1 and 2 of S.I. No. 15 of 1986 (Rules of the Superior Courts) as substituted by S.I. No. 260 of 1992 (Rules of the Superior Courts (No. 2), 1992).</P>
      <P>Section 68 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936 provides that the power of making, annulling or altering rules of court for the High and Supreme Courts shall be exercisable by the Superior Courts Rules Committee with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.  It is not, therefore, open to me to make amendments to the Rules of the Superior Courts.</P>
      <P>I might add, however, that the terms of reference of the Working Group on a Courts Commission, which is being chaired by the Hon. Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, includes a review of the operation of the courts system, having regard to the level and quality of service provided to the public and it is open to the Deputy to make a submission on this, or indeed on any other matter, to the working group.  To date the working group has published two reports and is continuing its work.  I look forward to receiving further recommendations of the group in due course.</P>

      <P>I have noted the Deputy's concerns on this matter.  It is, however, a matter which requires careful consideration both by my Department and the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>There is, on the face of it, considerable merit in this suggestion but there is a number of issues to be considered first in relation to it.  They have to do, <i>inter alia,</i> with a potential for disposal of evidence, the prospect of success and whether an amnesty is appropriate where some of such weapons may have been used in very serious crime.  I propose to keep the matter under review, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <Quest>the reason back-to-school grants from his Department have been withdrawn in 1996 from children in receipt of orphan's allowance whose foster parents are on social welfare and in receipt of back-to-school payments for their other children and who in previous years received this grant for all children, including children on orphan's allowance.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions for receipt of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance has always excluded orphans.  The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear.  Certain people on low <Col N="912" /> incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, the claim must be in respect of a qualified child, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, and, they must satisfy a specified means test.  A qualified child is one which falls into one of the age groups specified for the scheme and in respect of whom a child dependant allowance is payable.</P>
      <P>The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of survivors (widows and widowers) contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple.  Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable.</P>
      <P>Orphan's pension is not considered to be a qualifying payment under the terms of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme.  The orphan's pension, which is a basic social welfare payment, is payable to the guardian and is intended to cover the child's cost of living, including food, clothing and footwear.  Eligible applicants will receive either a contributory or non-contributory orphan's pension of up to £42.60 per week.  In comparison, the allowance paid in respect of dependent children with other social welfare or health board payments is either £13.20 or £15.20 per week.  The higher rate of orphan's pension as compared with the child dependant allowance rate means that the guardian receives an additional income of up to £1,528 per annum in respect of the orphaned child.</P>
      <P>My Department issued guidelines relating to this scheme earlier this year setting out the main administrative changes for the scheme in 1996. The guidelines were issued with a view to achieving consistency and equity in the operation of the scheme across the health boards and to prepare for the computerisation of the scheme in 1997.  Following the issue of these guidelines, it was realised by a health board which had previously made payments in respect of orphans, that orphans were not eligible for payment of the allowance as they did not fulfil the condition of having a child dependents allowance in payment and that a payment had been made in error in previous years.  However, in all orphans cases where a need was established, an exceptional need payment was made in 1996 in respect of orphans for whom applications were received.</P>
      <P>I am aware of anomalies in the scheme and have now initiated a review to address these issues.  This review will be completed for the 1997 scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department received an application from the above mentioned group for funding towards the cost of stress management, personal development and assertiveness courses under the scheme of grants to locally-based women's groups.</P>
      <P>Under this scheme grants can be made for a wide range of activities covering almost every aspect of personal and skills development for women/men.  Projects should involve the participants in the running of, and where possible, the design of the project itself.  Priority is given to: projects aimed at developing the skill and expertise of individuals in setting-up and running projects in their communities; groups in disadvantaged areas; projects aimed at specially disadvantaged groups, and new projects establishing themselves in their communities.</P>
      <P>I approved a grant of £800 towards the cost of stress management and personal development courses under this scheme to the group.  The cheque will issue as soon as the group furnish my Department with a tax number as required under the tax clearance procedures under which grants from Government bodies are made.</P>

      <Quest>when he intends to bring forward proposals, promised in April 1995, relating to the eligibility for old age pensions in view of the recommendations of the National Pensions Board in its final report entitled Developing the National Pension System; and if self-employed persons who entered the PRSI scheme in April 1988 will be included in any such proposals.</Quest>

      <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board (NPB) <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> is a comprehensive report which was published on 16 December 1993.</P>
      <P>In this report the NPB put forward, <i>inter alia</i>, a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions generally, including proposals for a wider range of pro-rata pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime.  They also recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension be increased from 156 (three years) to 520 (ten years) contributions.</P>
      <P>The report and its recommendations are being studied within the Department at present and I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals in the context of the next budget.  Any such proposals would also, of course, have to take account of the future funding of pensions generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> In relation to self-employed persons who entered insurance in 1988 as the Deputy will be aware to qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to self-employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self-employed people, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  They are, of course, covered for widow and widower's and orphan's pensions.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated previously while I, in principle, favour a <i>pro-rata</i> pension approach, I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the administration of the disability allowance scheme was transferred to my Department on 2 October 1996.  I expect that, when the initial backlog of claims has been cleared and a normal claiming pattern has been established, claims will be cleared more quickly than was possible previously.  It is the intention that the bulk of disability assistance claims will be processed within four to six weeks of receipt. Every case must be examined on its merits and medical assessments and means investigations are required before decisions on entitlement can be made.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the position of members of the Permanent Defence Force who have availed of unpaid pre-retirement support leave from September 1996 prior to their discharge from the Army in January <Col N="915" /> 1997 under the voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>I understand that this arrangement for voluntary unpaid pre-retirement support leave was put in place in order to facilitate 80 to 90 personnel whose applications for voluntary early retirement could not be granted in 1996 due to over-subscription, and that it was primarily intended for personnel who wished to take up civilian employment at an early date.</P>
      <P>As such personnel continue to be members of the Permanent Defence Force during this period of pre-retirement support leave and their contract of service remains intact, they are not entitled to receive unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance in accordance with the relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>However, I have been informed by the Minister for Defence that he has made arrangements to make advance payments to the individuals concerned so as to ensure that they will not suffer hardship in the period prior to their discharge from the Permanent Defence Forces next January.</P>

      <P>I assume that the reference in the question to five contributions is a typographical error and that the Deputy intended to refer to Class S contributions payable in respect of self-employed persons.</P>
      <P>Self-employed persons are compulsorily insurable under the Social Welfare Acts since 1988.  They are eligible for benefits as follows: widow's/widower's contributory pension; orphan's contributory allowance; old age (contributory) pension.  The normal rate of social insurance contribution (Class S) for self-employed persons is 5 per cent of income up to £22,300 for the present income tax year.  The contributions do not contain any element towards short-term benefits and therefore do not reckon for such benefits under the Acts.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> considered the position of self-employed persons in relation to invalidity pension.  The board recommended against such an extension which was considered to be unacceptably costly to the contributors.</P>

      <P>The underlying purpose of the students summer jobs scheme is to provide income support for less well-off third level students who are unable to find work and who are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance during the summer months.  The scheme was never intended for students who having failed to find work are entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  In my view the scheme offers a very worthwhile opportunity for students and is a very appropriate way of providing financial assistance to the targetted students during this period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report prepared for Forfás provides a good basis for setting new policy directions and I have considered in detail the recommendations which it makes.  As a <Col N="921" /> consequence, I have made the following decisions to sharpen the focus in the management of the property portfolio:</P>
      <P>&mdash; IDA Ireland has been given responsibility for the property portfolio since January 1996.</P>
      <P>&mdash; The private sector will, from now on, have a lead role in the provision of industrial buildings.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Existing properties will be offered for sale, using commercial criteria, to sitting tenants.</P>
      <P>&mdash; If sitting tenants are not in a position to purchase in the short to medium term, then the property will be offered for sale to third party investors, individually or as part of a portfolio.</P>
      <P>&mdash; For vacant properties, where there is a low expectation of occupancy by incoming investment, IDA Ireland will examine other potential employment uses of such buildings, including their sale.</P>
      <P>Property remains an important instrument in competing for foreign direct investment and in facilitating regional development.  But, as the report indicates, our industrial property needs can best be provided through partnerships between the IDA, the private sector and local authorities.  A more tightly run property management function, now being put in place, will ensure that this policy instrument is most efficiently used for development purposes, and the combination of the private sector, local authorities and IDA Ireland should ensure the proper provision of a balanced, internationally competitive land portfolio across the country.  It is very much in the interests of each local authority to make adequate provision for well serviced industrial lands if new industrial projects and new employment are to be secured for their areas.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland reports that an increasing number of projects, particularly large projects, require the scale and range of skills, support services and infrastructure which are only available in the larger urban areas.  I believe that the new policy approach which I have determined will pose a challenge to the IDA, local authorities and private property developers in the Louth area as well as all other areas to effectively co-operate in making those areas outside the greater urban areas attractive to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>In this context, I have asked IDA Ireland to work in partnership with local authorities and the private sector to ensure the provision of suitable sites across the country for industrial development.  The primary objective is to ensure that serviced sites are available so that we continue to be highly competitive in the attraction of foreign investment and to achieve a balanced regional spread, so providing local employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>The regulations regarding food labelling, for which I have responsibility, are comprehensive.  Their purpose is to inform consumers of the content of the food or drink which they consume.  In particular, they provide that the following information must be shown on the accompanying label:</P>
      <P>&mdash; Name of the food or drink;</P>
      <P>&mdash; Net quantity;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&ldquo;use-by&rdquo; date;</P>
      <P>&mdash; Storage instructions;</P>
      <P>&mdash; Name and address of bottler, manufacturer, packer or seller;</P>
      <P>&mdash; Country of origin, only if its absence is likely to mislead consumers;</P>
      <P>&mdash; An indication of the alcoholic strength over 1.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the case of food, there is a requirement to show the ingredients in descending order of importance.  This requirement does not apply to alcoholic beverages on the grounds that their disclosure could breach trade secrets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs, who has responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations, has recently examined the labelling of alcoholic lemonades on sale here.  He has found them to be in compliance with the food labelling provisions.  The products are clearly <Col N="923" /> labelled as being alcoholic fruit drinks, as well as giving an indication of their alcoholic strength.</P>
    <P>However, I continue to be concerned about the labelling of such products.  Therefore, I am now seeking the agreement of the European Commission, and of member states, to introduce stringent requirements for the labelling of alcoholic fruit juices with the aim of protecting consumers' health.</P>

      <P>In 1985 when EU readaptation aid was paid to former Irish Steel workers, the requisite matching funding was the extra statutory redundancy payments paid to the workers.  The case made to Brussels in relation to the Irish Steel workers made redundant following the 1994 restructuring plan is based on that precedent.  Therefore, the question of additional matching funds being made available does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are many factors which impact on the number of people on the live register, a large number of which are outside the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>However, the agencies under my aegis are working hard to develop industry in County Donegal and employment figures have, in fact, risen in the companies which come within the ambit of the agencies.</P>
      <P>Forbairt assists 171 companies in Donegal, employing a total of 3,487 people.  While net job losses were incurred in 1994, net job gains were experienced in 1995.  The annual employment survey for 1996 is under way at present and current indications suggest that 1996 will be as successful as 1995.</P>
      <P>At regional level, a key priority is to work with enterprising promoters, companies and communities to encourage and support new quality start-ups and to assist companies with the potential to grow to achieve competitiveness and profitable growth through technology and innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1995 Forbairt's national linkage programme which helps Irish companies win business from multinationals has also been regionalised and should make a positive impact. The IFI-Forbairt North American Partnership Programme is another initiative to help Donegal <Col N="926" /> companies to further strengthen its industrial base.</P>
    <P>Four Donegal companies have concluded technology partnerships-strategic alliances with US companies &mdash; Bio Medical Research Ltd., Bunbeg, MDR Electronics, Bunbeg, International Test Technologies, Falcarragh and Flite Software Ltd., Letterkenny.  Additional employment is expected to be generated as a result.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is involved with 13 overseas companies located in Donegal, who between them employ 4,496 people.  During the period 1991 to 1995, there has been a net increase of 954 jobs.  Expansion is continuing in a number of overseas companies in the region, including Unifi in Letterkenny and Abbott Laboratories in Donegal town.  Strenuous efforts are being made to find a replacement project for the Ballyshannon area to replace Donegal Rubber.</P>
    <P>In addition, IDA Ireland, together with Donegal County Council, are proposing to develop a Business Park in Letterkenny to assist County Donegal to compete for a share of inward investment in manufacturing and international services.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that a private developer, in conjunction with IDA Ireland, will provide a building of 20,000 sq. ft. in advance of demand on this site as an initial development.  When completed, IDA Ireland will vigorously market this building to suitable overseas clients.</P>
    <P>The Donegal County Enterprise Board, since its inception in 1993, has been very active in the promotion of small business.  The board has approved approximately 150 projects worth over £1 million of which over £400,000 has been drawn down.  Almost 100 jobs have been created in CEB-supported projects.</P>
    <P>In relation to 1996, grant approval capacity of £408,000 has been allocated to Donegal CEB to support the development of small and micro-enterprise projects.  A budget of £140,000 has also been given for indirect enterprise support activity and £120,000 for administrative requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, national responsibility for policy in this area is primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance. As regards my departmental interests, on 12 September of this year in the course of my address to the third <i>Sunday Business Post</i> national small business conference in Dublin Castle I announced my intention to develop a European Monetary Union Business Preparation Awareness Campaign.</P>
      <P>The concept behind this initiative is to help ensure that businesses have the information which is available to assist them to prepare appropriately for the challenge which economic and monetary union presents in an informed way so that they can avoid disruption to their businesses when the changeover to single currency becomes effective.  In launching this initiative I have asked Forfás to co-ordinate an information campaign for enterprise, especially small and medium scale enterprise, on the implications of the economic and monetary union for business operations.  Forfás is currently in the process of developing this initiative.  Forfás's work in this context is being developed in coordination with associated work being planned in other Government Departments.  While this initiative is still in the formative stage, I anticipate that the dissemination of appropriate information to business sectors and organisations will commence soon.</P>
      <P>As regards preparations for economic and monetary union within my Department and in the industrial development agencies, a single currency officers team was formed earlier this year under the chairmanship of the Department of Finance.  All Departments are represented on this group whose remit is to help ensure that Departments make appropriate arrangements for the changeover to the single currency.  In addition the industrial development agencies have themselves established planning groups to handle the changeover to economic and monetary union as it affects their particular operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also asks about reports on the effect of the single currency.  In July 1996 the <Col N="928" /> Economic and Social Research Institute published their Policy Research Series, Paper No. 28, entitled, economic implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>This study was undertaken on behalf of the Government by the ESRI, and the terms of reference indicated the comprehensive nature of the economic analysis which the Government required.  The resulting report entitled, economic implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union, is a comprehensive economic analysis of the impact of the single currency on the various sectors in the Irish economy including the agriculture sector, and it also examines in detail the potential impact on individual sectors of Irish business of a situation where Ireland is a member of economic and monetary union but the United Kingdom, for whatever reason, remains outside the single currency regime.</P>
    <P>Papers have been produced by various bodies on particular aspects of economic and monetary union.  A number of conferences have been held or are planned.  The ESRI study represents the most comprehensive economic appraisal of the likely implications of economic and monetary union membership for Ireland, a copy of which was sent to all Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Travers Task Force was set up by the Government in May 1995 to advise on how best to progress the STIAC report and how its 160 recommendations could be brought forward for implementation.  The STIAC report contained a wide-ranging review of science, technology and innovation policy.</P>
      <P>The task force was chaired by Mr. John Travers, chief executive of Forfás, and its membership included representatives of Government Departments with responsibility for science and technology matters.</P>
      <P>The task force completed its report and presented it to Government in November 1995. It will be used as a basis for the Government response to the STIAC report.  The response will be published very soon.  The work of the task force did not involve any additional expenditure as the members were already paid by the State.</P>
      <P>A Task Force for Industry Adjustment was established in March 1995 and its primary purpose was to identify areas of business at risk from competitive forces and to propose competitive strategies.  In December 1995, the task force approved a change management programme which is designed to facilitate companies in implementing initiatives to increase their competitiveness.  The enterprise development agencies will be responsible for administering this programme.  The work of the task force is ongoing.  There are no costs to my Department associated with this measure as it is co-funded by industry and the EU.</P>
      <P>In March 1996, the terms of reference and composition of a Task Force on Enterprise and the Environment were announced.  Broadly the aim of the task force will be to identify the challenges which industry will face arising from environmental concerns and to identify opportunities for business in providing environmental services and responding to the growing environmental consciousness of consumers.  Three meetings have been held to date.  The task force report will be finalised before year end.  A provision of £15,000 has been made for 1996.</P>
      <P>A Task Force for Tallaght was established in April to make proposals in response to the situation in Tallaght arising out of the announcement of the closure of Packard Electric Ltd.

    <P>I am making urgent arrangements to deal with the situation occasioned by the local authorities who have failed to appoint veterinary inspectors as required by the Act.</P>
    <P>Inspection fees are laid down by the European Communities (Fees for Health Inspections and Controls of Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1995.  The standard rate per head is £3.78 for bovines, £1.03 for pigs and £0.40 for sheep.  Local authorities may, however, in lieu of the standard inspection fee levy the licence holder the actual cost of inspection.  I am not aware of any local authority who has adopted this course to date.</P>

      <P>The monitoring of retail prices is a function of the Director of Consumer Affairs. However, since the BSE crisis, I have paid particular attention to the price of beef at retail level as against the price received by producers.</P>
      <P>Data from the CSO shows that the Consumer Price Index for beef for the period mid-February to mid-August fell by four points on the scale. Average deadweight prices for cattle and heifers slaughtered at licensed export abattoirs fell by 16 per cent over the same period.</P>
      <P>While the CSO data indicates that retail prices have fallen to some extent, I am concerned that the fall in producer prices has not been adequately reflected at retail level.  Accordingly, last month, I asked the Director of Consumer Affairs if he had carried out an investigation of this issue.</P>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has now informed me that he has obtained from the major supermarket chains details of monthly changes in their purchase and retail prices for the main beef cuts.  The investigation has revealed that supermarkets generally have passed on to consumers reductions in the cost of their beef.</P>

    <P>The reductions in the rates of refund from September to November 1995 reflect the EU Commission's attempts to limit the quantity of export licences issued in light of the GATT ceiling on subsidised exports.  The series of increases in refunds on 13 December 1995 and 12 February were in response to representations from various member states, including Ireland, that the earlier cuts were too severe.  The increase on 26 April was designed to encourage exports following the March BSE scare.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult to strike an optimum balance between refunds for live cattle and beef, the current level of live exports to Egypt would indicate that the EU Commission has for the moment measured the balance correctly.  I will, however, keep the matter under review in the light of developments and prices in various markets and I will seek adjustments to the refunds if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU regulations advance payments under the EU special beef premium scheme and the EU suckler cow premium scheme are not normally payable until 1 November each year.  These regulations were amended last year to allow advance payments under the 1995 special beef premium scheme to commence on 16 October 1995.  Ireland commenced payments on that date.  This year, for budgetary reasons, the EU has again amended the regulations to allow commencement of advances, at 80 per cent of entitlement, on 1 October 1996 under both the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the EU special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department has over recent weeks been concentrating on making payments to beef farmers under the special package of measures introduced to compensate farmers for loss of income as a result of the BSE problem.  This entailed making almost 200,000 payments valued at close to £70 million by the final payment date of 15 October 1996.  In addition, payments under the 1996 cattle headage and sheep headage schemes commenced on 26 September last and to date £37.892 million has been paid.  Payments under those particular schemes are continuing. Given the additional logistical problems this year, associated with making payments under the special BSE compensation package, my Department will not be in a position to commence advance payments under the 1996 special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes until 1 November 1996.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that in the period since 1 January 1996 to date some £326.046 million has been paid to Ireland's beef farmers under the various EU bovine headage and premia schemes.  In addition, payments totalling £98.472 million have been made to Ireland's sheep farmers in the same period under the EU ewe premium scheme and the EU sheep headage scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of quota available for distribution from the 1997 national reserve will depend on the number of premium rights that will be forfeited as a result of non-usage of quota in 1996 and the number of rights that accrue to the reserve following the permanent transfer of quotas.  Appeals against forfeiture are proceeding and when these are completed it is expected that the national reserve will comprise approximately 75,000 premium rights.  Some 2,595 farmers have applied for ewe quota allocations from the 1997 national reserve.</P>
      <P>The criteria that will be used in the distribution of the reserve are: Category A: Farmers under 35 years of age on 1 January 1997 who will apply for the ewe premium scheme for the first time in 1997.</P>
      <P>The following conditions must be satisfied: (i) the total income, including that of his/her spouse/partner, must not exceed £16,472.  Any off-farm income included in the total income must not exceed £11,000; (ii) his/her total livestock units &mdash; LU's &mdash; must not exceed 35. The Lu's will be based on his/her 1996 applications under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes and if the applicant is a milk producer, 897 gallons of his/her milk quota will be taken as equal to one livestock unit; (iii) if under 28 years of age on 1 January 1997, the applicant must: (a) have obtained the Teagasc certificate in farming or a higher qualification or (b) have at least three years practical experience in farming and have satisfactorily completed a course in farming of a minimum duration of 150 hours; (iv) if 28 years of age or over but under 35 years of age on 1 January 1997, the applicant must have the requirements set out at (iii) (a) or (iii) (b) above or have at least five years experience in farming.</P>
      <P>Category B: Farmers who have applied regularly for the ewe premium scheme, including farmers who applied for the first time in 1996, and who can demonstrate that the operation of the quota limits will jeopardise the viability of their holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify under this category the applicant must satisfy the following conditions: (i) the total income, including that of his-her spouse-partner, must not exceed £16,472.  Any off-farm income included in that total income must not exceed £11,000; (ii) his/her total livestock units &mdash; LU's <Col N="939" />&mdash; must not exceed 35.  The LU's will be based on his/her 1996 applications under the special beef and suckler cow and ewe premium schemes and if the applicant is a milk producer, 897 gallons of his/her milk quota will be taken as equal to one livestock unit.</P>
    <P>Category C: Farmers who are over 35 years of age on 1 January 1997 and who are first time applicants under the 1997 ewe premium scheme and who satisfy all the other conditions attaching to Category A above.</P>

It also examines the currency exposure and interest rate sensitivity of 40 industrial sectors including a number of food and drinks groups and assesses the impact on these sectors should the UK remain outside the European Monetary Union.

      <P>In its survey of agricultural labour input for 1994 the Central Statistics Office estimated that there were 153,400 farms in Ireland, and published data relating to the classification of these farms according to farm size.  There is no corresponding data relating to farm income available from the CSO, but family farm incomes, on a farm-size basis, are available from Teagasc's National Farm Survey.  Figures relating to such income are available for 1995 and these, together with the various farm size categories, are set out in the table beneath.</P>

      <P>There are no plans at this stage to reintroduce the control of farm pollution scheme, dairy hygiene scheme or alternative enterprise scheme.  However, should additional funds become available as a result of the mid-term review of the Structural Funds, consideration will be given to the reintroduction of the dairy hygiene scheme in a modified form.</P>
      <P>The farm improvement programme which was launched in 1986 continues to apply for those farmers who took out farm plans before 8 December 1994, when the scheme was suspended by the previous administration.  Farmers who had planned investments may apply to carry out these works as per their farm plan.  Due to a shortage of funds provided in the operational programme it was necessary to limit the re-launched Farm Improvement Programme to investments in horticulture.  This scheme which was launched in 1995 and is open to applications has not been suspended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants in REPS are required to have an agri-environmental plan drawn up detailing how the scheme's measures are applied at farm level. One of the principal measures of REPS deals with waste management.  Under this measure participant farmers must provide for the storage and management of farm waste in a manner which avoids pollution.  In many instances such facilities exist already.  Over the last five years <Col N="943" /> alone over 40,000 farmers have been grant aided for pollution control works involving aid in excess of £200 million.  In addition considerable numbers have joined REPS and it is not anticipated that the suspension of the schemes will seriously affect uptake under REPS.  Indeed, the conditions of the REPS were amended to allow those who had not joined the CFP scheme to provide an alternative method of pollution control which satisfied the requirements of REPS.</P>

      <P>The overall objective of the clawback recently put in place is to bias the operation of the quota system in favour of active milk producers.  It will achieve this by promoting temporary leasing as an alternative to land-quota leasing as well as quota restructuring, both of which schemes make quota available to producers in priority categories.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate how much quota will be transferred to these schemes or to the national reserve as a result of this measure.</P>

      <P>A proposal for a Council Directive to introduce rational planning techniques in the electricity and gas distribution sectors was forwarded by the European Commission to the Council on 14 November 1995.  The proposal has been examined by the Council working party on energy on a number of occasions and was also considered by the Permanent Representatives' Committee.</P>
      <P>Ireland has welcomed the objective of the Commission's proposal which is to encourage the more rational use of energy.  However, a large majority of member states, while welcoming the objective, have expressed a general reservation on the proposal in its present form.  In particular, some consider that it is premature to introduce a legally binding instrument.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Irish Presidency of the European Union has made a considerable effort to progress this matter.  However, because of the extent of the opposition among member states to the draft Directive, it has not been possible so far to reach a consensus.  The Presidency is in consultation with the Commission in an attempt to establish how progress might be made.</P>

      <P>Licences awarded under the Exploration Licensing Round in the Rockall Trough will benefit from the attractive features applicable to frontier exploration licences, as set out in the 1992 Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development.  These include the conditions that there is no obligation to drill a well during the first phase of the licence, reasonable rentals will be payable by the licensees, there is no provision for production royalties or State participation and a licence will be of 16 years duration.  In addition the Finance Act, 1992, provides that a discovery made by the year 2013 under a licence in this round will qualify for a special rate of 25 per cent corporation profits tax.  I am satisfied that the <Col N="946" /> incentives in place are sufficiently attractive to encourage companies to apply for exploration licences under the round.</P>

The Commission is considering Ireland's application in conjunction with those of other member states and will decide before the end of the year on the level of funding being made available.

The applicant has largely complied with the necessary conditions but has not yet forwarded an up-to-date survey report.

      <P>There are two companies under the aegis of my Department to which the Deputy's question applies.  These are Arramara Teoranta and the Salmon Research Agency.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Arramara Teoranta</i>
      </P>
      <P>Arramara Teoranta is a commercial company in which the Minister for the Marine holds 50.65 per cent of the shares and appoints three of the five directors, including the chairman.  The remaining 49.35 per cent of the shares are held by the NutraSweet Kelco company which also appoints the remaining two directors.  The company employs 30 people directly, and in addition makes payments to seasonal harvesters of seaweed and searods.  The authorised share capital of the company is £450,000 of which only £77,000 has been allotted, called up and fully paid by both shareholders, and of which the Minister has provided £39,000.  The company does not receive an annual subvention from the Department, but it received grants in 1995 from Údarás na Gaeltachta amounting to £38,448 for capital and research and development purposes.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Salmon Research Agency</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Salmon Research Agency is a company limited by guarantee and not having any share capital.  The agency was established in 1955 by the Guinness company which made the investment in land, buildings and equipment.  Guinness has withdrawn from the operation of the agency, and it is now effectively a State agency.  The agency has the objective of conducting scientific and field research for the purpose of improving and developing salmon and sea-trout fisheries in Ireland, and employs 19 people to this end.  The State has not made any investment in the agency, but pays an annual subvention to maintain its operation.  In 1995 the subvention amounted to £226,000, including a payment of £66,000 to renew capital equipment, and in 1996 the subvention is £150,000.</P>

      <Col N="955" /> The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has a total complement of 50 full-time staff.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991 provides that where a Fisheries Development Society in whose region the holding of a share certificate has been deemed to be a compulsory requirement for trout and coarse fishing requests the assistance of the relevant regional fisheries board in enforcing that requirement, all officers of that board are required to engage in such enforcement.</P>
    <P>The holding of a share certificate is compulsory in the northern Shannon area but not in the southern Shannon area.  On foot of a request by the Northern Shannon Fisheries Development Society to the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board the enforcement of the compulsory share certificate requirement in the northern Shannon region is, therefore, a matter for the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board.  I have no function in relation to such enforcement and my Department does not, therefore, maintain the details requested by the Deputy, I will, however, ask the board to provide the Deputy with the information sought.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 335, 336 and 337 together.</P>
      <P>The Trout and Coarse Fisheries Development Societies were established under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991 to participate in the development of trout and coarse fisheries by raising funds through the issue of share certificates and making grants or payments available for appropriate development works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eight societies, with jurisdictional areas corresponding to those of the regional fisheries boards, but with two societies covering the Shannon region, were established under the 1991 Act.  In the period between the establishment of the societies and the first elections to the societies' management committees in December <Col N="956" /> 1992 each society was managed by trustees appointed by the Minister for the Marine.  In 1992 two of the societies, the northern and upper Shannon, opted, in accordance with the enabling legislation, to make the holding of a share certificate a compulsory requirement for fishing in their areas.  This requirement is enforced by the Shannon and Northern Regional Fisheries Boards, respectively.</P>
    <P>Membership of societies is open to those who hold a current annual share certificate.  The management committees comprise seven members of which five are elected by the members and not more than two appointed by the Minister.  Those who hold a current annual share certificate and who also held an annual certificate in any two other years since the previous election are eligible to vote in committee elections.  Ministerial appointments are made following consultation with the relevant society, the Central Fisheries Board, the relevant regional board, Bord Fáilte and other appropriate interests.  Casual vacancies which occur among the ministerial appointees are filled by the Minister, while any such vacancy among the elected members is filled by co-option from among candidates for the previous election.  The Minister also appoints the returning officer for the purposes of elections and fixes a time and a date for the receipt of nominators.  Both ministerial appointees and elected members normally serve for a period of five years while individuals appointed or co-opted to casual vacancies serve for the remainder of the period for which the person occasioning the vacancy would have served.  Committee members may be reimbursed in respect of vouched expenses incurred by them in relation to attendance at meetings.</P>
    <P>A list of the trustees appointed in 1991 and ministerial appointments in 1992 and subsequently, together with their representative category, follows for the Deputy's information.</P>
    <P>The conduct and management, in accordance with the law, of all the affairs and business of a society is a matter for its management committee. Each committee elects a chairman, appoints a secretary and operates according to the rules provided for under section 5 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991.  These rules contain detailed provisions governing, among other matters, elections, the functions of the management committee, meetings, finance and disbursement of funds, annual reports and accounts and the issue of share certificates.</P>
    <P>I have no function in relation to the day-to-day conduct and management of the affairs and business of societies.  The accounts of the societies are required to be audited in accordance with the Companies Acts.  Auditors are appointed by the management committees from a list of public auditors approved by the Minister for Tourism <Col N="957" /> and Trade.  In addition, under the Act, the societies are required to annually furnish to the Minister for the Marine their income and expenditure account, balance sheet, auditors report and annual report.  I am concerned about the functioning of the societies and especially their efficiency and effectiveness in pursuing their general objectives.  It is timely and appropriate, therefore, that their operations be reviewed and I am making arrangements to have such a review initiated.</P>

      <P>According to all available information officials of my Department have not attended angling trade shows, angling fairs or shows abroad in the period mentioned.  The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards have statutory responsibility for the promotion of angling and officers of the boards would, as part of their official duties, attend trade shows abroad from time to time.  I have no function in relation to such attendances, however, and my Department does not maintain details of attendance and associated costs.  I will ask the Central Fisheries Board to assist the Deputy with the information sought.</P>
