    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 7, motion concerning Private Members' Business; No. 8, motion concerning ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No. 17, Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill. 1996, Order for Report and, subject to the Order being made, Report and Final Stages; and No. 2, Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 7 and 8 shall be decided without debate.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 35, Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Landmines Bill, 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Against the background of ongoing industrial unrest in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and given the Minister's statement that there will be utter havoc in the Department, does the Government have any plans to introduce emergency legislation to ensure the administration of the animal disease eradication programmes and the maintenance of the disease free status of the national herd and to allow farmers to continue trading?  As I am sure the Taoiseach is aware, this has become a major problem for farmers and everyone involved in agri-business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that <Col N="3" /> legislation as such is at issue; the provision of resources and people willing and able to implement existing legislation is the question that needs to be dealt with.  This will be among the matters to be discussed at the meeting this afternoon with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> relating to industrial peace during the currency of the programme which, with the partnership approach generally, has brought significant benefits to everybody.  Everybody employed has benefited from the partnership approach, but it is important that this is based on commitments, on the Government's part, to meet certain pay obligations and, on the part of other parties, to ensure industrial peace and abstinence from industrial action during the term of the programme.</P>
      <P>These matters will be the subject of discussion between Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions this afternoon and are of relevance to all involved in social partnership.  Clearly, the immediate economic concerns in the agriculture sector are of particular importance bearing in mind the importance of revenue from the food sector to meet Government commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to the Taoiseach's reply to the Leader of the Opposition about the serious problem in the agriculture sector, will he indicate whether a meeting will take place today under the aegis of the CRC?  In view of the urgent need to resolve this problem, does he accept that a CRC meeting <Col N="4" /> should be held at which not only Congress interests but also those of farm organisations and employers would be heard by the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given what the Taoiseach said in reply to my question about the licensing of a casino, can I take it he has not ruled out the possibility of bringing forward legislation on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said legislation is not promised on that matter and there is not a proposal to introduce legislation.  The Deputy should not seek to add or subtract in respect of what I said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give <Col N="5" /> a commitment that the NESF report on long-term unemployment will be debated in the House?  Will he give a commitment that the resources necessary to deal with long-term unemployment, which were spoken about last year, will be provided?  There is provision for only a small amount in this year's Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision for raising matters appertaining to legislation but not the nature of or the submission of reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Tuesday week I raised with the Taoiseach, in the context of promised legislation, the question of decommissioning, and in reply he referred to the need for the legislation to include provision for forensic testing. I am sure he has had the opportunity to reconsider that reply since given that forensic testing would be totally contrary to the Mitchell Commission recommendations.  Will the Taoiseach guarantee that there will not be provision in the legislation for forensic tests on decommissioned weapons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say what the Deputy suggested; I said in regard to the question of forensic testing, whether or not it would occur, there are rights of defendants as well as rights of possible prosecutees to be considered.  I said given that constitutional rights are in question, any legislation would have to be consistent with the Constitution.  It was simply a reference to explain the complexity of the matter.  I did not give an indication of the content of the legislation and regret the Deputy, in his attempt to summarise what I said last week for the benefit of people who do not remember it, has, perhaps, inadvertently, misrepresented it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it should have been left unsaid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain the reason for the delay in bringing forward the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, which was long promised?  Will he accept that in view of yesterday's decision at the Council of Energy Ministers' meeting this Bill is of extreme urgency?  Will the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications make a statement to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the status of the Freedom of Information Bill?  Does the Taoiseach intend to issue an apology, as requested by the National Union <Col N="7" /> of Journalists, to a journalist whom he threatened and insulted during the course of an interview last Thursday night?  Surely that is not the conduct expected from a Taoiseach who promised accountability, transparency and openness?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the forthcoming Education Bill will the Taoiseach take urgent steps to ensure transparency in the Department of Education in terms of its deliberations in the preparation of that Bill?  A private seminar was held on 13 March in the Department and we only learned about it today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the recently published NESF report on long-term unemployment is somewhat critical of policies to date, does the Taoiseach intend to introduce legislation to effect the proposals on long-term unemployment put forward last January by me and my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, which would go some way towards tackling that problem?</P>

      <P>In view of the finding of the Scott report that in the United Kingdom and Ireland everything is secret unless it is revealed by public administration, will the Taoiseach say what is the status of the Freedom of Information Bill?  It was put before a committee of the House but seems to have vanished since then.  When will the Bill be brought before the House?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 31, after &ldquo;contract&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for services or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our challenge in framing this Bill is to create the conditions in which young people would have, on the one hand, the right to work, the right to earn money and the right to partake in an enterprise culture and, on the other, that they would not be exploited.  Our challenge is to find the correct balance between the rights of young people and their need for protection from exploitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In framing this amendment I have particular concern for a category of young people who are often used to do leaflet drops, courier work or to sell magazines on a door to door basis.  As the Bill is currently drafted I am not satisfied that such young people have the protection of the law and that is the reason I have framed this amendment. In so doing I have the backing of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which has expressed concerns similar to mine and which is of the opinion that this Bill <Col N="13" /> will not adequately protect young people engaged in the work I have described unless this amendment is accepted by the Minister.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and, by so doing, to work for the improvement of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quill's amendment would have far-reaching implications that would bring in various kinds of work not normally covered under employment law.  I am concerned about the points raised by Deputy Quill.  Much more work needs to be done in regard to how we define areas of <i>quasi</i> self-employment and to examine ways to extend employment protection law to such workers.  It would not be appropriate in this Bill to single out one particular area until that examination is complete.  I have asked my Department to examine in detail areas of atypical work, including sub-contract work, to see how we could extend employment law on a more general basis to such areas.  Without the degree of work that would need to be done in terms of refining what we are talking about, we could unintentionally include areas in this legislation that would be totally inappropriate.  If somebody is doing a couple of hours casual work, babysitting for example, which is not in the nature of an employment contract, they could be caught under the Bill.  That would not be our intention, given the discussions we have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met yesterday representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss our programme for the European Presidency.  Under the social Protocol, discussions are taking place between employers and workers at European level on the whole area of atypical work. Those discussions should take place in parallel with what we are doing here. This is a huge area and it is not appropriate to include it in this context.  I take on board the spirit of Deputy Quill's amendment and I have asked my <Col N="14" /> Department to review this area in a wider context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her response.  I share the concern of Deputy Quill and the Minister that there should not be any exploitation of young workers.  During our previous discussions on the Bill consensus was achieved on many points.  I am satisfied with the Minister's response to the effect that her Department will review this matter and discuss it with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others. We are all trying to achieve a balance and at various Stages of this Bill we emphasised that the Bill was too draconian; no doubt that will arise again today on other sections.  Our aim is to complement the protections the Minister is trying to put in place.</P>
      <P>There was not much general public discussion following our last debate on the Bill but I hope, following Report Stage, there will be a wider discussion and a greater awareness of the rights of young persons in the workplace.  There is a move towards part-time work but we, as legislators, cannot allow such a move to develop without putting adequate protections.  I will agree to any move the Minister puts forward &mdash; we have some proposals also &mdash; that will add to that protection.  In the light of the Minister's response and the fact that she will pursue the points made by my colleague, my party accepts her bona fides in this matter.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for her open attitude to the ideas I put forward in the context of this amendment.  I am grateful that she has taken on board the spirit and the principle of what I said and that she will return to this important area which must be regulated in law.  Employers are in a buyers' market and often young people are desperate for jobs.  In that climate young people can be grossly overworked, underpaid and exploited.  It is important to lay down in law terms that will give the protection I seek for young <Col N="15" /> people so that they can take up part-time, holiday or after school work etc., but that they will not be underpaid and overworked.  I am satisfied that the Minister is sincere about pursuing this matter.  I look forward to her introducing the broader provisions which she promised here today so that we can debate them further and put in place proper protections for our young workers.</P>

      <P>We come to amendment No. 2.  I note that amendments Nos. 14 and 21 are related and that amendments Nos. 3, 5, 22 and 23 are consequential on amendment No. 21.  I suggest that amendments Nos. 2, 3, 5, 14, 21, 22 and 23 be taken and debated together if that is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following: &ldquo;`work' shall not include the supervision of children in a domestic context;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I tabled this amendment, as I said on Committee Stage, is that I am not yet satisfied &mdash; in spite of what was said in previous debates &mdash; we have made it abundantly clear that the activities of babysitting are excluded from the terms of this Bill.  Unless we do that, we could have grave difficulties in future.  I ask the Minister to spell that our specifically in the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that babysitting activities are excluded from the Bill.  It was stated that this would be necessary given that section 4 provides that a person under 16 years of age is not allowed to work after 8 p.m.  In the main babysitting takes place after 8 p.m.  If that provision remains in the Bill then the activity of babysitting is not properly protected in law.  For that reason, I ask the Minister, as so much babysitting takes place after 8 p.m., to exclude specifically and categorically the activity of babysitting which <Col N="16" /> needs a flexibility in time and in terms of hours which is not evident to me or to anyone who has read the Bill and who has spoken on the Bill, in the context of the law as currently drafted.  I appeal to the Minister to take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we are dealing only with contract of service rather than contract for services, the ordinary babysitting which youngsters do for a next door neighbour, a relative and so on does not come under the Bill. If I were to accept this amendment it would mean that where, say, a 17 year old was employed as an <i>au pair</i> or in a crèche full-time in a private house he or she would not enjoy the protections of the Bill.  By distinguishing between our contract of service and our contract for services, a regular employee, minding children or otherwise, will be covered and will enjoy the protections of the Bill.  However, the Bill will not extend to the normal babysitting which is done under a contract for services, for example, babysitting for a next door neighbour.  Casual babysitting is excluded from the Bill.  People like Deputy Kitt who, I am sure, enjoys a night out after 8 p.m. can continue to have babysitters to look after his youngsters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that people working at a regular job which involves the care of children enjoy the protections of the Bill.  That is the reason I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  The point being made by the Deputy is already covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own amendments Nos. 3 and 5 are technical.  Amendment No. 21 is the substantive amendment.  I am advised by the draftsman that in relation to making regulations to exclude people who are employed in a family business or on a family farm, as suggested in Deputy Kitt's amendment No. 14, that I have to give myself this explicit power. <Col N="17" /> That is the reason a new section 9 is being inserted.  A close relative can be defined as a person who is employed by a close family member in a private house, or on a farm or in a family undertaking on non-industrial work.  Under the provisions of the Bill young people are excluded from industrial work. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 are consequential following the renumbering. The point raised by Deputy Kitt in amendment No. 14 is covered in amendment No. 21.  This will be done by way of regulation under which we will be able to exclude people working in a family business or on a family farm.  We can be assured that the regulations are in accordance with the provisions of the directive and that the health, safety and welfare of young people are protected so that there is no possibility of exploitation by a close family member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has responded positively to my amendment No. 14.  The question of workers in a family business was raised by members of my party when we discussed this Bill. I thank the Minister for tabling her amendment No. 21.  The Minister said that from the advice she has received, this is the best way to pursue this matter.  I accept the Minister's amendment because, as I said earlier, we do not want to tie up the parents or young people who are working in that type of environment in bureaucratic red tape and at the same time we want to provide protections for them.  As far as I am concerned this can be done by way of regulation while at the same time providing adequate protections under law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not table an amendment on the babysitting question which we discussed on Committee Stage.  I am satisfied with the Minister's response &mdash; Deputy Quill may think differently &mdash; that we can accommodate Deputy Quill's concern. Her amendment stated that &ldquo;work shall not include the supervision of children in a domestic context&rdquo;.  I think we can accommodate this within the Bill as it stands.  It is important that we clarify this matter.  My amendment refers to <Col N="18" /> work on family farms or in the agricultural enterprise sector.  We should not incorporate in legislation the relationships between parents and children who work in that type of environment.  The Minister of State has accommodated my party's concerns on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her openness in accepting the essence of Deputy Kitt's amendment.  It would be a gross over-regulation of normal family arrangements if we extended the law to incorporate young people who work on family farms.  I support the Minister of State's amendment.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 2, a distinction between contract for services and contract of services is legalistic and abstract.  However, I accept the Minister of State's good intentions and understanding of the matter.  My understanding is not so developed.  Will the Minister of State explain the difference between a young person doing <i>au pair</i> work for a specific number of hours per day and a young person baby-sitting for a defined number of hours in the evening?  While a formal contract may not be drawn up, many young people baby-sit on a contract basis.  It is understood that the baby-sitter will present herself or himself at a given place at a given time to work for a certain number of hours and that is similar to a formal contract.  However, I accept the Minister of State's assurance that baby-sitting will be excluded from the application and enforcement of this law.  I trust that will be the case and thank her for considering my amendment.</P>

    <P>I tabled this amendment to cover, in particular, young people who do paper runs.  Young people in Cork city deliver papers very early in the morning.  I get <i>The Examiner</i> at approximately 7 o'clock each morning.  Delivering papers is part of their livelihoods and may be a family tradition.  In many cases their parents and grandparents may have delivered papers.  If 8 o'clock is included as the time at which young people may start work, we will exclude those who do paper runs and, consequently, cut back on their incomes and family budgets.  Under an EU directive the earliest time a child can begin work is 6 a.m.  To accommodate those who do paper runs, why can we not bring our law into line with that EU directive?  Will the Minister accept my amendment to take account of a small number of people who provide a key service to the public and who depend on that service for their livelihoods?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>My paper is delivered after 9 o'clock in the morning but it is not <i>The Examiner.</i> While I accept Deputy Quill is trying to cover specific cases, I would be concerned about young people working in the early hours of the morning, whether on milk rounds or paper runs.  On the one hand, we are trying to protect children while, on the other, we want them to be able to help their parents on milk rounds and so on. I would like to hear the Minister of State's views on this.  I am inclined to agree with the wording of the Bill. While we get many good directives from Europe, we have our own culture and traditions, which include a later starting time for work than applies in many other EU countries and that is not necessarily wrong.  I would be concerned about aligning ourselves with Europe in terms of an early work start. I will make my judgment on the basis of the Minister of State's reply, but the <Col N="20" /> inclusion of the Deputy's amendment might open the floodgates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While the EU directive provides for a 6 a.m. start for 14 and 15 year-olds, article 16, which is reproduced on page 28 of the Bill, provides that implementation of the directive shall not constitute valid grounds for reducing the general level of protection afforded to such young people in our national legislation.  In a 1977 Act we ratified ILO convention No. 79/1946 which covers night work carried out by young people and provides for an 8 a.m. start for 14 and 15 year-olds.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kitt in that we do not have a tradition of starting work very early.  The provisions do not apply to family businesses or contract for services where people are employed on a casual basis.  An 8 a.m. start should be acceptable for children who are still attending school.  We are constrained by international obligations and there are good policy grounds for adhering to an 8 a.m. start.</P>

      <P>(a)  does not require to permit the young person to work for more than 8 hours in any day or 40 hours in any week.</P>

      <P>(i)  between 10 p.m. on any one day and 6 a.m. on the following day, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  between 11 p.m. on any one day (provided the day is not before a school day during a school term where such young person is attending school) and 7 a.m. on the following day, where the Minister is satisfied, following consultation with such representatives of employers and representatives of employees as the Minister considers appropriate, that there are exceptional circumstances affecting a particular branch of activity or a particular area of work as may be prescribed.</P>
      <P>(c)  ensures that the young person receives a minimum rest period of 12 consecutive hours in each period of 24 hours,</P>

    <P>(d)  ensures that the young person <Col N="22" /> receives in any period of 7 days a minimum rest period of 2 days which shall, as far as is practicable, be consecutive, and</P>
    <P>(e)  does not require or permit the young person to do for him or her any work for any period exceeding 4½ hours without a break of at least 30 consecutive minutes.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 is in substance the same as the proposal we adopted on Committee Stage.  Following our discussion on Second Stage and the debate on Committee Stage I moved to allow young people to work up to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights and during the school holidays on days when they did not have school the next day.  This is the maximum flexibility I was allowed under the terms of the directive and under our ILO obligations.  It goes a substantial way towards meeting the concerns expressed in relation to young people involved in weekend working in the catering and pub trades etc.  Before our Committee Stage debate I met the Vintners' Federation of Ireland who were satisfied with the proposed change. In essence what we are proposing is what we agreed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kitt and Quill have tabled amendments aimed at further extending what we are doing in this area.  I cannot agree to an 11 p.m. finishing time on every day of the week because we are dealing with young people of school age who are, generally speaking, in the school system.  We want to ensure that they are not so exhausted from working midweek that they cannot concentrate on their studies which are probably of the best long-term benefit in terms of their job chances and career prospects. Throughout the Bill we have recognised the value part-time work has for young people of school age.  This is being facilitated by extending working hours to 11 p.m. and opening up a range of employments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill referred specifically to tourism and the hotel, restaurant and café sector.  What I am doing is not confined to those sectors.  My amendments <Col N="23" /> are tied basically to whether or not there is school the next day, which may be a broader way of dealing with the matter.  The sectors mentioned by the Deputy are probably the main sectors involved, but if other sectors emerge that are not covered by the Deputy's amendments we could find ourselves tied down.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kitt and Quill are proposing in amendments Nos. 13 and 15 that young people be allowed to work up to 12 midnight at weekends and in certain other circumstances when supervised by an adult.  These exemptions would not be possible because of our obligations under the ILO Convention No. 79 and because of Article 16 of the directive which forbids us to reduce the level of protection already in force in the member states.  We all share the ideal of having enforceable legislation that will reconcile working life and study for young people.  I have taken legal advice in relation to these points.  I have pushed out the boat as far as legally possible. This Bill substantially meets the concerns in this area.  We are of one mind in regard to what we want to achieve, but I am not in a position to accept the amendments tabled by the two Opposition parties.</P>

      <P>We spent a considerable amount of time on Committee Stage discussing this non-contentious matter and in the end we achieved a good result.  The Minister's opening position was too draconian, but she has come a long way since we began our discussions.  Having young students in our own families, we were speaking from experience about the reality of young people helping to cover their maintenance costs as they try to study and have a social life.  Such work is a necessity, whether we like it or not.  At the start of our discussions the Minister's position was that students should not work after 10 p.m.  We debated the possibility of extending the working hours to 11 p.m. or 12 midnight.  We reached a consensus on 11 p.m. as the finishing time for that <Col N="24" /> type of worker provided it is not on a day before a school day where the young person is attending school.  That is the best approach because we are trying to ensure that young people will not be fatigued going into class.</P>
      <P>The Minister has met the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and other concerned groups.  I had consultations with the trade union movement, youth organisations and the Vintners' Federation to try to get the best possible balance, bearing in mind that our primary focus is to protect the young worker.  I got a very positive response from the Vintners' Federation.  The Minister has gone as far as she could, given that there is an EU directive with which we have to comply and that we have obligations under the ILO Convention.</P>
      <P>Although I would like to see an active committee system in this House, I have some criticisms of it.  There are too many committees and it is not possible to attend them all.  In this instance we had a particular issue to discuss and we achieved a good result.  I thank the Minister and her officials for this amendment which incorporates the views I expressed on Committee Stage. I am willing to withdraw my amendments on the basis of the amendment the Minister is putting forward.  She has finally got it right and there is nothing more she can do.  The Minister is endeavouring to protect young student workers, accepting that the vast majority must engage in some type of part-time work to subvent their third-level education.  In this respect the Minister and her Department have done a good day's work.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendments constitute a substantial improvement on the original provisions of the Bill.  For that reason I support them, withdraw mine and thank her and Deputy Kitt for the amount of time and thought put into them.  They have gone as far as possible to create conditions in which young people can engage in <Col N="25" /> holiday or weekend work, to which they have a right.  Indeed they have a financial need to engage in such work, which affords them an opportunity to subvent their third-level education, the purchase of books and so on, thus giving them a sense of independence and an opportunity to participate in what might be described as an entrepreneurial pursuit, the benefits of which are substantial and must be provided for in law to the maximum possible extent.</P>
      <P>My initial fears were that, if the working hours were too restrictive, young people would be unable to bid successfully for such work, that adults who would be more flexible and more prepared to engage in casual or part-time work would be given preference. However, I am now satisfied the Minister has gone as far as possible and done as well as she can by these young people, on which I compliment her and her officials, and withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="29" />&ldquo;(2)  A general exemption shall be available for employees in licensed and catering trades who are employed under the terms of a recognised apprenticeship agreement.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks general exemption for young people employed under the terms of a recognised apprenticeship agreement in the licensed or catering trade.  I tabled this amendment bearing in mind that there are many such young people who will have decided to pursue a career in the vintners and catering trades.  I was anxious to ensure that their working hours would not be interfered with in any way, which takes us back to the 11 o'clock provision already agreed in that, in law, it would be impractical that an employer should be obliged to terminate the employment of, say, a 16 or 17 year-old at 11 o'clock.  I am anxious that the law would not interfere with their right to learn the business. There is a fundamental difference between an apprentice and a student, which must be recognised in law, affording an apprentice barman greater flexibility in learning his trade in its totality.</P>
    <P>The Minister should endeavour to accomodate their needs in this Bill. While she indicated she was willing to investigate this matter by way of regulation, I am anxious to hear what she has to say and ascertain whether she can allow greater flexibility in the case of apprentices as opposed to students engaging in part-time work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tom Kitt raised a valid point, there is a need to draw a clear distinction between a student who engages in part-time work and an apprentice engaging in a very structured activity, based on some type of contractual obligation.  Perhaps the terms of an apprenticeship are covered in the legislation that sets out and defines the conditions for apprenticeship, but if it is not covered with sufficient clarity, it is important that the substance of Deputy Kitt's very thoughtful amendment would be taken on board.  Once upon a <Col N="30" /> time a young person served his time to the bar business and learned his trade from the ground up.  Nowadays apprenticeship is much more structured and there is a recognised course in regional technical colleges.  I am interested in the Minister's comments on the needs and rights of young apprentices as set out by Deputy Kitt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage it was my intention that we would deal with this by way of regulation to be made under section 8 rather than by way of a generalised exemption.  Under articles 8592 and 10(4) of the directive there is provision for derogations by way of exemptions where there are objective grounds for them and under section 8 we can allow any group or category of employers to employ young people on terms other than those laid down in section 6 by way of regulation where compliance with the terms of the section would be impractical because of the seasonal nature of the work or for other technical or organisational reasons.  I have wider powers under section 8 than tying it down to a sector.  For example, representations have been made in relation to racing apprenticeships where young people may deal with horses after a race night and work late.  That would come under &ldquo;the seasonal nature of the work or other technical or organisational reasons&rdquo;.  It is preferable to deal with the point raised by the Deputies by way of regulation, where we are able to specify that the terms of the regulation comply with the terms of the directive in relation to the health, safety and welfare of the employee.  We are able to put in conditions to ensure that those protections are there while relaxing some of the detailed provisions of the legislation.  That is a better way of doing it. I have given an undertaking already on Committee Stage to make regulations, for example, in relation to bar trade apprentices.  The provisions of section 8 allow me to make regulations for a group of employers where they have engaged in discussions with appropriate <Col N="31" /> representatives of employers and employees on the proposed changes. The protections in section 8 in relation to regulations are preferable to what Deputy Kitt suggests, but the end product will be the same in terms of offering flexibility to young people to pursue careers through an apprenticeship while at the same time being able to ensure that that flexibility is not being exploited by their employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for her support and the Minister for her response.  We have opened up an important debate on the question of careers for young people.  The Minister gave the example of an apprenticeship in the world of racing and the more we debate this issue the more we can find other examples of what I refer to.  In my amendment I refer to the licensed and catering trades but there is the wider services sector.  A young person may decide to pursue a career in one of the service areas, a growing area of employment opportunity.  As legislators we should not allow anything to stifle the opportunities these young people have in this sector.  The only way young people can find their way is through experience and they may find out that they are natural entrepreneurs.  I have made a distinction between the young student who decides to take on part time work to finance third level education and the young person serving his apprenticeship to the trade.  The trades are important and serving apprenticeships gives young people an opportunity to break though a barrier and find out what suits them.  There are many young people who have come through that system, whether in the catering or licensing business or in other important services areas who end up as entrepreneurs.  We are talking about giving young people an opportunity to pursue a career and to learn a trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 8, the Minister may introduce regulations that will account for the type of proposal I have put forward. In the light of that response, I am <Col N="32" /> willing to withdraw my amendment.  I thank Deputy Quill for her support.</P>

That will give the Oireachtas another chance to look at the regulations made for people working in a family business or serving an apprenticeship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 clarifies what happens if somebody working 45 hours a week under the old system now works a maximum of 40 hours a week under the terms of the directive and clarifies the situation on rates of pay.  We are talking about hourly rates applying in the new circumstances.  The effect of section 12 is to modify any provisions which require the employee to work in excess of the new statutory limit but otherwise leaves the contract agreement in order.  Accordingly, the rate of pay expressed in hourly and weekly terms &mdash; the normal working week which cannot <Col N="33" /> exceed 40 hours under existing legislation &mdash; remains the same.</P>

      <P>The directive on working time deals mainly with adult workers who would be limited to 48 hours per week averaged over a four months period.  The 1977 Act provides that the normal working week will not exceed 40 hours and the maximum one will not exceed 45 hours.  Under this Bill we are reducing the maximum working week and the concept of a normal working week no longer holds.  Consequential provisions are included concerning rates of pay and so on.  The Bill clarifies that a person earning £4 an hour who works 40 hours a week will receive £160 a week and will not be paid for the missing five hours.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair, Deputies Kitt and Quill, Deputy Keogh who stood in for Deputy Quill on Committee Stage and Deputy Bell who chaired that Stage.  We had a constructive debate on Second, Committee and Report Stages.  It demonstrated the strength of our parliamentary democracy in that all sides have discussed the Bill with a great absence of heat, a great injection of additional matter and have improved it through constructive discussion and debate.</P>
      <P>This legislation will extend the protections offered to young people.  It puts their schooling first while acknowledging the important role work can play during their school years.  It brings our law into line with modern European practice and meets our international obligations under the EU directive and the ILO Conventions.  I hope the legislation will enhance young people's status in their working environments and ensure their protection against exploitation.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill we have built in new protections and raised the minimum working age in terms of regular work in line with the proposed raising of the school leaving age to 16.  We have ensured that young people under the age of 16 who work during the summer holidays will be entitled to three weeks' holidays.</P>
      <P>I thank my colleagues opposite for their thoughtful and constructive contributions.  The constructive debate on this Bill illustrates the strength of the committee and parliamentary systems, that we do not always play politics in this House and that we can, together, produce a Bill that represents a consensus across the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and her officials for a constructive response to the proposal we put forward in the early stages of this debate.  There has been a gentlemanly debate on this Bill across party lines and we discussed matters in detail.  There may be other occasions in this Chamber when we hurl insults at each other, but on this matter there was a common interest in protecting young persons at work.  This matter is covered under the Protection of Young Persons Employment Act, 1977, but many of its provisions have not been enforced.  This Bill brings home to us that we are part of the greater European Union and that there is an EU directive covering the protection of young people at work.  In passing it we will fulfil our duties in implementing that directive and, in doing so, we are dealing with the Irish context.</P>
      <P>During the earlier discussion about young people who might do a paper round at 6 a.m., we discussed our culture of work starting time.  Through discussions we have managed to produce a Bill which is as well balanced as any that has been passed.  We strive to achieve balance in legislation in this House.  In this case the Minister listened to the views of the Deputies opposite and consulted youth organisations representing students, the trade union movement and the licensed and catering businesses. The end result is good legislation.  I thank the Minister for her co-operation and I look forward to the implementation of this Bill.</P>

The overriding concern expressed by every Member was that young people should give their prior commitment to pursuing their formal education for as long as they wished to do so.  We were conscious that we should not put into law anything that would interfere with that.  Having proceeded in that spirit, we have put in place provisions that will enable young people to take on part-time and holiday work with the maximum protection of the law.  This is a key measure that advances better prospects for young people and their well-being.</P>
    <P>I regret that most young people will not be aware of the work undertaken on this Bill in this House during the past number of weeks.  Many of them are apathetic about politics and increasingly many of them do not vote in elections. Irrespective of what shortfalls may exist, they are not aware that people have devoted hours of their time and thought to putting in place legislation to advance and promote their well-being.  That is our duty and if we were to do less we would not do ourselves justice.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for being open to the number of amendments I put forward and her help in steering a good passage for this law through the House.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the indicative time-frame he envisages for all-party negotiations as outlined in his speech in Finglas in Dublin on 30 April 1996.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Government believes the principles and procedures set out in the ground rules paper offer the necessary reassurance to all parties that the talks commencing on 10 June will be both meaningful and substantive.  I suggested in my speech at Finglas that agreement on an indicative time frame could perhaps give an added focus and dynamic to the talks.</P>
      <P>The British legislation provides, as a matter of prudence, for negotiations over a period of up to one year with the option of a second year.  As I indicated in Finglas, however, there may be value in aiming for a more concentrated time-frame than that.  I added that it would be most important that such a time-frame would not place undue pressure on any of the participants.</P>
      <P>I would encourage all the participants to consider my suggestion carefully in the interests of advancing the all-party talks towards their ultimate objective &mdash; a political agreement to underpin lasting peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his helpful reply.  There is a view that it would be very difficult to sustain intensive all-party talks for a year, a year and a half or two years and that it might be more useful to have a shorter period.  As I and the Taoiseach stated <Col N="39" /> the Unionists referred to this in one of the discussion documents they published last year.</P>
      <P>On the broader question, does the Taoiseach agree that not any constitutional Nationalist party North or South has advocated the inclusion in all-party talks of parties associated with organisations engaged in violence?  Will he further agree that all parties in this House continue to be committed to the terms of the Downing Street Declaration, that there is not a basis for the suggestion that democratic opposition to violence or threats of violence is weakening in this House or elsewhere and that organisations actively involved in bombing in recent months or making bomb threats will preclude from the political process political parties associated with them who hope to be involved in the all-party talks on 10 June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to all the Deputy's questions is yes.  I am not aware of any suggestion by any party in the House that those currently engaged in violence or threatening violence should be represented at the talks. There is a common commitment to the Downing Street Declaration by the parties here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the all-party consensus re-emerged after his Finglas speech, why did the Taoiseach feel it necessary to deliver the speech he made last Thursday?  Does he accept that speech was unhelpful and insensitive at this time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that there be honest and open discussion of the assumptions which underlie policy positions adopted.  The cause of peace is not served by failing to identify honest disagreement where it exists. I would have thought this was a view with which the Deputy agreed given her concerns about the necessity for open debate in many other areas of national life.  What I said was correct and the points I made about the necessity for <Col N="40" /> balance and the dangers of a lack of balance in statements about this matter were reasonable and necessary for me to say in the context of remarks made earlier.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply to my earlier questions but will he agree that organisations involved in bombing, making bombs or making bomb threats will preclude from the talks political parties with which they are associated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference between making threats and the reality because they have the same political purpose and intimidatory nature.  It is very important that there should be neither violence nor the threat of violence.  This applies on all sides; it applies to the concerns expressed frequently about stocks of weapons which can be seen by some people as threatening.  It is important to understand that what we hope to achieve is not just an absence of violence but also the removal of the threat of violence whether implicit or explicit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Tuesday night's speech pointed the way forward and looked at the bigger picture but Thursday night's speech did not fit in with it.  Given the widespread concern that the loyalist ceasefire may be about to end, has the Taoiseach made any arrangements to meet with the PUP and UDP or does he intend to meet them?  Does he believe that such a meeting could reassure those parties with a view to ensuring that the ceasefire is not broken?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read what I said in Mullingar and consider whether she disagrees with it.  If she agrees with it perhaps she could explain on what principle she believes such statements should not be made.  If she examines what I said she will find that it represents a point of view in regard to pluralism with which she has agreed on many occasions.  I am, therefore, surprised that the Deputy, who is <Col N="41" /> frequently an advocate of openness, transparency, answers, clear statements and debate about other matters, would not wish people to be equally clear about the assumptions on which they are working&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will not advance the cause of peace by failing to discuss honestly and in a respectful fashion such differences as we may have.

      <P>The issues of legislation and decommissioning are important in the context of clarity and the removal of the threat of violence during the talks.  When I raised the matter last Tuesday the Taoiseach said for decommissioning to take place certain changes in legislation would need to be made in both jurisdictions in regard to, for example, carrying out forensic tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that this is in direct contradiction to the Mitchell report which states that decommissioning should be exempt by law from forensic examination and that information obtained as a result of the <Col N="42" /> decommissioning process should be inadmissible as evidence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to forensic evidence being used in a defence but it would still be forensic evidence.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has misread my statement.  I said that certain changes in law would need to be made with regard to carrying out forensic tests.  At present there is no barrier to carrying out forensic tests on decommissioned weapons.  There is no plan to make provision for carrying out forensic tests on decommissioned weapons.  For that assurance to be given changes in legislation are necessary.</P>
      <P>I also made the point that, given our written Constitution, there is the possibility that some people might claim their potential defence could be disadvantaged by the absence of such tests.  It would be necessary in making changes to the law to take account of such claimed legal difficulties for potential defendants.  Given that we have a written Constitution, we must be careful when framing legislation to do nothing to prejudice the right of any defendant to a defence in any situation, however rare or theoretical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex issue and I can quote what the Taoiseach said last Tuesday.  He made the point that the issues are complex, particularly with regard to people who might wish to use &ldquo;evidence based on particular weapons&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give <Col N="43" /> an assurance there will be no forensic tests on decommissioned weapons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans in the legislation we are preparing for the carrying out of forensic tests on decommissioned weapons.  So that the legislation will be consonant with the Constitution, it is necessary in framing it to take account of a number of legal complications which might arise.  For example, potential defendants might claim they are disadvantaged by the absence of a provision for forensic tests and might claim, in order to establish a margin of doubt, that if such a test had been possible they might have gained an advantage in proving their innocence.</P>
      <P>There are those who may believe that legislation on this issue is a simple matter.  However, given that we have a written Constitution, there are certain problems which need to be taken into account in drafting the legislation.  That said, there are no plans to provide for forensic testing of decommissioned weapons.</P>

      <P>With regard to the indicative timeframe for all-party talks, Mr. David Ervine of the PUP commented that decommissioning was not and should not be on the agenda for any talks between the Taoiseach or the Government and the PUP or UDP.  Will the Taoiseach suggest forcefully to those parties that the Mitchell principles on decommissioning should be adhered to by them?  Will the Taoiseach comment on the view that there would be a hardening of positions in the run-up to the elections preceding all-party talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first question I would refer the Deputy to the Joint Communiqué agreed with the British Prime Minister which stated in regard to the opening of talks on 10 June that all participants would need to make clear at the beginning of the discussions their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report <Col N="44" /> of the international body, that is the Mitchell report.  They would also need to address at that stage its proposals on decommissioning.  Confidence building would also require that the parties have a reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's second question, I cannot say whether there is a hardening of positions for electoral purposes.  As we move into an electoral phase there will be a tendency for people to paint their positions in bolder colours than might otherwise be the case.  However, I do not believe any party should change its basic principles because an election is taking place and I am sure that is not the case with regard to any of the parties contesting the elections in Northern Ireland.  The overwhelming majority of people on both sides of the traditional divide in Northern Ireland want a settlement.  They want their politicians to seek a settlement and will be impatient with them if they do not seek and obtain one.  They want peace to be underpinned by such a settlement.  People should stress the fundamental requirement of a peaceful settlement in their comments.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach see merit in Archbishop Eames's suggestion for an independent body to examine the re-routing of parades to avoid the sectarian tensions and difficulties that arise with a small number of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to demonstrations of traditional loyalties it is important that people should have respect for those who do not necessarily share those loyalties.  Parades should be conducted with respect for those with a different point of view.  Archbishop Eames has made valuable calming contributions to public debate on many occasions.  I hope his contributions on this matter will continue to be as helpful as in the past.</P>

      <P>On the question of the indicative timetable there seems to be some agreement among the parties in the North that a shorter timetable would be useful.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there is merit in electing a US chairman, with President Clinton's confidence, to take charge of the talks, whose remit would include securing agreement between the parties during the next six to nine months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mitchell and the other members of the international body made a truly remarkable contribution to the peace process.  The clarity and simplicity of their report was very helpful to both Governments in finding a basis upon which a fixed date for all-party talks could be agreed.  We would be most anxious to avail, in the appropriate way, of the contributions that members of the body can make in the future.  However, it is best to submit this matter for discussion rather than taking unilateral decisions at this juncture.</P>

      <P>In the unlikely event that representatives of Sinn Féin are present at the talks on 10 June and as the Entry Into Negotiations Bill allows for an extension until May 1998, will Sinn Féin be permitted to take part in the negotiations during that period should the IRA call a ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Deputy's question is legitimate but it is important not to think in such terms.  We must work ceaselessly and energetically to ensure that all relevant parties are present from 10 June.  All that is required for this to happen is that the IRA reinstitute the cessation of violence which existed from August 1994. That cessation was introduced without agreement on a fixed date for all-party talks which is now in place.  If a cessation of violence was justifiable and reasonable in August 1994, it is doubly justifiable and reasonable that one now be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obstacles such as the precondition of <Col N="46" /> a gesture on decommissioning were preventing agreement on a date for the talks and have been removed.  If the maintenance of a cessation of violence was justifiable while those obstacles remained in place, it is doubly justifiable following their removal and the agreement for the commencement of all-party talks on 10 June.  This is an historic opportunity, and, while the Deputy's question is reasonable, well framed and astute, it is better that we do not enter into speculation about an event which it is hoped will not eventuate.</P>

      <P>I put questions to the Taoiseach and his colleagues in Government with the purpose of obtaining information on the implementation of reports of task forces in which Departments are engaged.  From the range of replies I have received, I have experienced great difficulty in discovering the task forces put in place by various Ministers.  Some of those replies indicated that the Department of the Taoiseach should perhaps have a co-ordinating role.  The reply I have received to this question seems to indicate that it does not have such a role.</P>

      <P>There is no uniform practice in relation to task forces. Where it is plainly required, a Department with lead responsibility will co-ordinate the project and other Departments will hold subsidiary responsibilities.  All interdepartmental groups or task forces that are established are co-ordinated by the Department with lead responsibility.  If it arises that two or three Departments hold equal responsibility in the matter, it is likely that the co-ordinating function will be provided by my Department or the Department of Finance.  This depends very much on the subject involved.  There cannot be a rigid rule because subjects and prescriptions vary.</P>

      <P>On 2 May 1996, the Government announced details of <i>Delivering Better Government &mdash; a Programme of Change for the Irish Civil Service.</i> This programme, which was developed by the co-ordinating group of secretaries established under the strategic management initiative, was fully endorsed by the Government and sets the strategic direction for the Irish Civil <Col N="48" /> Service in the coming years.  The programme was drawn up following consultations throughout the Civil Service by the co-ordinating group at senior management level and took into account submissions received from the trade unions and from the private sector.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday 1 May, senior officials met representatives of the public services committee of ICTU, the Civil Service General Council and the Association of Assistant Secretaries to outline the contents of the programme and the approach to implementation.  The Civil Service trade unions and associations are represented at these fora and a full discussion of the programme and its implementation took place.  On Thursday morning, staff from all Civil Service Departments and offices were briefed on the programme.  The official launch in Dublin Castle was attended by representatives from the civil and public service trade unions.</P>
      <P>A key element in the overall implementation of the recommendations of the report is the participation of staff at all levels and, in particular, the input of front line staff in the development of the individual initiatives which make up the programme for change.

      <P>There is a distinction to be drawn between matters for which officials are responsible in terms of executive responsibility for carrying out policy on which it is reasonable for them to give interviews, and advice they may proffer to Ministers on matters for which Ministers are responsible in terms of decision-making.  That matter of advice is not a matter upon which I would expect interviews to be given because, clearly, that is the province of Ministers.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for reminding me of the resources that are available.  The report launched last week sets out in detail for the first time, a statement of the respective responsibilities of Ministers, secretaries, programme managers and various other officers which will be incorporated in the legislation.  It will be possible for an official who has a doubt as to whether he or she can answer a particular question to seek guidance in statutory form. Such statutory provisions do not yet exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1924 Act Ministers are responsible for everything.  Given the size of our public service now, this is at variance with reality, but that is the law. Clearly, legal change is necessary to underpin the devolution of responsibility that will occur under the strategic <Col N="50" /> management initiative.  I will revert to the Deputy with my best estimate as to when the legislation will be ready for presentation to the House.</P>

      <P>On interviews by departmental secretaries, is permission sought from the Minister concerned, or the Taoiseach in the case of his secretary, or can the public servant make the decision?

      <P>As I have already indicated there are not specific statutory rules governing this matter.  As Ministers are responsible for everything, from a legalistic point of view, their consent is necessary for everything.  It may well be the case that the relationship between Ministers and secretaries is so good, as it is in this Government, that Ministers and secretaries will not feel it necessary to seek specific permission before answering a question.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the briefing for which I offer my apologies.  The 1924 Act with all its faults has lasted for more than 70 years for very good reasons.  Other jurisdictions have tried to move away from what, obviously, is a conservative Act. When Ministers were responsible and answerable, people did not feel compelled to withhold facts and left Ministers to answer.  In jurisdictions with a different set-up, where somebody else might be answerable without the protection afforded to Deputies in the House in going public, they have found that the facts do not always find their way into the public domain.  Instead of opening <Col N="51" /> up the situation a move from the 1924 Act may have the opposite effect.  That is what has happened in similar cases in a number of jurisdictions.  I urge that the matter be handled with great caution.</P>
      <P>While much good work was done during the past ten years in opening up public offices, there is a difficulty regarding the interpretation of the directive of successive Governments that public servants should give their names when dealing with members of the public.  Will the Taoiseach ask those involved to resolve this difficulty?  While some Departments and State bodies do this as a matter of course, others refuse. Members of the public are entitled to deal with a named person rather than a section.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there is a need for more flexibility in redeploying public servants?  Many of the problems encountered in introducing reforms in the system stem from the lack of flexibility in redeploying staff resources. Unfortunately, there are continual incremental additions to the system which have bedevilled us with costs we cannot afford.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the Deputy's views are reasonable.  As the House is undoubtedly aware, I have offered to consult the Opposition parties on a quarterly basis on the progress of the strategic management initiative.  They will be given information on a regular basis on the way in which the Act might be amended.  Inputs of the kind the Deputy has made can be made in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that the names of officials should be given in all Departments.  I am sorry to learn that is not the case.  I also agree with him that redeployment is important.  One of the advantages of the TLAC system introduced by John Boland is that it provides for redeployment and lateral movement between different Departments in the Civil Service.  The strategic management initiative on a service wide basis <Col N="52" /> would not have been possible without this system which has been in operation for the past ten years.  By allowing people to seek promotion to other Departments it has created a service wide ethos which makes common strategic management initiatives of this kind across the service possible.  This might not have been possible in the past when people thought in exclusively departmental terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The heritage services of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht provide an information and education service to the general public, including young people and students, on all aspects of the national heritage.  An education officer is attached to the heritage services with specific responsibility in this area.  The service provided includes catering for school groups on education tours at visitor centres, publication of education packs, visits to schools by wildlife rangers and other heritage services staff and an annual schools' newsletter <i>Heritage Highlights.</i> A major environmental education conference is planned this year at Kilmainham for transition year teachers with the aim of encouraging good practice in the teaching of environmental education in transition year.  An in-service training course for primary school teachers is also held each year at Wexford wildfowl reserve.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Heritage Act, 1995, a function of the independent statutory Heritage Council, which the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht appointed last year, is to promote interest, education, knowledge and pride in and to facilitate the appreciation and enjoyment of the national heritage.  In carrying out this function, the council is required to co-operate with public authorities, educational bodies and other organisations and persons.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated in this House on Committee State of the Heritage Bill, when accepting an amendment proposed by Deputy Quill to provide that the functions of the Heritage Council would include promotion of heritage education, he believes that the Heritage Council can play a valuable role in promoting heritage education, especially among young people.</P>

I welcome the fact that an environmental education conference will be held later in the year. Will the Minister agree that knowledge of fundamental and major historic events and influences are the only way of acquiring an interest in and knowledge of our heritage.  Our understanding of the development of art and literature must be seen in the context of historic periods in which they were conceived.  Will the Minister agree that the removal of history from the core curriculum will create a void and that such action would be absurd if we are to promote an appreciation and enjoyment of our national heritage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures in the Finance Bill, 1996, which provide for the continuation of a revised section 35 <Col N="56" /> investment incentive scheme for a further three years until 1999, ensure the necessary level of support to the Irish film industry to secure the continued growth and consolidation of the industry.  These measures also provide a substantial level of support to attract major film makers, with the possibility to raise as much as £8.25 million in section 35 funding for productions in the off-peak period October to January inclusive.  The changes in the section 35 scheme were not arbitrary, but were introduced on the basis of an independent economic evaluation of section 35 carried out by the economic consultants INDECON.  The INDECON report is in the public domain.</P>
    <P>As for the position of the indigenous film industry raised by the Deputies, I am pleased that one of the major successful achievements of the Government's package to date has been the steadily increasing number and quality of projects emanating from the indigenous sector.</P>
    <P>Sixteen indigenous productions have either recently been released or are due to be released in the next 12 months. Several indigenous films have won international awards including &ldquo;Korea&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ailsa&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Hanging Gale&rdquo;, &ldquo;35 Aside&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nothing Personal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Joe My Friend&rdquo;.  All of the above films have availed of section 35 investments.  They have also secured international sales including a number of very substantial proceeds from the US from the likes of Miramare, Fine Line, Overseas Group and Castle Rock.  This underlines the fact that home-based producers are competing in the marketplace at the highest level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Those of us present for Report Stage of the Finance Bill will remember the Minister for Finance saying that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is in favour of the changes to section 35, which will undermine that measure.  Is there any truth in the recent newspaper reports that that Minister had to travel to America to <Col N="57" /> allay the fears, particularly of those in the film industry, about section 35 and assure them that it still applies to them? Does the Minister believe that because of the framing of section 35 the film industry is an investor-driven industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>During Committee Stage of the Bill dealing with this matter there was a long debate on section 35.  Part of the reason for the examination by INDECON was to find out what could be done in the future.  The Ministers for Finance and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht are anxious to avoid a repeat of the experience whereby the industry experienced almost total collapse because of over-massaging of tax incentives.  The record of the industry is very good, the most impressive aspect being the uptake of indigenous industry and the increase in employment &mdash; the Minister deserves great credit for the increase in numbers by almost 500 per cent, from 438 to 2,000 in two years. There is particular emphasis on youth employment, with many young people becoming involved in the industry.  I have a strong belief in the future of the industry.  The steps taken to date are minor and the changes are directed towards encouraging indigenous industry.  This matter was fully debated and accepted by all parties on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the co-producer of the award winning film &ldquo;Sense and Sensibility&rdquo; stated at a seminar in Dublin last week that he would have liked to have used Ireland as the location but he did not do so because it would have doubled the cost of the film?  Will the Minister agree that the current cost of film making in Ireland is driving potential investment out of the country?  Has the Minister's Department undertaken any critical examination of that statement and, if so, what new measures do he and his Department propose to address this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is <Col N="58" /> referring to the article by Michael Foley in <i>The Irish Times</i> this week in which there was a reference to Mr. Laurie Borg, one of the producers of &ldquo;Sense and Sensibility&rdquo;.  Mr. Borg did not make any application to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, nor did he show any interest in doing so.  I am a little confused in regard to the Deputy's claim.  Does she think that the costs are over-the-top?  I believe Ireland is well able to compete with Britain or the United States in this regard.  We have the added bonus of the tax incentive which amounts to approximately 10 per cent of the cost.  The Irish taxpayer is providing a hefty cushion to any producer who wants to make a major film in this country.  I would have preferred the Deputy to acknowledge the announcement made yesterday in the United States by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, that Pierce Brosnan and others will make a major film in Ireland this year. I would have thought congratulations were in order to the Minister on making such a successful trip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to help the Deputy but I do not have that information.  I have answered fairly the question put down.  On the figure of 10 per cent, the existing 80 per cent tax relief is calculated to give a 10 per cent reduction.  In fact, the actual figure is 9 per cent.  Most of the people who spoke at the conference to which Deputy Quill and Deputy de Valera referred were strong in their praise of the major advances in film production in Ireland. It is unfortunate that the three people quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> article were critical but they had a different agenda. Other people spoke at that conference who praised the industry here and they are confident it will continue to thrive. There is certainty in the new measure because, as I stated in my reply, the tax relief system will operate for a further three years to 1999 which will be of assistance to investors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that as an Opposition spokesperson it is not my function to either flatter or engage in fantasy?  I asked a clear question.  Will he accept that the co-producer of &ldquo;Sense and Sensibility&rdquo; is a major opinion former on the international stage?  I do not give credence or otherwise to the substance of his statement but I want to know if the Minister's Department is prepared to critically examine his statement with a view to identifying the factors that inhibit the growth of the film industry in Ireland. That person and a number of other key producers highlighted the absence of a basic film infrastructure in Ireland and other matters of that nature.  It is important that the Minister takes my question seriously and commits his Department to examining critically the <Col N="60" /> statements made at that seminar and reply in a serious fashion to the concerns expressed in my question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not treat the Deputy in a trivial manner.  She asked me a serious question and I made a serious effort to answer it.  I did not detail at length the costs of film making in this country but I pointed out that the costs in both the UK and the United States are greater than those in Ireland. In the film industry here it has been known for the union groups to make deals and if Mr. Borg had investigated more fully the position in Ireland I am certain he could have made arrangements for the production of &ldquo;Sense and Sensibility&rdquo; but, to my knowledge, he did not make any query in that regard.  I respect Mr. Borg's position as a leading producer but he should consult people like Morgan O'Sullivan and World 2000 who might be able to advise him in this regard because they seem to have confidence in the structure being provided.</P>

If there is substance to them, certain corrective measures will have to be taken; if there is not any substance to them, they must be formally denied.  Brushing them aside in an offhand manner will not serve the future of the film industry and employment in that industry, in any serious fashion.  I appeal to the Minister <Col N="61" /> to respond formally to the points made at the seminar by the producers to whom I referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <P>I have given a full reply to Deputy Quill.  The matter of an individual giving his opinion that one producer is dominating costs or being adversely critical of the entire film industry should be taken up and I will ask the Department to examine that matter.  I certainly do not agree with his view.  Some of the producers and promoters have their own agendas.  I firmly believe there is a rare opportunity for people to invest in the film industry, particularly in the indigenous film industry.  The terms are very generous.  I hope Deputy de Valera is not saying they are too generous. People should take advantage of it now.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht</askee>
      <Quest>the consultations, if any, he has had with the Department of the Environment concerning the publication of the review by Irish and international consultants on the experience of the public arts schemes in Ireland including the Department's 1 per cent for art scheme.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9221/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>To date my Department has had no function in the operation of a &ldquo;1 per cent&rdquo; for art scheme, which has been operated through the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Arising from consultations with the Minister for the Environment in relation to the 1 per cent arts scheme, a public art research project was initiated in December 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A steering committee to oversee, monitor and advance the project was established under the chair of the <Col N="62" /> Department of the Environment, comprising a representative from my own Department in addition to representation from An Chomhairle Ealaíon, Temple Bar Properties and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The steering committee appointed consultants to carry out research and prepare a report to advise the committee on the approach that should be taken in the development of a more effective strategy in the promotion of art in the public sector for use by public authorities in commissioning art.  The consultants' report was submitted to the committee recently.  The steering committee has now considered the findings of this research and has finalised its own report, which will be submitted very shortly.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the final report from the steering committee, a decision will be taken as to the next stage for the development of a more effective strategy in public art.  Arrangements for publication can be considered at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The report to which I referred in the question was promised to be completed by the end of 1995.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the 1 per cent for art scheme should be encouraged.  He will also agree that such schemes need to be looked at from time to time to ensure they are more effective.  Will the Minister agree that such projects should be undertaken in consultation with the community and that there should be more local involvement regarding commissions under public art schemes?  I am sure the Minister will agree that more emphasis on involving local people would give them a greater opportunity for further participation and input in the art which will surround them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy in regard to more local involvement.  The application for the 1 per cent scheme for public art has produced some fine exhibitions, one of which is in <Col N="63" /> Bunratty in County Clare.  Other projects have been very successful.  If we were to fight about which end of the dual carriageway the particular arts object should be located, Bunratty or Lansdowne Bridge, I am sure there would be a difference between Joe Gorman in Cratloe and Sonny Scanlan in Ballycasey.  There is a need to involve the local authority.  If the occasion arises the local authority should ask for local comments, a recommendation which I believe will be included in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his positive reply.  In regard to county art plans, there would be a desire for further involvement.  Under the arts plan we have been discussing the need for more accessibility, community involvement and equity.  I am pleased to note the Minister is prepared to push for further involvement in regard to community art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree it would be a good idea if the report in question was debated in the House?  Will he accept that the 1 per cent for art scheme is administered by local authorities up and down the country?  Most Deputies who are also members of local authorities have direct experience of how the scheme has been working in practice for the past four or five years.  If the report was debated in the House, Members could bring to that debate their own experience as to how the scheme, which is so beneficial to Irish artists at local level, is working in practice and how it could be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the report comes to hand the question of a debate in the House will be considered.  I hope the report, which can make a valuable contribution, will be debated in the House. That is not to be critical of some of the work undertaken by the Department of the Environment.  In recent times exceptional work has been done on the Mal-low-Cork road.  The local deer and milk churns etc., certainly highlight local <Col N="64" /> heritage and this is making a valuable contribution.  I will convey the Deputy's sentiments to the Minister.</P>

Anuas ar sin bíonn an tUdarás ag plé leo maidir le forbairt pobail, turasóireacht, aerstráicí, seirbhísí, scéimeanna de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh, scéimeanna de chuid FÁS agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>Ar mhaithe le dúbailt a sheachaint agus ar mhaithe le dea-riarachán is fearr cúram na gcomharchumann Gaeltachta a bheith ar eagraíocht amháin agus, ag cur cúinsí uile an cháis san áireamh, is ar an Údarás amháin is fearr an cúram a bheith seachas ar mo Roinnse.  Bhí plé faoi seo idir ionadaithe ó mo Roinnse agus bainistíocht an Údaráis.</P>
      <P>Tuigim nach bhfuil bainisteoirí comharchumann áirithe sásta lena bhfuil ar intinn agus tá cruinniú iarrtha acu leis an Roinn chun an cheist a phlé.  Tá dáta le haghaidh cruinnithe á shocrú.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Aire cén chomhairle a glacadh leis na comharchumainn nuair a bhí an cinneadh seo é dhéanamh?  Cén uair ar cuireadh in iúil do na comharchumainn go raibh an cinneadh seo déanta agus an bhfuil sé i gceist aige cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt don Údarás le go mbeidh siad in ann na deontaisí reachtála a bhí á n-íoc ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta go dtí seo a íoc leis an comharchumainn?</P>

An nglacfadh an tAire leis gurb é an léamh atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta ar an gceist seo ná go bhfuil deireadh curtha leis an deontas do na doirse agus do na fuinneoga?  Tá deireadh curtha le deontas na mbóithre áise agus tá an Roinn ag fáil réidh leis na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta agus tá gach cosúlacht ar an scéal gurb éard atá ar bun gur gearr nach mbeidh fágtha againn ach Roinn Ealaíon agus Cultúir agus nach mbeidh an Ghaeltacht ann ar chor ar bith.

Dá bharr sin, beidh siad ag obair ar bhealach níos éifeachtaí.

Táim sásta go bhfuil cinneadh maith déanta ag an Aire agus má bhíonn deacrachtaí ag na comharchumainn i ndiaidh na gcumhachtaí sin a thabhairt don Údarás is féidir leo dul go dtí an Roinn agus gearán a dhéanamh.

    <P>In the interest of openness, accountability and transparency, why were the Gaeltacht co-operatives not consulted about this proposed decision?  When the decision was made why did they have to hear about it on the grapevine?  Why were they not officially informed by the Department that the decision had been taken?  This is fundamental to the Gaeltacht co-operatives and they find it difficult to understand the reasons for the decision because the scheme of help to the Gaeltacht co-operatives run by the <Col N="68" /> Minister of State's Department worked well.  They believe it is part of the shedding by the Department of its responsibility in regard to the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <Col N="69" /> The allocation of funds to meet the Waterways Service share of the feasibility study, which it is proposed will be commissioned jointly by the Waterways Service and their counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Watercourse Management division of the Department of Agriculture, is still being actively pursued.

There is substantial funding at present.  It is time a decision was made on this matter.  A number of studies have been carried out, one of which was carried out two years ago.

    <Title>Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill which aims to modernise planning and management systems in health boards.  It sets down in legislation new planning, management and accountability provisions which will change the way health boards conduct their business.  It presents a challenge to everyone involved in the health sector to work within a planning framework which is linked to specific resources and clear objectives.  It brings accountability much more to the fore both in planning and reporting terms.  In short, the Health (Amendment) Bill is at the centre of the process to require health boards to carry out their tasks in a context which emphasises planning, strategic management and accountability.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the individual elements of the Bill, it might be useful for the House to consider the background to the Bill both from a strategic and financial viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our December 1994 policy agreement, A Government of Renewal, endorsed the health strategy as the basis for the Government's programme in the health area.  The health strategy reorients our health care system and <Col N="218" /> sets out a four-year action plan with targets for reductions in risk factors associated with premature mortality together with improvements in other indicators of health status.  The strategy outlined a number of principles which would guide the development of our health services. These are that the Minister and the Department of Health should be responsible for the development of health policy and overall control of expenditure but should not be involved in the detailed management of the health services; greater responsibility should be devolved to the health boards and other executive agencies; the roles of all key parties, including the members of boards and their managements, must be clearly defined and greater autonomy must be balanced by increased accountability at all levels.  I am pleased that all of these principles find expression in the legislative proposals now before the House.</P>
    <P>The Health Estimate this year is approximately £2.4 billion, including £110 million to be spent on capital items.  Taking account of the transfer of responsibility for funding the disabled person's maintenance allowance to the Minister for Social Welfare and allowing for certain other once-off items of expenditure in 1995, this represents an increase in the Health Estimate of approximately 4 per cent over 1995.</P>
    <P>Within this total figure, a sum of £1.34 billion has been allocated to the health boards.  Taking account of the disabled person's maintenance allowance transfer and other non-recurring expenditure, this allowed for an average increase in health board funding of just over 3 per cent on last year.  This is designed to cover the full year cost of developments initiated in 1995 and includes the 0.7 per cent savings on non-capital expenditure required of each Minister in the context of the 1996 Estimates.  We were fortunate to have been able to negotiate the use of these savings as a contribution towards the cost in 1996 of the further development of services in line with the Government Programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i><Col N="219" /> and the action plan in the Health Strategy.  These developments include improvements in child care services, services for the mentally handicapped, the physically disabled and the elderly, psychiatric services, dental services, acute hospitals, and services for those with AIDS-HIV and drug problems. The funding allocated for the health services this year should enable health boards to maintain services at approved 1995 levels and provide for the critical service developments in the areas I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>Despite this level of investment, we continue to face enormous pressures in terms of the demand for services.  The increasing complexity of the technology available, the new drugs continuously becoming available and the ageing of our population, all put an increasing strain on the resources available to the services.  It is worth noting that during the last five years &mdash; at a time of unprecedented growth levels in our economy, the levels of non-capital expenditure on health has increased by 7 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>While the economy will continue to grow, the forecast is that the rate of growth will slow down.  This will have implications for the level of resources which will be available for public services generally and, in turn, for the level of public investment in health care.  At a macro level, we need to start planning for the implications likely to flow from our obligations under the Maastricht criteria.  We will need to develop a strategy to cope with this new discipline on the public finances and the implications can be expected to extend into all areas of public policy.</P>
    <P>One serious message arises from all of this.  It is that we can anticipate two sets of pressures in the years immediately ahead, one being the inexorable pressure for additional and higher quality services and the other will derive from the stronger discipline on public spending to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Current spending on health and social <Col N="220" /> services is comparable with other EU and OECD countries.  If more resource is required for our health services each year, taxpayers, consumers and opinion formers will require a greater depth of information and clarity on service planning and performance.  The Bill does not represent a critical or negative judgment on current management within the health boards, but rather about the establishment of a process whereby clear parameters are laid down for the future management and the conduct of performance review, among other things.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this legislation the House must be keenly aware of the difficulties confronting those involved in the delivery of health and social services.  There is no denying that, on a day-to-day basis, workers must deal with ever increasing demand for services from a more knowledgable and informed public.  They are required to deal with competing demand and priorities within the confines of the funding available.  Their achievements in doing so are a testament to the co-operation, professionalism and dedication of health service workers and management.  The Government recognises the contribution of all those working in the health service.</P>
    <P>Health boards will be aware of the many conflicting demands and pressures when developing their service plans. Developing service plans will present health boards with challenges but will also help them to reflect local priorities in a manner seen to be reasoned and justified.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important to the successful implementation of this Bill that health boards, their members and managements, accept that they are now required to deliver services in line with the determination in any year.</P>
    <P>It is against this background this Bill has been developed.  The Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996 has three main objectives: to improve financial accountability and expenditure control procedures in health boards; to clarify the respective roles of the members of <Col N="221" /> health boards and their chief executive officers, and to begin the process of removing the Department of Health from detailed involvement in operational matters.</P>
    <P>The first of these objectives is to strengthen the financial accountability arrangements in health boards.  The Government is determined that the health boards will in future operate in the environment of service planning aligned to strict financial control and accountability.  In A Government of Renewal, we committed ourselves to introducing legislation to improve the accountability of health boards.  This Bill gives effect to that commitment.  It reflects the Government's strategic management initiative with its emphasis on making the public service more responsive, more accountable and more open.</P>
    <P>The public expect a more open and accountable system of health administration.  Health boards will be required to prepare and adopt an annual report on the performance of their functions during the preceding year.  This will help taxpayers to judge whether they are getting the best value possible for the money they contribute to the public finances.  Services will have to be even more responsive to people's needs and more information will have to be made available about the actions and decisions taken on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>The second objective is to clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of members of health boards and their chief executive officers.  One of the key problems identified by the Commission on Health Funding in the present structure is that it confuses political and executive functions to the detriment of both.</P>
    <P>The Health Strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future,</i> proposed that this be tackled by making board members responsible for policy functions e.g. determining overall levels of service and expenditure while delegating to chief executive officers responsibility for operational matters.  Clear lines of responsibility must be drawn between <Col N="222" /> boards and their chief executive officers. All modern organisations, whether public or private, must have clear lines so that each level understands its role.  A board which interferes in operational matters cannot perform its functions in an adequate way as it will lose sight of the broader issues and strategy with which it must be concerned.  A chief executive officer who moves into an arena which is proper to the board may neglect his or her main objective which is to implement the policy decisions taken by the board.  The Bill gives effect to this by specifying the functions to be performed by board members and chief executive officers respectively.</P>
    <P>The third objective of the Bill is to begin the process, signalled in the Health Strategy, of removing the Minister and the Department of Health from detailed involvement in the management of individual services by devolving greater authority and responsibility to the health boards.  The development of greater expertise in the health boards in service planning and evaluation allied to the improvements envisaged in the governance role of health board members will create an environment in which greater authority and responsibility can be devolved to health boards.</P>
    <P>While the Minister will continue to have ultimate responsibility to the Oireachtas for all health services, his Department will no longer be involved in the detailed management of individual services.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains definitions of key terms used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 requires health boards in carrying out their functions to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources; to co-operate and co-ordinate their activities with other health boards, local authorities and public bodies and to give due consideration to the policies and objectives of Ministers and of the Government.</P>
    <P>Section 3 and 4 clarify the respective roles of the members of health boards <Col N="223" /> and their chief executive officers.  Provision is made for certain specified functions, to be known as &ldquo;reserved functions&rdquo;, to be carried out directly by the members of health boards.  These include the adoption, supervision and amendment of service plans, the appointment and removal of the chief executive officer, the purchase and disposal of land, the borrowing of money and decisions to continue the provision and maintenance of any premises.  The chief executive officer will assist the board, as appropriate, in these matters but the board will have the final say in the performance of these functions.  Any function that is not reserved to the members will, subject to some minor exceptions, be a function of the chief executive officer and the staff of the board.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer will be obliged to provide the board with any information they might require in relation to such functions but will otherwise be autonomous in performing them.  The effect of these changes will be to bring the management system in the health boards into line with the arrangements that have worked well in the local government system over many years.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires the Minister to specify the maximum amount of net expenditure that may be incurred by each health board in any year.  The term &ldquo;net expenditure&rdquo; means the gross expenditure of a health board less the income of the board, other than grants made by the Minister.  This amount which is referred to as a &ldquo;determination&rdquo; must be notified to the board within 21 days of the publication of the Estimates.  There is provision to enable the Minister to make a determination in respect of a period other than a financial year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is empowered to vary the determination at any time during the year for example, to make additional funds available to meet agreed pay increases or to develop particular services or facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> Section 6 requires a health board, within a period of 21 to 42 days of the receipt of a determination as the Minister may direct, to adopt a plan specifying the services to be provided by the board within the financial limits determined by the Minister.  The board is required to submit a copy of its plan to the Minister.</P>
    <P>If a health board does not submit a service plan within the relevant timescale, the Minister may allow a further period, not exceeding ten days, to enable the board to do so.  If a health board fails to submit a service plan, the Minister may direct the chief executive officer to prepare and submit a plan within ten days.  The Minister may, not later than 21 days after the receipt of a service plan, direct a health board to modify its plan and the board is required to comply with such a direction.</P>
    <P>Service plans are already in operation throughout the health boards on an administrative basis and the plans of boards for 1966 have already been discussed with the Department of Health. The plans cover all the main service programmes such as general hospitals, handicapped, elderly, etc., and describe how boards will manage those programmes during the year.  It is vital that plans present a coherent, integrated approach to the services and reflect the expenditure resources committed by the Minister to the agencies.  The development of service plans will continue with the Department of Health to ensure that they represent a satisfactory basis to the planning and management of services.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that where the Minister amends a health board's determination, he or she may direct that the service plan of the board shall stand amended accordingly or, alternatively, require the health board to submit an amended service plan.  The power to direct that a plan stand amended is intended to deal with situations such as where the Minister makes additional funds available to meet agreed pay <Col N="225" /> increases or to develop particular services or facilities.</P>
    <P>The members of the board will be required to monitor expenditure to ensure that it does not exceed the amount set by the Minister.  In addition, a health board may vary its plan at any time during the year provided it does not breach the financial parameters laid down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that whenever the Minister makes a determination, he or she shall specify the amount of indebtedness that a health board may incur and a health board shall not exceed the amount determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 9 requires the chief executive officer to implement the service plan and to ensure that net expenditure and indebtedness do not exceed the amounts determined by the Minister. Where the chief executive officer forms an opinion that a decision or a proposed decision of the board will result in net expenditure or indebtedness exceeding the amounts so determined, he or she is required to inform the Minister and the board of that opinion.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that if, at the end of the year, the expenditure incurred by a health board is less than the amount set by the Minister, the savings can be carried forward into the next year. However, if expenditure is greater than that authorised, the excess expenditure will become a first charge in the income and expenditure account for the following year.</P>
    <P>Section 11 requires health boards to keep all proper and usual accounts and to prepare and adopt annual financial statements on or before 1 April in the year following the year to which they relate.  This is also the date by which health boards are required to submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that if the Minister is satisfied that a health board is not performing any of its functions in an effective manner or has failed to comply with any direction given by the Minister, he or she may, by order, transfer specified functions of the board for a period <Col N="226" /> of not more than two years to either the chief executive officer or such other person as the Minister may specify.  This provision is intended as a measure of last resort to deal with situations where a board is not being governed in a satisfactory manner, for example, where a board has seriously and without good cause breached the expenditure limits set down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope that this power will never have to be invoked and that any difficulties or disputes that might arise can be resolved without resorting to this provision.  I would also point out that before exercising this power, the Minister is required to have a report prepared in relation to the performance by the board of its functions, must give the board at least 14 days' notice of the intention to exercise the power and must have regard to any representations made by the board in this regard.  I believe that this process provides some breathing space to allow problems to be resolved by agreement between the Minister and the board.</P>
    <P>Section 13 empowers the Minister to give directions in writing to health boards and requires boards to comply with such directions.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that future appointees as chief executive officers of health boards shall hold office on a fixed-term contract basis, as is already the case with senior civil servants and city and county managers.  The new provision will not, of course, affect the tenure of existing office holders.</P>
    <P>Section 15 requires each health board to prepare and publish an annual report in relation to the performance of its functions during the preceding year.  I see this as an important step in bringing the principles of accountability, transparency and freedom of information to bear on the activities of health boards.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the dissolution of the Dublin, Cork and Galway regional hospital boards, the local health committees and the national health council.  As Deputies will be aware, all these bodies have long since ceased to function and this provision is <Col N="227" /> merely giving formal effect to their abolition.</P>
    <P>Section 17 contains miscellaneous amendments to the Health Act, 1970. Most of these are required to bring the relevant provisions of the Act into line with this Bill.  Of particular interest is paragraph (g) which imposes a new statutory obligation on health boards to develop and implement health promotion programmes.  The need for an explicit statutory duty in this regard was identified in the health promotion strategy, launched last year.  I believe that this provision will assist in the successful implementation of that strategy.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 dispense with the need for health boards to obtain ministerial consent to the acquisition or disposal of land and to the payment of grants to voluntary bodies; however, the Minister may give general directions which must be complied with by the boards.</P>
    <P>Section 20 makes it an offence to carry on a nursing home that is not registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  This is required to plug a loophole in the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 21 allows the Minister to extend by order the term of office of An Bord Altranais which is due to expire on 3 October 1996.  Work on the revision of the Nurses Act which will involve the establishment of new board structures is under way in the Department and it is hoped to publish the nurses Bill before the end of the year. The purpose of this provision is to enable the present board to continue in office until the new Act comes into force, I hope in the summer of 1997. This avoids Boad Altranais going to the trouble and expense of holding elections to a board which will fall to be reconstituted under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 22 amends the definition of &ldquo;health service&rdquo; in the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  This is the Act that provides the statutory basis for a number of health agencies, including Beaumont Hospital and St. James's <Col N="228" /> Hospital and the National Rehabilitation Board.  The current definition of &ldquo;health service&rdquo; in the Act has a traditional medical orientation and this has prevented the establishment of bodies under the Act to perform functions in relation to personal social services.  The revised definition is designed to overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>Sections 23, 24 and 25 contain standard provisions regarding repeals, the laying of orders before the House of the Oireachtas, short title, construction and commencement.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill which will affect all aspects of the management, planning and accountability of health boards.  It is fully in keeping with the aims and objectives of the health strategy and indeed its enactment is central to the achievement of those objectives. The Bill also reflects the Government's desire to introduce a more strategic approach to management in the public service.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Official Report of the debate on the Health Bill in 1969 when the then Minister for Health, the late Deputy Seán Flanagan, introduced the concept of the establishment of health boards, legislation governing which was implemented by the then Minister, Mr. Childers.  I will not bore the House with quotations from it except to say that we were saved from a certain fate.  At column 1647 of the Official Report of 16 April 1969, the Minister said: I should mention that I have received representations from the medical profession that each chief executive officer should be a doctor&rdquo;.  With due deference to my colleague on my right, I believe we have been saved in that the Minister did not accept that recommendation.  From a financial point of view, I am sure the Minister would agree that neither the health board nor Department of Health could afford to employ a doctor as a chief executive officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Health is an <Col N="229" /> important issue for all members of the public and treatment of a patient is a constant source of discussion and analysis.  Often in such scenarios debate arises about the delivery of health services. Families will discuss how they were treated at the local hospital or health centre and the manner in which an application for a medical card or a refund of medicine costs was handled by a health board.  These examples highlight the interaction of people with their health boards.  Apart from them, few State organisations have such a daily impact on people's lives.</P>
    <P>A vast array of health and social services are delivered by each health board through the hospitals, health board offices and health centres in the regions. As a consequence, everyone identifies with the local hospital or health clinic and regional health board.</P>
    <P>There is also considerable local democracy in the structure of health boards, as public representatives, health professionals and interest groups are represented on them.  The absence of direct representatives of consumers on health boards must be seen as an inadequacy of the current structures and I hope that will be rectified by the Minister on Committee Stage.  Consumers should be part of the democracy as health boards received vast sums of taxpayers' money through the Department of Health.  Of the £2.4 billion under this year's Health budget, £1.34 billion will be allocated to the eight health boards. That money is spent in diverse ways on general and psychiatric hospitals, general medicine, especially for holders of medical cards, a wide range of community health care including child protection, drug treatment and women's health, home help and supports for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Health boards are also major employers in each region.  In that way they have a major impact on people's lives in that everyone knows someone employed in a hospital, health centre or health board office.  Given this vital role, the health service should be subject to constant review and change but this is <Col N="230" /> the first major Bill to review the operation of health boards since 1970 when the current health board structure was established.</P>
    <P>This legislation has been introduced following a review of the health services by the former Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  The outline for it was drawn in the health strategy document, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i> That document noted there were key problems in the current health board structure, political and executive functions were confused and often undermined the structure and there was a lack of balance between national and local decision-making which did not provide for sufficient information and evaluation. Accountability within the structure was deemed to be inadequate and there was insufficient integration of related services and inadequate effective representation of the interest of individual patients and clients within the structure.</P>
    <P>The health strategy document also identified a weakness in the Eastern Health Board area, in that significant services were provided by voluntary agencies in the region, but no single authority had overall responsibility to co-ordinate all services and to ensure appropriate links between them.  In <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> it was proposed to introduce legislation to provide for a new authority in the eastern region and to remedy the deficiencies identified in all the health boards.  The Minister appears to have taken a minimalist approach to the outline proposed in that document.  Will the Minister of State outline how stands the proposal concerning the eastern regional authority? Will that be covered under another Bill? Originally we were told it would be, but it did not appear on the Government's programme supplied to the Opposition at the beginning of this Dáil session.  If that is the road the Minister intends to travel, will the Minister of State outline why it is necessary to introduce two separate Bills to deal with what is essentially the same topic.</P>
    <P>The role of health boards needs to be clarified.  I hope this legislation will <Col N="231" /> ensure they will be more accountable.  It sets the framework within which health boards and the Department of Health will act.  The more detailed day to day arrangements for putting it into effect will have to be worked out later and as is often the case with legislation of this kind, that element may prove to be the most controversial.  Will the Minister of State outline how that will be achieved? Will a standard code of operation or individual codes apply to each health board?  What will be the health service consumer's input?  Will the Minister establish a working group with representatives of the various interests to negotiate the arrangements and will he report such progress to the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>Health board accountability is required in many areas.  Many controversies have arisen recently involving health boards' handling of child abuse cases.  Almost all health boards have had to deal with a major case, ranging from the Kelly Fitzgerald case, to that of the west of Ireland farmer to the Kilkenny incest case and so on.  In each episode there has been considerable public concern about how the health board concerned and other States services dealt with the matter.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree that the public consider the responses to those cases inadequate and ineffective. They have highlighted the necessity for the implementation of strict codes of practice for operational matters and for procedures to be put in place to deal with concerns expressed by other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I argued on many occasions on the need to introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse.  That is the only way to clear up the grey areas that exist.  Once a decision is taken to introduce mandatory reporting, experts in health boards can discuss the procedures, processes and the guidelines that must apply.  It is only in that way difficulties, which are often more perceived than actual, will be ironed out.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the health document,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" />
      <i>Putting Children First,</i> introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, has greatly assisted health boards in dealing with these issues.  While presenting the issues the document appears to make the case for not introducing mandatory reporting.  This is hardly the purpose of a discussion document.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, has not aided the work of health boards in terms of the new structures put in place for a child care inspectorate within his Department.  Like me, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, strongly believed that a child care inspectorate should be put in place.  However, health boards should not be seen as inspecting themselves which in effect is what will happen.  I would much prefer to have an inspectorate which is not only independent but is seen to be independent.  This is very important and I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>Even though the inspectorate will inquire into the social, child care and other services administered by health boards, at the same time it is located within the arm of Government which controls health boards.  I believe the public would much prefer to see it established as a separate organisation. In recent years we witnessed the controversies and difficulties which have arisen between the Department and health boards.  This was obviously the case in regard to the Kelly Fitzgerald report.  I believe the Minister, his two Ministers of State and the officials in the Department wanted to publish the report but that the health board believed it was its property and decided not to publish it.  This is an area where disagreement will continue to arise between the Department and the health boards.  If the inspectorate was established outside the Department it could make an independent decision as the health boards would not have the same lien on it as it now has on the Department.</P>
    <P>Consideration must be given to combining the work carried out by the children's divisions in the Departments of <Col N="233" /> Justice, Health and Education under the one Minister.  A start has been made in this regard and as a former Minister for Justice I know the difficulty in doing this.  I am not particularly concerned about the home of this independent unit but the present structure, whereby the children's division in each Department does its own thing, is not the best way of ensuring value for money from the point of view of the Government.  The Minister should examine the matter to see if this work can be carried out in a more coherent way.  I am not one of the people who believes that there should be a Minister for children at the Cabinet table as this is a bit like saying that one cannot secure the delivery of services for the west without a Minister for the west.  There are only 14 places at the Cabinet table &mdash; the Taoiseach has 15 &mdash; and one cannot have a Minister for every area of policy.  However, there is room for manoeuvre and it should be possible to co-ordinate the delivery of services to children by the Departments of Education, Justice and Health.</P>
    <P>As the many cases which have become public in recent years show, health is becoming an increasingly complex and controversial area.  Drug treatment is also another hot topic at health board level and it must be tackled in a co-ordinated way.  Fianna Fáil will shortly produce a position paper outlining how the matter can be addressed by health boards and the health authorities generally.  The document will not look at the problem from a health perspective only but will also examine the issues arising in the Justice and Education areas and the employment perspectives.  In this way we hope to achieve an integrated approach to the topic which will assist health boards and, I hope, lead to a unified system of drug treatment at local level.</P>
    <P>Dublin receives most publicity but in almost every area difficulty arises when a health board decides to set up a methadone treatment centre or an addicition treatment centre.  This happens when the health board attempts to locate these centres in communities. <Col N="234" /> This is a laudable idea but local communities worry that the units may not be administered in a proper way and that children may obtain access to used needles, etc.  Health boards could reduce that level of concern and secure local agreement if they confined such units to campuses owned by them, for example, health board administrative blocks, hospital campus or health centres which are already on site.  There are hospitals in almost every area of Dublin city and it would be relatively easy and much less painful to establish such facilities on health board property or hospital campuses.</P>
    <P>There has been much coverage of the nurses' dispute in recent days.  The threatened industrial action has major implications for the services delivered by health boards.  For the first time in 16 years we are facing a wholesale dispute by nurses.  Fianna Fáil has said it wants to see justice for nurses because of the key role they play in the health services. It has also stated that the level of frustration among nurses should not be underestimated.  That frustration was apparent in the ballot when the deal was put to a vote.  It must be noted that if the package was not put in the deal document immediate industrial action would have taken place as strike action had been suspended pending negotiations.  The aspirations of nurses in regard to pay and conditions can be met over a reasonable timeframe.  They would yield tangible and measurable improvements in health service delivery. It was not wise of the Government, following the announcement of the ballot result, to make it appear that it was going over the nurses' heads to the Congress of Trade Unions.  This sent a wrong message to nurses and may have hardened attitudes.  The correct course would have been to speak first to the nursing unions.  However, this seems to have been added only as an afterthought.</P>
    <P>In addition to the immediate disruption of services, a strike by nurses will have major implications for the hospital <Col N="235" /> waiting list initiative.  In the Government's policy document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> there is a commitment to continue the progress made over the past two years in reducing hospital waiting lists for a range of surgical procedures.  However, this has not been achieved to date and the Minister has attempted to disguise this failure to make progress.  In reply to a parliamentary question from me on 23 April the Minister for Health said that in December 1994 there were 28,004 patients on the waiting list.  He went on to make a comparison with 1993 when there were 40,130 patients on the waiting list.  A commitment was given in December 1994 in A Government of Renewal to make progress on this issue. At that time there were 23,835 patients on the waiting list, and that progress had been made by the then Fianna FáilCoalition Government.  Since then the number of patients on the waiting list has increased from fewer than 24,000 in December 1994 to 28,004 at the end of December 1995, the latest date for which figures are available.</P>
    <P>In the context of this debate about resources for health boards and how they are managed I would like the Minister to explain why the number on the list has increased so greatly over a short period, why the list increased in 1995 when more money was spent on the initiative and how he intends to fulfil the commitment made in the Government programme of renewal.  Will he also say why the latest figures are so out of date, how often the Department of Health receives updates from the health boards and hospitals and whether this information is transferred by computer or in writing?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another issue which arises in the context of the use of resources by health boards and hospitals and responsibility for departments. Every year without fail there is a crisis in the accident and emergency departments of the major hospitals.  There are also numerous complaints about overcrowding, dangerous conditions, patients left on trolleys for hours, medical conditions made worse by long <Col N="236" /> delays, lack of dignity for patients left on corridors and upset relatives.  This crisis has been going on for several years and a resolution appears to have eluded the Department, the hospitals and the health boards.  Last year a series of summits was convened in which the Department of Health decided not to participate.  It passed the buck to the hospitals and the health board.  This abdication of responsibility appears to have resulted in the crisis continuing and this autumn we will probably face another series of disruptions.  Will the Minister indicate whether he has any plans to alleviate the crisis?  Will he arrange for the ambulance services in Dublin to be co-ordinated?  Has he plans to get involved now rather than when that crisis hits?</P>
    <P>The co-ordination of ambulance services in Dublin is important.  There have been complaints about the ambulance services and difficulties that have arisen in particular situations.  A bizarre situation exists whereby, in cardiac cases, two ambulances arrive on call, one from the fire brigade service and one from the Eastern Health Board.  I heard a radio programme yesterday on which a couple from the US who had spent a holiday in Ireland were very complimentary to Beaumont Hospital and its staff.  The husband had had a cardiac arrest and his wife was impressed when two ambulances arrived at the scene.  It was pointed out in the programme that two ambulances arrived because it was a cardiac case.  It is a little ridiculous that two ambulances are sent to one emergency when one might be better used elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a welcome provision that health boards will be required to publish an annual report by a set date. Taxpayers will thus be able to see where their money is being spent.  The issue of reporting by health boards arises in the context of the hepatitis C controversy. The Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995 makes welcome provision for health care for hepatitis C victims.  However, there have been many difficulties with the health cover to date.  There have been inadequate counselling services and other facilities in health board <Col N="237" /> areas.  I proposed an amendment to the Bill requiring health boards to report annually on the resources they are making available for hepatitis C health care. The amendment requires them to give a breakdown under all health care headings.</P>
    <P>The controversy has raised a fundamental question about the accountability of agencies such as health boards and about who represents the public interest.  In the hepatitis C controversy serious doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of the board of the blood bank and, rather than concern about the board's handling of matters reducing with time, it has increased. There has also been a problem with the representation of the public interest. Apart from the Opposition parties and the lobby groups who represent the victims, everyone in the hepatitis C controversy has claimed to be party to a court case and refuses to take the public interest into account.  A similar scenario could arise in relation to the health boards.  The Minister might explain how this will be addressed under the new structures.  Who will take the public interest into account when the Department and the health board are embroiled in a controversy or are before the courts?</P>
    <P>If the then Minister for Health, the late Seán Flanagan, could have foreseen in 1969 the large, unwieldy and excessively bureaucratic structure which the health boards would become, he might have made a different decision in relation to their establishment.  The proposal to set up the regional education boards is a good example to follow.  We need to simplify structures, not to create overbureaucratic organisations.</P>
    <P>The public can be infuriated by cut-backs in services.  When the cut-backs hit the Department of Health and are transferred to the health boards, people are concerned that they always seem to affect the services in hospitals or health centres, yet never the administrative structures.  Is the Minister concerned about that?  If cut-backs are to be made, why do the health boards not look first <Col N="238" /> to their own administrative services before hitting the weaker sections of the community?</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary to put patients through the hell of form filling in hospitals?  When patients arrive in admissions they have to answer ten to 20 questions about themselves and their families; when they go to their ward they are asked the same series of questions; and when a consultant finally sees them they are asked the same questions again.  With the use of modern technology, is is not possible to have the responses recorded in a certain form and made available to those who need them?</P>
    <P>I approve of section 14 which empowers the Minister to allow for the appointment of a chief executive officer of a health board for a set period.  We believe the Minister should include the set period in the Bill and we will suggest a period on Committee Stage.  There is provision for a set period of seven years for Department secretaries.  Why not stipulate the same period for the chief executive officers of health boards?  I am concerned about the provision which allows for a period to be set when an individual reaches a certain age.</P>
    <P>People are being appointed to high level posts in the public service at a much younger age than in the past.  If chief executives of health boards were appointed who were in their thirties they would have almost 30 years service if they did not have to retire until their sixties.  A person in such a responsible position loses the appetite for change and reorganising health board services and administration.  If a person's appointment is for a specific period of time it can sharpen their approach.  A provision might be made whereby if after seven years it was felt a person should be reappointed that could be considered.  However, I would prefer a tighter provision in section 14 with the period of time specified.</P>
    <P>Despite the accountability now being required of health boards, it is important that the Minister for Health <Col N="239" /> should still come before the House to answer questions on the activities of health boards and related issues of concern to Members.  Deputies can no longer ask questions on semi-State bodies and when crises develop we have to have major debates in the House.  Crises might often be averted if Opposition members could ask relevant questions which might alert a Minister to events in semi-State organisations.  Despite the changes being made in this Bill, it is important that the Minister for Health remains able and willing to answer questions on the health boards in the House.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers should always be willing to appear before committees of the House to answer for the performance of their health boards.  The powers of the committees must be changed to give them the power to compel witnesses to attend.</P>
    <P>There should be an onus on the chief executive officers to appear before the committees when requested to do so. Such a request has been made to one chief executive officer already and will probably be made to others in the future.  It is a good idea to have the chief executive officers appear before the Committee on Public Accounts because it allows them to answer for the expenditure of moneys in their health board area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I will be proposing a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  A former Fine Gael representative, Deputy Richie Ryan, was very critical of the original Bill 27 years ago and expressed his anger to the then Minister, Seán Flanagan.  However, Deputy Kyne &mdash; a representative of the Minister of State's party &mdash; was very kind to the Minister and supported the changes being put in place.  I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill and look forward to hearing his responses to the queries I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill sets out two basic objectives for the legislation &mdash; to improve the accountability of the <Col N="240" /> health boards and improve the organisational and management arrangements in health boards.  On behalf of my party, I enthusiastically support both objectives.</P>
      <P>Public service organisations have a long way to go in terms of accountability.  This is particularly true of health boards and other bodies associated with health and health administration.  Major publicly quoted companies give us some idea of what we as taxpayers should be entitled to expect from large public bodies such as the eight health boards. Allied Irish Banks, for example, has total assets of £25 billion, 15,000 employees and a network of offices and subsidiaries spanning several countries. It is a huge organisation by any reckoning.  However, the AIB is able to deliver a comprehensive set of financial results within two months of the end of its financial year.  Senior executives of the bank can be and are quizzed by institutional shareholders, investment analysts and financial journalists about the company's performance within a number of months of its year end.  That performance can be compared with the outturn for previous years, using appropriate indicators such as profitability and return on capital.  Trends can be analysed, management capability evaluated and corporate performance measured with some accuracy.  Compare this with the situation in the health boards.</P>
      <P>The basic financial reporting instrument prepared by the health boards is the statement of non-capital income and expenditure.  It can take a year or more for this document to be published.  In the case of at least two of the boards, the report for 1994 has still not appeared and will not be published until at least the middle of this year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, who has responsibility for auditing health board accounts from 1994 onward, has not yet been able to certify the accounts of the Eastern Health Board, which is by far the largest organisation of its kind in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> Timeliness is one of the key requirements in any reporting arrangement.  In the first half of 1996, we as public representatives should be scrutinising the financial reports for 1995 of the different State organisations, agencies, boards, companies and Departments. We could point out shortcomings, highlight difficulties and ensure that they were redressed as quickly as possible.  In other words, we would be analysing and evaluating the 1995 performance to ensure that the 1996 performance was better.  This should be one of our key functions as public representatives and would be of far greater value to our constituents than some of the work currently undertaken on their behalf.  What is the point of analysing figures for 1994 in the middle of 1996?  If figures are not published promptly after the period to which they refer, they lose most of their value.</P>
    <P>The problem of late publication of accounts is not confined to the health boards but is widespread throughout the public service.  In the case of the prison service, for example, we are still awaiting publication of the 1993 annual report.  Assuming it appears at some stage during the current year, of what value will this report be?  Delays of this length mean that documents are of little more than curiosity value when eventually published.</P>
    <P>The eight health boards account for total expenditure of approximately £1.5 billion per year, roughly £30 million per week.  This represents a huge amount of public expenditure in Irish terms and the highest level of accountability should be demanded for it.  Section 11 of the Bill proposes that the annual financial statement of each health board shall be adopted on or before 1 April in the year following the financial year to which it relates.  The Bill does not specifically refer to publication.  It is imperative that annual financial statements should not be merely adopted within a three-month period but should also be published that period.  Public representatives and other analysts and <Col N="242" /> commentators will otherwise continue to be kept waiting.</P>
    <P>The format of financial statements is also important.  When the present financial statements eventually appear they contain a detailed analysis of health board expenditure under about 40 different headings.  The financial statements under the new reporting requirements should be similarly structured in order to facilitate analysis and comparison across the different boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that it aims to begin the process of removing the Department of Health from detailed involvement in operational matters in the health boards.  I agree with this but I would go further.  The Department should see itself not as the manager but as the evaluator of the health services. Within six months of the year end the Department should publish a comprehensive performance review for the eight health boards.  This would provide a detailed comparative analysis of expenditure per person under the various headings in different board areas. High quality management information must be placed in the public arena on a timely basis to facilitate an informed discussion on the way in which the health service operates and a proper analysis of the efficiency and effectiveness with which it discharges its tasks. This kind of analysis is essential to ensure that we achieve value for money for the major expenditure devoted to the health services each year.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that spending on the health services has increased by almost 65 per cent during the past five years.  As far as I am aware, that was the highest increase in public expenditure in any Department or area of activity in the public sector at the time.  In other words, it now costs £17 million per week more to run the health service then it did five years ago.  Has a study been conducted to ascertain whether that service is 65 per cent better than five years ago?</P>
    <P>Although such a study has not been carried out, I can say without fear of <Col N="243" /> contradiction, that the services is not 65 per cent better than it was five years ago.  On what was the money spent and for what purpose?  In a political culture where the solution to every problem appears to be the application of additional resources or, in plain language more money, should we not pay more attention to the concept of value for money and think in terms of quality rather than quantity?</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of welcome initiatives on the management of health boards.  It dispenses with the need for health boards to get ministerial consent for land transactions or the payment of grants to voluntary bodies.  It also introduces a requirement that future appointees as chief executive officers of health boards should hold office on fixed term contracts.  That is a positive development.</P>
    <P>Because minor changes are made in the Bill the impression is given that the Minister and the Department are withdrawing from the day-to-day management of many of the services, particularly from a financial point of view, but that is not so.  If one looks at the Bill, one will see that virtually every section from sections 5 to 14 includes new provisions under which the Minister may specify this, that or the other in relation to health boards.  In removing the requirement to get consent in respect of one or two relatively minor matters it is wrong to give the impression that the Department will be less involved, it will be involved to a much greater extent.</P>
    <P>The health service should be managed as efficiently and cost effectively as possible.  I would welcome anything which contributes to the development of such a management culture within the service.  Even though the Bill is relatively long it makes no reference to the concept of quality as opposed to quantity.</P>
    <P>The concept of quality management standards is now widely accepted in the private sector, but has been slow to take root in the public sector.  Over 1,000 <Col N="244" /> business hold the internationally recognised ISO 900 quality standard.  They cover the whole spectrum of industry and commerce ranging from food processers to pharmaceutical manufacturers, hotels and insurance companies. It is imperative that we bring the same quality management ethos to bear in the public service.</P>
    <P>The document on Civil Service reform published last week highlights the desirability of improving quality and suggests the introduction of a quality service initiative.  The ISO system is already in place and provides a readymade target at which to aim in terms of quality management.  It is operated and administered by a State agency and should be a benchmark for health boards and all aspects of the health service.  It might not be appropriate to enshrine such a requirement in legislation, but the Minister could demand that all health boards meet the standard within a specified timeframe.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the quality management ethos would improve our health services and help to avoid some of the catastrophes which have occurred in recent times.  Would the hepatitis C disaster have happened, for example, if there were clear procedures in operation at the Blood Transfusion Service Board and they were properly adhered to?  Would the terrible mistakes which characterised the sad story of Kelly Fitzgerald have been made if there were a quality management ethos in the Western Health Board?</P>
    <P>I do not know the definitive answers to these questions, but I strongly suspect that the answer to both is that they would not have happened if the quality management ethos taken for granted elsewhere was followed in either organisation.  If private sector businesses are capable of reaching an internationally recognised quality management standard, our health services should also be capable of doing so.  It is, perhaps, even more vital that they should because of the nature of the work in which they are <Col N="245" /> engaged and the inordinate cost of their activities to the public purse.</P>
    <P>With regard to the organisation of health boards, does the Government have any plans to review the existing regional structure which is distinctly lopsided and has remained largely intact since the boards were first established in 1970?  My recollection of the Bill is different from that of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn because when it was finally enacted the Minister, Erskine Childers, was enthusiastic about the idea of eight boards at a time when it was the subject of some criticism in this House.</P>
    <P>In the 26 years which have elapsed since then, the size of health board population catchments has changed substantially but this has not been taken into account in the Bill.  Some of the smaller health boards have population catchments as low as 200,000.  The Eastern Health Board on the other hand caters for a population more than six times larger than that served by the smallest board.  Its total catchment, in excess of 1.25 million, accounts for more than 35 per cent of the national population.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a case to be made for reappraisal of the existing structure to ensure it offers the best means of delivering a quality service to the community at large and value for money to the taxpayer.  In particular, the question must be considered as to whether some of the smaller health boards should be amalgamated for the purpose of delivering a better service.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has a population catchment of about 350,000, the average size served by the health boards.  It does not deliver a proper cardiology service.  It has inadequate equipment to enable what are now regarded as routine cardiac procedures to be undertaken.  Most of them are carried out in Dublin.  It is unfair and wrong that, because somebody happens to live in a particular health board area, he or she cannot undergo what are regarded as normal, run of the mill medical procedures within that area.  Clearly, it does more than inconvenience people; it puts them at a serious disadvantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> When talking about the need for cardiac procedures we are talking about facilities, the non-availability of which may well mean the difference between life and death.  Non-availability of such procedures in a local area may mean that, unfortunately, somebody in that area will die whereas if he or she lived in another area where those procedures are available they would not.  People should not be discriminated against in respect of procedures that are relatively routine.  I fully accept that, for example, advanced cardiac surgery or advanced neurosurgery cannot be available in every part of the country; that is commonsense.  However, the fact that some areas lack ordinary cardiac facilities is unacceptable and should not continue. The provision of facilities would be improved if health board areas outside the Eastern Health Board were sufficiently large to enable them to provide relatively routine procedures.</P>
    <P>Because some effort is made in this Bill on the question of financial accountability I should conclude by referring back to the two episodes I mentioned earlier: the hepatitis C disaster and the Kelly Fitzgerald saga.  It is appalling that each of these incidents occurred, but by far the worst aspect is that in the hepatitis C affair there is still no accountability for a degree of neglect so serious that in most countries it would be a criminal matter.  There is no accountability and no penalty of any kind for those whose wilful failure brought about the hepatitis C disaster for hundreds, if not thousands, of people.  On the contrary, as I pointed out previously, not alone are no sanctions brought against the people who wilfully allowed this to happen but, in accordance with the worst traditions of the public service they were given golden handshakes on the agreed termination of their services.  The Minister for Health can hardly be blamed if the average person in the street thinks that the Minister of the day and the Department approved of the shortcomings and neglect.  This is a very <Col N="247" /> serious matter and if there was a repetition, would we expect similar approval from official sources?  It is quite remarkable that there is such a poor level of accountability.</P>
    <P>I again contrast what happened in regard to the use of infected blood here with what happened in France where at present several people are in jail, including a former Minister as well as several senior administrators, when it was discovered that HIV infected blood was used.  In this country, people knew they were using blood infected by hepatitis and they continued to do so, inflicting serious injury, suffering and disease on innocent people who availed of that blood or blood plasma in good faith. Thousands of people are now being compensated with large sums by the taxpayer and they include not only those who were injured but those who caused the injury.  It is the ultimate laugh that the taxpayer pays both sides, the injured and the injurers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley.  When I raised this matter in the House recently I said that people who are responsible for the suffering of others as a result of using infected blood are walking free and being paid by the State.  People did not like to hear me say that those responsible should be behind bars, but anybody who puts the lives of others at risk should pay the cost.</P>
      <P>My views on this Bill are probably different from those of other Deputies. I would like to see our eight health boards abolished.  People should be responsible at county level to those whom they represent.  For far too long health boards, particularly the Western Health Board, have not been accountable to anybody.  I hope the Government is not handing over responsibility of health boards to the chief executives. Health boards should be accountable to the Minister for Health who, in turn, is accountable to the Dáil.  The people elected to the Dáil should be able to get information from the Minister on all matters relating to health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> Deputy O'Malley talked about necessary services and I agree it is not possible to have every service in each county, but it is sad that most of the services required by the people of Mayo are located in Dublin.  People have to travel to Dublin from Belmullet, Erris, Ballina and Westport for the most basic health services.  I welcome the Minister's recent announcement about the allocation of £25 million for Castlebar county hospital, which will provide many new services.  We fought for many years for a proper health service in Mayo and I am glad that at last it is being provided.  I am aware that not all the services required will be available, but at least it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure in the Bill which provides that chief executives will no longer be appointed for life &mdash; it has not been decided yet whether their term will be two, three or five years.  As is the case with all State boards, chief executives of health boards should be appointed for a short time, perhaps two to three years, and if their performance is satisfactory their contract could be renewed.</P>
    <P>Some health boards live within their budgets whereas others, regardless of how much money they receive, seek extra funding.  Health boards are answerable to this House and to the people who elect us.  Chief executives of health boards should be required to appear before a committee of the Dáil to answer questions put any Members.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a problem which affects many of my constituents, namely, the number of questions they are asked when they go into hospital.  It can be like a question and answer session and patients may be required to answer questions three or four times while in hospital.  This is the computer age and, while I accept questions must be asked of patients, much of the information required is on computer.  Health service workers including doctors and administrators should talk to patients and explain their problems to them in layman's language rather than simply <Col N="249" /> doing ward rounds accompanied by ten or 12 students.  Patients are frequently left wondering what is wrong with them and that is not right.  Hospitals should have a PR person who can speak to patients about their problems.  Members of the public should not have to beg consultants to let them know what is wrong with their relatives.  I ask the Minister to give some consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the number of hospitals who arrange 30 or 40 appointments for the same time.  What is the reason for having 30 or 40 people in a waiting room?  It is degrading for people who are sick, particularly women who are often accompanied by young children.  They find it difficult enough to get to a hospital without having to wait with 30 or 40 other people.  This is a serious problem.  Appointments should be staggered to avoid people having to wait for long periods.</P>
    <P>I believe strongly that health boards should be operated at county level.  We should have a county committee of health.  I believe in the past such a committee existed in every county and they should be re-established.  We have a proven county council system which has endured since the foundation of the State, but unfortunately local authorities are not given sufficient powers. Likewise health boards should be structured at a local level because local people can identify problems in their own areas.  There should be representation from the general public, the doctors and the health boards which would result in a far better system.  The health boards are too large.  They are not responsible to anybody but if they were operated on a county level there would be a great deal more accountability.</P>
    <P>People are at their weakest when they are sick and they are entitled to receive a proper service from the health boards. I acknowledge that over the years Western Health Board hospitals have provided a good service but I want to refer to a group of workers in that service who do not get the recognition they <Col N="250" /> deserve.  Consultants, doctors and chief executives get recognition and when there are staff shortages in these professions their numbers are maintained, but that is not the case with nurses.  I am tired of hearing people say that nursing is a profession.  Of course it is, but nurses must be paid; they need pounds, shillings and pence to survive.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Minister is in negotiation with the nurses because they do a wonderful job.  They are very kind to people who are sick and at their weakest.  If one is in hospital it is wonderful to see the smiling faces of the nurses who do a difficult job under difficult circumstances.  They give a wonderful service to this State and I want to thank them for that service.  Nurses are easy to talk to; they are on the front line and they should be supported in every way.</P>
    <P>We have too many pen pushers in the public service and if we continue the way we are going there will not be a sufficient number of buildings in the country to hold all the paperwork produced. I am referring to every part of the public service.  We must look after the people working on the ground, in particular the nurses who must be complimented for their work.  I hope the current dispute can be resolved to their satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to certain incidents that took place in my health board area.  We need more social workers because we have many more social problems now than we had 20 years ago.  In the past, psychiatric hospitals discharged patients into the community who were not capable of living in such an environment.  That is not a popular view but if we continue to discharge these patients into the community, they will need proper supervision.  I know of people in my county who, having been hospitalised for 25 or 30 years, were discharged into the community despite the fact that they were not well enough to cope with such an adjustment.  Those people need help and they certainly must be supervised. Health boards must employ more social workers and nurses if the policy of discharging patients from psychiatric <Col N="251" /> hospitals is to continue.  Psychiatric patients need supervision on a day to day basis; they should not simply be discharged into the community to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>The chief executives of health boards have too much power while the members of health boards have insufficient power.  I hope in this Bill the Minister is not removing any power because in the final analysis this House is responsible to the people.  The Minister is not responsible for the day to day operation of health boards but the chief executives of the boards must be answerable to the Minister, who should have the final say in relation to certain issues.  Taxpayers are paying for the health service and the chief executives of the health boards should be answerable to the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Bill does not provide for the operation of health boards at county level because it is impossible for people in the city of Galway, for example, to have an understanding of the problems in Belmullet and <i>vice versa.</i> If health boards were operated on a county level they would be more responsible to the people.  They could meet on a regular basis and the people in the county would become aware of any problems.</P>
    <P>The problem of staffing will have to be addressed.  If we are to continue the policy of discharging patients who have been hospitalised for many years, we must have additional social workers and nurses to deal with them.  People cannot be expected to walk out of a hospital and live their lives in a normal society when they have lived in a hospital environment for ten, 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>The £25 million funding for the hospital in Castlebar was a major boost for the county.  The local people believe that a Government has finally listened to them.  We fought for that hospital over many years.  Many new services will be provided but additional services are required.  Women should not have to leave County Mayo at 7 o'clock in the morning to travel to a hospital in Dublin <Col N="252" /> by train or by car, a journey which can take from four to six hours.  Health services should be provided as near to one's county as possible.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the Castlebar services. I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for the wounderful work being done in the Department.  We in Castlebar have waited a long time for this good news for County Mayo.  The people can now look to the future with confidence.  We will have a good service in the next three to four years and a new hospital with plenty of staff and facilities.</P>

      <P>Ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of our health services is a matter of concern to each and every family.  Sooner or later almost every individual has to receive medical care whether from the family doctor or from hospital-based services. In general, we have much to be proud of in our medical services.  The standard of primary care provided by our family practitioners is a match for that provided in the most economically developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be reasonably argued that our GMS system provides a more comprehensive level of access to excellent medical care than is available in many wealthier western countries.  On the other hand it might be argued that our acute services are not as well developed as might ideally be the case.  From time to time we see and hear of cases of undue delay in providing elective services such as hip replacements and various other surgical procedures.  There is no doubt that such backlogs are the cause of much distress and pain for people dependent on the State for medical treatment.  It is vital that renewed efforts are made to eliminate such unfortunate problems in our health services.  We also have substantial resource <Col N="253" /> difficulties in the area of fully equipping our acute hospitals.  As medical technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, there is a tendency for smaller regional hospitals to be left behind in the race to provide comprehensive state-of-the-art services.  This trend is totally unacceptable and must be addressed as a matter of urgency by the Minister and his Department.  On the positive side it is accepted that our acute hospital health care personnel are excellently trained and their tremendous dedication continues to make a major contribution to society.</P>
    <P>In the overall context one can have a certain degree of satisfaction regarding the quality of our health services.  At the same time there is a number of warning signs that there is no room for complacency in terms of the service.  There is clear evidence that a number of factors have combined to place an unprecedented level of demand for resources on the health sector.  The increasing sophistication of modern medicine is exerting a major inflationary pressure.  Costly procedures such as coronary by-pass surgery and organ transplant are becoming increasingly routine rather than exceptional in the daily practice of acute medicine.  Similarly many newly-developed drugs are extremely expensive in the treatment of conditions such as cancer, chronic illnesses and infectious disease.</P>
    <P>Population projections indicate that the number of elderly people in Irish society is likely to increase substantially in the next 20 years or so.  This welcome trend towards increased average life expectancy will place a further major strain on our health care service, particularly in the acute hospital sector.</P>
    <P>If there was ever a time to closely examine the efficiency of our healthcare system it is now.  In a sense the Bill before the House is timely, since it addresses a number of key issues regarding the performance of our healthboards.  Since the health boards act as the main arm of implementation <Col N="254" /> of health policy, it is vital that they operate at the highest possible levels of efficiency and accountability.</P>
    <P>Before considering the various sections of the Bill I will make a few points.  Ideally, in parallel with the introduction of the proposed legislation, it would have been appropriate for the Minister and his Department to carry out a comprehensive review of both the structural and operational strengths and weaknesses of the current model of health care management.  It is agreed by many that the health board structure helps to devolve power from the centre to the regions in terms of determining both the organisation and delivery of health care.</P>
    <P>However, there are also a number of potential weaknesses in the structure. For example, it might be claimed that having eight health boards introduces an unnecessary level of duplication, especially in administration.  It has been suggested that there should be a greater degree of centralisation in the treatment of patients with relatively rare conditions.  Otherwise one runs the risk of developing a relatively large number of under-resourced centres rather than a smaller number of fully equipped and fully staffed units which are almost certain to be more effective.</P>
    <P>It is time to review the overall organisation of the delivery of health care here and the preparation of the Bill provided an opportunity to carry out this much needed work.  We seem to lack even the most basic information to compare the relative performance of the healthboards.  Without such feedback how can either the Minister or the individual health boards decide on the best strategies to be adopted across a range of healthcare services?</P>
    <P>I agree with the intent of section 2 which directs the boards to have regard to various standards and goals in their operations.  However, I remain to be convinced that we have developed adequate quality assessment techniques to monitor the satisfactory implementation of the section.  A cynic might suggest that the crude target of meeting an <Col N="255" /> annual budget target combined with minimising negative media coverage is likely to be nearer the mark in terms of monitoring the performances of the different health boards.  While this comment is probably too harsh, it must be agreed that sufficient resources have not been allocated to the vital task of audit and quality control within our health care services.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 5 deal with the relative roles of board members and the chief executive.  It is obviously important to allocate the overall responsibility for policy and performance to the board members while placing operational control in the hands of the chief executive officer.  While it is important that the Minister maintains overall control of the health boards, I have some doubts regarding the necessity of the comprehensive nature of input by the Minister which is facilitated by section 13.  In practice I presume it will only be used to deal with very specific problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 15 which requires each health board to prepare an annual report on its performance during the previous year.  For comparison purposes, it would seem sensible that each such report would have two parts.  While the contents of one part might be totally at the discretion of the individual health board concerned, a standard format might be used in each health board area for the second part to provide precise comparative information.  Without a fixed format of that type, one could end up with different reports from the regions without any facility to compare and contrast individual performances.</P>
    <P>In summary, I welcome the general trend towards increased accountability which is the basic purpose of the Bill.  In an area of such critical importance to the people, we must take urgent steps to improve the scope and detail of information and research which is available on the performance of our health services, for example, the Hospital In-patient Enquiry system, HIPE.  This data <Col N="256" /> collecting facility has tremendous potential to provide detailed information on the performance of our acute hospital sector.  To-date this source of information does not seem to be fully exploited.  I expect a similar position exists in many other areas of our health care system.</P>
    <P>At a time when a wide range of factors have combined to create ever increasing demands for resources in our health care sector, we must take every possible step to ensure that audit and quality control becomes an accepted part of the delivery of health care services.  We do not have an option in this regard if we sincerely wish to maintain and develop the quality of our health care system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long overdue Bill as the health boards were set up in the 1970s.  As a member of a health board I am glad a clear distinction has been drawn between the functions of health board members and management as uncertainty in that regard caused great difficulties in the past.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Bill the Minister should have taken cognisance of the recent announcement to reward efficiency and effectiveness in the Civil Service.  It would be remiss to introduce policies for the Civil Service and not to take cognisance of them when introducing a new management structure for health boards.  Major changes have already taken place in our health boards.  Management performance has improved dramatically and there is a greater level of consciousness about spending.  We want to provide the best possible service at a minimum cost and ensure that scarce resources are not wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In placing demands on boards and management, the Minister also places a demand on himself.  If he allocates a sum of money to a health board within which it cannot possibly operate, the dilemma will rest with him.  How could he hold a chief executive officer responsible for the additional demands that <Col N="257" /> might be placed on a board's resources? For example, two years ago there was a great demand for beds at Cork University Hospital because a large number of people became ill at the same time.  This placed an additional cost of approximately £200,000 on the health board which could not have been anticipated and similar difficulties could arise in the future.  If the Minister operates a tightly controlled budget, chief executive officers and health boards will have no option but to limit services and, consequently, the sick will be affected.  The Minister will face major difficulties if health boards do not have sufficient funding to meet the demands placed on them.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.5 million was allocated to the Southern Health Board for nursing home subventions.  This will cover only those at present in nursing homes and those approved for places.  The Minister is asking the chief executive officer in the Southern Health Board to continue to approve nursing home subventions even though he knows that within six months the £1.5 million will be exhausted.  At the same time he is introducing an amendment to the Health Act which specifically states that the chief executive officer must not exceed the funding allocated to the health board.  Does the Minister realise the dilemma this will pose?  The chief executive officer will have to cease providing certain services and it will have a serious impact on nursing home subventions.</P>
    <P>As the number of elderly is spiralling, the number seeking places in nursing homes will increase dramatically in the next ten years.  To overcome this difficulty the Minister should provide nursing home subventions under a demand led scheme, similar to the supplementary welfare allowance operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  If a family member suddenly becomes ill and cannot be cared for in the home, the family may have no option but to seek nursing home subvention.  Under the provisions of the Bill the chief executive officer would have to cut the cord in such circumstances and I do not believe <Col N="258" /> that is what the Minister wants.  As the Southern Health Board will face major difficulties in the next six months, I urge the Minister to consider providing such a demand led service.  Otherwise, elderly people will have to be told they cannot be catered for in the system.</P>
    <P>People care about the elderly and many would like to care for them in their homes.  Will the Minister consider removing the basic eligibility requirements for the carer's allowance?  Would it not be better to give a person £50 per week to mind an elderly person at home?  How many people would opt to care for the elderly at home if they could receive a pension and a non-means tested carer's allowance?  As many elderly people would prefer to be cared for in their homes, we must ensure people have the resources to provide that care.  If that were the case, the demand for nursing home subventions would be much less.  The average subvention is approximately £70 per week.  If the present trend continues there will not be enough places in nursing homes to cater for the elderly.  The number of people seeking places has mushroomed in recent years, the cost to the Minister's Department will mushroom accordingly and health boards will have great difficulty managing their finances.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be responsible for the indebtedness referred to in section 13.  I hope the Minister will ascertain how many of our public hospitals have vacant units, and, perhaps, make provision in the Bill for health boards to lease some of those premises to individuals who would be able and willing to provide a service for our geriatric patients at no extra cost to the health boards.  It might generate finances for the health boards if vacant premises were leased to people who were willing to provide care for the elderly.  The suggestion is worth considering.  I will have more to say on that issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the Bill, I feel there are major cost implications that will cause problems for the Minister and <Col N="259" /> grievous pain to health board managers and members in planning their budget for the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill, the purpose of which is to improve the financial accountability and expenditure control procedures in health boards, to clarify the respective roles of members of health boards and chief executive officers, and begin the process of removing the Department of Health from detailed involvement in operational matters.</P>
      <P>The overall Health Estimate for this year is about £2.4 billion and a total of £1.34 billion has been allocated to health boards.  If the purpose of this Bill is to introduce measures for better planning and control of expenditure levels, that is to be welcomed, because we are dealing with very large sums of money.</P>
      <P>This Bill attempts to establish a process where clear guidelines can be put in place for the management and the performance of health boards.  Only two years ago the Exchequer had to bail out a number of health boards which had allowed their accumulated deficits to get out of control.  This Bill is an attempt to put in place legal controls to ensure that this cannot happen again.  The Western Health Board offended least in this regard.  The overrun figures paid to health boards in 1994 were not part of their allocation but an extra allocation to cover deficits.  The Eastern Health Board received £14.1 million, the Southern Health Board £10.2 million, the Midland Health Board £6.7 million, the North-Western Health Board £6 million, the North-Eastern Health Board £5 million, the Mid-Western Health Board £4.7 million, the South-Eastern Health Board £3.6 million and the Western Health Board £2.6 million.  In future boards that manage their affairs prudently should be rewarded with increased allocations in the following year.  This might be an incentive for boards to stay within their budgets and a penalty for boards which do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> The general public do not seem to realise the size of the budgets allocated to health boards.  For example, the expenditure for 1995 in the Western Health Board region was £216.4 million compared with a budget of a mere £9.47 million in 1972, the year the health boards were established.  In the two major hospitals in Galway, University College Hospital and Merlin Park, we had considerably more bed spaces in 1972 than we now have, and this at a time when our population in the Western Health Board region is getting older &mdash; there are now more than 50,000 people over the age of 65 in the Western Health Board area.</P>
    <P>People are living longer and there is a greater demand for hospital and institutional care.  In the meantime the administrative costs of running our health boards has increased significantly every year.  In 1992 the administrative and management costs in the Western Health Board region were £7.66 million. In 1994, two years later, they were £9.786 million, an increase of more than £2 million in two years.  The general public would say that this increase in the cost of administration of the health service in our area did not result in a corresponding improvement in patient health care.  That is what is important.  How the money our health boards receive is turned into patient care is what the general public is concerned about.  They see the hardship caused when people have to wait for operations or have their hospital bookings cancelled the night before an operation because there are no beds available.  They are aware of the hardship suffered by patients who must wait on trolley beds in casualty to be admitted to hospital.  That is a recurring problem in University College Hospital, Galway, and it is getting worse due to neglect and lack of capital expenditure on our hospital over the past 25 years. There has been little capital expenditure since the hospital was first opened.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the dedication of the hospital staff, the doctors and nurses who must cater for this overflow in the <Col N="261" /> casualty unit and work in extremely difficult circumstances.  I speak about the hospital of which I have most knowledge and to which I am a regular visitor because it is in the area I represent.  I cannot praise too highly the dedication of the doctors and nursing staff who do an excellent job under very difficult circumstances.  The intolerable situation in the casualty section of the hospital cannot be allowed to continue.  It is an indictment of Ministers for Health over the past ten years.  Let us put the record straight &mdash; it is an indictment of Ministers who represented Galway for the past ten or more years.  They stood back from the problem and neglected Galway's justifiable case while their ministerial colleagues ensured that major funding was provided for other hospitals in the region.</P>
    <P>Castlebar Hospital received an allocation of £25 million only recently for the second phase of development there and I do not begrudge that to Castlebar. Sligo Regional Hospital received a major allocation also in the recent years. I blame our representatives who have neglected the case of the capital of Connacht, Galway City, and neglected to provide capital for University College Hospital over the past ten to 15 years. This neglect has resulted in the chaos we are now witnessing at the hospital.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, who in April last year, shortly after his appointment, visited University College Hospital at my request.  He immediately sanctioned the drawing up of plans by the Western Health Board for an interim development at the hospital.  Yesterday at a health board meeting which I attended, I was glad to hear the chief executive officer say that we are now at tender stage of this interim development which will provide four separate units with accommodation for 13 or 14 beds each, two additional X-ray rooms and ancillary accommodation, two additional operating theatres with ancillary accommodation, and refurbishment of the existing theatres.  The work will also include an extension to and alterations <Col N="262" /> in the accident and emergency department, including observation beds.  That is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Although only an interim measure, I thank the Minister for Health for his quick response to the call from University College Hospital Galway, in respect of which the Western Health Board passed a motion yesterday seeking an updating of its 1982 plans submitted to his Department which have been so shamefully neglected ever since.  We seek the go ahead for the major development required at that hospital, the most important within the Western Health Board region.  I call on my colleagues in Government to participate in this campaign and have this essential development undertaken for residents of the Western Health Board area, particularly those in Galway city whose population has trebled since the establishment of that health board and quadrupled since that hospital was first built.</P>
    <P>Daily one hears comments on radio programmes, including some by Opposition Deputies and Senators, about the scandal at University College Hospital Galway but there is never any acknowledgment of responsibility.  I have been a Member of this House for eight years and this is the first time my party has been in Government.  I am glad the Minister has responded positively, allowing the Western Health Board to proceed with the interim development at that hospital.  Nonetheless, that will amount to repairing a leaking bucket and will not totally rectify the problem.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of health boards' involvement I question is their administration of the rent subsidy scheme for the Department of Social Welfare, expenditure on which has escalated at an alarming rate over the past five to six years.  The national cost of that subsidy was £8.6 million in 1990, £14.4 million in 1991, £23 million in 1992, £38.7 million in 1993, £44.8 million in 1994 and £52.9 million in 1995.  In the Western Health Board area 8,262 applicants received <Col N="263" /> £4.2 million in 1994 and in 1995 some 8,230 applicants received £5.1 million.</P>
    <P>This type of accommodation being a major problem in Dublin city, in the Eastern Health Board area 33,445 applicants in 1994 received some £25.98 million and in 1995 some 34,253 applicants received £35.9 million.</P>
    <P>The system must be examined thoroughly.  Its administration is causing grave concern to those in built-up urban areas where those in receipt of rent subsidy must compete with young married, working couples who would not be eligible, further exacerbating the cost of rented accommodation.  Rent subsidy is assessed by health boards on the prevailing rates for rented accommodation which was why in 1995 fewer applicants within the Western Health Board region received £1 million more than in the preceding year.  This has become a vicious circle.  The demand for rented accommodation is driving up costs and health boards are obliged to pay a subsidy based on the prevailing rate.</P>
    <P>Another consequence of that scheme is that, whenever young people living at home apply for the £62 unemployment assistance, which is means-tested on the income of their parents, they are deemed ineligible, whereas if they move to a flat or other rented accommodation they immediately become eligible.  Usually they will apply to the health board the following week for a rent subsidy, for which they will qualify, in addition to a medical card, further exacerbating the position of others who must compete for rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>I submit that this is an anti-family scheme.  Suppose my unemployed son or daughter lives in the family home and applies for unemployment assistance, based on my income as a public representative, he or she will be deemed to be ineligible whereas, if they live in a flat or other rented accommodation they will be eligible for unemployment assistance in addition to a rent subsidy from the health board.  If my daughter, a fully trained nurse, finds she is unemployed and comes to live in the family <Col N="264" /> home and applies for unemployment assistance, she will discover she is ineligible.  Probably she will do what thousands more are doing, that is, move into rented accommodation.  The following week her boyfriend might ask what is the point of both of them living in separate flats.  He might then decide to move in with her and my wife and I might suddenly discover we are to be grandparents.</P>
    <P>I am talking realistically in the present climate.  If young people live at home with their parents, at the very minimum they will be encouraged to seek employment.  I submit that for two years after the completion of young people's education they should qualify for unemployment assistance only if living at home, thus maintaining the family unit intact while costing society generally much less than the present system. I make that case based on the startling figures being paid out by health boards in supplementing the cost of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>I request the interdepartmental committee at present investigating that matter to seriously examine taking that responsibility from health boards.  Why should they have to administer such a scheme?  Would not its administration be more appropriate to the Department of the Environment?</P>
    <P>I understand that health boards are also responsible for some aspects of the administration of grants for mentally handicapped persons, the Department of Education being responsible for others.  Whenever a public representative inquires, he or she is told its administration is a matter for the Department of Education rather than the Department of Health.  In turn, when one inquires of the Department of Health, one is referred to the Department of Education.  Rather than have interdepartmental responsibilities, each Department must have its responsibilities clearly specified.  The Department of Health should be responsible only for the administration of the health services and not for rent subsidies and matters <Col N="265" /> that might more appropriately be handled by the Department of the Environment.  There are several matters I would like clarified and I am sure the Minister will be glad to do so on Committee Stage.  I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Minister in his very detailed speech outlined the many changes he would like to see in the health boards in the coming years. Many politicians who have never served on the health board are inclined to be critical of how it operates.  It is quite some time since the eight health boards were established and we have to ask whether they are capable of moving with the changing demands on health services today and into the next century.</P>
      <P>I have been a strong critic of health boards, particularly the South-Eastern Health Board, because it does not provide the services needed on a country by county basis.  Some counties seem to do far better than others.  Even though the health board structure was put in place by my party I have always believed it was a major mistake to change from a county to regional structure because when the health service was administered by the local authority there was greater accountability for the operation of the service.  I have been critical of the elected representatives who are members of the health board. A short time ago a Deputy said that the role of the members of the health board needs to be defined and I agree.  Health board members have far greater powers than they exercise.  They have allowed a chief executive officer and his administrative staff to assume overall power rather than exercise it themselves.  Many of the public representatives on the health board have never initiated or implemented the policies that the people want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have argued &mdash; and will continue to argue &mdash; that health services should be administered on a county basis.  Some people might think that would be a retrograde step but some counties have benefited far more than others.  For example, in the South Eastern Health <Col N="266" /> Board, counties Waterford and Kilkenny have benefited far more than Wexford and Carlow because the headquarters and the principal hospital of the region are located there.  In the past year or two County Wexford has done reasonably well because the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, is from Wexford and during his term of office many new initiatives were implemented in Wexford, including the upgrading of the hospital, which was initiated by Fianna Fáil and continued by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition Government.  New services such as day care centres were provided in the smaller villages.  Prior to that time and for the best part of 20 years County Wexford had lost out badly because of the health board structure.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, is from Waterford and while he is in office I am sure he will ensure there is a fair and even spread of resources throughout the region and not just concentrated in one or two counties.  Chief executive officers of the health boards have too much power and I agree with our party spokesperson, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Members on the other side of the House who have said that the chief executive officer should have to come before the Dáil on an annual basis to account for expenditure and the services provided in the region he administers.  The health boards are not accountable enough to the general public, to Members and to the Minister.  In the course of his address the Minister said greater responsibility should be devolved to the health boards and other executive agencies.  The role of all key parties including the board members and managers must be clearly defined.  I would like to see health board members accepting their responsibility and not continuously hiding behind the chief executive officer and his senior administrative staff.  The powers have been devolved to the health board members and they could provide a far better service.  The members are the policy makers and the role of the chief executive and his staff is to implement it.  I am not <Col N="267" /> satisfied that this is happening.  Perhaps it is happening in reverse and I am glad the Minister will clearly define and spell out the role of both to ensure that we get a better service from the health boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take a deep interest in patients' rights.  Members are aware that patients are asked a great many questions and a detailed form has to be filled in.  In this era of modern technology and computerisation surely this should happen only once and the data should be in the system on the patient's return visits.</P>
    <P>I am very critical also of the way hospital appointments are handled. Everyone gets word to come to the hospital at 9.30 a.m. and perhaps 100 or 200 people arrive and are still there at 2.30 p.m.  Surely it is not impossible for hospital staff to arrange appointments at different times so that one patient is called at 9 a.m. and appointments are made every ten to 15 minutes?  People have to go to hospital from all parts of the county and sit around all day waiting to be seen.  In many cases a neighbour or taximan, who had to be paid, brings the patient to hospital.  It is totally unfair that the patient cannot even get a cup of tea, coffee or a sandwich.  However, there are no problems with appointment times in the Dublin hospitals and one is seen at the appointed time.  Will the Minister discuss ways of improving this unacceptable system with the chief executive officer, health board members and hospital administrators?  Patients who are ill may have to wait up to two hours for their turn.</P>
    <P>I have seen cases, especially in respect of older very ill patients, where people were allowed jump the queue to attend the doctor.  Changes could be made in this area with little difficulty or inconvenience to the hospitals involved.</P>
    <P>The chief executives and administrative staff of the health services appear to have no problem getting salary increases.  However, those working at the coalface dealing with the public &mdash; nurses, ambulance drivers, community <Col N="268" /> welfare officers and so on &mdash; always have to beg, threaten strike action and create all kinds of rows to get increases. This causes great anxiety and annoyance.  It also causes concern to the public seeking a better health service.  While there are substantial administrative salary increases every year, services on the ground do not appear to be any better.</P>
    <P>This area must be looked at.  Nurses, ambulance people, doctors and others dealing on a daily basis with patients should be given the salary increases which they deserve.  At present, nurses are very dissatisfied.  They are annoyed that this and previous Governments have not recognised the major role they plan in society caring for patients.  Their role has never been adequately recognised by the powers that be.  However, it is recognised by patients.  Anyone who has been in hospital has seen the tremendous work done and service provided by nurses.  However, teachers, whether primary or secondary, the gardaí, farming groups and others with clout get benefits and wage increases while nurses have to take a back seat. In view of the nature of the service they provide, nurses have never felt happy about threatening or going on strike or abandoning their patients.  However, their patience has finally snapped and they are now serious about taking action to get a better deal for the work they do.  Regardless of the time of year, nurses are always on call to look after people.  This must be recognised by politicians on all sides of the House.  The salary structure they seek should be negotiated with them and they should not have to beg for an increase they so richly deserve.  The Minister of State is a caring man.  I know that he, the Minister and the Department will continue to negotiate with the nurses because they recognise the major role they play.</P>
    <P>We live in a changing society.  The area of child abuse has come to the fore. Health boards are not geared to deal with this escalating problem.  There is need for more staff training and greater expertise.  The Minister should tour the country to discuss this with them.  Board <Col N="269" /> members and officials do not recognise their major responsibility to put an action plan in place and hold discussions with the children involved, their parents and other relevant people and groups. This most serious area requires a co-ordinated approach between the boards and the Department of Health.  People are concerned that the boards have not recognised the importance of the problem and have not geared themselves to deal with it.  The Minister spoke of devolving greater powers to the boards, which is welcome.  However, in this area he must have a hands on approach to ensure that structures are in place to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Many people do not have adequate access to transport to hospitals.  The health boards provide a transport service to the major hospitals, for example, there are adequate mini bus services from Wexford to Ardkeen and Wexford to Dublin.  However, if one wishes to travel from Enniscorthy or Gorey to the general hospital in Wexford, one must hire a taxi or get a lift if one does not have a car.  Some mornings, especially on Fridays when, in my work as a politician I travel out of Enniscorthy to the county hall or some other destination, I would see nine or ten people on the road thumbing lifts to the hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister advised that £2.4 billion was being spent by the health boards and it baffles me that they are unable to provide adequate transport services for such people.  It is not right to expect a mother who is not in good health to thumb a lift to the local hospital in the middle of winter.  I hope the health boards will consider this issue again. Transport services were withdrawn some years ago.  I never understood why they had to be withdrawn completely. Not much thought or consideration was given by the boards to this area.  I have written to the chief executive and the members of the South-Eastern Health Board on a number of occasions and will continue to do.  A transport system could be introduced on a small scale. Most people have cars, but there are some on or below the breadline for <Col N="270" /> example, lone parents, separated mothers, etc, who do not and must thumb lifts to hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the fact that by the turn of the century the number of old people will have increased.  What plans are the health boards putting in place to deal with this problem in ten years' time?  I believe, from making telephone calls to the health boards and local health clinics, there are few plans, if any, being put in place.  The Government introduced a bed subvention for nursing homes, which was welcomed, although many people do not qualify because of the rigid implementation policy adopted by the health boards. The Department of Health &mdash; I know it has set up a planning committee &mdash; and the health boards must look at a long-term plan to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Nursing homes charge exorbitant fees.  It costs approximately £250 a week to keep someone in a nursing home in Enniscorthy and it could be twice that figure in some parts of Dublin.  A person on a pension would not be able to secure a bed in such nursing homes. Some Deputies suggested that grants should be paid to people to look after their aged mother or father at home. This should be seriously considered.  A father or mother would prefer to stay in the family home rather than move to a local nursing home or geriatric hospital.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take on board some of my suggestions.  I will also make representations to the health board. Our health services are on a par, if not better, than some of our EU counterparts.  However, we should question what value we get for the increasing amount of money allocated by the Minister to the health boards each year. Health boards should be accountable and changes should be made to ensure that people get an improved service.  I welcome the Bill which gives us an opportunity to put on record our views on how health boards should operate and the type of services they should provide for the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to this debate.  We have little if we do not have our health.  Foremost in our duties as public representatives must be to provide a good health service for the people.  I am happy with our health services, which are probably the best in the world and it must be acknowledged that successive Ministers gave their all to building the health services.</P>
      <P>Some £2.4 billion is spent on the health services and £1.34 billion by the health boards.  There must be accountability when spending such a large sum of money.  A Deputy made the comparison between the health boards and financial institutions with a turnover which is treble or quadruple the health boards' total bill.  They return their end of year accounts within two months after 31 December.  However, that is their business and they must do it properly because they are dealing with our money.  They are making money and they must know what to do.  Health boards are different because they are not dealing with financial matters, but with the administration of health care which is costly.  If people want the services, they must be paid for.</P>
      <P>We have some of the finest surgeons in the world.  I heard an interview today with Mr. Nelligan, our famous heart specialist.  He said he was not stating his own case, but laying out the facts.  He is only one of a large number of people dedicated to health matters.  He works from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. five days a week and is on call at weekends.  How many people work those hours and give that type of service?  He does three major heart operations a day, five days a week. People come here from all over the world for heart treatment.  We should be proud of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that Mr. Nelligan and his team and many other surgeons who have trained both under him and abroad are providing this service, there is still a backlog.  I cannot understand why this is the case given the improvements in health care.  Mr. Nelligan said there is <Col N="272" /> an 18 months' delay for a heart operation, but he reiterated that an emergency would be dealt with immediately. If someone is diagnosed as needing a bypass, it could be 18 months before they have their operation, although they are continuously monitored.  It is a worrying time for the patient and his or her family.  Mr. Nelligan indicated that we would need to do at least another 400 operations per annum to clear the backlog.</P>
    <P>People whose eyesight is failing because of cataracts need an operation to remove them.  I have brought people to Dublin on numerous occasions to have their eyes examined, but they were told they must wait for an operation because of the waiting lists.  That has a traumatic effect on people.  It is important that someone whose eyesight is failing has an operation.  Orthodontic treatment is another area which must be addressed.  We do not seem to be coming to grips with the growing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the manner in which health care is administered through the North Eastern Health Board.  I have been a public representative since 1974, although I have never been a member of the North-Eastern Health Board. However, I know the chief executive officer and the staff who are efficient and forthcoming as regards representations.</P>
    <P>Cavan General Hospital is one of the finest in the country.  When its development was sanctioned, the people of Cavan did not wait for someone else to do something for them.  They set up a fund raising programme to provide major equipment and over £100,000 was collected for a CAT scan machine. Other equipment was also bought.  The people will help if services are being provided and the Cavan people are no different from people in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The health services in Cavan General Hospital are outstanding and we are fortunate to have a great team of surgeons, doctors and nurses who give great service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> There must be flexibility with regard to budgeting because if a person needs immediate health care in an emergency, he must get it and the people who provide it must be paid.</P>
    <P>With regard to care of the elderly, there is a move towards providing small nursing home units close to communities rather than large isolated nursing homes.  In County Cavan St. Felim's is being divided into nursing home units in Virginia, Ballyconnell and Cootehill and this is a step in the right direction. However, we should not focus our attention exclusively on nursing home accommodation.  Medical advances mean that people live longer.  They do not aspire to live in a nursing home but to remain in their own homes.  More effort should be made with the help of the health boards and the Department of Social Welfare, to co-ordinate a proper service by which people can be looked after in their own communities.</P>
    <P>In the past one of the younger children in a family stayed at home to look after the aged parents and that person's life might be spoiled because by the time the parents passed on, the carer was too old to set up his own home. Young people are more inclined nowadays to get on with their own lives.  The elderly people are not being abandoned but young people have their lives to live.</P>
    <P>If young people want to care for an elderly parent or relative they should be given help to do so.  For financial reasons a young couple who want to care for an elderly relative may have to work but are reluctant to leave an elderly person at home alone all day while they are out at work.  The idea of &ldquo;granny flats&rdquo; and extensions to houses is good, but a home help or carer's allowance is also needed.  District nurses also do marvellous work in this regard and are greatly underrated.  A system which helped young couples to care for an elderly relative at home would free up beds for those who cannot be cared for at home.  Many people now in institutions could be cared for in their own homes or communities.  In Cavan town, Cavan County Council has a policy of <Col N="274" /> building old person's dwellings in groups.  Old people fear burglaries and robberies so we have developed a system of small units in groups of three or four where people can live individually but have the company of neighbours. That model should be further developed because it gives a person the freedom of his own home in his community.  It can readily be provided but it requires back up services and the carer's allowance, for example.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare is too strict in laying down the rules and assessing incomes.  With this system an elderly person can have the satisfaction of living in his community in his home, and there is a saving for the health boards in that beds in hospitals and nursing homes are left free for those who need them.  If the Minister addressed this problem he would do a great service to those involved.  It is important not to forget the elderly.</P>
    <P>I have no complaints about the health services.  We are fortunate to have them. The previous speaker referred to waiting times at clinics.  People are often given morning appointments but may not be seen until the afternoon.  This is due to carelessness on the part of the person arranging the appointments and a little time and attention given to the process would improve the problem. People who are sick should not have to wait for long periods, especially when they have young children.  The problem is exacerbated if those involved have to travel a long distance to Dublin, for example.  The system should be more streamlined to avoid people having to sit around for three or four hours.  I compliment the Minister of State and the Minister for the work they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been some time since there was an examination of our health structures.  We have been working from regulations devised in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the then Minister, the late Seán Flanagan.  The health boards are delivering a good health service.  I agree that the chief executive <Col N="275" /> officer of each health board should be a doctor.  I am aware that other Members would not agree with this but when the health boards were initiated doctors were appointed as chief executive officers because they had the greatest knowledge of health matters.  However, things have changed since that time.</P>
      <P>A major portion of organisational structures dates back to the 1970s.  The Commission on Health Funding made a number of observations with regard to structural organisation, particularly in respect of confusion as to the way health services are delivered at local and national level.  No proper evaluation has been completed in many instances and accountability has not been the hallmark of the health service.  There has also been poor integration of services within the State.  The interests of the primary user, the patient, have not been sufficiently taken into account.</P>
      <P>In light of this background and the developments that have taken place since the 1970s, it is advisable that the current managerial system be considered.  Many new aspects have been developed in the areas of management and high-tech medicine and we must also deal with the areas of litigation and the media.  It is very important that health boards learn to deal with the media and problems of litigation that arise on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the then Government decided to proceed with an organisational effort within the health boards because of the plethora of voluntary and statutory agencies and sub-agencies which have developed in recent years.  There did not appear to be an overall management structure or linkage in place between these agencies.  Greater information was needed with regard to the exact position of health boards <i>vis-à-vis</i> the chief executive officers, voluntary agencies, the Minister and his Department.  It was decided that the time had come for a significant consideration of the problems of the health boards, particularly the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any changes to the health services <Col N="276" /> should be directed for the benefit of patients, not civil servants, doctors or managers.  The new structure should be patient-oriented and not oriented toward chief executive officers, executives or the personnel responsible for administering the health boards.  We should consider the needs of patients and the type of service being delivered to them.  Everyone has experienced poor service and management in many areas of the health service.  There have been some successes in various health boards but decision-making must be devolved to grass roots level.  We must work in conjunction with the voluntary sector and encourage practical development.</P>
    <P>The health sector is one of the largest employers in the country.  Ireland has many unemployed people and it should be within the power of the Department of Health, working in conjunction with other Departments, to see if some of these people could be employed in the health service.  The health boards could consider various aspects including carer's allowance, minders, etc.  There are areas which have the potential to help reduce the rate of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Many problems have arisen in recent years which were not a feature of life in 1969 or 1970.  New problems such as AIDS, hepatitis, drug abuse, the reemergence of TB in some areas, the issue of litigation and allergies seem to be becoming increasingly prevalent. Problems also exist with regard to funding and VHI cover.  These issues have recently evolved and must be effectively dealt with by any new structure in the health boards.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the bread and butter issues which have not been sufficiently resolved.  For example, people still encounter problems when trying to speedily procure medical cards in cases of hardship.  There is also the problem of assessment in cases where people have small amounts of money on deposit with the local bank.  The interest is reckoned at 10 per cent for assessment purposes, when depositors might only be receiving 1 or 2 per cent.  These questions must be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> We must also consider people's views regarding provision of services.  Things have changed dramatically in relation to accident and emergency services in recent years.  Road traffic accidents are more serious than 20 years ago, cars travel at much greater speeds and major accidents are a daily event.  Is it sufficient to have a junior house doctor or senior house officer dealing with people involved in serious road accidents? Should a consultant physician or registrar be on duty at all times to obviate the problems that exist in terms of litigation?  Health boards must carefully consider these issues.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory progress has not been made with regard to waiting lists. Despite recent effort and financial investment, there has been an increase in the number of people on waiting lists. This matter must be reconsidered to discover the reason we have not succeeded in reducing numbers.</P>
    <P>Many people have experienced problems in the area of orthopaedic medicine.  People must wait a long time and endure much pain before being admitted for such necessary procedures as hip and knee operations.  This is not acceptable.  We must consider the position in the private sector <i>vis-à-vis</i> the public sector.  People can have a hip operation in the private health sector within one or two months.  In the public health sector they might have to wait years for such an operation.  The health boards must look critically at the delivery of service.</P>
    <P>The same problems pertain in the developing area of cardiac medicine where heart by-passes are the order of the day.  Such operations will become more frequent and we must endeavour to deal with the problems that exist.</P>

      <P>One hundred and ten million landmines contaminate 70 countries of the world.  This weapon of mass destruction kills and maims 500 people every week and 26,000 per year.  If there was an incident at sea or an airplane crash these figures would result in massive media coverage.  However, because the casualties are spread throughout the world and, in many cases, affect the poorest of the poor and even though horrific multilation is involved, the carnage resulting from landmines receives little media attention.  In countries such as Afghanistan, Mozambique, Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia, men, women and children are blown up while merely collecting firewood, fetching water and tending cattle.  The only coverage we receive of landmine victims is when, unfortunately, they happen to be UN officials or American or European soldiers.</P>
      <P>There is no escaping the harsh fact that, if no other mine were planted or manufactured, children not yet born will be killed for years to come by those already in the ground.  The harsh statistic is that one mine exists for every 50 people on this earth or one for every 20 children.  In some countries, there are more than one for every citizen.  A recent &ldquo;Ban Landmines, Now!&rdquo; exhibition, organised by Mr. Tony D'Costa and Pax Christi in Dublin graphically brought home the horrifying reality that in Cambodia, for example, while there are 9.3 million people it is estimated that 10 million or more landmines are hidden in the ground.  One of every 256 persons has at least one limb amputated.  Cambodia is also home to between 35,000 and 40,000 mine victims and in excess of 300 mine accidents occur every month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Landmines savagely ensure that the <Col N="279" /> massacre of the innocent continues decades after peace agreements have been signed.  Mines planted during World War II are still killing people today and, as technology becomes more sophisticated, the mines of today can detect body heat, footstep patterns and other signals which can cause them to explode.  In some countries landmines have become one of the biggest obstacles to development.  Mines destroy the fabric and infrastructure of a society. Economic reconstruction, the return and rehabilitation of refugees, resettlement of internally displaced people and post-conflict redevelopment of a society become impossible.</P>
    <P>Landmines cripple economies as well as individuals.  Denying access to land severely affects food production thus causing malnutritution and starvation. They maim or kill the workforces upon which rural economies depend to sustain themselves.  In many parts of the world, landmines affect every aspect of the lives of the people because they are planted everywhere &mdash; in large tracts of agricultural land, dams, river banks, forests, electrical installations, transportation systems, roads, footpaths and entrances to places of worship.</P>
    <P>Demining is a laborious, dangerous and expensive operation which involves searching the ground inch by inch.  The United Nations standard of demining is 99.9 per cent clearance and restoration of the ground to pre-war conditions. The impact on any society is the same whether there are 100 mines in a field or over 1,000.  When there is a mine accident, the land suddenly becomes an object of terror for those dependent on it.</P>
    <P>In 1993 approximately 10,000 mines were removed at a cost of $70 million. During the same period, however, between two to five million mines were laid.  A mine can be as cheap as $3 to manufacture.  However, removing the same mine could cost anywhere between $300 and $1,000.  To remove the mines already in the ground throughout the world would cost, at a <Col N="280" /> minimum, $33 billion and would take hundreds of years.  The total money pledged and received, including £100,000 from the Irish Government, at the United Nations conference on demining held in Geneva in July 1995 came to 20 cents per mine instead of a minimum of $300.</P>
    <P>Mines are designed to kill and maim able-bodied soldiers.  In reality, however, the main victims are civilians. According to a study conducted by a Polish institute, the death rate among children for mine accidents is as high as 80 per cent.  Small children are more susceptible to mine blasts.  Damage to vital organs, loss of blood and lack or absence of medical facilities contribute to or are often the cause of death.  It may offend sensitive ears, but the limbs of children have been found 30 metres from the site of a mine explosion. According to the Compassion Centre, a Russian non-governmental organisation, between December 1994 and February 1995 children accounted for less than 5 per cent of all casualties in Chechnya yet, following the outbreak of conflict, this figure rose to 40 per cent within the three subsequent months, an increase attributed solely to landmines.</P>
    <P>Landmines used to be considered an indispensable weapon for the military. However, opinions are changing in military circles.  There is a growing understanding and opinion among military personnel that landmines should be banned.  The <i>New York Times</i> reported, on St. Patrick's Day this year, that General John Shalikashvili, the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has ordered a review of the US military's policy with regard to the use of land-mines.  Timothy Connolly, the former US principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for special operations, stated:</P>
    <P>Landmines should be put in the category of chemical weapons.  Even though they have military utility, chemical weapons have been banned because of their devastating consequences to soldiers and civilians.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> Some day, and that day has to be sooner rather than later, we are going to reach the same conclusion about anti-personnel landmines.</P>
    <P>General Norman Schwartzkopf, who we remember from the Gulf War, said he wished to see landmines &ldquo;forever eliminated from warfare&rdquo;.  This was based on his personal experiences of &ldquo;having seen hundreds of my troops killed or maimed by them&rdquo; as well as being &ldquo;keenly aware of the devastating effects&rdquo; of landmines on civilians.</P>
    <P>A recent publication of the International Committee of the Red Cross, entitled &ldquo;Anti-personnel Landmines, Friend or Foe?&rdquo;, a document which was recently launched in Ireland by the Irish Red Cross, discusses the military uses and effectiveness of anti-personnel landmines.  High ranking military personnel from North America, Europe, Asia and Africa participated in the international study.  Out of the 26 conflicts considered in the study, &ldquo;no case was found in which the use of anti-personnel mines played a major role in determining the outcome of a conflict. At best, these weapons had a marginal tactical value under certain specific but demanding conditions ...&rdquo;.  At the launch in Dublin, the chairman of the Irish Red Cross, Ms Una McGurk, stated that &ldquo;anti-personnel landmines are serial killers and Governments which support... mine manufacturers in their countries are exporting death. Governments who profit through taxes from this business are handling blood money&rdquo;.  She went on to say that the society &ldquo;hopes that, on foot of this study, governments and military commanders will now be persuaded to support a prohibition.  This is a matter of life and death for thousands of innocent people around the world&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General of the UN has persistently called for a total ban.  Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has stated that &ldquo;anti-personnel landmines are ... real weapons of mass destruction.  This method of mass destruction is both perverse and insidious since it blindly <Col N="282" /> strikes at civilian populations ... we must eliminate landmines once and for all.  We must ban their use.  We must ban their production.  We must destroy those that are stockpiled.  The Convention on Chemical Weapons, signed in Paris in January 1993, clearly indicates the path we must follow&rdquo;.  At the end of the recent Geneva Conference, the Secretary General expressed his disappointment at its outcome.</P>
    <P>There are two sources of international law which are supposed to regulate the use of anti-personnel land-mines, as outlined in International Humanitarian Law, ICRC, Chapter VII, &ldquo;Mines &amp; the Law&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>... Parties to a conflict must always distinguish between civilians and combatants.  Civilians may not be directly attacked and indiscriminate attacks and the use of indiscriminate weapons are prohibited.</P>
    <P>... It is prohibited to use weapons which cause unnecessary suffering. Therefore, the use of weapons whose damaging effects are disproportionate to their military purpose is prohibited.</P>
    <P>These rules have become part of customary international law and thus apply to all states irrespective of their treaty obligations.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Inhumane Weapons Convention, a convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects, was adopted in 1980.  It applies to states parties which ratified the convention. Ireland did so in March of last year.</P>
    <P>Some provisions of the UN Protocol include:</P>
    <P>... Mines may be directed only at military objectives, indiscriminate use is prohibited and all feasible precautions must be taken to protect civilians ... Records must be kept of the location of pre-planned minefields, and the parties to a conflict are also to keep records on other minefields laid during hostilities ... At the end <Col N="283" /> of hostilities, the parties are to try to agree, either among themselves or with other states or organisations, to take the necessary measures to clear minefields.</P>
    <P>According to Article 38 (1) of the Convention on The Rights of the Child, &ldquo;....  Parties must undertake to respect and to ensure respect for rules of international humanitarian law applicable to them in armed conflicts which are relevant to the child&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We might have international laws and conventions, but nobody knows where mines are being laid indiscriminately. The conflicts we see today are of a civil nature rather than being fought by uniformed soldiers and that means that even the existence of minefields, let alone the mapping of them, is unknown.</P>
    <P>International law, well meaning as it is, has failed.  This failure of international law to prevent civilian casualties caused by landmines reinforces the need for the total prohibition of the production, procurement, transfer, sale, repair, stockpiling, import and use of anti-personnel landmines, similar to the international ban on chemical and biological weapons.  I am seeking to achieve all party support for such an urgent prohibition.  Undoubtedly, there has been a rapid worldwide development of opinion for an international ban on landmines.  The number of countries calling for a total ban has grown from four in May 1994 to nearly 40 countries at present.  Belgium, a former mine producing country, imposed a unilateral ban on landmines on 2 March 1995.</P>
    <P>Why should there be a unilateral ban on landmines?  Considering recent developments, Ireland stands in an ideal position to take a leadership role in achieving the objective of a total ban in the international arena.  Non-governmental organisations, for example, Trócaire, Goal, Concern, Pax Christi, Earthwatch and Action Aid, have vigorously promoted a unilateral ban on anti-personnel landmines and have urged the Government to consider this seriously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> From time to time representatives of international non-governmental organisations have made the same request in their presentations at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, including Ms Jody Williams, the co-ordinator of the American International Campaign to Ban Landmines.  Many well-known organisations around the world have written letters to the leaders of all political parties in Ireland in support of this Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>
    <P>The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, representing over 500 organisations in 30 countries, has tirelessly promoted a unilateral ban.  The European Parliament has, on two occasions, called upon all members of the European Union to adopt national bans on anti-personnel mines.  Likewise, the International Committee of the Red Cross has urged all national Red Cross societies to work for national bans in their respective countries.  Following the recent Geneva review conference where 55 countries, including Ireland, adopted new rules on the use of landmines but ignored demands for an outright ban, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and the Red Cross described the new Protocol as &ldquo;woefully inadequate&rdquo;.  These organisations, along with countless others, have stated that the amended mines Protocol will not make a significant difference in stemming the global landmines crisis.</P>
    <P>The new Protocol has many loopholes.  It has ineffective mechanisms and its scope is too narrow.  Ironically, the failure of the review conference is counterbalanced by the increasing numbers of people and organisations throughout the world calling for a prohibition on landmines.  Unfortunately, their voices have not been heard.</P>
    <P>A unilateral ban could have a significant impact internationally in achieving the United Nations stated objective of &ldquo;total elimination of this category of weapons&rdquo;, an objective which mirrors our own position precisely.  A ban will make permanent Ireland's refusal to be associated with this particularly abhorrent weapon and it will associate Ireland <Col N="285" /> with other states which have renounced their use for themselves; Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, the Philippines and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Internationally, a comprehensive ban can only be achieved if individual countries take courageous steps unilaterally; ending the use of anti-personnel mines will clear the way for their legal prohibition.  Being a non-mine producing country with a unilateral ban, Ireland would strengthen its ability to influence the world towards a total ban.</P>
    <P>The cynics will perhaps say that this is an empty gesture.  The grandparents of the same cynics may have had much the same to say about Frank Aiken, a prime mover of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which was promoted despite Ireland's nuclear free status. Following in the footsteps of Frank Aiken, we stand in a unique position to help make our world landmine free.  We are providing a genuine response to the problem.  The very magnitude and intensity of the humanitarian tragedy caused by landmines requires every nation to have the moral courage to create, explore and seize every opportunity to promote and secure a total international ban as a matter of the utmost urgency.</P>
    <P>On various occasions, representatives of the Government have stated that as Ireland does not produce landmines and does not stockpile them, a unilateral ban would be irrelevant in the Irish context.  There is a high level of awareness among the general population in Ireland of the devastating effects of landmines in countries like Cambodia, Angola, Afghanistan and Mozambique.  This House would represent the wishes of our people in bringing forward a unilateral ban on landmines.  We must take a moral stand and we must support the victims of landmines.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this Fianna Fáil Bill, it is worth remembering that, as I outlined in our recent Foreign Affairs policy document <i>Our Place in the World,</i> for an island nation on the edge of mainland Europe with a relatively small population, Ireland's influence on <Col N="286" /> world affairs has been hugely disproportionate to its size.  Over the decades we have earned the world's respect for our values, culture, our clear statements on foreign policy and positions taken in relation to same.  Fianna Fáil believes that what we must do now is utilise our respected position to demonstrate the path which should be followed by world governments.  We believe that Ireland, especially in view of the forthcoming EU presidency, should not let the opportunity to deal effectively with the landmines issue fall from its grasp.</P>
    <P>In seeking support for this Private Members' Bill this evening, I recognise there may be room for improvement in its drafting.  For example, the question of the level of sanctions will have to be agreed on Committee Stage.  I hope we will be able to accept Second Stage and work on improving its drafting and other areas so that it will have all party support on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank once again the NGOs which are familiar through their work with this hugely important issue.  I thank them for their help, support and assistance in the preparation of this Bill and I call on the Tánaiste and the Government for all-party support for this non-controversial political measure which would have the support of our people as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill proposed by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ray Burke.  I am well aware that the Government has ratified the Convention on Inhumane Weapons but I was somewhat disappointed that there was little mention of landmines in the White Paper on Foreign Affairs.  There was but one and a half pages devoted to the subject in chapter 6 of the White Paper, which related to disarmament and arms control.  This issue should have been addressed in a more complete way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a policy document, <i>Our Place in the World,</i> Deputy Ray Burke gave much more prominence in a shorter <Col N="287" /> document to the whole question of land-mines.  He stated that an outright worldwide ban on the manufacture, sale, export and stockpiling of all types of anti-personnel landmines within three years should be a central objective of Irish foreign policy and I support that call.</P>
    <P>More than 100,000 million mines have been laid around the world, most of them in poor and developing countries. They claim at least 12,000 lives per year, up to 85 per cent of which are children, in countries such as Afghanistan, Cambodia and Angola.  Despite this two million mines per year are being planted while 100,000 mines are taken out of action each year.  Ireland should take the lead in this regard by introducing legislation to ban the manufacture and export of landmines, which is what we are proposing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have had numerous requests from many organisations, particularly the NGOs, to try to introduce legislation to ban anti-personnel landmines in particular.  Pax Christi has pressed strongly for the promotion of a unilateral ban on anti-personnel landmines and it hopes there will be Government support for this Bill.  Certainly, if we could achieve that, Ireland would be associated with the other states which have renounced the use of landmines, such as Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Philippines, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has described the problem of anti-personnel land-mines as a global crisis.  He stated that we must eliminate landmines once and for all, ban their use and production, and destroy those which are stockpiled. As a non-nuclear State, Ireland can be a prime mover as in the past with the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Ireland is in a unique position to help make the world mine-free.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the executive committee of Trócaire, Bishop Kirby, has launched a crusade to try to impose a ban on landmines.  He visited countries <Col N="288" /> such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Rwanda, where he saw the effects of landmines.  He has described land-mines &ldquo;as fighters that never miss, strike blindly and go on killing long after hostilities have ended.  In short, mines are the greatest violators of international humanitarian law; they are the most ruthless of terrorists&rdquo;.  That is a very accurate description of landmines.</P>
    <P>There are different types of landmine. Some are high-explosive anti-tank mines designed to destroy tanks and large vehicles while others are smaller anti-personnel mines designed specifically to kill or maim people.  Some of the latter can be set off by a child treading on a pressure switch or picking it up. These low cost plastic mines come in the shape of butterflies or toys and children are often their victims.</P>
    <P>Trócaire states that 45 countries have been involved in producing and exporting landmines.  Sadly, these include a number of Ireland's EU comember states, namely Italy, Sweden, Germany, Austria, France, the UK, Portugal and Spain.  I hope the issue can be taken up at EU level and pressure can be brought to bear on those countries. Other countries involved in the production and export of landmines include the USA, China, Egypt, the former Soviet Union, Iraq, Pakistan and the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>According to Trócaire, there are between 80 and 110 million landmines in the ground or one for every 50 people.  While it costs just $3 to buy certain types of landmines, the cost of removing them may be as high as $1,000.  Using the most conservative estimate, the total expenditure required to rid the world of landmines is in the region of $33 billion.  That is an indication of what is facing us.</P>
    <P>Most of these mines are located in developing countries with a total of 64 countries having recorded landmines. Countries with the highest concentration of landmines include Afghanistan and Cambodia.  In Africa, the countries most affected include Angola, Mozambique and Somalia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> Bishop Kirby's figures on Cambodia are shocking, particularly when he states that there is a landmine for every citizen.  Consequently, Cambodia has the highest percentage of landmine injuries in the world.  Let us consider it this way, one mine for every man, woman and child in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Last year, I understand UN funds for humanitarian aid totalled $2.5 billion and much of this was spent in 13 countries severely affected by mines.  The sum of $70 million was spent on clearing 100,000 mines while two million mines were planted simultaneously, which cost $1.4 billion to clear.  This is probably the most ironic situation of all.  While we are spending money to clear mines, more money is being spent planting new ones.</P>
    <P>Landmines are the biggest obstacle to development in a number of countries. Unless they are cleared and completely banned, there is no hope of socio-economic progress.  The Irish Government must continue its pressure within the EU to ban them and must provide the badly needed funding to remove them. In recent years, Irish aid has focused on countries such as Cambodia, and, to a lesser extent, Mozambique.</P>
    <P>The idea of the ban has been promoted by the NGOs, particularly Trócaire and Pax Christi, to which I pay tribute.  These organisations have stressed the need to press for the expansion in the scope of the convention to cover landmines used for internal conflicts, and 90 per cent of landmine victims are as a result of internal conflicts. A system for monitoring and verifying the convention must also be put in place.  It is most important that the convention be regularly reviewed and I hope this could be done every three to five years.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Burke's Bill and hope it will be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has aptly described anti-personnel landmines as &ldquo;weapons of mass destruction in slow motion&rdquo;.  In a strongly worded message of disappointment to the closing session of the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference last Friday, the Secretary General reiterated his view that the impact of these weapons is so appalling, so devastating, that a total ban on all anti-personnel landmines is the only solution.  That, the Secretary General said, must be the aim of the next review conference which is to be held in five years time.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the review process, Ireland has been in the forefront of countries advocating a comprehensive international ban on anti-personnel landmines.  We co-operated closely at the Conference with States Parties, both within and without the European Union, advocating a total ban.  Very regrettably, the support of many other countries for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines was not fully brought to bear on the negotiations, simply because they are not states parties to the convention.</P>
      <P>From what I have said so far this evening, as well as on previous occasions, the House will know that the Government shares the objectives of the Bill before us.  As is clearly stated in the White Paper on Foreign Policy, the Government is totally opposed to the indiscriminate nature, production, stockpiling, use and trade of anti-personnel landmines.  We have consistently pressed for this objective in every appropriate international forum available to us.  The devastating effects of landmines and their horrific humanitarian consequences make it imperative that we pursue with determination our efforts to obtain an international ban on landmines.  The position we seek to advance internationally reflects our domestic policy and practice, which I will set out in detail later in my statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> However, I must first address the Bill before the House.  For reasons which I will outline shortly, it is totally unnecessary.  More than that, it is appallingly badly drafted legislation, which could not be allowed to see the light of day in anything like its present form. This Bill is so poorly drafted that if it were passed unamended, it would have the effect of legalising the holding and use of land-mines by any armed force which called itself Irish.  In his attempt to exempt the Defence Forces, Deputy Burke has allowed in the version of the Bill before the House any Irish armed force to maintain land-mines for training purposes.</P>
    <P>If that kind of drafting was the only problem with the Bill, we could correct it easily enough, but the Bill goes further.  It seeks to impose an obligation on the Minister for Foreign Affairs which would be entirely outside my remit &mdash; to prohibit the manufacture of landmines.  However, the Bill fails to make landmines illegal in the jurisdiction.  It fails to create any offences or any penalties for breaches of the law.  It fails to give any powers to the police or the DPP in respect of the manufacture of landmines.  It does not even define a landmine properly.</P>
    <P>Ministers for Foreign Affairs for the future would be obliged by the Bill to prohibit something from happening in our jurisdiction which, nevertheless, would remain legal.  Ministers would be obliged to police this legal activity and impose some kind of invisible sanction on anyone carrying it out.  It is not now, and never has been, an appropriate function of a Government Minister to create criminal offences.  That is rightly the job of the Oireachtas and the purpose of Bills like this.  It is not a purpose that is likely to be achieved by scribbling down our first thoughts on the back of an envelope and calling it legislation.</P>
    <P>These are more than details.  New legislation to ban landmines would require careful work, and far more work than has been done here.  It would also <Col N="292" /> be work appropriate to the Department of Justice, which since the foundation of the State has had responsibility for controlling explosives.  It is also, as I said, unnecessary, not only because no one in Ireland manufactures or exports these evil weapons, but also because we already have a legislative framework in place which is more than adequate to ensure that the activities which the Bill proposes to prohibit never take place.  It consists of the Explosives Act, 1875, and the Control of Exports Acts, 1983.  I propose to deal with these separately.</P>
    <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875, the Minister for Justice regulates activities related to civilian explosives.  The production, stockpiling and importation of landmines are already subject to licence. There is no current licence to manufacture landmines in Ireland and it is understood that no such licence has ever been sought.  It seems clear that the Minister for Justice would also have power under the Explosives Act to refuse licences to procure or repair land-mines.  In our circumstances, because we do not manufacture landmines, procurement is the same as import.  Under section 43 of the Act, if considered necessary, the Minister for Justice is empowered to make regulations prohibiting the manufacture, keeping, importation, or sale of any explosive of a particularly dangerous character.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to tell the House that the Government has authorised the Minister for Justice to make an order under the Explosives Act, 1875, expressly banning the manufacture, keeping, importation and sale of land-mines.  This order will have precisely the same legal effects as is intended by the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The Control of Exports Act, 1983, permits the Minister for Tourism and Trade to make the export of goods other than agricultural or fishery products subject to a licence issued by him. The control of Exports Order, 1983, made the export of explosives, among other things, subject to licence.  The Department of Tourism and Trade, as the export licensing authority, upon <Col N="293" /> advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs, adheres to a policy of refusing any licence to export landmines.  An amendment of the 1983 order is currently under preparation in another context.  It has been agreed that the amended order, which will replace broad generic descriptions of military goods with a specific and detailed military list, will include landmines specifically, as well as other types of explosives.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are exempt from the provisions of the Explosives Act, 1875.  Any hindrance to procurement of anti-personnel landmines for this purpose could have a negative effect on the ability of the Defence Forces to discharge its responsibilities in international peace-keeping missions.  The House will agree that it is important to avoid any action which could have unintended negative effects in an area of Ireland's international engagement &mdash; peace-keeping &mdash; of which the country is justly proud.</P>
    <P>The Irish Defence Forces at present use anti-personnel landmines only for mine clearance training purposes, not for operational use.  Nevertheless, as a further indication of its serious commitment to the elimination of these weapons, the Government has requested the Minister for Defence to conduct an urgent policy review on the role of land-mines, especially anti-personnel land-mines, in its current policy and practice, with a view to renouncing for all time the operational use of anti-personnel landmines by the Defence Forces. I know that Members have views on some additional issues that might be included in such a review, and I look forward to hearing them.</P>
    <P>With these measures in place, Ireland, which has never manufactured land-mines, and which leads the international fight against them, can now say that we have put the legally binding measures in place to ensure that these weapons never emanate from here, and that they will never form a part of any military strategy we pursue.  We should perhaps also acknowledge that the <Col N="294" /> international campaign in this area is gathering momentum.  The amended Protocol on landmines to which I referred earlier, which was incorporated in the Inhumane Weapons Convention on 3 May does, in certain respects, represent an advance on the original 1980 instrument.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Protocol now extends to internal conflicts, where the most serious problems caused by the indiscriminate use of landmines have arisen.  The Protocol bans the use of non-detectable anti-personnel land-mines, thereby reversing the trend of recent decades towards non-detectable devices.  All anti-personnel landmines must have incorporated in them a material or device that enables the mine to be detected by commonly available technical mine detection equipment. This provision should greatly assist the essential mine clearance work that will need to be carried out after future conflicts.</P>
    <P>It includes new technical restrictions on long-lived mines.  While the reliability standards imposed on selfdestructing and self-deactivating anti-personnel landmines will not diminish the threat posed to civilians by remotely delivered anti-personnel landmines during conflicts, they will limit the duration of that threat.</P>
    <P>It affords stronger protection to UN peace-keeping missions, whose commanders will be entitled to receive from the parties to a conflict comprehensive information on mines and minefields which they have laid.  In view of Ireland's participation in numerous UN peace-keeping operations, I welcome these improvements.  More limited protections are granted to United Nations humanitarian and fact-finding missions and to missions of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  While inadequate, these represent a step in the right direction.  Importantly, it introduces a ban on the transfer of prohibited mines, with immediate effect, and generally restricts transfers to states which accept the constraints of the new instrument.  The amended Protocol <Col N="295" /> imposes an obligation on states to take penal sanctions against individuals who seriously violate its provisions.</P>
    <P>The final declaration of the conference records agreement that the next review conference should be convened in 2001 and that future review conferences should be held more frequently, with consideration to be given to holding a review conference every five years.  Overall, however, and despite these advances, the outcome of the review conference was deeply disappointing.  The impact of the practical steps I have just enumerated is seriously weakened by a profusion of qualification and exemptions which has justifiably provoked severe criticism of the amended Protocol.  It is particularly deplorable that the ban on non-detectable landmines may not take full effect immediately upon entry into force.</P>
    <P>Ireland and her EU partners argued strongly against such a delay during which no meaningful constraints with respect to detectability would apply. However, certain states parties which hold large stocks of non-detectable anti-personnel landmines, China foremost among them, insisted on the option of declaring they would defer compliance with the new rule for up to nine years after entry into force.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the agreement of all states parties, China and Russia included, that they will refrain from transferring non-detectable anti-personnel landmines pending entry into force, that is with immediate effect, is nevertheless important.  It is the one provision of the new Protocol which stands to bring immediate benefit in halting the further dissemination on non-complying mines.</P>
    <P>Despite widespread disappointment with the meagre results of the review conference, one positive effect was the undoubted impetus it gave to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. At the start of the review process, Ireland was one of only a handful of countries calling for an international ban on anti-personnel landmines.  On 30 <Col N="296" /> April 1996, the international campaign listed 34 states as calling for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel land-mines and this figure does not include all those which have made policy announcements on the matter to date. The House will wish to be aware of some of the more telling reverals of previous policy which this figure of 34 covers.</P>
    <P>Belgium, formerly a major producer, legislated to ban the production, use and export of anti-personnel landmines in January 1994.  This was supplemented last week by legislation on the destruction of stockpiles.  Canada announced on 17 January of this year that it declared comprehensive moratoria on the production, export and operational use of anti-personnel landmines.</P>
    <P>The Netherlands Minister for Defence announced on 15 March, following a through policy review, a decision to ban the use of anti-personnel landmines by the Netherlands' armed forces.  The Netherlands' armed forces are destroying all their anti-personnel landmines with the exception of a small number that will be kept in stock for research and training purposes.  The Netherlands subsequently extended its export moratorium to apply comprehensively to all recipients and announced it would also prohibit the production of anti-personnel landmines.</P>
    <P>In April, on the eve of the final session of the review conference, Germany announced its indefinite and unconditional renunciation of the use, stockpiling and procurement of anti-personnel landmines and the orderly destruction of all stocks held by its armed forces.  Germany had earlier extended indefinitely its moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines.  On 15 April, Australia announced a unilateral suspension of the operational use of anti-personnel landmines by the Australian defence forces, adding that Australia does not produce and will not export landmines and that existing stocks would be used for training and research purposes only.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom on 23 April <Col N="297" /> extended the scope of its export moratorium to prohibit the export of all anti-personnel landmines to all destinations and announced that the UK would work actively towards a total worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines.  On 3 May the UK made clear that the announced destruction of almost half its current sockpile would be without replacement. Remaining stocks will be used in the future only if Ministers, in exceptional circumstances, consider that no alternative exists to protect British troops.</P>
    <P>A total of around 50 countries &mdash; including many of the 34 countries which support a total ban on anti-personnel landmines &mdash; have either prohibited the export of anti-personnel landmines or operate moratoria on their export.  In time, such restraint on the side of most of the known major exporters of these weapons in the past is bound to reduce the glut of cheap anti-personnel landmines which gave rise to irresponsible use on an appalling scale in the past decade.</P>
    <P>Another review conference of this Convention will take place in five year's time.  By that date, according to the message of its Secretary General, the UN estimates that an additional 50,000 human beings will have been killed and a further 80,000 injured by landmines; and that between ten and 25 million more landmines will have been added to the 110 million already uncleared.</P>
    <P>There is no denying that the amended Protocol adopted on this occasion failed miserably to reflect the groundswell of public opinion throughout the world.  It failed the hundreds of thousands of mine victims.  The International Committee of the Red Cross had deeply regretted that, for the first time in a humanitarian law treaty, measures have been adopted which, instead of entirely prohibiting the use of an indiscriminate weapon, both permit its continued use and implicitly promote the use of new models which, in the view of the ICRC, will have virtually the same effects, at least in the short term.  This is a grave criticism indeed, coming as it does from an impeccable source and one which <Col N="298" /> enjoyed a special status throughout the negotiations.</P>
    <P>It behoves those who are the most disappointed to be the most determined.  A basis for future progress is in place, within the amended Protocol and without.  As I have indicated, attitudes towards anti-personnel landmines within the EU are evolving rapidly.</P>
    <P>During the period of the Irish Presidency, we will endeavour to pursue an enhanced and updated EU joint action on anti-personnel landmines.  An informal network of Governments and NGOs committed to working for a total ban is now developing.  In this context, the initiative taken by Canada to convene a meeting of supporters of a total ban in Ottawa in September is timely and most welcome.</P>
    <P>In summary, we are acting now, within the framework of laws already available, to place a legal ban for all time on the manufacture, use or export of these evil weapons.  The actions we are taking will be far more effective than tying up the resources of the Oireachtas in producing new and unnecessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the drafting of this Bill but I thank Deputy Burke and his party for bringing the subject before the House.  It has been useful and constructive in principle, and it has been effective in ensuring rapid Government action.  I hope he will agree that the mixture of Opposition initiative and considered Government response has produced the right result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that has been clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> In 1982, Reth, a 34 year old man, stepped on a mine and both his legs were rendered useless by the explosion. He was later found by a reconnaissance party whom he begged for an axe so he could cut of the dead weight of his legs. Left alone to die Reth managed to chop one leg and then dragged himself across the minefield.  When he regained consciousness in hospital both his legs had been amputated.  The patients on either side died within two days, which gave him more resolve to fight for his life.  He stayed in hospital for four months, being allowed only two aspirin a day to stem the pain.  Reth was repatriated to Cambodia from the Thai border camps in 1993.  Today he designs wheelchairs and is the happy father of six children.</P>
    <P>What we are discussing is far more tragic than any matter which could be raised at constituency level.  The figures are well known.  There are an estimated 500 victims of landmines a week, 80 per cent of whom are children, according to a Polish study.  There are between 80 and 110 million landmines contaminating 64 countries.  The cost of clearing all these is an estimated $33 billion, although it only cost $3 to buy a landmine.</P>
    <P>It is clear conventions have not been effective, although they have resulted in strong resolve and determined effort. The inhumane weapons convention, for example, has not put an end to land-mines.  We are beginning now to see unilateral actions from countries.  Belgium, in March 1995 voted unanimously for a ban.  On 2 April 1996 the Netherlands unanimously passed a resolution in favour of a ban in its parliament.  Norway has also unilaterally declared a legal ban.  Tonight Ireland has a chance to send a message to the world by its vote. It is important that message be clear. That is why I worry if the Government votes against this Bill, there will not be a clear message that the ban will be unilateral here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste has mentioned a number of resolutions and changes which are designed to <Col N="300" /> strengthen Ireland's position in favour of a ban.  However, NGOs, Governments and parliamentarians around the world involved in the same campaign would be helped all the more if the Dáil voted unilaterally on such a measure, as happened in Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway.  That is why it is important for us to achieve a unanimous vote on such a ban.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not perfect, a number of amendments have already been alluded to and I could think of more.  However, would it be possible to overlook the imperfection so that we could try to have a united front?  The legislation already in place &mdash; the 1875 Explosives Act and the 1983 Control of Exports Act &mdash; has the effect that we cannot impose a ban as long as the Government's views remain as they are.  It is a matter of policy rather than law when one has the discretion of granting a licence.  It could be stronger and we should try to establish that.  I realise there will be changes so we will wait and see.</P>
    <P>Amendments could be made to Deputy Burke's Bill and I would like that to happen.  We could perhaps change it quite radically on Committee Stage.  At least we should present a united front.</P>
    <P>I have already tabled amendments which I though might have been of use. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs is not the only Department that would be dealing with this matter so the Bill probably needs to be changed in that regard.  It needs to be changed so that the Army can continue to train in disarming and dismantling landmines.  As the Tánaiste mentioned, the penalties also need to be changed.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a precedent for adopting a unilateral position, and Deputy Burke referred to Frank Aiken.  The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention is another example where we tried to act unilaterally and it was welcome by all concerned.</P>
    <P>How many letters has the Department of Foreign Affairs received about this?  I have received dozens.  I would <Col N="301" /> like an answer to that question.  Replies should be sent to everyone who wrote letters so that they at least could have some message of peace in their hands. That would be all the stronger if it were as a result of a unanimous vote in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what the Tánaiste had to say and his approach is the correct one.  I am sure everyone in this House supports the objective of the Bill that Deputy Burke has introduced but, for the reasons stated, it is clearly unworkable.  I pointed this out some time ago to a delegation of organisations interested in this topic.  The Bill should have been withdrawn and replaced with one that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, sale or stockpiling of these appalling weapons.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why this Bill was introduced in its current terms because it does not create any offence and would be totally unworkable.  A Minister cannot prohibit something; it must be prohibited by legislation passed by the Oireachtas and cannot be done otherwise.  What the Tánaiste has said and what the Government proposes to do is adequate to cover the situation fully.</P>
      <P>To the best of my recollection the Firearms Act, 1971 includes provisions concerning explosives.  At the time we had many difficulties regarding explosives and various powers were introduced to compel manufacturers of explosives to number and colour them depending on where they were made and for what purpose.  Indelible dyes and such things were also to be used. Technology has moved on since then and what we used to call industrial explosives &mdash; which were the main cause of the problem in those days &mdash; do not seem to be used much anymore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Home-made explosives are now used which have a fertiliser base.  Semtex is also used and is far more dangerous than any industrial explosive.  Hopefully, semtex will not be replaced but we cannot do very much about home-made explosives.  At the time we banned the <Col N="302" /> more obvious forms of fertiliser.  Fertiliser now has to be mixed in a different way but it is impossible to prevent its use as an explosive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to make an order under the 1875 Act and an order under the 1983 Act which hopefully will cover the situation in full.  I did not know this was going to be announced and I did not have an opportunity to look at those Acts before coming into the House.  I will check them after the debate but, on the face of it, it seems that those powers are there.  The 1875 Act, as amended in 1971, would have powers to prohibit the use of specific explosives and this is clearly one of them.</P>
    <P>I share the Government's disappointment at the outcome of last week's conference in Geneva.  It seems extraordinary that countries meeting for the purpose of considering a weapon should fail to agree on anything meaningful. The main component of the Protocol is that they will meet again in five years' time to consider it further, but how many thousands will die and how many tens of thousands will be maimed in the meantime?  I find it hard to enthuse about something where the best that can be said of it is, as the Tánaiste mentioned, that it &ldquo;stands to bring immediate benefit in halting the further dissemination of non-complying mines&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In other words, there are such things as complying mines.  It will be perfectly legal for the next five years at least to disseminate what are called complying mines throughout the world without any hindrance.  How many thousands of people will be killed by complying mines?  These will apparently contain some form of metal to enable them to be detected by a conventional mine detector.  How is an unfortunate woman or child in Cambodia, Bosnia, Mozambique, Angola or other place afflicted with these accursed things to know that there is a bit of metal in the landmine they are about to walk on?  What difference does it make to them?</P>
    <P>They have no option but to walk on their land, around their village or to the <Col N="303" /> local well for water.  They either till their crops or they starve.  It is no consolation to say, as was stated at the recent Geneva conference, that any new mines will be complying ones.  Countries that are outraged by this, such as Ireland, should seek to have this conference reconvened much earlier than 2001. Canada is trying to do that in September in Ottawa and it should be given every support.  Hopefully, the conference will result in emergency action being taken to stop this.</P>
    <P>If no further land mines were laid down from this day forward, the world would still have a most awful problem in the four countries mentioned and to a lesser extent in other places.  Terrible suffering has been inflicted on the unfortunate people of Cambodia.  We are more familiar with Bosnia because it is part of Europe and nearer to us. That unhappy country is littered with not merely thousands but millions of these awful mines and it is appalling that it will still be lawful to lay them over the next five years.  China says it has large stockpiles and that since it is a big industry it must be facilitated.  It is unspeakable that others have agreed to that.  National delegations would have been better off to walk out of the Geneva conference rather than sign this.</P>

      <P>I do not know why the EU decided it would abide by this shameful Protocol.  The words of the International Committee of the Red Cross carry a great deal of weight and a large element of truth.  It regrets that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>for the first time in a humanitarian law, treaty measures have been adopted which, instead of entirely prohibiting the use of an indiscriminate weapon, both permit its continued use and implicitly promote the use of new models which, in the view <Col N="304" /> of the ICRC, will have virtually the same effect, at least in the short-term.</P>
    <P>That this should be the case in 1996 is deplorable.  In this matter, world nations think they must move at the speed of the slowest ship in the convoy, which is unacceptable.  Countries such as China and Russia want to drag their feet for their own commercial reasons but the rest of the world should not put up with it.  These weapons are every bit as damaging and indiscriminately dangerous to a civilian population as chemical weapons, which are universally banned.</P>
    <P>The awful feature of land mines is that they have no military usefulness or purpose.  Professional soldiers say they are of little value or import.  They are laid on a wide scale and 99.9 per cent of the casualties are civilians, most of whom are women, children and other totally defenceless people trying to go about their normal daily tasks.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency, I hope the Government encourages the EU to take a more active and concerned view of this awful problem than the one taken in Geneva in recent weeks, which was unsatisfactory and unacceptable. We have never had, used or made these mines and one hopes that, as a result of the two orders being made, we never will do so.  The only land mines we have here are a small number which are used to train soldiers in clearing mined areas.</P>
    <P>In that context, NGOs which are concerned with this problem say there is a huge need throughout the world for trained personnel to work in and clear mined areas.  The best such personnel are current, former or retired soldiers and the Irish Government could make a major contribution if it facilitated and encouraged our soldiers to volunteer for this, because no humanitarian work could be more valuable.</P>

      <P>It is disappointing that <Col N="305" /> technology advances so rapidly in the design and manufacture of these awful things but has not advanced at anything like the same pace in developing methods to get rid of them.  It would be marvellous if a laser beam or a similar electronic device could be developed to sweep an area, cause the mines to explode and render the area safe for the civilian population so that people do not have to go through it inch by inch.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that for a significant number of years to come it will be lawful to lay more of these mines.  They should be outlawed now by international agreement and our Government, when it has the EU Presidency, should seek to use the Ottawa conference in September to ensure that definite and concrete steps are taken to bring forward their total and permanent abolition.  Like the Tánaiste, I am glad Deputy Burke introduced this Bill, because if he had not the Government might not have taken these steps.  The Bill is defective but that is beside the point, because everyone in this House and in the country is united behind its purpose.  I hope the orders the Tánaiste referred to will be made without delay and publicised.  I hope it is made clear, both here and abroad, that making these orders under the relevant Acts has exactly the same effect as primary legislation, so that if we do not pass legislation we are no less determined than other countries which have done so.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for facilitating me.  Many people have expressed views about the horrific effect of land mines on innocent populations. Everyone has expressed horror at this during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, was excellent, but I congratulate Deputy <Col N="306" /> Ray Burke for introducing this Bill. Despite its flaws, he should be congratulated for raising this issue and for allowing us to debate it.  I welcome the Government's prompt and comprehensive response which accurately reflects the people's view on this issue.</P>
    <P>At present up to 100 million land-mines are scattered in conflict and former conflict zones throughout the world.  Landmines are the perfect killers in that they are indiscriminate and effective weapons which cost a few pence to manufacture, £1 to plant and hundreds of pounds to deactivate and remove. The random planting of landmines is the late 20th century's equivalent of the scorched earth policy used in the last century.  For years after a conflict has ended, agricultural workers and farmers must play Russian roulette each time they attempt to sow or harvest a crop. It is hard to imagine ploughing a field full of landmines, but it happens each day.</P>
    <P>Despite the horror of landmines, the international community has been remarkably slow to ban this lethal trade. The recent UN agreement reached in Geneva is a masterpiece of diplomatic fudging.  A comprehensive and immediate global ban on the production, trade, supply and use of landmines or their component parts seems as far away as ever.</P>
    <P>Apart from the welcome regulations we are now introducing, we must examine from whom we buy for our Defence Forces.  We must remove companies who manufacture goods, whether land-mines or their components, from any commercial competition in relation to supplying our Defence Forces.  We should use something which will hurt them most &mdash; money &mdash; and exclude them from any trade with this country. I agree with Deputy O'Malley who said that landmines should only be used in this country for training purposes.</P>
    <P>A fund is available for the deactivation of landmines throughout the world, but it is under-resourced.  We are not doing enough in this regard.  We must ensure the technology used for the <Col N="307" /> development of landmines is used to develop equipment which will sweep and clear areas of landmines.  I welcome the Minister's statement and I hope other countries will follow suit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to address the landmines issue with honesty, it is only with concerted international action and binding international treaties that we will eliminate the scourge of landmines.  The most significant advance in the anti-landmines campaign in recent weeks has been the call for a review of landmines policy by the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvilli.  While thousands die or are maimed by land-mines in the developing world, it is a sober fact that it was the tragic deaths of three British soldiers in a landmine explosion in Bosnia which forced the change of heart and caused the British Government and many of our EU partners to review their positions.</P>
      <P>When I attended the start of the review conference on the Inhumane Weapons Convention in Vienna in September 1995, I was one of only five Ministers calling for a total ban.  At the end of that review conference 23 countries supported a total ban.  While the outcome of that conference was very disappointing for us, nevertheless, the campaign has moved forward.  Ireland's leading and unequivocal position has been effective in giving pace and momentum to the movement for a total ban.  I intend to continue to take a leading position on the issue in every available international forum.</P>
      <P>As everyone knows, we do not manufacture landmines.  I have comprehensively examined the options available to us to ensure that no such manufacture occurs.  The current legislation ensures that manufacture and export cannot take place without a licence.  The Bill before us today, while well intentioned, does not provide any further safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The landmine campaign must be about effective legislation, not gesture <Col N="308" /> politics.  The package we are proposing, an order under the Explosives Act and a comprehensive policy review by the Department of Defence, will be much more effective and I ask the Opposition to accept that.  The Explosives Act provides a mechanism for enforcement which is totally absent from the Fianna Fáil Bill.  It can cover the manufacture of parts which, again, is not addressed in the Bill.  If we want to effectively prohibit the manufacture of landmines, such manufacture has to be a criminal offence.  The Bill creates no such offence and gives no role to the normal criminal process.  The Explosives Act mechanism provides for criminal procedures and sanctions.</P>
    <P>A legislative ban on the manufacture of landmines in Ireland is a small, but significant, step in the international anti-landmines campaign.  In conjunction with the relevant NGOs, I want to pursue this campaign in the context of the coherence of international aid policies and disarmament.</P>
    <P>We have the ridiculous situation at present where, for example, in Angola, considerable amounts of money are being donated towards demining while at the same time further mines are being planted.  We also have the situation where aid donors are effectively negativing their aid efforts by their policies on arms manufacturing.  As the developed countries are beginning to take a stand on landmines, if not on other arms manufacturing, the manufacture of landmines is moving towards the Third World.</P>
    <P>Our Presidency of the EU and the renegotiation of the Lomé Convention give us an opportunity, which I as Minister with responsibility for development intend to exploit, to ensure that there is some coherence between aid and armaments policy.  This is the greatest challenge facing policy makers on overseas aid.  I will be looking towards the NGO community for assistance in creating public awareness and political pressure to bring about this desirable coherence.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I commend Fianna Fáil's efforts in <Col N="309" /> introducing this Bill.  I ask it to accept that the package we put forward is a comprehensive response to a lot of detailed research and consideration on the best way to introduce a completely effective ban and on the review of the position of the Department of Defence on landmines.  That is important not only for our Army, but for armies throughout the world and I hope it will set a precendent.</P>

      <P>I would like to state my abhorrence of landmines.  I am disappointed that the point of the Bill has been missed.  Nobody in this House believes we will manufacture landmines but this is not the point at issue.  We need a simple Bill so that when we go to our international partners we can say &ldquo;this is what we have done, now you do the same&rdquo;.  I have no doubt that the Irish Army will not buy or lay land-mines tomorrow.  According to the Minister, we will say in international fora that we have made orders under the Explosives Act, 1875, and another Act instead of saying we have passed legislation and that other countries, beginning with EU members, should follow our lead.  I regret that the Government has not supported this Bill. This would have been a clear statement that we abhor the manufacture and use of landmines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ó Cuív and others who spoke in support of this Bill.  It is a matter of regret to me that the Government has missed the whole point of this Bill.  It is a clear statement of the moral stance of the Irish Government on an international ban on land-mines.  The Tánaiste stated that the Bill should not see the light of day in its present form.  He stated that it involved &ldquo;scribbling down our first thoughts on the back of an envelope and calling it legislation&rdquo;.  The preparation of the Bill involved us working with NGOs and their assistants.  They are not the type of people who scribble things on the backs of envelopes and the drafting of this Bill did not involve this.  In introducing the <Col N="310" /> Bill I recognised there was room for improvement in its drafting and that the level of sanctions would have to be agreed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>What is the Government going to do? The Tánaiste stated, &ldquo;During the period of the Irish Presidency, we will endeavour to pursue an enhanced and updated EU joint action on anti-personnel land-mines&rdquo;.  He will be in a wonderful position because he will be able to tell his colleagues in Europe that we have amended the Explosives Act, 1875, to expressly ban the manufacture of land-mines, that the Department of Tourism and Trade has amended an order relating to export licensing made under the Control of Exports Act, 1983, and that this amended order will replace broad generic descriptions of military goods with a specific and detailed list and will include landmines specifically, as well as other types of explosives.  This is riveting and I am sure the Tánaiste's colleagues in Europe will hang on his every word.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, stated that the landmine campaign is about effective legislation, not gesture politics.  It is not gesture politics when we are talking about the types and numbers of people involved.  I welcome the fact that these orders are to be made but why must they be dragged out of the Government by a Fianna Fáil Bill?</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste missed the whole point by stating, &ldquo;The actions we are taking will be far more effective than tying up the resources of the Oireachtas in producing new and unnecessary legislation&rdquo;.  It is totally necessary that we have a clear moral statement from the Irish people and Parliament that we are prohibiting anti-personnel landmines.  The Bill could be improved on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to a recent newspaper article, Deputy Kathleen Lynch of Democratic Left called on the Minister for Defence to ban the companies which make deadly landmines from supplying <Col N="311" /> the Defence Forces and to take a stand against landmines.  She said a ban would send a clear message that Ireland is not prepared to support the lethal trade in landmines.  We need a clear statement which represents the view of the Irish people on these horrendous weapons. There are over 110 million of them in the ground.  They are going into the ground at the rate of two million to five million a year.  Children not yet born will be killed by existing landmines.  We are failing as a world society to clear landmines and we are continuing to plant them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we have dragged some action from the Government on this issue.  However, it is relying on an 1875 Act and other legislation and on reviews in the Defence Forces instead of making a clear statement on behalf of the Irish people, who have been generous in their contributions to NGOs who work in many of the Third World countries in which these mines exist.  We need a clear statement from our Government and Parliament as to where the Irish people stand on this issue.  Instead, orders are to be made under legislation from another era.</P>
    <P>Why did the Tánaiste merely state, &ldquo;the initiative taken by Canada to convene a meeting of supporters of a total <Col N="312" /> ban in Ottawa in September is timely and most welcome&rdquo;?  What are the Government and the Irish EU Presidency going to do about this problem? Many of the landmines which are killing and maiming children around the world are manufactured in the EU.  We should persuade member states but we will not do so with orders under an 1875 Act.</P>
    <P>Last week debates were dragged out on a number of reports because there was no legislation put forward by the Government for the House to consider. Government Deputies were wheeled in to speak on important issues such as travellers on which they did not want to speak.  This primary legislation, which contains a clear moral statement on behalf of the Irish people, is being rejected by the Government.  It is making a major mistake.  By my own admission the Bill would need amendment on Committee Stage and this could and should be done.  Instead, we have a lost opportunity because the Government, for political reasons, refuses to accept a proposal, no matter what its merits are, which comes from the other side of the House.  It is as simple and rawly political as this.  It is a tragedy that the Government is so short-sighted on an issue which affects mankind to the extent that it does.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Environmental Health Officers' Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The environmental health officers, represented by the union IMPACT, are in dispute with the Department of Health.  The impasse dates from January of this year and is having a negative effect in the tourism and services sector.  All first applications for registration by Bord Fáilte of hotels, licensed restaurants, guest houses and cafés require prior sanction by the environental health officers under the <Col N="315" /> hygiene regulations.  People who are changing restaurants to licensed restaurants also require approval before they can be registered.  Due to the dispute the environmental health officers do not undertake this work.  Consequently, new businesses in the categories affected cannot operate legally, nor can they be registered in their appropriate categories.  This is having a devastating effect on the individuals concerned and many of them are in severe financial difficulties as a result.</P>
      <P>The dispute is detrimental to the maintenance of high standards in the delivery of services to tourists.  It would be a pity if unscrupulous operators were to benefit from it.  The fear has been expressed to me that some individuals may be able to seize this opportunity to gain registration by default and this must not be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>I understand some health boards have returned valid applications and fees to the applicants and advised them to resubmit them when the dispute has been settled.  This is most unfair to those who are seeking in good faith to comply with the regulations, particularly in view of the fact that an attempt is not being made to settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>The dispute is also creating difficulties for the operators of food stalls who need an annual licence.  Are some of these people operating without the required licence?  Since week end or late night inspections are not being carried out because of the dispute, there is a major question mark over the standards in this area.  Events which have outdoor catering and are of more than one day's duration also need a permit.  These have also fallen victim to the dispute.  Many outdoor events play an important economic role in communities and require outdoor catering facilities to operate effectively.  At this stage some of the major events are at an advanced stage of planning and the organisers need to be assured that potential hitches will be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environmental health officers have traditionally advised business <Col N="316" /> people in advance of making applications, yet this practice has ceased. Arising from the dispute, the environmental health officers are no longer checking private nursing homes.  This is a matter of grave concern and requires an urgent response from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The dispute arose this time last year when the officers declined to take on students to work with them for a time as part of their training.  This action was discontinued and restructuring talks began but collapsed late last year.  The union argued that officers' workload increased significantly since the last review in 1981, that the health boards are in receipt of a substantial income arising from their work and that this ought to be taken into account in determining their rate of remuneration.</P>
    <P>I am informed that an arbitrator found against the officers early in 1994. Many in this House would not be surprised at the outcome if they knew who adjudicated on the matter.  An attempt to break the logjam under option B of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> also appears to have failed.  I understand negotiations are not under way at present.  This is clearly the most serious aspect of a very important matter.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to take immediate action to end the dispute while there is still a reasonable level of co-operation.  The environmental health officers are currently co-operating in emergency situations.  This dispute has already adversely affected many people.  There is an onus on the Government to seek an early resolution and ensure that no further escalation occurs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A pay claim submitted by IMPACT on behalf of environmental health officers for a salary revision was processed through the standard industrial relations procedures and was the subject of two hearings by a board under the scheme for a National Joint Council and Arbitration Board for Local Government and Health Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> The arbitration board heard submissions from both parties on 31 January 1994.  The hearing continued on 18 February 1994 and the claim was considered by the board in private on the same date, following which the chairman issued his findings.</P>
    <P>The arbitration board rejected the basis on which the claim was made. Both the management and staff interests had opted to refer the matter to arbitration.  By convention, the decisions of the arbitration board are accepted by both sides.  However, IMPACT, on behalf of the environmental health officers, rejected the arbitration report and commenced industrial action in the spring of 1995.  The industrial action was eventually suspended following agreement to process the claim under clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>On entering these negotiations, management and union agreed a framework agenda which would form the basis for discussions.  As discussions progressed, it became clear that the broad range of issues raised by the staff side could not possibly be addressed within the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, which limits the pricing of any agreement reached to approximately 3 per cent.  Both management and staff were aware from the outset that they were obliged to negotiate within the confines of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The management side entered the negotiations in good faith but could not agree with the environmental health officers statement that they had a &ldquo;unique case&rdquo; as all health professions negotiating under clause 2 were limited to an award of approximately 3 per cent and, as the majority of these professions are represented by IMPACT, the scope of the negotiations was clear-cut from the outset.</P>
    <P>In the course of the negotiations, management tabled an offer which was rejected by the staff side as it failed to meet their aspirations as set out in their original pay claim, aspirations which far <Col N="318" /> exceeded the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> IMPACT, on behalf of environmental health officers, then withdrew from negotiations and opted to recommence their work to rule with effect from 15 January 1996.  The environmental health officers' work to rule involves non-cooperation with and non-implementation of legislation pertaining to a broad range of environmental health issues.</P>
    <P>The Special Restaurant Licence (Standards) Regulations, 1988 were made by the Minister for Tourism and Trade, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, under section 12 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 and are implemented by Bord Fáilte.  These regulations provide for the grant of a Bord Fáilte certificate to restaurants which comply with the requirements and standards set out in the regulations. The grant of such a certificate is a prerequisite for a restaurant to apply, through the courts, for a special restaurant licence under section 8 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  A restaurant owner, when making an application for a Bord Fáilte certificate, must furnish a wide range of documentary evidence in support of the application, including evidence under section 4 (2) (b), Part II of the 1988 regulations that the health board is satisfied that the provision of facilities for serving a full range of drinks in the restaurant would not interfere with the requirements of the Department of Health's Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950 to 1989.</P>
    <P>As a result of the ongoing work to rule by environmental health officers, health boards are not in a position to issue restaurant owners with the necessary documentary evidence required by Bord Fáilte relating to the Food Hygiene Regulations 1950 to 1989.  My Department, under the auspices of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, remains available for discussions at all times should IMPACT, on behalf of environmental health officers, wish to re-enter negotiations within the terms of <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his attendance.  For more than 20 years Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, County Meath has been recognised as the orthopaedic services centre for the North Eastern Health Board area.  The Minister is aware that its record of service is second to none.  It appears that there has been a change of policy, however, as the hospital has been waiting a year or more for the appointment of an orthopaedic surgeon to replace a retired person.  It also appears that there is an embargo against such an appointment. Will the Minister immediately investigate this urgent matter?  Four new consultants, including one orthopaedic surgeon, have been or are being appointed to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  One must assume that this represents a clear U-turn in policy as it means a division of services and a possible future winding down of the orthopaedic service at Navan hospital.</P>
      <P>The orthopaedic service at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan is well below its quota of surgical personnel at consultant level.  I am pleased with the new capital development in recent years at the hospital.  Regrettably, however, this has not been matched by increased orthopaedic surgical consultant personnel and staff.  It is obvious that there is concern among the existing professional staff with regard to the future policy for the development of the orthopaedic service at Navan hospital.  It appears that the North Eastern Health Board has not been fully advised in this regard.  The Minister should clarify this matter as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1992, the then Minister for Health, former Deputy O'Connell, informed me that the important orthopaedic role played by Our Lady's Hospital, Navan was greatly appreciated.  He assured me there was no question of weakening the hospital's services, particularly the orthopaedic service.  I appeal to the current Minister to give the same assurance to the consultants, staff and patients of the orthopaedic unit at Our Lady's <Col N="320" /> Hospital, Navan, that these services will remain as the sole orthopaedic service for the region.</P>
    <P>The advantages of having one unit based at Navan hospital include the fact that an experienced staff is already in place.  Six surgeons would work together on one site and a pooling of expertise, consultation and cross-referral would occur as a result.  The existence of one unit would also mean better value for money as there would be fewer consultant travelling expenses, etc., and it would be more cost effective to have one set of staff &mdash; consultants, nursing and junior doctors &mdash; on one site. Another advantage would be having one consultant on emergency call for the region, with a one in six rota meaning that no locum would be required. Other advantages include the fact that orthopaedic theatres and dedicated nursing staff are already in place and qualified junior staff would be attracted to one site.  Finally, more acute orthopaedic beds would be required in Navan hospital and hand/foot surgery could be encouraged at that centre.  This would lead to a strengthening of general surgery and medical back-up.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I recommend that the Minister keep the acute orthopaedic unit in Navan hospital with six consultants to lead the service.  The expertise of existing staff should be built upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy Hilliard for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position with regard to the provision of orthopaedic services in the North Eastern Health Board region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 the North Eastern Health Board adopted the policy outlined in the report <i>A New Direction for Acute Hospital Services.</i> Under this policy, hospitals in the area no longer act as individual units but have become component parts of a regional service.  In line with this policy, the board established two hospital groupings, the Cavan/Monaghan group and the Louth/Meath group.  Our Lady's <Col N="321" /> Hospital, Navan forms part of the Louth/Meath group.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision and development of services at individual hospitals is a matter for the health board in the first instance.  However, I am aware that the board is in the process of developing a comprehensive policy on orthopaedic and trauma services for the region.  The regional elective orthopaedic unit for the north east is based at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  The majority of elective orthopaedic patients within the region are treated at this unit and it provides a high quality service to the people of the north east. There are currently four orthopaedic surgeons working from the unit, one of whom is retired but continues to provide a service at the hospital.  In recent weeks my Department approved this replacement post and it is now a matter for the board to make an application for this post to Comhairle na nOspidéal, the statutory body charged with responsibility for the regulation of consultant appointments.  Applications for additional consultant orthopaedic posts have also been received in my Department from the board and they are being examined in the context of the board's overall policy for acute hospital service development.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will wish to know that in the past three years, the board has been successful in participating in an orthopaedic waiting list initiative which has significantly reduced the waiting list time for in-patient care.  A further initiative is planned for this year.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my Department's support for the board's policy for the development of acute hospital services.  Over the past two years my Department has made substantial capital and revenue funding available for this purpose.  In all, a total of 21 new and replacement consultant posts have been approved for the region, ten of whom are in respect of the Louth-Meath hospital group.  I am satisfied that this substantial investment by my Department will enable each of the board's hospitals to continue <Col N="322" /> to play a key role in the delivery of acute hospital services within the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a dramatic rise in the unemployment figures in the past year in the Dundalk area, especially in the most recent months.  I made a request for an Adjournment matter on this issue last week as a warning to the powers that be of the gathering storm clouds on the horizon in the area.  It is acknowledged by people that it is an unemployment blackspot.  The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues should give Dundalk the same attention given over the past number of months to places such as Tallaght because it is recognised that Dundalk has, proportionately, as bad a problem.</P>
      <P>The number on the live register in Dundalk increased by 10 per cent in the past year, the highest figure in the last decade.  At the end of 1994 the figure on the live register was approximately 4,260.  In mid-April this year it was 4,705, a rise of over 450.  This is not only against the national trend but also against the trend in Drogheda, the sister town in County Louth, where the figure has fallen from 4,650 to 4,495.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 50 per cent of this increase occurred in the last four months.  This happened for a number of reasons.  In the first instance, there is an ongoing dispute at AIBP in Ravensdale which I mentioned to the Minister some time ago when I raised other unemployment issues in the area with him.  The strike may escalate unless there is a dramatic intervention.  The matter is dragging through conciliation procedures and people who worked there do not even know if they are former employees; they are very unhappy with the manner in <Col N="323" /> which their dispute is being addressed. Second, community employment schemes under the aegis of FÁS have not been renewed.</P>
    <P>These are small aspects.  Of greater significance are the dramatic layoffs this year in two long standing industries in the town, Keytronic and Harris Ireland. These major developments led me and my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, to raise the matter after Christmas.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to adopt a hands on approach and to ensure that the State agencies in the area become directly involved in the creation of an emergency procedure whereby existing companies have an opportunity to avail of State resources to ensure that industries remain viable.  We have called for this many times in the past.  The Minister must accept that the figures are dramatic.  Some attention must be given to getting new industry into the area.  The situation needs dramatic attention, including a task force to address matters urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I lend weight to this issue.  For many, Dundalk symbolises a town that pulled itself up and decided to shake off the shackles of being an unemployment blackspot.  It did so, despite many difficulties, including currency problems.  Because of its own ingenuity and the hard work of various employees and firms, it brought itself up and began to present a far better employment picture.</P>
      <P>However, the current figures are startling.  A rise of over 10 per cent in a 12 months period, from April 1995 to April 1996, warrants a stringent and rigorous examination.  Apart from leaks from various firms, there needs to be a keen review of employment in Dundalk. I urge the Minister to give special attention to this area.</P>
      <P>The area does not want to slip back into a slough of unemployment.  None of us wants this to happen.  I am sad that Deputies from the area have to be here urging and willing the Minister to have this problem investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dermot Ahern for allowing me to express my concern on this issue.  I agree with his sentiments about the unacceptable unemployment figures in Dundalk.  However, it is not today or yesterday that Dundalk had such figures.  Over the last 25 years we have had double the national average, irrespective of what party was in Government. We were hung out to dry as a result of the Ulster troubles.</P>
      <P>In recent times, there has been a better dawn for Dundalk and the economic activity in the town has improved. Nevertheless, I cannot disagree with the concern expressed by Deputy Dermot Ahern and I join him in asking the Minister to address this tragic situation in respect of an area that has borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles without any recognition from Government over the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>The same concern and attention should be given to the area as was given to Galway, Cork and Tallaght in recent times.  The Border area has, unfortunately, borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles without any measures taken by any Government to counteract them.</P>
      <P>The only issue on which I disagree with Deputy Dermot Ahern is FÁS. Despite the figures, we continue to have a large incursion of people from the North still signing on in Dundalk.  It is very hard to get a fellow to do a day's work in Dundak and many of the FÁS schemes have difficulty in getting a full complement.</P>
      <P>The figures can vary from time to time.  In the last year the unemployment levels were also unacceptable, being double the national average.  I reject those figures.  Will the Minister pay full attention to the Border area, particularly to Dundalk which has 30,000 people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for raising this issue in the House.  As Minister, I am deeply concerned about unemployment.  I am, on behalf of the <Col N="325" /> Government, vigorously pursuing a multi-faceted range of policies to address the scourge of unemployment. My Department's mission is to promote employment and we are doing this urgent task by encouraging enterprise, ensuring competitiveness, securing an educated and skilled workforce, tackling exclusion from the labour market, promoting a fair and efficient employment regulatory environment and implementing an effective business regulatory system.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of unemployment in Dundalk.  My concern is shared by all Deputies in the constituency and Deputy McGahon keeps me in touch with the local situation.  Despite the unprecedented job creation performance, with 60,000 new jobs created since this Government came into office, the number of people on the live register in Dundalk was 4,650 at the end of March this year.  This, unfortunately, represents an increase of over 400 on the corresponding month in 1995.</P>
      <P>There is a range of responses to the serious problems of unemployment in Dundalk.  A local employment service is now well on its way to being established in Dundalk.  As I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions, this is a new service being developed in the country's 14 worst unemployment blackspots.  This service is designed to provide a comprehensive and personalised service for unemployed people, particularly those who are long-term unemployed and in danger of becoming margnalised.  It will provide a pathway for unemployed people to access the full range of employment options and is capable of offering a specialised career planning service, including guidance, counselling, access to training and placement in employment.  I am confident that the new local employment service, together with the innovative range of measures announced in this year's budget, will have a considerable impact on improving the employment prospects of those currently out of work in the Dundalk area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputies that the industrial <Col N="326" /> development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are active in promoting indigenous and foreign direct investment in the Dundalk area. Officials from my Department, acting directly or on my behalf, are in constant touch with these agencies about employment in Dundalk.  I want to see more investment by enterprise in the town which is fortunate to have a developed industrial estate with a good surrounding infrastructure in terms of roads, telecommunications and access to sea ports and airports.</P>
    <P>The north-east region has a significant base of high technology companies which is a key factor in attracting overseas investors.  There is an impressive array of over 40 overseas companies in County Louth, including Quantum, ABB, AFL Strible and National Pen.  In addition, there was the announcement last November that American Power Conversion Corporation, APC, is to locate its uninterruptable power supplies project in Drogheda.  This will result in £14 million investment and the employment of 300 people at full production.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a number of companies in Dundalk have experienced difficulties and we dealt with these in the House previously.  I assure the Deputy and the House that IDA Ireland is keeping in close touch with them and doing everything possible to assist them and to promote further investment in the town.</P>
    <P>As regards indigenous industry.  Forbairt, through its north-east regional office, continues to actively promote the area for industrial development.  During my visit to Boston with Forbairt officers last November I announced three specific business partnerships between Irish and US companies, including one between Creative Media Training Services in Drogheda and Paradigm Ink of Florida.  Forbairt is also working with Dundalk Regional Technical College in seeking to source potential technology based start-up companies.  In addition, I draw Deputies' attention to the recent opening of Potato Cuisine Limited in <Col N="327" /> Drogheda which will create over 60 jobs.  I assure Deputies that both IDA Ireland and Forbairt will continue to build on the developments in Dundalk and County Louth in general which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>This is a serious matter for farmers.  The scale of the problem is highlighted in a letter from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Farm Development Service under the heading, "Scheme for the Control of Farm Pollution&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
      <P>I am to refer to your approval for aid under the above Scheme and your notification of completion.</P>
      <P>The works have now been inspected and are deemed to be satisfactorily completed.  I am to advise you that in line with the Letter of Approval issued to you on 28/11/95 the claim will be processed for payment in early 1997.</P>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory and unacceptable that a claim will not be processed until 1997, although a letter of approval was sent on 28 November 1995.  This is a good scheme, although it is expensive for farmers.  However, its costings have not kept in line with the cost of materials or inflation.  It is two years since the costings were upgraded and this shows the Government's lack of credibility and integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government states nationally and internationally that our food products are produced on Irish farms under the most hygienic conditions and there is quality control from the farm to the factory and to the consumer.  How can the Government say that, while refusing <Col N="328" /> to pay farmers who upgrade their facilities, install the best equipment and build slatted floors and housing?  These people are told that if they wait for two years, their applications will be processed for payment.  If we want a chain of excellence from the farm to the consumer, then I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, to pay the farmers who have spent this money to improve their holdings.</P>
    <P>Several months ago a charter of rights was published.  Its implementation will cost tens of thousands of pounds and we were told there would be great improvements.  This document does not have a shred of credibility now.  The payment schedules listed show that the maximum time between lodgement of valid applications &mdash; that is, when works are completed &mdash; and payment under the control of farmyard pollution scheme was two months.  How does two months compare with two years?  This is a scandal.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to ensure that farmers who have worked to improve the standard of their farms for the production of good Irish food are paid on time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has failed to come into the House this evening to answer this important Adjournment matter.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is a capable man and I admire him for his work in rural development. However, it is serious when the Minister abdicates his responsibility, because the buck stops with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a stop go policy about agriculture.  This Government came like a thunderstorm and published a charter of rights for agriculture.  The Minister recently borrowed a man from the farm centre to work for him.  The control of farmyard pollution scheme is important. Jobs have been completed and inspected but farmers do not know when they will be paid.  Many farmers borrowed heavily on the strength of <Col N="329" /> receiving the grant.  They now have accumulated borrowings and are under pressure from bank managers because no money is coming forward.  The people concerned deserve the grant.</P>
    <P>County councils will put increased pressure on farmers as we approach the silage season.  The forecast is for dry weather and usually during such a spell of weather there is heavy pollution of our streams and rivers.  Farmers are, by and large, environmentally friendly; they do not like to interfere with nature but what can they do?  They are not getting co-operation or leadership from the Department despite the ballyhoo about the charter of rights for farmers.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to examine the matter and refer it to the Minister.  He will probably have to talk to Proinsias De Rossa who appears to be the leader of the country and has a major influence on Fine Gael, a party that was supposed to represent farmers and agriculture.  Deputy De Rossa runs the show and the money that rightly belongs to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the farming community is being transferred to other areas.  This grant aid must be brought forward and, instead of cases being processed in 1997, they should be processed this year.  The Department should also ensure that the moneys are paid to these deserving applicants.</P>
    <P>There are many such farmers in north Kerry, the Minister of State's constituency.  He is aware that the average farm in that area is quite small and the farmers cannot afford to be at the loss of such sums of money.  There are enough pressures on families in this day and age without additional pressure from a bank manager.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be in the House to present the bad news as well as the good news.  He has become an image Minister.</P>

      <P>I agree that the money was transferred to other schemes.  However, <Col N="330" /> it was transferred before this Government came to power and followed the revision of funds under the first programme.  As a consequence of the shrinking billions in the Cohesion Fund, this programme was underfunded.</P>
      <P>The scheme for the control of farm pollution was launched in September 1994 and, due to the extremely high level of demand compared with the funding provided, it was necessary to suspend the acceptance of new applications on 27 April 1995.  A precedent had been set by the previous Minister when he suspended the FIP scheme in December 1994.  There was inadequate funding to meet commitments to applicants under the scheme on an annual basis.  Since then, the agreement of the Government has been given to the provision of adequate funding to meet the demand from existing applicants.</P>
      <P>In May 1995 new procedures were introduced which enabled my officials to process the outstanding applications while recognising the budgetary provisions inherited from the previous Government.  To deal with the unapproved applications, approvals were issued on the basis that payment would be guaranteed but deferred until funds became available.  This was made clear to all applicants.  In these circumstances, approvals issued from that date were on the basis that payment would be made in 1997.  To date, some 85 approvals representing a grant commitment of about £700,000 have been completed and lodged for payment.  These people were glad to be given approval even if payments were deferred.  The works concerned have been inspected and the claims are being lodged in order of receipt for payment in 1997.  The applicants concerned who were advised of the process at the time of the approval are being informed again in writing of the procedure in respect of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1995 my Department introduced revised processing procedures to enable officials process outstanding applications.  Under these procedures applicants are requested to forward drawings showing existing and <Col N="331" /> proposed buildings.  Where appropriate, applicants are required to get planning permission or the consent of neighbours for the proposed developments.  These must be submitted with the drawings. To facilitate dealing with these applicants in a fair and equitable manner they are asked to complete this exercise within six months.  At this stage, all 18,500 applicants under the scheme have been contacted and the funding necessary to meet the claims will be provided over the period of the operational programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> Up to 3 May 1996, a total of £38 million was paid to some 4,700 applicants who completed work to the Department's specification.  In addition, a further 75 claims, representing a grant commitment of £618,000, are being processed for payment.  I expect these payments will issue in the coming weeks. There is no delay in the issue of payments in respect of claims where the approved works are completed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 May 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 18 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Business and Employer Confederation, IBEC, music industry group report <i>Striking the Right Note</i> makes recommendations in relation to the music industry.  In addition, Deputies will be aware that in May 1995 the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht established a special task force on the music industry, FORTE, to examine the scale and structure of the industry so as to identify any factors that may be inhibiting its further development and measures that could accelerate its expansion.  FORTE's report is due to be submitted shortly and, taking account of both reports, it will then be possible to consider their recommendations and decide on any initiatives that might serve to further the development of the music industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> The IBEC report recommends that a specially designated body or music board should be established to provide a focus for future initiatives in the music area.  I understand that FORTE has also been considering the merits of this possibility and will be discussing it in its final report.  Until its report has been received and studied, I am not in a position to say whether such a board would be of assistance to the overall strategy of ensuring that all the cultural industries are developed to their maximum potential.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has already been able to respond to some of the recommendations in the IBEC report and the interim report from FORTE on the subject of taxation.  The 1996 Finance Bill proposes that, effective from 6 April 1996, the BES tax incentive be extended to investment in the production, publication, marketing and promotion of new artists' studio recordings and associated videos, subject to a detailed certification process.  Draft guidelines for the implementation of the scheme have been drawn up and are being discussed with the Minister for Finance.  These discussions are at an advanced stage and the guidelines should be available in the near future.  The extension of the BES to the music industry will help increase investment in the area of new and emerging talent &mdash; the lifeblood of the industry.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ballraíocht FORTE.  Táim sásta go bhfuil trasghearradh daoine i gceist a bhfuil sé de chumas iontu labhairt le heolas agus le taithí faoi ghnéithe uile an tionscail cheoil.  Is féidir liom a dhearbhú go bhfuilim ag súil leis go mbeidh na moltaí a thiocfaidh ó FORTE ábhartha agus oiriúnach d'fhonn na saghasanna ceoil uile atá mar chuid den tionscal ceoil in Éirinn &mdash; ceol traidisiúnta ina measc &mdash; a fhorbairt tuilleadh.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua gur lorgaigh FORTE aighneachtaí ó na páirtithe leasmhara uile trí fhógraí a chuir i <i>Anois, Saol, LÁ, <Col N="72" /> The Irish News, The Belfast Telegraph, Hot Press</i> agus sna nuachtáin náisiúnta le linn dá scrúdú a bheith ar siúl acu.</P>

While local authorities are exempt from this provision, I am arranging for the National Parks and Wildlife Service to re-issue a letter to all local authorities drawing their attention to the potential damage caused to nesting birds by hedge cutting and requesting them to refrain from this activity in so far as possible during the breeding season.</P>

      <P>There is strict protection for wildlife habitats in areas owned or under the control of my Department e.g. national parks, nature reserves and refuges for fauna.  In relation to private lands, section 18 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, provides the facility to draw up management agreements with land owners.  This ensures that the land will be managed so as not to harm wildlife. Under section 39 of the Act it is an offence to burn vegetation growing within one mile of a wood which is not the property of such persons, or of a nature reserve or refuge for fauna. Under section 40 of the Act it is an offence to destroy, by burning or otherwise, between 15 April and 31 August vegetation growing on any land not being cultivated for agriculture or forestry.</P>
      <P>Special protection areas &mdash; SPAs &mdash; designated under the Birds Directive provide for the protection of the habitats of bird species and for the prevention of excessive disturbance of the species in these areas.  It is Government and EU policy to grant-aid only developments as are compatible with protecting the environment.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service &mdash; NPWS &mdash; advises grant-aiding bodies as to whether or not particular developments are compatible with protecting the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the rural environment protection scheme, implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, farmers are paid to farm their land in an environmentally friendly way. They receive a top up on the basic payment if they have land in a proposed Natural Heritage Area and if they manage it according to NPWS prescriptions. Planning authorities have been asked to inform the NPWS of any development which requires planning permission likely to have a significant negative <Col N="78" /> impact on proposed NHAs and to provide the NPWS with an opportunity to make submissions or submit reports on such developments.</P>
    <P>To further protect important natural habitats a Bill to amend the Wildlife Act, 1976, is being prepared and the EU Habitats Directive will be transposed into Irish law in the coming months.  In accordance with the directive natural habitat types of European Community interest, including certain types of wetlands, will be proposed for designation as special areas of conservation.</P>

      <P>The EU Structural Fund allocation for national parks and nature reserves comes to £6.65 million.

      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples, under social assistance schemes, is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare, it appears that the Supreme Court held in the Hyland case in 1989 that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provision to treat a married couple living together less favourably than a (unmarried) cohabiting couple.  This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>In relation to taxation, there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance (and double rate bands) is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances.  The Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems has been looking at, <i>inter alia,</i> the position of cohabiting couples generally.  The group will be reporting shortly, and I will carefully consider the group's recommendations.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the reference in the Deputy's question to section 79 of the Consolidation Act, 1967 is intended to mean section 72 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 which deals with capital allowances in partnership cases.</P>
      <P>The entitlement to capital allowances would depend on the circumstances of the particular case.  In general, the skipper/owner is the person who incurred the expense of acquisition of the vessel.  In such circumstances the other fishermen in the venture would have no entitlement to any capital allowances arising.  However, there may, in certain circumstances be an entitlement to capital allowances where, for example, the vessel was acquired by the partnership rather than by one member of it.</P>
      <P>If there is any particular case about which the Deputy has a concern she should pass the relevant details on to the Revenue Commissioners at Dublin Castle where the matter will receive immediate attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission established a fund of 30 million ecu (approximately <Col N="88" /> £IR24 million) under Council Regulation 3904/92 on measures to adapt the profession of customs agent to the internal market, to provide assistance to Irish customs clearance firms with diversification plans, principally by way of training and retraining measures.  Apart from this scheme there was no provision for compensatory payments as such to the customs clearance agents in Ireland when customs clearance was abolished.</P>
      <P>Under the regulation, Community assistance was to be provided for the following measures: management of the conversion or restructuring of companies, in particular by market studies and research; technology transfer, including the collection and dissemination of information, and innovation within companies; assistance in the creation or maintenance of long-term employment; and vocational training for employees and any measures to facilitate such training.</P>
      <P>Ireland was allocated 526,038 ecus (IR£420,830) from the fund on the basis of the number of jobs threatened here as a percentage of the EU total.  As the financing was to be provided under the European Social Fund, the scheme was managed by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>The European Council regulation establishing the scheme required member states to consult relevant professional and social interest groups before submitting applications for aid to Brussels.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment provided details of the scheme to the following representative organisations: The Association of Customs Clearance Agents of Rosslare; The Irish Customs Clearance Agents' Association; The Irish Ship Agents' Association; The Border Customs Clearance Association; and The Institute of Freight Forwarders in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Applications for retraining programmes were to be submitted to FÁS; applications for business diversification projects were to be submitted directly to the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Twelve applications for funding were received from customs clearance agents. These applications plus the FÁS application, totalling 13 applications, were forwarded to the European Commission and were approved for funding before the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>The customs clearance agents' programme was originally scheduled to run from 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1994.  It was subsequently extended for one year to 31 December 1995.  Ireland's full allocation was expended before 31 December 1994 and a final claim, setting out the final expenditure position on each of the 13 approved projects, was submitted to the European Commission on 19 May 1995.</P>
    <P>No further EU funding is available specifically for former customs clearance agents.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the deployment of the various units of the Customs National Drugs Team (CNDT) throughout the <Col N="90" /> country is designed to afford the best possible protection in the fight against the illegal importation of drugs.  Apart from the specialist staff of that team, the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff are responsible, as part of their normal duties, for combating drug smuggling.  In this regard, a total of 54 full-time Customs and Excise staff are currently serving in Counties Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that there is no intelligence available at present to indicate that there is smuggling of illegal drugs into these counties from Northern Ireland and no units of the CNDT are based in the area.  Should the need arise, however, local Customs staff may call on the assistance of units from Dublin.</P>
      <P>The deployment of units of the CNDT is, of course, kept under review in the light of experience.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons in the public service are being granted redundancy/early retirement packages in circumstances in which they are free to seek employment in other public sector agencies; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that some transactions could be effected far more economically by secondment or transfer; his policy regarding persons retiring early from the State service who become reengaged in other State-funded agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>A person who availed of a voluntary redundancy or early retirement scheme from a private sector organisation would clearly be free to seek employment subsequent to such redundancy or retirement.  Such freedom also applies to public sector employees in a similar <Col N="92" /> situation, and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with this freedom.  Moreover, given the size and number of State agencies, it would not be surprising that instances arise in which persons let go by one agency might subsequently be re-employed in another.</P>
      <P>It would not of course be acceptable that a person who was granted early retirement terms, including pension benefits, should be re-employed in the same organisation and continue to receive pension benefits from that organisation.  While it is not inconceivable that a person might at a later stage successfully gain employment with the same agency or within the same area of the public service from which he or she had previously been made redundant, pension benefits in payment would immediately cease on such re-employment.  Any lump-sum benefits received at the time of initial redundancy would be taken into account at the time of eventual retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Redeployment is one of the options to be considered when the question of <Col N="93" /> redundancies arise in the public service and is brought to attention.  It is clearly necessary, however, to locate areas which might have the capacity to absorb those threatened with redundancy and that their skills and expertise profile should match requirements in those areas.  This, unfortunately, is not always the case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935 any person who sells or delivers petrol or diesel fuel for use for combustion in the engine of a motor vehicle is required to obtain an excise licence.  The number of such licences issued in 1995 was 2,565.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 July 1994, applicants for these licences were required to obtain a tax clearance certificate as a precondition for the grant of a licence. Traders who persist in trading without the necessary licence are liable to prosecution and since the introduction of tax clearance 19 traders have been convicted in the District Court for unlicensed trading.  Court hearings are pending in another 56 cases.</P>
      <P>The Customs and Excise staff continue to carry out regular checks to detect unlicensed trading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied that the most effective means of providing a customs service in the Bantry Bay-Beara Peninsula area is to have staff centralised in and operating from Bantry, and deployed on a flexible basis to various locations, including Castletownbere, as required, to meeting the needs of the work.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners recognise that because of the large concentration of fishing vessels in Castletownbere at certain times of the year, the full-time assignment of an officer of Customs and Excise during the peak period is warranted.  Full-time attendance has, in fact, been given since March and will continue for the peak fishing period.</P>
      <P>Outside the peak fishing period, the Commissioners cannot accept that a sufficient volume of work exists to justify the full-time attendance of an officer of Customs and Excise.  In the off-peak season, therefore, the best means of providing a customs service is, as already stated, by the flexible deployment of staff from Bantry.  In these circumstances, the Commissioners do not deem it necessary to reopen the Customs Office in Castletownbere on a full-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> The Revenue Commissioners are fully alert to the dangers of drug smuggling along the coastline, including smuggling through ports in the south west of the country.  Experience has shown that inteligence gathering and surveillance, rather than a static presence, are the best means of combating drug smuggling.  The Commissioners have made a substantial commitment in terms of staff and other resources to the Customs National Drugs Team (CNDT).  Customs National Drugs Team staff based in Cork comprising 16 officers consists of operational, intelligence, maritime and sniffer-dog units. Intelligence units, each comprising two full-time members of the CNDT, are also based in Bantry and Tralee and are supervised by two higher executive officers who become involved in drugs related work as necessary.  All units are mobile and employ the most modern means of communication and have access to air and sea surveillance.  Speicalist CNDT officers in the Cork and Kerry regions can call on assistance, where the need arises, of other Customs and Excise staff.</P>
    <P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, the customs service has also enlisted the assistance of the general public in the fight against drug smuggling through the Drug Watch Programme, which was launched in 1993. Under this programme, the assistance of coastal communities, maritime personnel, as well as people living near airfields has been enlisted to report unusual occurrences to customs.  Over 15,000 calls have been received from the public in response to that programme.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the present measures taken by customs in co-operation with the other enforcement agencies concerned provide adequate protection against the illegal importation of drugs along the south west coast and the situation will, of course, be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The European Commission proposed a sum of 19 million ecu in the 1996 EU budget for a communications plan for the introduction of the Euro, which is set to take place in January 2002.  The <Col N="97" /> Commissioner responsible, Mr. de Silguy, announced on 25 April that the European Parliament had agreed to release the full 19 million ecu for this purpose.  Commissioner de Silguy said that for 1996, the Commission's priority would be to identify the necessary messages, establish the basic communications tools and establish close contacts with networks of opinion multipliers; it was likely that the financing needs for future years would develop beyond the 19 million ecu available in 1996.  I understand that the process of allocation of funds from the 19 million ecu provision is in the initial stages.</P>
      <P>The question of Ireland's participation in the ongoing communications plan is under consideration.  The Deputy will be aware that information about economic and monetary union and the single currency was widely disseminated in Ireland in the period prior to the 1992 referendum on the Treaty on European Union.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance and double rate bands, is given derives from the Supreme Count decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances.

The group will be reporting shortly and I will carefully consider its recommendations.</P>

      <P>Prior to the tax year 1954-55 the personal allowance for a widowed person was the same as for a single person.  In that year a higher personal allowance was introduced for widowed persons. The widowed person's personal allowance currently stands at £3,150 compared to £2,650 for a single person.  An additional allowance of £2,150 is available to a widowed person who has dependent children.  The lone parent allowance available to other persons is £2,650.  This means that the personal allowances of both a widowed person with dependent children and other lone parents are currently £5,300, the same as the basic allowances for a married couple.</P>
      <P>A special transitional allowance was introduced in 1991 for widowed parents with dependent children to operate for the first three years following bereavement.  This allowance, which is provided in addition to the above allowances, is £1,500 for the first tax year following bereavement, £1,000 for the second and £500 for the third tax year.</P>
      <P>In 1980 a special ceiling on mortgage interest relief for widowed persons was introduced and currently stands at £3,600 as compared with £2,500 for a single person.  A special ceiling for widowed taxpayers on rent relief for private accommodation for those aged 55 years and over was introduced in 1991.  When this relief was extended to all taxpayers in the 1995 budget, albeit at a lower level, widowed persons were granted a higher ceiling than single people.  These reliefs currently stand at up to £1,500 and £750 respectively for a widowed taxpayer compared to £1,000 and £500 for a single person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to widowed <Col N="100" /> persons, as indicated above, is that certain allowances are higher than the single person's in recognition of the fact that widowed persons may have taken on extra responsibilities in marriage which do not necessarily cease upon the death of a spouse.  In addition the extra allowances are granted on compassionate grounds.</P>
    <P>The tax treatment of widowed persons has been reviewed on a number of occasions and the existing tax treatment is considered to be reasonable.</P>

      <P>I am not certain as to the specific initiatives to which the Deputy refers.  Any such proposals would be considered on their merits.  I have no plans at present for the creation of in-traineeships for graduates within the Irish Civil Service. Some of the aims of in-service training within the European Commission, to which the Deputy refers, such as familiarisation with the objectives and problems of European integration are of specific relevance to the European Commission rather than to the Irish Civil Service.</P>
      <P>There are excellent career opportunities for graduates who compete successfully for positions in the Irish Civil Service such as administrative officer, third secretary and executive officer as well as a variety of openings in the professional-departmental areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  These guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have agreed to implement the following measures to assist medical card holders who take up employment or participate in schemes and who could be considered to remain entitled to a medical card on hardship grounds: persons who held the medical card while on the Live Register are allowed to retain the medical card for a period of two years after securing paid insurable employment if they qualify for family income supplement in respect of that employment; persons who held a medical card while on the live register are allowed to retain the medical card for a period of two years after securing a placement on the community employment programme; persons on the live register starting their own businesses who are paid a back-to-work allowance by the Department of Social Welfare and who are paid family income supplement in respect of that employment are allowed to retain their medical card for a period of two years; disabled persons participating in the employment support scheme who held a medical card before entering the scheme are allowed <Col N="102" /> retain the card for a period of two years; persons on the live register who participate in education, training or other recognised development courses are allowed retain their medical card; and weekly payments made under the community employment programme, back-to-work allowance and family income supplement are excluded income when assessing a person's eligibility for a medical card.</P>
    <P>The recent budget also included a provision in relation to the retention of medical cards by persons who have been unemployed for at least one year prior to re-entering employment.  Arrangements are being made for the implementation of this decision in accordance with the provisions of the Health Act, 1970.</P>

      <Quest>if he will amend the Health Insurance Act, 1994, regulations regarding companies such as BUPA, which are entering the Irish market, by stipulating the minimum level of in-patient cover that health insurance companies must provide, either as a sum insured or for the duration of in-patient stay and to ensure that discrimination does not occur affecting groups such as the psychiatrically ill.</Quest>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Health Insurance Act, 1994, and the regulations made pursuant to it, comprise the regulatory framework for the operation of a competitive health insurance market in this country and apply to all undertakings wishing to carry out health insurance in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the unforeseen nature and extent of costs arising under indemnity health insurance, I do not consider that providing for a minimum level of in-patient cover as a sum insured would constitute a satisfactory minimum protection as it could give rise to the individual being significantly under-insured in the event of prolonged and expensive <Col N="103" /> treatment resulting from serious illness or injury.</P>
    <P>With regard to duration of stay, the regulations provide to all insured persons a statutory minimum entitlement in respect of levels and periods of indemnity cover under all health insurance contracts.  These provisions are intended to meet our obligation to provide for competition in the health insurance market; to safeguard the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover; and to offer a significant protection to the general public in an open competitive market.</P>
    <P>Prior to finalising the regulations I met with representatives of the two major private psychiatric hospitals.  The proposals on minimum benefit in respect of psychiatric in-patient and day-patient services were acceptable to them in the context of an open competitive health insurance market.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide that the minimum period of guaranteed cover in respect of private psychiatric in-patient care is to be 100 days in a year.  Furthermore, I am committed to making provision, at an early date, for a further period of 20 days day-patient care in private psychiatric hospitals.  The level of cover now provided as a statutory minimum compares very favourably with the position taken by insurers elsewhere who specifically limit, in some cases extensively, their exposure to risk in the area of psychiatric illness or do not cover it at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Eccles Breast Screening Programme was a population-based screening programme for breast cancer, based at the Mater Hospital, Dublin.  The programme, which was a pilot programme, ran in north Dublin and in Cavan and Monaghan and had two main objectives; to evaluate the impact of breast screening on morbidity and mortality from breast cancer in Irish women and to address the feasibility and potential value of a national breast cancer screening programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eccles Programme commenced in 1989 and was thoroughly evaluated. This evaluation indicated that breast screening, for women in the 50 to 64 age <Col N="110" /> bracket, was effective in identifying breast cancer at an early stage, allowing for early treatment.  The programme <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> contains a commitment to expand the Eccles Programme on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>I announced, in October 1995, that a national breast screening programme would commence in 1996 and adequate resources have been allocated for this purpose.  At present my Department is engaged in setting a framework for the first phase of the national programme, which will commence in the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas.  The decision to proceed on a phased basis is guided by the need for: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; on-going evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    <P>The issues to be addressed before the programme can commence, include the establishment of a population register, which covers the maximum number of the target population, the organisational structures required and a guarantee of quality assurance.</P>
    <P>The programme will commence before the end of the year.</P>

    <P>A total of £230,000 in additional revenue funding has been allocated to the North-Eastern Health Board region in 1996 for the provision of services for persons with a mental handicap.  It is anticipated that an additional 33 new residential places will be provided in 1996.</P>
    <P>In addition, £4 million in capital funding is being provided nationally in 1996 of which £2 million will be used to support general service developments and £2 million to develop and improve the quality of training facilities under the European Regional Development Fund Assisted Programme.  Details of the precise amounts allocated to each health board area including the North-Eastern Health Area will be provided later this year.  I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting residential care.  However, I am aware that more needs to be done if we are to meet the needs of those awaiting services.  The Government is committed under both the Health Strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of the service as resources become available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In 1992, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board decided to establish a working group to review in depth how the needs of people receiving non-drug items, including ostomy products under the General Medical Services scheme (GMS), were being met and if these needs could be met more efficiently.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the review of ostomy-urinary products on the GMS Scheme was to ensure that the needs of users of ostomy-urinary appliances would be met in the most effective manner and that the most modern &ldquo;user-friendly&rdquo; products should be available to GMS patients.  To this end, each product on the scheme was evaluated by a group, which included specific expertise in stoma care, on the basis of quality, suitability and security.  All appliances were evaluated on this basis alone with no distinction being made between appliances manufactured in Ireland or abroad.  Following this evaluation, it was decided that a number of out-dated products should be replaced because they had been superseded by the more advanced products referred to above.</P>
      <P>Each September, all manufactures are given the opportunity to apply to the board to have their products considered for reimbursement.  Following each review, a draft update list is sent to each manufacturer giving them the opportunity to make representations to the board if their application had not been successful.  Further consideration is then given to each representation received and a final update is sent to each manufacturer effective from 1st January each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Irish Medical Devices Association, representing the manufacturers of non-drug items, have met with members of the non-drug review group on a number of occasions with the purpose of establishing guidelines for <Col N="114" /> manufacturing-distributors of ostomy-urinary appliances.  These meetings have been most successful and it is hoped to publish shortly &ldquo;Criteria for Ostomy/Urinary Products in the GMS Scheme&rdquo;, including minimum data requirement for user trials of these products.</P>
    <P>With regard to consultation with hospitals, all relevant documentation is forwarded to hospitals as soon as it is available.  A booklet entitled &ldquo;List of Reimbursable Non-Drug Items in the GMS Scheme&rdquo; is published each year and sent to relevant personnel.  Representations made by Hospital Stoma Care Advisers have been considered at each review.  Following the 1992 review, the Department and the General Medical Services (Payments) Board met with the Ileostomy Association and explained the basis of the decision to revise the list of ostomy products available to GMS patients.  The association expressed satisfaction with the outcome of that meeting.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand the figures mentioned by the Deputy as the total expenditure in the GMS scheme on all ostomy-urinary products in 1995 amounted to only £2.82 million.</P>

    <P>Rushbrook House is a large house on the grounds of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  It accommodates 18 residents with a mental handicap.

All the residents <Col N="117" /> were immediately relocated, pending an engineering survey.  All the ceilings in Rushbrook House have since been checked, and extensive renovations carried out.  In addition, while the house was vacated, the Eastern Health Board fully repainted and redecorated the house, carried out extensive upgrading of the hot water system, and completed further minor upgrading works.  The house will be ready for reoccupation in two weeks.</P>

It is also intended that further funding will be allocated towards the maintenance and upgrading of units which will remain on the campus of St. Ita's Hospital.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of drug treatment services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Detoxification services can be provided to drug misusers on an inpatient or an outpatient basis.  Inpatient detoxification beds are not specifically designated to adults or to minors, but are allocated on the basis of medical need. There is no distinction made by the drug treatment services between non-injecting and injecting drug misusers in regard to the provision of detoxification facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 20 impatient detoxification beds &mdash; ten in Beaumont Hospital and ten, to be increased in June to 15, in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  Inpatient <Col N="118" /> detoxification facilities are also provided in a number of health board psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>Outpatient detoxification facilities are available through the four drug treatment clinics in Dublin, in some psychiatric hospitals and, in some instances, through general practitioners.</P>

      <P>It should be noted that entitlement to medical cards is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  In this regard medical cards can also be issued to individual family members.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

    <P>The project referred to by the Deputy is a major undertaking by the board involving the development of purpose built residential accommodation and day care facilities on land owned by the board at Ballydribeen, Killarney, which will facilitate the transfer of 28 persons with mental handicap who are currently inappropriately accommodated in St. Finian's Hospital, Killarney and will also provide a number of <Col N="121" /> assessment/respite beds for the catchment area.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the board that planning permission for this development was refused by Killarney Urban District Council on the 18 May 1995.  The decision was appealed to An Bord Pleanála on 16 June 1995 and following an oral hearing held by An Bord Pleanála on the 8 September 1995 planning approval was granted on 4 October 1995.</P>
    <P>I understand that a number of difficulties subsequently arose with regard to fire certification but that following discussions and consultation with the Fire Authority, fire certification issued on 27 February, 1996.  The project is now ready to proceed to tender stage and the board has received approval from my Department to proceed with the preparation of tender documents.</P>

      <P>A number of significant developments are planned to take place at the National Library over the period referred to.</P>
      <P>Legislation will be introduced to establish the National Library as an autonomous body under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the preparation of a second strategic plan for the five-year period from 1997 will be commenced.  This plan will have regard in particular to the provisions of the Government's strategic management iniative.  It will look at how best the increasing requirements of the customers of the National Library can be met as well as at how best the <Col N="128" /> development of the staff of the National Library can be ensured.</P>
    <P>A national photographic archive will be established in Temple Bar later this year where the photographic collections of the National Library will be relocated and developed.  It is envisaged that the new facility will be open to the public as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>Work on the development of the Racquet Hall at the rear of the National Library to house a microfilming unit will commence shortly.  It is hoped that this new facility will allow the National Library to partake in the &ldquo;Newsplan&rdquo; project whereby scarce and important newspaper files which might otherwise be lost through decay, will be microfilmed for future preservation.  Preliminary work on the planning for an extention to the National Library by conversion of the adjoining National College of Art building has commenced.</P>
    <P>A major preservation copying project involving work on Gaelic manuscripts will be undertaken.  Additional work on the maps collection held by the National Library will be carried out while considerable financial resources will be invested in archival materials and in conservation work.</P>
    <P>The latest technology will be implemented to ensure the continued development of the National Library so as to provide a fast and efficient service to users who due to their remote location do not have easy access to the facilities of the National Library.</P>
    <P>The National Library will undertake a review of its information services over the coming years and will continue to develop its educational and exhibition services as well as its heraldic and genealogical services.</P>

      <P>Details of projects which have benefited from national lottery funding in the areas of arts and culture, heritage and the Irish language during the years 1992 to 1994 are contained in the Appropriation Accounts for those years.  Prior to 1993 money for projects in the arts, culture and heritage areas were disbursed through the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach and prior to 1996 money for certain other projects in the heritage area were disbursed through the Vote of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Details in respect of organisations/ projects to which funding was provided in 1995 follow in Appendix 1-2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount of national lottery <Col N="130" /> money provided for the areas of arts and culture, heritage and the Irish language under the aegis of my Department in 1995 was £14,378,680.  These amounts include grants-in-aid to certain bodies under the aegis of my Department.  In the case of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, which is funded from both the Exchequer and the national lottery, detailed lists of grants given by An Chomhairle are published in their annual reports, copies of which are laid before the Oireachtas.  Maidir le Bord na Gaeilge, tá eolas faoi na bealaí ina chaitear an t-airgead a chuirtear ar fáil don eagraíocht &mdash; arbh ón gCrannchur Náisiúnta an t-iomlán &mdash; ar fáil ina cuid tuarascálacha bliantúla, a leagtar faoi bhráid an Oireachtais.</P>

      <P>While I recognise that a house improvement grants scheme would help to promote the conservation and improvement of the housing stock, I am particularly conscious of the cost of the previous scheme.  The Government's priorities in the housing area, as set out in <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> are to expand the local authority and other social housing programmes and to upgrade deficient local authority dwellings.  As the available resources will, accordingly, be concentrated on these programmes, I have no proposal, at this stage, to reintroduce a house improvement grants scheme.</P>

      <P>I have been conducting a full assessment of road safety policy in recent months, including an appraisal of the scope for more involvement by bodies at local level and for greater focus on the higher-risk categories of road users. I intend to announce the results later this month.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 111 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>I have approved Mayo County Council's proposal to construct a large diameter watermain and associated pumping stations and break pressure tank at an estimated cost of £2.25 million.  The council is, at present, drawing up detailed contract documents in respect of these works; these documents must, in turn, be submitted for my Department's approval.  Thereafter, it will be necessary to seek my Department's approval in respect of the council's proposals for the carrying out of the works whether by way of contract or direct labour.  Submissions from the council for these necessary approvals will be dealt with urgently.</P>
      <P>On completion of the Castlebar-Westport link, and the proposed break pressure tank at Sheeaune, the resultant dual supply will obviate the need for a substantial increase in water storage capacity at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Comprehensive and updated waste statistics are currently being compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency.  When completed these will provide detailed information on progress in implementing the national recycling strategy.</P>
      <P>Preliminary indications are that the overall recycling rate for packaging waste has increased from 10.3 per cent in 1993 to some 17 per cent at present. This represents satisfactory progress in relation to the target of 27 per cent recycling for this waste stream over a five-year period which has recently been agreed with IBEC in the context of the REPAK initiatives.</P>
      <P>As regards recycling rates for individual materials, these stood in 1993 at 19 per cent for paper, 21 per cent for glass, 24 per cent for metals and a negligible rate for plastics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> Measures currently being pursued in order to improve Ireland's recycling performance were set out in the replies to Questions Nos. 142, 143 and 144 of 12 March 1996.</P>

      <P>The information requested is given in the following table.  In test centres where there is a low level of testing, failure rates over a relatively short time span may not be representative of the true overall position in relation to these centres.  Supervisory testers continuously monitor the work of driver testers in order to ensure the application of common test standards throughout the country and to establish underlying causes of significant and persistent deviation of failure rates from the national average.</P>

      <P>The carrying out of development by a local authority in its functional areas is exempted development under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 and is not, therefore, subject to normal planning procedures.  However, in accordance with Part X of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, local authorities are obliged to give public notice of most major developments which they propose to carry out.  Submissions or observations on the proposal must be sought and the plans must be available for inspection by the public during a period of not less than one month.  A report on the proposal must then be prepared, including details of any submissions or observations received.  This report must be submitted to the elected members of the local authority who have the discretion, under section 3 of the Local Government Act, 1955, to direct that the proposed development is not to proceed.</P>
      <P>This procedure was introduced in 1994, after full consideration, and in the context of changes to planning law relating to development carried out by public bodies generally.  I believe that it is an open and democratic procedure.  I have no plans to replace it.</P>

      <P>It is open to the board of management of the school in question to apply to my Department for provisional sanction for an additional post on developing school grounds.  This application may be made if the enrolment of the school on 30 September 1996 is projected to exceed the enrolment on 30 September 1995 by a minimum of 30 pupils.  In this way, a post which would otherwise be suppressed at the school may in fact continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, should the projected increase in enrolment fail to materialise <Col N="156" /> in September next, the provisional sanction for the post would have to be withdrawn.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the anomaly in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 which confirms the right to buy out ground rents but does not allow of vesting the freehold of houses containing flats in view of the fact that the Act only applies to houses in single occupancy; her views on whether this situation is satisfactory; the plans, if any, she has to introduce an amendment to the Act to cover all leasees with premises and leases of more then 150 years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 &mdash; the provisions of which were continued in force indefinitely by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1987 &mdash; provides for a special procedure for the vesting of a fee simple in dwellinghouses.  A separate and self contained flat in premises divided into two or more such flats is not a dwelling within the meaning of the Act and, accordingly, the special procedure contained in Part III of the Act does not apply to such premises.  The question of acquiring the fee simple in relation to such premises is dealt with in other aspects of the Landlord and Tenant code &mdash; for example, provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>I understand that the primary purpose of Part III of the 1978 Act was to provide that owner-occupiers of dwellinghouses would have a special procedure available to acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simpe in their property.  Dwellinghouses which are let for commercial purposes give rise to different considerations.  I am satisfied that Part III of the Act has worked well in practice &mdash; as is evidenced by the number of householders who have availed of the scheme to buy out their ground rents &mdash; and I have no plans at present to widen the categories of persons who may avail of the procedure under that part of the Act.  If, however, the Deputy wishes to let me have a detailed submission putting forward any case for such change I will, of course, arrange to have it examined.</P>
      <P>I am not clear what particular point the Deputy has in mind by referring to leases of more than 150 years as the Act in question makes no distinction on the basis of that timescale.</P>

      <P>Delays in the hearing of court cases in County Donegal as in other areas are a matter of serious concern.  To address this problem the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, increased the maximum number of judges who may be appointed to the various courts.  I have obtained Government approval for the appointment of 15 additional judges i.e. three to the Supreme Court; <Col N="178" /> two to the High Court; seven to the Circuit Court and three to the District Court.  To date three additional judges have been appointed to the Supreme Court and three judges have been appointed to the resulting vacancies in the High Court.  The remaining judicial appointments will be made as quickly as possible.  I am confident that the appointment of additional judges will allow the backlog of civil and family law cases to be addressed.</P>
      <P>In relation to a review of the District and Circuit Courts areas, I would remind the Deputy that I established the Working Group on a Courts Commission in October last to examine all aspects of the operation of the courts system.  Reform of the family courts structure, in particular, is the subject of the recent Law Reform Commission Report on Family Courts.  The recommendations it contains call for a combination of structural and legal reforms and a major injection of resources.  I will be considering these recommendations in the context of available resources and the Government's commitment to complete the steps necessary to strengthen family courts.  The report will also, I expect, be given full consideration by the Working Group on a Courts Commission.</P>

    <P>A total of 29 applications to transfer to this jurisdiction have been formally transmitted by the UK authorities, to date.

    <P>Under the terms of the Convention, the two States involved in processing a transfer request are required to exchange information relating to the prisoner.  The information in question includes particulars of the offence, court warrants, sentence administration particular, etc.  Owing to the complexity of documentation required, the process of information exchange is not one which can be completed quickly.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 171 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>At the end of March 1996 there were 7,521 persons in receipt of the carer's allowance.  The number of recipients for each of the years 1991 to 1995 is as follows: 1991, 3,959; 1992, 4,437; 1993, 4,748; 1994, 5,392 and 1995, 7,189.</P>
      <P>According to the most recent statistics available, about 1,600 persons who applied for the carer's allowance failed to qualify on means grounds.  Consequently, if the means test was removed, that number of additional carers would have qualified together with an unknown number of carers who would satisfy the other conditions attached to the allowance but who did not apply on the grounds that they would not have satisfied the means test.  It should be noted that there are various estimates of the number of people caring for relatives either full-time or part-time; one such estimate is put to 100,000.</P>
      <P>In regard to other assistance available to carers, the respite care fund was established by my Department in 1993 to enable carers to avail of respite breaks from their caring duties. Responsibilities for the administration of the fund was transferred from my Department to the Department of Health last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like most of the schemes operated by my Department, the carer's allowance scheme is kept under continuous review and, in this connection, my Department is in contact with the Department of <Col N="181" /> Health regarding provision for carers generally.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 177 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>During the period December 1994 and September 1995 rent supplements were in payment to various persons residing at the address in question.  In September 1995 rent supplements were withdrawn in respect of these premises when it was found that the premises did not comply with the fire, health and safety standards of Dublin Corporation. The premises was visited earlier this year by the superintendent community welfare officer and the community welfare officer on receipt of an application for a rent supplement from one of the tenants who had previously been in receipt of a rent supplement.  Considerable improvements had been carried out by the landlord and payment of a rent supplement was restored to this tenant until 20 April 1996.  The EHB have ascertained that this tenant is moving shortly to a new address to enable the landlord to carry out further renovations on the premises.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that other tenants of these premises claimed rent supplements using addresses from other properties owned by the same landlord. Accordingly, no rent supplements were withdrawn on this basis.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns of the Deputy about any possible abuse of the rent supplement scheme as highlighted in this parliamentary question, and in view of the Deputy's concern, I have asked the EHB to investigate the matter further.  However, I am not in a position to disclose confidential information relating to any applicant's circumstances without the applicant's express permission.</P>

      <P>The Government has allocated a sum of £19,736 million to the county enterprise boards for 1996.  I am at present examining proposals for the differentiated allocation of this funding as between each county enterprise board.  A final decision on the allocation for each board in 1996 will be communicated to it as soon as possible. In the meantime, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the likely allocation for any particular board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending a final decision on the differentiated allocations, each board has been given a grant approval capacity of £180,000 for the first six months of 1996. The boards have also been given a budget for the first six months of the year of £66,000 for indirect enterprise support activity, &ldquo;soft supports&rdquo;, and <Col N="187" /> £60,000 for their administrative requirements.</P>

      <P>The Partnership Act, 1890, and the Limited Partnerships Act, 1907, set out the legislative provisions regarding the law of partnership in Ireland.  Section 1 (1) of the Partnership Act, 1890, provides that &ldquo;a partnership is the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit&rdquo;. Section 2 (2) of that Act declares that the sharing of gross returns does not of itself create a partnership but section 2 (3) provides that &ldquo;the receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In determining whether or not workers such as share-fishermen would have right of access to a rights commissioner or the Labour Court in terms of a dispute with the owner of a boat, the key issue hinges on the nature of the employment contract of the share-fishermen.  If the contract is a &ldquo;contract of service&rdquo;, then the fishermen would be an employee of the boat owner.  On the other hand, if the contract is a &ldquo;contract for service&rdquo;, the fisherman would not be an employee and thus would not have access to a rights commissioner or the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the employment difficulties being encountered by qualified Irish pilots has recently been brought to my attention.  Last week officials from my Department met with representatives from the Irish Air Line Pilots Association to discuss the situation and consequent on that meeting the question of training Irish pilots to the type rating level required has been raised with the air line companies concerned. An early response is anticipated in view of the impending peak season for the travel trade.  The question of licence validation in other EU countries is a matter for the relevant aviation authorities in each country concerned.</P>

To date, three potential investors have expressed an interest and have visited the vacant plant.  IDA will continue to promote the premises through its network of offices, particularly in Europe and the United States, until a suitable replacement project has been secured.</P>

      <P>I understand that FÁS takes particular care to ensure that persons employed by them are suited to work with members of the public.  I further understand that FÁS is especially conscious of the need to ensure that all persons, and particularly children, who have contact with FÁS programmes are protected fully from possible abuse.  In order to ensure the protection of children, FÁS has drawn up and is in the process of disseminating child protection guidelines for use by community employment sponsors.  It is FÁS policy to require all sponsors who undertake projects which deal with young people or with people with special needs to have in place procedures to deal with the protection of these vulnerable groups.  These procedures aim to provide a framework within which sponsoring bodies will: create a safe and secure environment for children and-or for people with special needs; help lessen the possibility of persons with a criminal record or with history-background of offences relating to abuse, being recruited; help to ensure that the best available person is recruited to work with childrenpeople with special needs; and deal in a correct and sensitive manner with all allegations, suspicions or disclosures of abuse.</P>
      <P>FÁS has also drawn up draft clearance checking procedures for use by project sponsors as part of their recruitment procedures and also for use by FÁS when selecting participants for child care training courses.  My Department is currently discussing with the Department of Justice as to how these procedures could best be put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, official price control on petrol and auto diesel products was discontinued on 1 October 1991 with the entry into force of the Competition Act, 1991.  It is significant that during the 18 year period prior to then when price control applied to these products, the relevant maximum prices orders allowed for significant price differentials per litre, in case of deliveries pursuant to one or more sales of 455 litres or more, or alternatively of sales of less than 455 litres at a time.</P>
      <P>The decision by the then Minister to remove price control on petrol and auto diesel was predicated on the security against anti-competitive practices which the Competition Act, 1991 provides.  I propose to strengthen competition law, through the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and by enabling the courts to impose stiff fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition.  I intend to seek to have the Bill, which has completed Committee Stage in the Dáil, enacted at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, in its recent report on the proposal by Statoil to acquire Conoco, the Competition Authority commented that with the abolition of price control and price surveillance, there is now a much greater degree of price variability in the petrol market, including differences in intra brand and inter brand prices, between different areas and at different times.  The authority noted that, in some cases, the difference between the highest and lowest price for a particular brand and grade can be as <Col N="195" /> low as 0.3p per litre or over 9p per litre. The cheapest price for one brand and grade can be 10p per litre or more below the highest price for the same grade of another brand on the same date in different parts of the country, although local price differentials tend to be much lower.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of and regret the hardship caused to the farming community by the programme of industrial action taken by the Civil and Public Service Union.  All discussions on the issues involved are being conducted under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.  Following preliminary negotiations, it has been agreed that the results of positive brucelosis tests will be released.  Further discussions are scheduled for today.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he proposes to take regarding the practice of some veterinary practices who return cadavers including still born animals to farmers in view of the fact that it is a reasonable presumption that the carcase is simply buried on farmland; the further steps, if any, he proposes to take to inform practices of current regulations; and the resources that are available to him to ensure that best practice is adhered to.</Quest>

      <P>My Department is not aware of the practice referred to by the Deputy.  Perhaps he could arrange to let me have specific details.  The legal position is that cadavers, including stillborn animals, are designated high risk waste under the European Communities (Disposal, Processing and Placing on the Market of Animals By-products) Regulations, 1994 and must be disposed of by rendering or, in exceptional circumstances, under licence of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, by burial or burning.  Disposal by burial or burning must be in accordance with the relevant environmental protection and waste disposal regulations of the Department of the Environment and the local authority in whose functional area the disposal takes place.</P>

      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91, as amended, lays down the rules which must be followed in the organic production of plant and plant products.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is the competent authority recognised under the regulation and other bodies may be approved by it to operate the inspection system set out in the regulation.  There are three such independent bodies in Ireland &mdash; Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association Ltd., Organic Trust Ltd., and Demeter Standards Ltd. There is no EU regulation in place governing livestock production at present but one is being prepared.  I have no plans, at this time, for the establishment of an independent control body as referred to by the Deputy.  The Deputy may be assured, however, that I am keeping the organic farming sector under ongoing review and I will be working to ensure that this important sector is developed to its full potential.</P>

    <P>As regards the extension of the high rate of payment of the deseasonalisation premium, at last week's meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, I raised the issue of compensation for beef producers who had suffered as a result of the current BSE crisis.  I suggested that such compensation could best be provided by way of increases in the deseasonalisation and the special beef premia.  The Council agreed on the <Col N="202" /> urgency of short-term income support measures for producers and the EU Commission undertook to suggest concrete measures to the Council at its next meeting in May.  I will be pursuing this matter further at that meeting.</P>

      <P>The REP scheme was launched in 1994 and since then the operations of the scheme have been the subject of ongoing review by my Department.  I have established a consultative committee on REP which is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, Minister of State, to provide feedback on the operation of the scheme and advise on possible improvements. Farming bodies, environmental groups, planning agencies and relevant Government Departments are represented on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of this committee is ongoing and as a result of its work and my Department's monitoring and controls, deficiencies have been noted in a number of areas.  The main deficiencies <Col N="203" /> are in the preparation of plans by planning agencies and the non-compliance with the terms of the scheme by some farmers.  The increased level of checking by my Department will ensure strict compliance with the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to breaches of the Department's specifications, a range of penalties is being finalised at present involving reimbursement of between 10 per cent and 100 per cent of any aid paid.  Furthermore, serious breaches may result in exclusion of the participant concerned from further participation in the scheme for such periods as may be determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU regulations governing the suckler cow premium scheme specify that only &ldquo;cows belonging to meat breeds&rdquo; are eligible for the scheme.  However, in order to allow producers to convert their herds to acceptable breeds, a transitional arrangement was put in place which allowed payment on other breeds during 1993 and 1994 provided the cows had been &ldquo;inseminated by bulls of a meat breed and the producer in question received the suckler cow premium in respect of 1990 or 1991&rdquo;.  1995 was the first year when the rule governing breed eligibility had to be applied without derogations.</P>
      <P>My officials carried out field inspections in all cases where applicants changed the breed declaration of any of their cows between 1994 and 1995.  In other words, cows that were described in 1994 as non-beef but described one year later as a different breed were examined by my officials to establish eligibility.  In the vast majority of cases the animals were found to belong to eligible beef breeds.  In a small number of cases involving less than 1 per cent of all those applying for suckler cow premium in 1995, invalid change of breed declarations were found.  Under the terms and conditions of the scheme the penalty in these cases was the non-payment of premium under the 1995 suckler cow scheme and ruling out of the scheme for 1996.  Anyone penalised in this way was given an opportunity to appeal the decision and, if appealed, was visited a second time by a different inspecting officer to examine the animals in question.</P>
      <P>I had my officials discuss the level of penalty in these cases with officials of the European Commission but the change of declaration was considered by them to be serious enough to warrant such penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of breed is considered fundamental to the aim of the scheme which is to promote the production of quality meat.  When the eligibility criteria were decided the transition period <Col N="205" /> of two years was negotiated in order that producers would have sufficient opportunity to convert from dairy to beef breed herds if their circumstances required such a conversion.</P>

      <P>The total cost of the Cost and Competitiveness Review is estimated by ESB to be around £260 million over the period 1996 to 1999, during which time the bulk of costs associated with the restructuring will occur.  The package will be self-financing to the extent that the savings over the same period are expected to be around £250 million.  The cost of the ESB's organisational restructuring &mdash; exclusive of the proposed voluntary severance scheme and associated employee assistance programmes &mdash; is estimated to be around £80 million over the same period.  These costs include the lump sum payments to staff, removal of the employee's &ldquo;deficit&rdquo; pension contributions, and productivity awards to staff.</P>

      <P>The full light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative comprises a core network of lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely and Ballymun and a second phase network comprising an additional line to Finglas and an extension of the Ballymun line to Dublin Airport and Swords at an estimated total capital cost of £410.3 million in 1994 prices.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 provided for a total expenditure of £200 million &mdash; in 1994 prices &mdash; on light rail during the period.  Of this amount approximately £175 million &mdash; 216 million ECU &mdash; is proposed to be EU-cofinanced at a rate of 65 per cent; that would approximate to £114 million in EU funding.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the detailed work which has been carried out by the project team on light rail, CIÉ is confident that it will be possible to implement the first phase of the core light rail network at a capital cost of £220 million in 1995 prices.  This would leave a balance of approximately £106 million in capital costs and any non-capital costs to be financed nationally.</P>

      <P>Overtime is not payable to members of the permanent Defence Force, consequently the question of its payment does not arise.  There is, however, a consolidated allowance known as Border duty allowance which is payable on a permanent basis to all personnel posted to Border units.  This allowance ranges from £42.52 to £48.12 per week and is paid in recognition of, <i>inter alia,</i> the <Col N="212" /> incidence of separation from families and difficult working conditions.</P>
      <P>Subsistence allowance is paid in respect of those occasions where personnel are performing duties away from their stations and are not provided with meals.  This does not arise frequently, however, as there is a comprehensive catering system in place in Border units, in which there has been heavy investment, to cope with feeding troops in the field.</P>

      <P>An EU Regulation (EC 2719/95) amending Council Regulation 3699/93 was adopted by Council on 20 November 1995.  This Regulation allows EU moneys from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance (FIFG) to be used for part-time financing an early retirement scheme for fishermen subject to certain conditions.  However, no additional FIFG funds have been provided by the EU to support any such scheme.  Existing FIFG funds available to Ireland are allocated under the Fisheries Operational Programme 1994-1999 and the PESCA Community Initiative. These funds are already fully committed.  In this context and in the context of priorities within the fisheries sector I have no proposals for an early retirement scheme for fishermen at this point.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme on Peripherality &mdash; 1989-1993 &mdash; Dublin Port obtained £1.525 million EU grant aid towards the purchase of a tug the <i>Cluain Tarbh</i> in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Port of Cork obtained approval, in October 1994, for £2.77 million EU grant aid from the Cohesion Fund towards the cost of a tug the <i>Gerry O'Sullivan.</i></P>
      <P>Under current EU directives, Council Directive 90/684/EEC of 21 December 1990 as last amended by Directive 94/73/EC of 19 December 1994, aid of up to 9 per cent of a contract valued over 10 MECU is available for the purchase of a tug of 365 kw or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in December 1994 an international agreement was signed within the OECD, under which all direct or indirect aid to shipbuilding is to be considered unlawful.  This agreement, to which the EU is a party together with the USA, Japan, Korea and Norway, has not yet entered into force &mdash; this should have happened on 1 January 1996 &mdash; but is expected to do so in the near future.  The EU Commission, <Col N="215" /> however, has already signalled that it will no longer approve grant aid for such projects.</P>
