      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 3, 5, 9, 32, 405, 420 and 426 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been involved in the situation affecting the managing director of <Col N="1975" /> Bord na Móna.  I have consciously avoided involvement lest such involvement might be seen as political interference and prejudgment of the outcome to this affair.</P>
    <P>The issues surrounding this matter fall to be considered by the board of Bord na Móna.  The board has had to proceed in a considered manner and has afforded the managing director every opportunity and the necessary time to respond to all the questions which have arisen in relation to his position.</P>
    <P>I share the regret of Deputies that the matter has proved to be prolonged.  This is having an effect on the morale of the workforce of Bord na Móna; a workforce whose sacrifices more than anything else have laid the basis for the turnaround in Bord na Móna's fortunes and performance.</P>
    <P>The chairman of Bord na Móna, Mr. Pat Dineen, was appointed by the Government in September of last year. He was given a general mandate and asked to concentrate all the energies of the board and management on confronting the risks and challenges facing the company.</P>
    <P>Today I received a copy of the following resolution adopted last night by the board.</P>
    <P>Having considered the statement of the Managing Director to the Board at the Board meeting on 1st July, in response to the Board's request for explanations relating to the issues which were brought to the Board's attention by Price-Waterhouse Reports, the Board has decided to advise the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, that on the basis of the evidence available to the Board, the Board is of the opinion that Government guidelines relating to the Managing Director's remuneration would appear to have been breached during the period of its review of the Managing Director's remuneration arrangements since his appointment in 1987 to 1995.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> The board has further decided to advise the Minister that these remuneration arrangements which were originally entered into between the former chairman and the managing director were not disclosed to the board or its remuneration committee.</P>
    <P>The issues arising concern more than simple breach of pay guidelines.  There are also matters of corporate governance and standards of integrity and behaviour which would be addressed by any board of any company.  I, therefore, consider the communication I received this morning from the board to be unsatisfactory in that I would have expected the board to have advised me of its findings in relation to the following question among others.  Did the board have the power to deviate from the Government's pay guidelines?  Did it have power to delegate its functions in relation to pay to the chairman and for him to carry them out in a confidential manner?  Why was there not a formal budget line in Bord na Móna for public affairs?  Why was cash handed to the managing director to cover unvouched expenses?  What are the fiduciary duties of the managing director and chairman to the board?  I have now asked the chairman to address these questions urgently.  I will advise my Government colleagues later this afternoon of the position and the Government will decide what further immediate action is called for.</P>
    <P>In relation to Government guidelines on pay of chief executives, the following is the position.  In Report No. 35 of the Review Body it was stated that the recommended rates of remuneration were intended to include salary and all other benefits apart from superannuation and expenses approximating to those applying in the Civil Service which they took as the norm.  If additional benefits are provided the actual salary paid should be reduced by the value of those benefits below the remuneration rate recommended.  These conditions were accepted by the managing director in writing.  On 12 November 1993, 7 July <Col N="1977" /> 1994 and 6 July 1995 the former chairman affirmed to the then Minister, Deputy Cowen and to me that Government guidelines on the pay of the managing director were being complied with.  Clearly this was not so.  I am adamant that there has to be the highest standards of corporate governance and behaviour in all State companies under my aegis.</P>
    <P>The issue of indemnification arose following receipt by members of the board of a letter from the managing director drawing attention to their potential personal liability.  The Attorney General advised that there was no objection to the board indemnifying its members against a court action where they carried out their lawful duties as board members.  The board members were so advised.  Contrary to the impression given in the media, I did not, as Minister, provide any indemnification to the members of the board.</P>
    <P>The 1995 report into State bodies under my aegis dealt mainly with public procurement and asset disposal and its terms of reference did not cover the remuneration of chief executives as this was not deemed necessary as the chairpersons reported annually to the Minister on this matter.</P>
    <P>The leaking of information to the media in relation to this case has been the subject of much comment.  I cannot condone such leaks.  However, I do not believe that an inquiry would serve any useful purpose and would most likely prove a futile exercise.  I confirm that one copy of the draft Price-Waterhouse report was received by the Secretary of my Department, it was not copied and at all stages was kept confidential.  The same is true of the final Price-Waterhouse report.  Indeed at no stage have I had possession, or even sight of, the draft report, the final report or any appended information.  Of course, I have been kept informed of developments by the secretary and as appropriate by the chairman of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> I recently received written confirmation from the chairpersons of eight of the State companies under the aegis of my Department that the basic salary of their chief executives is in conformity with the levels stipulated in the review body's most recent report.</P>
    <P>In the case of two of the State companies under my aegis, the chief executives are on personal rates, negotiated as part of their service contracts agreed by the Government, which are above the rates set out by the review body. These rates are confidential.  It should be noted, however, that in the event of either chief executive leaving his post, his successor would be paid the rate set by the review body for the post, unless specifically authorised otherwise by Government.</P>
    <P>The level of expenses and other non-pay elements of chief executives' employment contracts have been examined by officials in my Department.  A summary of their review has been forwarded to the Department of Finance and will form part of a report currently being prepared for Government on this matter.</P>
    <P>This review did not include Bord na Móna, which is being dealt with as a separate issue and has been covered elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears, not for the first time, that the Minister has declared war on the board of a State company.  He plans to take on the board of Bord na Móna and tell it why it did not do its job properly by giving it a list of reasons.  This declaration of war on Bord na Móna is interesting.  Why did the Minister allow the matter to drag on for ten weeks?  He could have posed these questions nine or ten weeks ago and got the answers he required.  Why did he allow the directors to behave in this manner for so long, causing damage to the company and its employees? Also, will he clarify whether the former chairman, Mr. Halligan, was authorised by the board to agree the remuneration package of Dr. O'Connor?  Does the Minister consider that the wording and <Col N="1979" /> spirit of the resolution passed early this morning contain any censure of the managing director, Dr. O'Connor, or does he consider it a neutral decision?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither I nor any member of the Government have declared war on a semi-State body, including Bord na Móna.  I am concerned at the damage being caused to the company while the dispute rages.  The chairman and members of the board have been cautious and prudent in their approach to the matter.  They have given the chief executive of the company every opportunity to answer the questions raised in the Price-Waterhouse report.  I am satisfied that the issues raised in the report were dealt with in a fair, impartial and objective fashion by the chairman and members of the board.  I accept there were delays, but they were not entirely the fault of the members of the board. The Deputy will recall that the chief executive was not in a position to give answers or to co-operate with the board on a number of occasions.  Having taken advice he proceeded to answer a number of questions that had been put to him.</P>
      <P>I understand that when the former chairman of the board met the board on 19 June 1996 he made a detailed statement about his involvement in the approval of the remuneration package. As I stated previously, this report was given in confidence to the board.  I am not aware of the full detail of what he said, but it is my understanding he stated at that time that he had made a verbal agreement with the chief executive in respect of a package.  I also understand that there is nothing signed in writing on the minutes or otherwise of the board's record in this regard.</P>
      <P>I met the chairman of Bord na Móna at lunchtime and he advised me of the happenings at the board meeting last night.</P>

      <P>I will communicate his report to my Cabinet colleagues later this evening at a Cabinet meeting and we will then make the necessary decisions.  We are attempting to establish the facts and address the issues raised in a satisfactory manner so that Bord na Móna can get back to doing what it should be doing, addressing its business without the distraction of an internal debate about the remuneration package of the chief executive of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister will agree that specific requirements are laid down in the terms of appointment and guidelines issued to chief executives and chairmen of State companies.  The board has reported to the Minister that these have been breached, but he outlined a number of questions he is putting to the board.  Has the chairman of Bord na Móna a duty to report to the Minister and not the Secretary of the Department? On what date did the Department receive the Price-Waterhouse report?  Why did the Minister state it was given to the Secretary and that he did not see it?  Does he agree the questions he posed today were answered in the Price-Waterhouse report?</P>
      <P>As the board does not have a hire and fire role in relation to the managing director of Bord na Móna, who has responsibility to deal with any major breach of the terms of contract under which that person holds office?  Does the Minister have to take action, if such is required, because the board did not make the appointment, it was made by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary of the Department is the Accounting Officer who usually deals with any financial or other matters relating to pay and remuneration and for that reason the report was forwarded to him.  The board is responsible for the managing director of the company who reports to the <Col N="1981" /> membership of the board.  In the first instance, responsibility rests with the membership of Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In the event of a board making a decision regarding the future of the managing director, that is then reported to the Minister and the final decision rests with the Government because, as the Deputy correctly states, the chief executive of the company is appointed by the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister both personally and politically sponsor the appointment of Mr. Dineen as chairman of Bord na Móna?  Is the Minister aware that on the date of his appointment at a private dinner in Dublin, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, announced to an international gathering which was seeking his support for the second mobile phone licence that he had secured the appointment of Mr. Dineen on that day as chairman of Bord na Móna?  In his responding remarks at that dinner, Mr. Dineen stated that he would deal with the chief executive.  I want to know what instructions he was given.  Did the Minister or the Tánaiste sponsor him?  It is well know that while Dr. O'Connor would have supporters in Cabinet &mdash; the Minister would not be numbered among them &mdash; Mr. Dineen has a number of supporters there too.  We want to know the exact situation.  Whose agenda is being played out?  What instructions were being given and why is this situation being created by the Government? Is it to achieve the removal of the chief executive, to destroy the board or to destroy the company?  The Minister should clarify the matter for the House as it is important.</P>

      <P>The appointment of Mr. Pat Dineen as chairman was in accordance with normal procedures.  As Minister I sponsored his name to Cabinet and received Government approval for his appointment.  The chief executive of the company was informed of the appointment of Mr. Dineen in the normal course of events.  I can state categorically that there was no hidden agenda.  Mr. Dineen, who has an exceptionally good track record in business, was appointed as chairman of the board with one specific task, to ensure that the company would continue to develop, expand, become financially sound and to report back to Government &mdash; as all chairman do &mdash; on the progress being made.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not respond to my question as to whether he saw any censure in the resolution last night from the board of Bord na Móna. Did the Minister interpret any censure in the resolution he read to the House or did he regard it as neutral reporting of its current opinion?  Why has it taken ten weeks to check the matter of £66,000 unvouched expenses?  Why could the Minister, his Department or the Department of Finance not have checked that out sometime during those ten weeks?  We are no wiser today.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister said today it is not clear whether that situation is correct. Ten weeks down the road we are no wiser as to whether there was cause for concern.  What was the Minister's interpretation of the motion of censure? That is the kernel of the matter, yet the Minister is not guiding us in any way on that central point.  In fact, the Minister seems to be dodging the issue completely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 15 and 418 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Electricity Directive is the very best that could be agreed and represents a fine balance between the member states who wanted a significantly higher level of liberalisation and those states who wanted a more measured and planned approach to such opening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a number of clearly stated objectives in my approach to these negotiations.  The proposal on the table <Col N="1990" /> would have had serious adverse consequences for Ireland if I had not fought to protect Ireland's position as a small and isolated electricity system.  The directive very clearly takes on board the question of public service obligations which to me was a vitally important issue and absolutely essential to prevent cherry picking.  Also, I achieved agreement that 15 per cent of electricity generation could be provided by indigenous fuels and this provision protects the peat industry into the long-term future.</P>
    <P>The ESB will also have adequate time to complete its restructuring and to adjust to the new competitive market. The decision of Council enhances the importance of the cost and competitiveness review.  Its early and full implementation is an essential prerequisite for the ESB to operate successfully in the new competitive market.  I have every confidence that the ESB will prosper in this market.</P>
    <P>The directive will in no way disadvantage domestic consumers.  The ESB will not be allowed to subsidise its competitive business at their expense.  Domestic consumers will benefit equally with larger consumers from the extensive changes which are happening in the ESB as a result of the cost and competitiveness review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the CCR was based on a 13 per cent liberalisation of the electricity market and that 22.5 per cent of the market will be open to competition, increasing to 35 per cent, what are the consequences for the ESB in terms of the number of jobs to be retained and in terms of price increases, which are inevitable in view of liberalisation? If competition levels are doubled, if a 6.5 per cent increase is granted to the ESB over a three year period, and if the Minister has to rebalance the tariffs, is it not inevitable that there will be an increase to domestic consumers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have clearly stated it is not the intention of the Government or this directive to burden domestic consumers with over and above price <Col N="1991" /> increases.  The Government has already made a decision in respect of price increases.  We have allowed for price increases over the next three years which are conditional on the implementation of the CCR.  The price increases are very modest and take account of the investment needs of the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If one accepts that the top 250 energy using companies representing 25 per cent of the market here are the main target for competition from outside utilities, is it not inevitable that with the rebalancing of tariffs and to ensure competition in the heavy industry sector, domestic consumers will have to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not.  It is important to recognise that electricity bills cover the cost of electrical energy and of the electricity transmission and distribution networks.  Geographical differences in costs arise almost entirely in the transmission and distribution of electricity.  The ESB will continue to operate the electricity network and it is the Government's intention that the charges for use of the transmission and distribution networks will be non-discriminatory. Industries in the higher density population areas, therefore, will not have any advantage over those in less populated areas where transmission and distribution is inevitably more costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that prices will be non-discriminatory in an open market but when the market opens and large industry avails of the opportunity to import electricity, as no doubt they will, it is obvious to any amateur economist that prices must rise for the remaining users of electricity.  In other words, if the finest commercial customers are lost to imported electricity, prices simply must increase for everybody else.  I predict &mdash; as I have many times on this issue &mdash; that there will be frequent increases in the price of electricity in the coming years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated clearly that the Government made a decision in respect of price increases which will be modest and conditional on the implementation of the CCR.  I want to make it quite clear that domestic consumers will not be expected to shoulder more than their burden of any price increases in electricity. The increases will be non-discriminatory. As far as the outcome of the electricity directive is concerned, I am satisfied we have included in the directive the issue of public service obligations. That was a bone of contention which was argued strongly by our delegation on behalf of the ESB.  Our concerns in this area have been included in the directive and will address many of the issues raised by the Deputy, including the cherry-picking of larger customers to the disadvantage of domestic consumers.</P>

When it is in operation, from where does the Minister expect alternative sources of electricity supply will come to provide the competition which is the objective of this directive? Importing electricity has been mentioned. Does the Government plan to proceed now with an electricity interconnector between the adjoining island and ourselves or will it open up the market for the construction of privately funded electricity generating stations?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the first question on two occasions.  On the second part of the question, it is not the Government's intention to cancel, alter or interfere with the decision we have taken in respect of the peat fired power station in the midlands.

      <P>I fundamentally disagree with the Minister's view that if the ESB loses its top 250 companies as customers to imported electricity it will not increase domestic electricity prices.  By way of giving us some comfort has the Department conducted any study which bears out the Minister's opinion that losing these major customers to imported electricity will not result in an increase in domestic prices?  Is that an opinion off the top of the Minister's head or has he studied the matter?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is missing the point.  The object of the CCRs exercise was to prepare the ESB for competition. It was clearly stated in the McKinsey report that the ESB's cost base was out of line and that its productivity was not conforming with that of operators in other European countries.  The CCR was based on an in-depth study and analysis of the ESB's operation and set against best practices in utilities in other <Col N="1995" /> countries.  The ESB always expected there would be competition.  It must restructure the company and conduct the necessary rationalisation to ensure that its cost base is driven down, so that with a lesser share of the market it can compete effectively.</P>

      <P>The mandatory off-take of petroleum products from the Whitegate Refinery will end with effect from 1 January 1997.  Until then, importers of gasoline, gasoil, propane and butane will continue to have a statutory obligation to purchase up to 35 per cent of their requirements from the refinery.</P>
      <P>In order to enable the refinery to trade on a fully competitive basis, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited is implementing a three-year programme of investment which is due for completion in December 1996.  The results of this programme, allied to a number of marketing initiatives, are expected by the INPC to enable the refinery to operate on a commercial basis when the mandatory regime ends.</P>

      <P>It is most important to sell them.  The company has developed its markets in preparation for the nonmandatory regime and I am satisfied it will succeed.  If there is a need for a larger refining capacity in the future, a number of possibilities must be considered, including a joint venture with the private sector, direct investment by the State or a combination of both. However, the main reason we need to <Col N="1998" /> retain the refinery is for security of supply. We could import oil and oil products as cheaply as they can be produced here, but we need a refinery.  That has been the consistent position of the Government and it was also the position of the two Opposition spokespersons when they were Ministers in the Department. From a security of supply point of view, it is necessary to have a refinery in Ireland.  We are confident it will be commercial from 1 January 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 415 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DART extensions to Greystones and Malahide are included in a package of public transport investments which is under consideration for Cohesion Fund assistance by the European Commission at present.  My Department has been in regular contact with the Commission on <Col N="1999" /> this package, including the Greystones and Malahide extensions.  I understand that the Commission will shortly finalise its consideration of the package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister's reply because there has been no action to make the public believe the commitment is being fulfilled.  We are aware of the high profile commitment made during the recent Wicklow by-election that the DART would be extended to Greystones.  However, little has been heard about it since.  We will be keeping an eye on progress as long as the Minister is involved.  I hope he will get approval soon for funding for the project.  Perhaps he could indicate when work will commence, which is what people want to hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no avoidable delay in getting this project under way.  Our decision to approve the project was a policy one taken in the context of the National Development Plan and the operational programme for transport.  That decision was only taken after detailed analysis of the project by CIÉ, which showed positive economic returns, and after discussion with the European Commission.  Following that policy decision, the normal European Union approval procedures for Cohesion Fund projects were put in train.  A detailed application was submitted to the Commission for Cohesion Fund assistance and, in accordance with normal procedure, the Commission then asked an independent consultant to review the submission.  This work has only recently been completed.  Each Cohesion Fund project requires an individual Commission decision to approve financial assistance.  I understand that an internal Commission consultation process is nearing completion, which I hope will enable this formal decision to be taken before the end of July.  CIE is ready to start this project as soon as it gets formal approval from the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that, on the basis of the analysis carried out by CIE, the new service will generate a small operating surplus and it will not require an ongoing operating subsidy.</P>
      <P>A number of points should be made concerning the financial position of the DART service.  In 1995, the latest year for which published accounts are available from CIE, total expenditure on the DART service was £26.85 million, but that figure included interest charges and infrastructural costs totalling £11.35 million, which are not directly related to the day to day operation of the service. When those charges and costs are excluded the total day to day operating costs of the service for 1995 was £15.5 million, which compares with a total revenue from the service of £13 million in 1995.  A total of 16.7 million passenger journeys were made by DART in 1995.  The operating deficit on DART services for 1995 was £2.4 million or 1.5 pence per passenger journey.  The total deficit, taking account of interest charges and infrastructural costs, was £13.8 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the DART is losing money and that its operating costs for 1995 were £15.5 million when interest and other extraordinary charges were deducted.  Apart from interest charges and capital spending, in terms of its ordinary day to day running costs the DART is losing more <Col N="2001" /> than £2 million a year.  That is extraordinary. Has the service always operated at such a loss?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated in the House on an earlier occasion that the figures improved during 1995, but we have only got the CIE report. Annual reports of CIE for the previous three years show a drop in the number of passengers using the DART service. That is alarming, particularly in view of the overall annual losses in the operation of DART.  It would be very serious if the Dublin commuter was losing confidence in the DART service. Now that the annual report has been published can the Minister confirm that the trend has been reversed and that people are returning to use the DART in greater numbers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>According to the latest figures available, 1995, approximately 1.5 per cent of our total primary energy requirement is met through biomass.</P>
      <P>The alternative energy requirement, AER, schemes and my recently published policy document on renewables, Renewable Energy &mdash; A Strategy for the Future, will between them significantly increase the contribution of renewable energies to our national energy requirement, especially in the area of electricity generation.</P>
      <P>Under the AER 1 contracts have been offered for the installation of 111 megawatts of electricity generating capacity from alternative source, wind 73 megawatts; hydro 4 megawatts; landfill gas 12 megawatts; combined heat and power 22 megawatts, and these projects are gradually coming on stream.</P>
      <P>The AER II competition is a special competition to secure a 30 megawatts electricity generating plant using biomass-waste as the fuel and that competition is under way.</P>
      <P>Under my renewable energy development strategy a target of a further 100 megawatts of electricity generating capacity using renewables has been set for year ending 1999, with wind taking 90 megawatts, hydro 3 megawatts, and biomass-waste 7 megawatts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under my strategy market access is guaranteed for renewable energy products which are successful in getting funding under the EU THERMIE programme. At present such projects <Col N="2003" /> amount to almost 10 megawatts of installed generating capacity.</P>
    <P>A longer-term target of 310 megawatts from wind and hydro has been set for the period 2000-10 with further targets for biomass-waste to be set in the light of the outcome of the AER II process.</P>

      <P>Is it not time that the Minister of State took more positive action to ensure the achievement of the targets and objectives to which he continues to refer in regard to his policy and document on energy renewal? Documents and policies will not achieve implementation on the ground unless the necessary facilities are provided to enable the construction of alternative energy generating stations.  Is the Minister aware that those who have applied to provide alternative energy projects under the THERMIE programme are making no progress and are meeting inordinate obstacles from the ESB and that there is absolute and utter frustration among the promoters of the THERMIE projects because of the lack of progress, the obstacles put in their way and the major financial investment to which they have committed themselves which, in many cases, is under serious threat?  Is the Minister of State aware of the crisis in this area and the anger of those who have taken him and the Government at their word, who have formulated and put forward proposals but have found that they have been seriously blocked?  Those people called to see the Minister in his office and explained the difficulties which confront them, but the obstacles remain, no progress has been made and we stand to lose out under the THERMIE programme. Those promoters who took the Government at its word and acted in good faith have been let down and have possibly incurred serious financial losses.</P>

I can give the Deputy figures about what has been done in that regard.  On the wind area, planning has been granted and cleared for implementation for 13.7 megawatts.  Planning permission has been granted for another 22.5 megawatts, but appeals against that have been lodged by third parties and 14.7 megawatts from wind has been submitted for planning.  The people in Carrickabrock in Tipperary who got the contract decided to pull out because of local opposition and in Tullytrasna planning was refused for 7.5 megawatts. The application was unsuccessfully appealed.</P>
      <P>A number of very small, separate hydro projects which have been through the planning process have been implemented since then consisting of 0.435, 0.07, 2.1, 0.14, 0.56 and 0.21 megawatts respectively.  In addition, probably people would be interested in CHP &mdash; combined heat and power &mdash; projects, a large number of which appear to be deployed by the alcohol trade, including Guinness 6.3; Harp, 2.2; Macardle, one megawatt and Smithwicks, 2.2 megawatts, respectively, all in the planning process.  There is a further list of combined heat and power projects, amounting to approximately nine megawatts, which have passed the planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt landfill projects will draw public attention, methane gas having been extracted from old dumps at Balleally, Friarstown, Tramore Valley, Ballyogan and Dunsink amounting to approximately ten megawatts between them.  In addition there is the 30 megawatt power station for biomass waste in respect of which tenders are being submitted, which process is proceeding expeditiously.  Therefore, the House will <Col N="2006" /> see there is a great deal happening on the ground as well as on paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the major difficulties being encountered by alternative energy producers reaching a satisfactory arrangement with the ESB to take supply into the national electricity distribution network, all of which the Minister said had been resolved.  When were they resolved, because I spoke to some such promoters just yesterday?  Is this something that occurred yesterday evening, this morning or when did the Minister become aware that there had been a major change?  On reading the small print, I do not want to discover there has been no change?  I want the Minister to be open and honest and tell us precisely what is the position, what is the major change, when it occurred and whether it will meet the objections of those people he heard in his office?</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Molloy referred to THERMIE grant holders who now have an automatic right, which was announced approximately six weeks ago although I have not the exact date and who are now entitled to an automatic contract with the ESB.  The legal problems of admitting them to the national grid and obtaining contracts for them caused problems which have now been resolved.  I have not heard any serious complaint from any THERMIE grant holder since then, all of whom were very pleased that they now had automatic access to the grid apart from the technical requirement involved in attaching them thereto which would take some time anyway.</P>

      <P>Was it just yesterday or the preceding day that these difficulties were resolved because, if this decision was taken six weeks ago there is still a problem?  Does the Minister anticipate any difficulties in price terms in connecting these people to the national grid?</P>
      <P>On the wind energy programme he has implemented, does the Minister agree his aspirations and reality may be poles apart because, very often, while people implement it they encounter a dilemma between what is environmentally acceptable and what is happening on the ground, leading to very many such programmes being refused planning permission on environmental grounds?  Does he foresee this being a continuous dilemma for his strategic programme on wind energy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the second part of the Deputy's question first.  So far, one applicant only has been refused planning permission, which was appealed and refused on appeal also. Eight applicants have passed the planning process and are ready to go ahead. Therefore, it is a myth that they are all being refused.  That is simply not the case.  In the case of another wind energy project in Slievenamon, applicants withdrew their application because of local opposition, which was their decision rather than anybody else's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, I simply do not accept the environmental arguments being advanced about constraints on wind energy project managers, with regard to the method by which they can construct their wind farms, since there are no environmental negatives to wind energy.  The windmills are structures of <Col N="2008" /> some beauty which appear to reach out their arms to the heavens to extract energy from the skies and do so as long as the wind blows.  It is said they are ugly but in comparison with some other structures nationwide, windmills are beautiful structures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is true.  There is no noise from these new windmills whereas the older ones Deputy Molloy had constructed in County Mayo could be heard ten miles away.  I know it is a long time since he was Minister but the new ones are silent, and move very slowly, posing no danger to birds.</P>
      <P>The price of connection to the grid is determined by the cost of bringing a line from the source of generation of electricity to the grid.  One of the problems encountered by hydro producers is that grid connection costs are higher because their structures are usually located high up in the mountains where streams are sufficiently rapid to generate electricity. That cost is determined in each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's 30 megawatts biomass project, the contracts for which are at present under consideration, is he aware of the serious position that has developed in County Monaghan with regard to the disposal of mushroom waste or compost which can no longer be used on landfill sites because of a run-off from it and the fact that its recycling ingredient which we had hoped could be used as a soil conditioner is no longer viable?  I was contacted this week by a ten unit satellite mushroom grower whose contractor informed him last week in writing he could no longer take the waste from his mushroom farm, the relevant local authority having issued a three day notice of closure of the site.  This man told me he will be forced to reduce production, perhaps even to cease unless an alternative <Col N="2009" /> method of dealing with that compost can be devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of and sympathise with the circumstances the Deputy has just described.  Within the relevant competition terms there is room for the producers of mushroom, chicken or turkey waste to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not particularly want to know whether they have because somebody else will be adjudicating that competition, the technical aspect of which ended on 30 April last.  A new circumstance now arises in which no applicant can be involved in adjudicating the competition.  The assessor will be appointed in a few days time and the competition will proceed to the next stage.  I hope for an early decision in this case involving up to a 30 megawatts station which, whatever the form of biomass, will take a large volume.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 24 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Last week I announced that the Government had decided to choose KPN Telia as the strategic partner for Telecom Éireann.  Detailed discussions have now commenced with a view to signing a deal within the next 30 days.  I am delighted with the outcome of this process.</P>
      <P>We have a deal which aligns the strategic and financial interests of the State, the company and the strategic partner. Above all we have a deal which is good for the Irish consumer and Irish business. In partnership with KPN Telia, Telecom Éireann can accelerate its transformation into a modern telecommunications company which is totally focused on the needs of its customers.  It is nonsense to suggest that this deal should be reversed.  It makes sense financially and strategically.  It has received a broad welcome at home and abroad, from Telecom Éireann's employees, business interests and financial experts.</P>
      <P>This deal represents excellent value. The facts speak for themselves.  There are no less than 85 separate strategic initiatives which have been agreed between Telecom Éireann and KPN Telia.  These initiatives incorporate over 100 man years of management input by KPN Telia.  They will provide a comprehensive strategic support programme which will consist of technical support, expert and managerial assistance, software and systems improvements across all business categories.</P>
      <P>Nobody can question the ability of the KPN Telia consortium to deliver on these initiatives.  They have proven track records in their home markets and are backed by their global Unisource partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset our first priority was to find a partner with the right strategic fit. This has been achieved in the context of a financial deal which, in addition, represents excellent value for the State.  In addition to the initial £183 million which will be paid for a 20 per cent stake, the State will also receive a further £200 <Col N="2011" /> million for the exercise of an option on a further 15 per cent of the shares.</P>
    <P>Finally, through a profit-sharing formula the State will capture a 60 per cent share of the gain on the strategic partner's investment over a certain threshold and this will apply to the entire stake purchased by the partner including the initial 20 per cent stake. It is expected that, based on the likely business performance of the company, this deal will produce overall proceeds to the State in excess of £500 million.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly refute the suggestion by Deputy Brennan that the price of £180 million is not much more than half the value of the company and challenge him to establish his assertions on value.  He has focused on only one element of the pricing and has got even that figure wrong.</P>
    <P>Less than one year ago the Government set out the key objectives for the telecommunications sector and the alliance process.  I am happy to say that we now have a deal which fulfils these expectations and which I am certain will lead to a top class telecommunications sector in terms of price, quality and availability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that one of these questions is a priority question. Are we dealing with it in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with it in that way.  The Standing Orders relating to priority questions after a certain stage prohibit Question No. 2 being taken as a priority question.  The fact that it is being taken with Question No. 10 is an opportunity to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been many questions about this deal, but the biggest question in my mind is how on earth the Minister got it past the Democratic Left and Labour parties.  No doubt the Minister will not answer that here.  Perhaps he would answer it in some other forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> I would like to respond to the Minister's kind invitation by way of some questions about the figures.  Does the Minister accept that this deal has dramatically short-changed the Irish taxpayer, that the price he achieved, £183 million for 20 per cent, is a derisory figure, that it is a betrayal of the taxpayers and a selling off cheaply of the investment of over £1 billion by the Irish public in Telecom Éireann?  Does the Minister further accept that the public were not given the opportunity to buy one share, although the Minister has sold 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann to foreign telecommunications companies, some of which are owned by financial institutions?  Does the Minister accept that £200 million or £300 million of taxpayers' money, investment and pension fund money is abroad in foreign telecommunications companies, that we own more of British Telecom than we are allowed to own of Telecom Éireann?  Does the Minister accept that Telecom Éireann's profit last year was almost £200 million?  Does the Minister know that one can buy a telecommunications company for ten times its profit?  Ten times £200 million is £2 billion.  The price the Minister achieved was not £2 billion; it was the equivalent of £900 million.  In response to the Minister's invitation I put it to him that ten times profit is the normal price for telecommunications companies.  The Minister has achieved less than five times profit.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that we started out with ten players and ended up with one bid, that the bid the Minister accepted is derisory and an insult to the taxpayer?  I am amazed that the Minister's colleagues in Government stood back and allowed him to sell off 20 per cent of our finest State company for a miserable £183 million.  The figures relating to the future are conditional on performance and are meaningless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Deputy putting forward the same old jaded arguments he has been touting in <Col N="2013" /> the public arena during the past few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has suggested that the value of Telecom Éireann should be based on a multiple of ten times the operating profit.  This is not the normal measure used in these transactions.  Operating profit does not take interest payments or tax into account.  The actual profits of Telecom Éireann for the year 1995-96 are £66.4 million.  If the Deputy is saying that the value of Telecom Éireann should be a multiple of ten times profit, this yields a valuation of £660 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>

      <P>The price to be paid for the initial 20 per cent stake alone, without taking into account the price for the 15 per cent option and the State's share of the excess return to the strategic partner, values the company in excess of £500 million.  This has been raised here on a number of occasions.  It was a policy decision by the last Administration of which Fianna Fáil were part.</P>

      <P>I have on a number of occasions in this House outlined the Government's objective and policy initiative in this area.  It was to find a strategic partner for Telecom Éireann that could give the business community and industrialists here access to a modern, broad-ranging telecommunications network.  We are at a disadvantage because we do not have that access with the result that industry and business is not competitive.</P>
      <P>The strategic benefits available to Telecom Éireann arising from this deal are exceptional.  The partner will transfer substantial operational and strategic benefits to Telecom Éireann as part of the new arrangement.  These will accelerate the transformation of Telecom Éireann over the coming years into a customer focused operator playing a role on the global telecommunications stage.  PTT/Telia will become actively involved with the management of Telecom Éireann to ensure that the benefits are delivered.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to think back to 18 months ago when a number of senior players had an interest in taking a stake in Telecom Éireann. The price being quoted at that time was £450 million.  It was reduced to two suitors, one of whom could only be described as a regional operator.  The Minister has received £183 million, which is one third of the price available two years ago.  It must be seen as a let down for the Exchequer and the workers of Telecom Éireann that the Minister's intransigence and delaying tactics allowed a situation to arise where we really had only one suitor.</P>
      <P>In light of what was available, the price may look fair.  However, one can also compare it with what KPN paid to the Czechs.  If one compares the profits of the Czech telecommunications company with ours, one finds that we really got very bad value for what is a strategic national asset.

It will gain immediate access to money which Telecom Éireann requires to invest in its infrastructure and the stake will grow in value in the longer term.  Telecom Éireann will have a strategic partner with huge experience of competing in world markets.  Both companies involved have experience of successfully transforming their companies to meet competition and that is exactly what Telecom Éireann has to do now and in the future.</P>

      <P>The nine airports received EU grants totalling £27,861,000 over the past five years.

    <P>(i)  A further Exchequer funded marketing scheme has been approved by the Government, totalling £2.35 million over the four years 1996-99, to assist the six privately owned regional airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports, but no moneys have yet been paid under this scheme.</P>
    <P>(ii)  This figure includes £1.775 million paid to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. in 1992 in respect of tourism and traffic development &mdash; Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications Vote.  The figure does not include an allocation of £1.8 million in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications 1996 Vote for the marketing of Shannon Airport by Aer Rianta which has not yet been disbursed.</P>

We explained it was required for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs when using the Government jet.  Will the Minister address this concern?</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a much more important question.  In relation to the marketing funds earmarked for regional airports, is he concerned that one can fly from Farranfore to Dublin for £49 whereas a flight from Cork to Dublin costs £89?  Is it true that some of these funds are being used to reduce air fares to attract passengers, giving the airport more than a level playing pitch in terms of competition with the other international airports?</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business on Thursday last I requested that we should not wait until 25 July to debate all the matters emanating from the recent murders but should try to deal with them this week.  I acknowledge that the Government examined the Fianna Fáil Bill, as the Taoiseach said it would, and that the Minister kindly informed me late on Sunday night that it would be taken.  This is the first time in many decades that an Opposition Bill is being taken in Government time.  We have proven that much valuable work can be done by the Opposition.  As I said to the Minister, amendments will be taken on board. Yesterday the Whips agreed the wording of the Private Members' motion and I welcome that agreement.  However, I do not like the idea of trying the Opposition into agreeing something and then seeing the entire Government give a press conference on its ideas.  We are trying to deal with crime issues which I strongly believe the Government should have dealt with in the past 18 months and it is not helpful for the Government to organise a press conference to coincide with the debate on these issues. We will co-operate when we can and <Col N="2319" /> will continue to work as we have done in recent days, but the Government holding the press conference when we are debating these matters in an effort to upstage the Opposition is not very helpful.</P>

      <P>Last Tuesday, 25 June Deputy John O'Donoghue tabled Question No. 303 which asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry &ldquo;the legal fees and expenses paid or payable and claimed and unpaid to persons representing public representatives at the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry in Ireland...&rdquo;.  That evening he received a reply which stated that claims for costs had been submitted and that examination of these was ongoing by the taxing master.  Deputy O'Donoghue then tried to raise the matter on the Adjournment but received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle which stated that it could not be taken on the Adjournment and was a matter for the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should listen to what I am saying as it is very relevant.  Today Deputy O'Donoghue tabled Questions Nos. 370 to 376, inclusive, and 392 to 394, inclusive.  It was only when the Deputy had pursued the matter on three separate occasions &mdash; first by way of parliamentary question, second by way of an Adjournment <Col N="2320" /> debate and third by way of further parliamentary questions &mdash; that the relevant Department and Minister wrote to the Deputy advising him there was an oversight in the reply to Question No. 303 on 25 June in that it did not include certain information and did not indicate that following an interim certificate of taxation made by the taxing master on 13 March a payment of £754,760 was issued to Messrs. D. White and Company, the solicitors acting on behalf of a former Member of the House and the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.</P>
      <P>During the beef tribunal Mr. Justice Hamilton said that if questions had been answered properly there might not have been a need for the tribunal.  In this case the evasive reply given to Question No. 303 showed the Minister and the Department thought Deputy O'Donoghue would go away.  They also thought he would go away when he tried to raise the matter on the Adjournment and it was only when he put down further detailed questions that they owned up.  It is entirely unsatisfactory if this is the way we have to go about getting information from the Government, Ministers and Departments.  I love the line &ldquo;did not include certain information&rdquo;. A sum of £750,000 is not a little matter one would forget when replying to a detailed question.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister who wrote the letter come into the House in the normal way and correct the error given in reply to a parliamentary question and put the facts on the record?  Will he also say why this information was concealed in his Department and not given in the reply to the first question?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach wishes <Col N="2321" /> to reply.  The reason I raise this matter is that the Ceann Comhairle's letter stated the Minister had no responsibilities to the Dáil in this matter and it was a matter for the Dáil itself.  That position changed as the days went on and the Minister's office told me it will give the full information in reply to today's parliamentary questions.  It is, therefore, a matter for the Dáil.  There was an effort by somebody somewhere to conceal this information.  Nobody forgets about £750,000, especially when it relates to a Minister.</P>

I understand that since then two sets of proceedings have been taken against RTE in that matter, and there may well have been settlements.  Given that the newspaper industry report recommends changes and that when my party moved its Bill to change the law in this area the Government said it wanted more time &mdash; it was not possible to have a Second Reading of that Bill last October as the Government had not completed its deliberations &mdash; will the Taoiseach agree there is an urgent need for change in the law in this area?

      <P>It is appropriate to make the point that newspapers are businesses and obviously act some of the time with business considerations in mind but they also serve a public interest in a very important way.  It is better that both considerations which are encompassed within the newspaper industry report should be considered properly in their respective contexts and any conclusions to be drawn should be drawn in that way.  While I appreciate the Deputy and her party have a particular view on this matter, which she freely expressed in the House, I am sure she is also aware that others have different views about the need to provide protection for the reputation of individuals. Not all individuals who may avail of the defamation law to protect themselves have a criminal record.  It is important that their interests should also be considered in a mature and careful way in light of the public interest and all the other considerations.  I am sure the Deputy would wish the Government to do that and that is what we will do. When we receive the report we will study it and come to a conclusion on the matter.</P>

It is important that one should consider the issue of defamation.  The House would probably wish me to do this, to ensure that the issue of defamation, which is a finely balanced issue, is considered in a careful way in its full context.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) Where a direction has been given under paragraph (b) or (c), the fact that the direction was given, the date and time when it was given and the name and rank of the officer of the Garda Síochána who gave it shall be recorded.</P>
      <P>(f) The direction or, if it was given orally, the written record of it shall be signed by the officer giving it and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) shall state the date and time when it was given, the officer's name and rank and that the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention was necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned, and</P>
      <P>(ii) shall be attached to and form part of the custody record (within the meaning of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Station) Regulations, 1987) in respect of the person concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (d) provides that a direction given by a chief superintendent under paragraph (b) or (c) of the <Col N="2328" /> section, that is a direction for the extension of the periods of detention may be given orally or in writing and if given orally shall be recorded in writing as soon as practicable.  This follows exactly the wording included in the detention provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 &mdash; section 4 (3) (c).</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's first amendment provides that where direction is given orally it shall be confirmed in writing within 12 hours of it having been given rather than as soon as practicable. Obviously it is desirable that a written record should exist as quickly as possible. The setting of the 12 hour limit would, to some extent, be arbitrary and a dilution of the protection that is already in the Act which, in effect, provides that the direction must be given in writing as soon as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment would be to remove the requirement to provide written confirmation as soon as possible, it it were within 12 hours of the direction being given.  Arising from a commitment I gave on Committee Stage to consider points raised by the Deputy, I decided to propose an amendment to meet what the Deputy sought in his two amendments, except that it specifies a 12 hour period.  Under my proposal, a record must be kept of any direction given by a Garda officer under section 2 (2) for the further detention of a person for any period after the initial six hours of detention have elapsed.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) of the amendment provides that the direction for a period of further detention should be recorded as well as the date and time when it was given and the name and rank of the officer who gave it.  Paragraph (f) provides that the direction or, if given orally, the written record shall be signed by the officer giving it and state the date and time when it was given, the officer's name and rank and a statement that the officer had reasonable grounds for believing further detention was necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned.  The direction will be attached to and form part of the custody record of the detained person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2329" /> Deputy O'Donnell wanted this period reduced to three hours.  I hope both Deputies accept that my amendment achieves the best result.  The purpose of this amendment, and those tabled by Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue, is to ensure careful use of the extension of periods of detention so that people's civil liberties are not abused.  In the debate taking place outside the House people advocate a type of regime to be adopted one day and the next day pass motions stating nothing should be done to abuse civil liberties.  While I recognise the climate in which such comments are made, one would get confused if one were to follow everything being said.</P>
    <P>My objective in introducing this legislation for seven day detention is to ensure we have sufficient penal powers to deal with serious criminals while making sure they provide the necessary protection for people in custody. Despite what I read, I believe the measure of a seven day detention, with the necessary safeguards, is appropriate in the present climate to deal with the type of crimes being committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment which is broadly in line with the amendments I proposed on Committee Stage.  It is true that an individual may be deprived of liberty when he or she is detained for any length of time, but the circumstances under which this matter arose are extremely serious for the State.  The introduction of a seven day detention period, with provision for a judicial review after the first 48 hours, is necessary to deal with suspected drug traffickers. However, I also recognise the necessity to ensure, as far as possible, that human rights or civil liberties are not breached.  If a chief superintendent decides, after the first six hours, to detain a person for a further period the direction, and reasons therefor, should be stated in writing.  I welcome the measure which provides that the decision to detain shall be recorded in writing, that the officer's rank and name shall be specified and that he or she will <Col N="2330" /> set out the grounds for the continued detention, which will be attached to the custody record.  This provision is in the interest of not only the person detained, but of the officer concerned because allegations of abuse against officers are frequently made at the subsequent trial. While this may not guarantee that false allegations against an officer are not made, the court will be able to ascertain from the written record, taken as soon as possible after the decision is made to further detain, the precise reasons for the further detention.</P>
      <P>The seven day detention power is necessary because much of our legislation does not reflect the seriousness of the drug trafficking problem.  There is provision for a judicial review following the first 48 hours of detention and again after 72 hours.  The seven day detention period is based on sound reasoning.  It will at least give the authorities an opportunity to gather evidence.  Far too often people have had to be released after a short period of detention.  Under the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act people can be detained for up to 48 hours, but under the criminal justice Acts an individual may be held for only two periods of six hours, with a rest period of eight hours, making a maximum of 20 hours.  It is impossible to expect the authorities to gather the necessary evidence, particularly if the case has an international dimension, in that period of time.  Also, in the case of drug peddlers or traffickers who stuff or swallow drugs it is paramount that a sufficient period of time is allowed to retrieve the drugs.</P>
      <P>The seven day detention period has inbuilt safeguards.  The concept of a judicial review and the specification in writing by the officer concerned of the reasons and date and time of direction will mean people's rights are not abused.  I welcome the amendment as an additional safeguard.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying that.  I am glad she has brought forward her amendment to take account of a lengthy discussion we had on Committee Stage in relation to the need to put safeguards in place at the same time as we are putting in place radical proposals to increase the powers of detention on the part of the Garda in relation to drug traffickers.  There is a great dilemma in the media, as well as in legal and academic circles, as to the dangers of legislating hastily in the heat of the moment following the death of a journalist.  It is within the capacity of Dáil Éireann to adjudicate fairly on these issues while we are legislating.</P>
      <P>As well as being my party's spokesperson on justice, I am also its spokesperson on human rights. All Deputies are keenly aware of the need to put safeguards in place while introducing increased powers of this type.  Drug trafficking has presented problems on a scale and sophistication of criminality which the State is not equipped to deal with under current legislation.  This Bill responds to the exceptional problem posed by drug trafficking and the sophistication that surrounds it by conferring exceptional powers on the Garda.  These exceptional measures extend powers to detain a suspect for the purposes of investigating the offence rather than charging him, and substantially increase the length of time during which it is permissible to hold a suspect without charge.  It is extremely important that we stitch into the law plenty of safeguards to protect against abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the dilemma in balancing conflicting rights of the individual and the duty of the State to protect the common good and public safety, the Supreme Court has said that the potential damage to society from the use and distribution of controlled drugs is so great and constitutes such a pernicious evil that when it comes to controlled drugs the Legislature has wide discretion in reconciling the rights of the common good with individual rights.  The <Col N="2332" /> Bill is carefully crafted to do that and is all the better for the amendments which are being tabled and accepted by the Government on Report Stage.  I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 6 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) (i) At any time prior to the expiration of the second 24 hour period of detention provided for under paragraph (c), an application may be made to a judge of the Circuit Court, who, if satisfied by oral evidence made by a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Chief Superintendent and such other evidence as may be called at an <i>ex-parte</i> hearing, that the further detention of the arrested person is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence in respect of which he has been arrested and that the offence being investigated is a substantial and serious offence, may direct that the period of detention be extended by any period of time not exceeding a further 72 hours from the expiration of the second 24 hour period of detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) If, within the final 6 hours of a period of detention authorised by a judge of the Circuit Court under paragraph (e) (i) of this section, an application is made to a judge of the Circuit Court, that period of detention may be extended by a period of time not greater than 48 hours from the expiration of the period of detention under paragraph (e) (i) of this section if the judge is satisfied, by oral evidence of a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Chief <Col N="2333" /> Superintendent and such other evidence as may be called at an <i>ex-parte</i> hearing, that the further detention of the arrested person is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence in respect of which he has been arrested and that the offence under investigation is a substantial and serious offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister provides in the Bill that an application to the court for the detention of an individual beyond the 48 hour period should be a contested hearing. This is not desirable because the fact that the continued detention of the accused person will be contested may well render some of the most essential provisions of this legislation unworkable.</P>
    <P>On 12 October 1995 the Minister expanded on the details of the proposals which she had previously announced regarding detention.  At that time the Minister said, and I fully agreed with her, that the powers of detention were necessary due to the international dimension which often exists in such cases and that it may be necessary for the Garda to make extensive inquiries in other countries when a person has been detained in connection with a suspected offence of illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>Without additional powers it is feared that many persons who will be detained in connection with serious offences may have to be released before investigations are sufficiently advanced.  A situation whereby an application for the continued detention of a detained person is contested will not be in the interests of the Garda in their investigation of international drug trafficking. Their role, aspiration and duty in this regard will not be advanced because as a result of the provisions of this section, as they stand, they will be compelled to go to court.</P>
    <P>They will be obliged to disclose to the detained person, and to the public at large, the extent of their knowledge. Nothing could be more damaging to the interests of justice than an open public <Col N="2334" /> court hearing at an early stage of the investigation where the Garda will literally be obliged to disclose their hand not just to the detained person but also to any accomplices he may have here or beyond these shores.  An application by the authorities for continued detention should be made <i>ex-parte</i> by the Garda authorities to the court.  The provision which insists that there should be a court hearing at an early stage of the investigation is inserted in this legislation without legal justification.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made on Second Stage and on Committee Stage that one has to have a court hearing before a court can approve the continued detention of a person who has already been held for 48 hours.  The answer to that concern is that suspects being detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, do not have to be given the information on which the Garda base their suspicions. Additionally, suspects detained under section 4 of the 1984 Act, whose period of detention is being extended by a Garda Superintendent, do not have to be given the information on which he has reached his decision.  They are not given the opportunity to make submissions as to why they should be released.</P>
    <P>A similar provision to this one exists in relation to persons detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  In order for the detention powers to be truly effective the application to the court by the Garda authorities should be <i>ex-parte</i>.  That was provided for in the Fianna Fáil Private Members' measure, the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996.  The insertion of the obligation to have a contested hearing at this early stage of the investigation poses more questions than it truly answers.</P>
    <P>We have not been informed yet what provisions will be afforded to inform an accused person of the reasons for their further detention.  We have not been informed about the time frame the Minister envisages as being suitable for the accused person to consider the <Col N="2335" /> information, to consult a solicitor and instruct counsel before the hearing.  We have not been informed by the Minister whether the detained person will have a right to free legal aid at this early stage of the hearing.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have a contested hearing in relation to whether or not the person should be detained beyond 48 hours, is the Minister saying that if the court finds against the detained person and holds that they should be held for a further 72 hours, they will then have a right of appeal?  It appears the Minister has chosen to take detention out of the realm of supervised administrative law and to insert it needlessly into the mainstream of criminal law.  In the final analysis &mdash; I do not say this lightly &mdash; that may result in some of the essential provisions of the Bill being rendered unworkable.  People with an interest in a case and who may be accomplices of the detained person will, as a result of the hearing being contested, learn of the evidence available to the Garda because the Garda, in open court, in front of the general public and the press, will have to set out the confidential information it has on the reasons the individual should be further detained.</P>
    <P>In recent times there was at least one case where an individual was released after a very short period and where evidence came to light subsequently which might have had a different bearing on the outcome of the case, but the courts and the authorities did not have an opportunity of looking into the matter further.  It would be unfair of me to go into detail in that regard other than to issue this solemn warning: people involved in drug trafficking have accomplices who in many cases, are located either in this country or outside it.  To ask the Garda to go to court and disclose evidence it may have would assist accomplices in learning of the challenge they are faced with, thereby assisting them in possibly avoiding the penalty they should face.</P>
    <P>The argument may be made that it is <Col N="2336" /> necessary in the interests of natural justice that a detained person, when before a court in regard to his or her further detention, should be given the right to make his or her argument.  In proposing this amendment I outlined the reason I do not regard it necessary, in terms of the Constitution or legal precedent, to afford a detained person that right in this instance where we are dealing with such a pernicious conspiratorial trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was raised on Committee Stage the Minister was very clear that bringing the judge into the equation after a 48 hour period of detention is clearly aimed at preserving the constitutionality of what is a lengthy period of detention for questioning. Having heard yet another argument against an independent assessment of the continuing need for a person's detention, I would be interested to hear the Minister's response.  The Bill is framed in such a way as to preserve the constitutionality of the provisions relating to assessment by a person independent of the Garda investigating team, such as a judge, of whether the detention is lawful and is being progressed expeditiously and with diligence and that the person detained is not allowed languish without any effort to continue investigation of the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice regrets she has to leave the House, but she is attending a Cabinet meeting where matters not unrelated to this discussion are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential difference between what is proposed in these amendments and the approach taken in the Bill is that under these amendments an application to a court for the continuation of a person's detention would be made <i>ex parte</i>.  In other words the detained person would not have to be brought before the court.  The Bill provides that a detained person must be brought before a court and have a right to be heard on the basis that such a provision <Col N="2337" /> was considered necessary to comply with requirements under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Having regard to the jurisprudence which has built up in respect of Article 5 (1) (c) and Article 5 (3) of the Convention it is clear that provision must be made that the arrested person be brought before a court after 48 hours.  There is a substantial body of jurisprudence in this regard. It would not be sufficient to simply require a chief superintendent to apply for an extension in relation to detention. The detained person must be physically brought before a judicial officer and must be given an opportunity to be heard.</P>
    <P>In the case of Schiesser <i>v.</i> Switzerland, the European Court of Human Rights defined the powers and qualities required of a judicial officer to comply with this provision.  These include complete independence when performing in the judicial capacity, the detainee must be present at the hearing and the judicial officer must listen to the detainee's representations or those of his or her representative, the need for all the circumstances for or against release to be reviewed and for the judicial officer to decide, by reference to established legal criteria, whether there are reasons to justify detention, and the power to order immediate release where continued detention is no longer justified.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been carefully drafted to take into account these and other requirements arising from that case and subsequent cases dealing with related matters.  I recognise the concerns which Deputy O'Donoghue has raised about the practicalities of what is being proposed in the Bill, but on the basis of the advice available to me I am satisfied that what we are providing by way of safeguards are necessary if we are not to fall foul of the Convention.  I am sure the Deputy would not suggest that we should deliberately include a provision in the Bill which would clearly be in breach of the Convention.  It will, of course, be a matter for the judge in an individual case to decide what evidence <Col N="2338" /> is necessary to enable him or her to conclude that further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.  We could not realistically include in legislation more precise guidelines which would deal with every eventuality in detail, but I am sure we would all accept that in exercising judicial discretion the Judiciary will take into account any implications that particular information might have in terms of prejudicing an ongoing investigation.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances the proposed amendments cannot be accepted for the reasons I have already stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty here.  The decision by the Government to allow for a contested hearing at an early stage of the investigation has very serious repercussions and consequences, which I have already outlined, regarding the fact that the judge will require definitive evidence which will be contested by the person who is being detained.  That would lead undoubtedly to information getting into the public domain which it would be undesirable to make public.  If we are to proceed in this way, as a matter of course there would have to be an appeals procedure under which a detained person could seek a review.  We could then be into a legal quagmire as well as releasing information which should not be released at an early stage of the investigation.  Once a contested hearing is allowed at that stage, it will have consequences which may not have been foreseen.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Gannon, for example, in dealing with the question of a contested hearing in the case of the State (Healy) <i>v.</i> Donoghue, 1976 Irish Reports, page 335, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the natural rights of an individual whose conduct is impugned and whose freedom is put in jeopardy are the rights to be adequately informed of the nature and substance of the accusation, to have the matter tried in his presence by an impartial <Col N="2339" /> and independent court or arbitrator, to hear and test by examination the evidence offered by or on behalf of his accuser, to be allowed to give or call evidence in his defence, and to be heard in argument or submission before judgment be given.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that in the scheme envisaged in this legislation, a suspect is a person whose conduct is being impugned.  In those circumstances, and because of the manner in which it is being proposed that there be a contested hearing, the rights set out by Mr. Justice Gannon would apply.</P>
    <P>In the same case, Chief Justice O'Higgins stated:</P>
    <P>If the right to be represented is now an acknowledged right of an accused person, justice requires something more when, because of a lack of means, a person facing a serious criminal charge cannot provide a lawyer for his own defence.  In my view the concept of justice under the Constitution... requires that in such circumstances the person charged must be afforded an opportunity of being represented.</P>
    <P>This opportunity must be provided by the State.  Only in this way can justice be done, and only by recognising and discharging this duty can the State be said to vindicate the personal rights of the person charged.</P>
    <P>In approaching the detention hearing in the manner proposed, the Minister has unwittingly helped to create a complex maze.  The gardaí will have to stumble blindly through the detention provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if the detention applications were made <i>ex parte</i>.  If a contested hearing is allowed, we are into the area of jurisprudence, some of which I have outlined, which would apply to an accused person.  In effect, the jurisprudence regarding fair procedures which applies to an accused person will, because of the adversarial nature of the detention hearing, lead to <Col N="2340" /> those procedures and that jurisprudence being applicable in the case of a detention hearing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been pressed on this matter more than once by me and she gave a similar reply on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State has given almost precisely the same entrenched view here this afternoon and, while I express the gravest of reservations, I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 7a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 33 to 36 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) (i)  The Minister may make regulations for the treatment of persons detained pursuant to this section, whether in a Garda station or in a place of detention.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Such regulations shall include provision for the assignment to a member of the Garda Síochána (not being a member who was involved in the arrest of the person) of responsibility for overseeing the application of the regulations in respect of that person, without prejudice to the responsibilities and duties of any other member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>(iii)  Such regulations shall provide for the making of an audiovisual record of any interview between a person detained pursuant to this section and a member or members of the Garda Síochána, and of any physical examination of such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv)  Such regulations shall provide for the provision, to a person <Col N="2341" /> detained pursuant to this subsection, of access to a solicitor.</P>
    <P>(v)  Such regulations shall provide for the provision of medical treatment for persons detained pursuant to this section who have, or who appear to have, a physical dependence on controlled substances.</P>
    <P>(vi)  A failure on the part of any member of an Garda Síochána to observe any provision of such regulations shall not of itself render that member liable to any civil or criminal proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him or her.</P>
    <P>(vii)  A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall render him liable to any disciplinary proceedings.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment was tabled on Committee Stage but not debated because I was called out for a vote in another committee.  Under the Bill, the Minister is proposing radical changes in the periods of detention.  Concern has been expressed about the need to introduce safeguards, and the conditions under which a person is detained must be carefully examined when consideration is being given to increasing the periods of detention.  It is stated in the Bill that the regulations made under the 1984 Act for the detention of persons for questioning will equally be applied in relation to these increased periods of detention.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (9) (b) envisages that regulations in respect of 12 hour detention under section 7 of the 1984 Act shall apply to detention under section 2 of the 1996 Bill in a Garda station or in a place of detention.  My concern is that specific regulations may be necessary to deal with the contingencies which might arise in respect of seven day detention as distinct from a period of 48 hours. For example, how often will a detained <Col N="2342" /> person have access to his or her solicitor? What will happen if the detained person is a drug addict suffering from withdrawal symptoms?  As the Incorporated Law Society correctly pointed out, there is no provision for legal aid in respect of appearances before the courts whether on an application for a warrant for further detention in subsection (2) or where the judge, in authorising further detention, has ordered that the detained person be brought before him during a period of detention.</P>
    <P>There is currently no provision for the video taping of interviews while persons are being interrogated.  I acknowledge the Government is accepting a curtailment of the absolute right to silence in drug trafficking cases, but if we are to change the law in this way, and if we are to sanction extended periods of detention without charge, it is important we question the Government on the reason we do not have in this jurisdiction video taping facilities for interviewing suspects. Such a major safeguard could be put in place by the Government to ease the concerns of many people in regard to introducing radical measures for increased detention of suspects.  If we curtail the right to silence &mdash; and I welcome the Minister's acceptance of that point &mdash; there is no justification for not video taping, as a matter of routine, all interviews of suspects detained by the Garda in serious matters, particularly having regard to available technology.</P>
    <P>There should be an independent and accurate record of what happened and of what people did or did not say.  The record would show the state of the person's mind and their physical condition while they were being questioned.  It is in the interests of the Garda, the suspect and the public that we put in place up-to-date technological procedures.  Perhaps the Minister knows why we are not providing for interviews to be videotaped. The purpose of my amendment is to raise these issues.  I do not accept the Minister's statement that regulations to deal with 48 hours detention are suitable to deal with extended periods of detention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  For too long our criminal justice system has harked back to the Victorian age.  Whether that is the nature of common law is a moot point. However, we have, for some reason, failed to enter the 20th century let alone realise we are on the threshold of the 21st century in terms of the detection or trial of offences.  It is right and reasonable for the Garda Síochána to avail of the most modern technology when interviewing a person detained.  Video link evidence is allowed in connection with certain offences.</P>
      <P>While it is wrong that it should not be permissible for a jury to draw whatever inferences are reasonable from the failure of an accused person when interrogated to mention a defence which he puts forward at his trial, I am also aware that people may be vulnerable, ill educated and ignorant of the law in custody.  That is not to say they are in the majority, but there may be a minority of people who feel vulnerable.  I am also aware that the Minister's amendment on the individual's right to silence is minimalist in so far as it relates to drug trafficking offences and allows an inference to be drawn if the individual stays silent and subsequently puts up a defence at his trial which he did not mention earlier. However, there are vulnerable people in a minority of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than criticising the proposal before the House, it would be better if the Government availed of the most modern technology to ensure that justice is not only done but is seen to be done.  This is not just in the interests of the accused person but of the interrogating gardaí because people who are cunning and Machiavellian in these matters will often, through self-inflicted injury, put a case before the court that confessions were forced out of them. We should guard against that.  It seems that to forbid an inference to be drawn from the accused person's silence in relation to evidence he or she subsequently brings up at his or her trial is contrary to common sense.  It does not <Col N="2344" /> help the innocent but it almost certainly gives an unfair advantage to the guilty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The extension of detention to up to seven days is a serious departure which I support because it arises from a serious drug problem.  It has been said that seven days or periods up to seven days detention are necessary because many people who bring drugs into the country or from one area of the city to another do so by carrying them internally. Gardaí have on many occasions been forced to release people knowing that the drugs which were held internally would be on the streets doing untold damage within a short time after their release.  That dictates that the people most likely to be held under this legislation will be the drug addicts &mdash; the vulnerable, ill-educated people from poor areas.  For that reason it is important that such stringent legislation should be balanced by necessary safeguards, which are included in Deputy O'Donnell's amendments.</P>
      <P>If I felt this legislation and the periods of detention would result in the main drug dealers or drug barons being arrested, I would not be concerned. However, they will not be held under this legislation.  Regardless of who they are, it is in the interests of the gardaí and those being questioned that the system of questioning be changed from the present archaic one to a modern system which includes videotaping.  Regulations for medical treatment must be provided for people who are serious drug addicts and who need it.  These amendments bring us up to date with modern needs. It would be wrong and counter productive to introduce a provision of seven days' detention without introducing those other measures as safeguards. Such a provision will not be effective if the proper safeguards are not put in place.  I strongly support Deputy O'Donnell's amendments.</P>

      <P>Section 7 of the Criminal Act, 1984 provides that the Minister for Justice shall make regulations providing <Col N="2345" /> for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations.  Such regulations have been made in the 1987 Garda Síochána regulations relating to the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations. Those regulations will apply to persons detained under the present Bill and they already deal with many of the matters contained in the Deputy's amendment such as the role of the member in charge, access to a solicitor and medical treatment.</P>
      <P>A steering committee on audio and audio-video recording of garda questioning of suspects is involved in an ongoing pilot scheme which is due to run until the summer of 1997.  Until that pilot scheme has been completed, the Minister will not be in a position to consider whether to provide for mandatory recording on a countrywide basis.</P>
      <P>On the question of legal aid for persons detained, the Minister is proposing to seek Government approval for carrying out a review of the operation of the criminal legal aid scheme.  This review should provide an opportunity for examining the issue of granting legal aid to persons detained in Garda stations. Given that custody regulations are in force, and having regard to the circumstances I outlined, this amendment cannot be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on these amendments is important and the proposals from the Opposition should be treated seriously.  I was interested to hear the Minister of State's response to the two Opposition Deputies where he indicated that many of the protections they seek to put in place exist under current legislation, and will apply to the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's response to this issue.  The drugs scourge is the greatest danger facing our young people.  I want a coherent and coordinated approach at all levels in dealing with it and I consider the Bill, and amendments under discussion, are part of such an approach.  I am not satisfied that to date the Government has dealt with these issues comprehensively or <Col N="2346" /> satisfactorily, and I say that with sadness. For 18 months I have watched with frustration from these backbenches the performance of the Government in dealing with this issue.  In fairness to the Government, I must say I felt equal frustration with the way Deputy O'Donoghue's colleagues dealt with this matter when they were in Government.</P>
    <P>This amendment raises an issue of great seriousness which cannot and should not be dismissed by reference to a pilot project.  The 1984 Criminal Justice Act made provision for the video-recording of interviews of people held in custody and that has never been properly enforced.  It was put in place for two reasons: to ensure that gardaí were not victims of false allegations of physical abuse or other unethical conduct in eliciting responses from people held in custody and to ensure that in no circumstances did gardaí abuse their powers.  I am not suggesting that the vast majority of gardaí would, but we all know of incidents that happened at moments of high tension and emotion that, perhaps, in the cool light of day members of the Garda force regretted. I am aware of such an incident having taken place in regard to a matter that will come before the courts and which I am not at liberty to discuss, but it is sufficient to be a cause of substantial alarm.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the very serious case to which my comments relate and, if he is not, he should be.</P>
    <P>I fully support the idea of providing extended periods of detention for those arrested and liable to be charged for drug offences or for those who are taken into custody to answer questions on drug offences.  However, we must ensure the procedures we put in place to bring to justice those guilty of preying on our young people and causing some of their deaths by the use of drugs do not become the mechanism whereby those who should be convicted are released by our courts.  There is considerable danger that in circumstances where suspects are questioned over extended periods of time gardaí who <Col N="2347" /> behaved in exemplary fashion will become the butt of allegations that they abused the person or persons being held.  There is also a danger that when statements are made that issue may become a trial within a trial.</P>
    <P>There is a further danger that the courts will have difficulty in deciding who is telling the truth due, perhaps, to the physical presentation of suspects when taken before the courts first or due to medical examinations after a period in custody.  It may be difficult for the courts to establish if someone suffered injuries before or after he or she was taken into custody or shortly after he or she was released.  There is a danger that convictions that should be successful before our courts will be set aside where allegations of abuse are made and there is no neutral recording available to the courts to indicate where lies the truth.</P>
    <P>I supported amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies on last week's Committee Stage of the Bill.  I did not attend the meetings of that committee because I am reluctant to get involved in a situation where I am seen, for one reason or another, to be constantly at war with my Government colleagues.  A backbench Deputy is supposed to go silently through the lobbies and preferably to be seen but not heard.  I am no longer prepared to take that view in this House on issues about which I have deep concern and on which I have a degree of knowledge that would be of benefit to this country.  It may be the case that Deputy O'Donnell's amendment is unnecessary because some of the issues raised in it are dealt with in existing regulations.</P>
    <P>If some of the issues raised merely duplicate what is in existing regulations, I do not see why a specific measure cannot be contained in the Bill which makes it clear that those regulations apply to the circumstances prescribed by the Bill.  If much of the amendment is unnecessary, I do not see why it should be included in the Bill save for one item.  It is essential that there is provision in regulations which allows for <Col N="2348" /> video-recording.  It is extraordinary that in 1996 a Minister of State can come into this House and regard it as satisfactory that measures put in place by legislation in 1984 are being tried currently only as part of a pilot project.  Of course, it says a lot about Fianna Fáil during its period in Government between 1987 and 1994 and the extent to which it dealt with that issue seriously.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in political point scoring.  I am interested in ensuring that, for once in this House, we deal fully and comprehensively with the problems with which those outside this House are confronted, in an intelligent rather than piecemeal way, not designed merely to meet present public relations needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister must seriously consider providing a video recording of events that take place in a Garda station whenever a suspect is held for periods for which this Bill allows, an essential prerequisite to its successful implementation. We must remember that every gangster and hoodlum outside this House, whether small-time drug pedlars selling small amounts of drugs simply to obtain cash to feed their habit or drug barons running a multi-million pound industry, if held in custody for days resulting from the provisions of this Bill, will inevitably allege some form of mistreatment which may undermine the purpose for holding them, if any questioning to which they are subjected is not video recorded.  They may allege forms of mistreatment, to take the issue Deputy O'Donoghue raised earlier, in claiming to the court their period of detention should not be extended.  They may not allege physical but verbal and psychological abuse, leading to trials within trials to determine simply whether one can hold people in custody.  This difficulty would not arise if this Bill provided for a video recording of the interviewing of suspects.</P>
    <P>We are simply engaged in a pilot project, which is the way the wheels of bureaucracy grind slowly through the Department of Justice, without any sense of urgency, any precise time scales adhered to except when there is a <Col N="2349" /> tragedy that needs to be confronted in a public relations exercise.  Video recordings of interviews of suspects are customary in several countries with similar legal systems to ours.  It is seen by police forces in some of those countries as a protection for them in fulfilling their role and seen by the judiciary as a means of ensuring that whenever allegations of abuse of a prisoner or someone held in custody are made in the course of a serious trial, primary evidence is available to verify whether there is any truth in those allegations.  It is time to end pilot projects and get on with dealing correctly with issues, dragging ourselves at least into the 20th, if not the 21st, century.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, came into this House on 19th June to deal with Parliamentary questions tabled to the Minister for Justice on the drugs issue.  In reply to various queries raised by Deputies Ned O'Keeffe and John O'Donoghue and my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, he told the House effectively that everything was being done that needed to be done. Have we not learnt, within the space of less than two weeks, just how wrong he was?  I do not make that point by way of any personal attack on the Minister of State, it is not my intention to do so. I simply believe that to date the Government's approach to these issues has lacked a sense of urgency, a comprehensive view.</P>

      <P>I thank Members who have supported my amendment.  It is crucial that it be seriously considered by the Government but, to judge from the unsatisfactory response of the Minister <Col N="2350" /> of State, a more comprehensive reply was not considered necessary on the need for audio visual recordings of Garda interviews of persons held in detention.  I do not accept that the 1987 regulations, which emanated from the 1984 Act, are adequate to deal with periods of detention of up to seven days. Within the context of this Bill I do not accept they adequately include measures to provide specifically for the types of persons who will be detained.</P>
      <P>Drug trafficking is not merely a matter of quantity but will involve, as Deputy Gregory correctly pointed out, addicts being used by criminal drug lords.  I do not consider the pilot scheme in force since 1987 sufficient to properly implement provisions enacted by this House long before I became a Member in 1984.</P>
      <P>If we are to be signatories to the radical measures we all agree are needed to provide for extended periods of detention, to curtail the right to silence, all of which I support since we are dealing with a very difficult and sophisticated criminality necessitating such radical measures, the Minister must acknowledge it is wrong to proceed without inserting the necessary safeguards.  As other Members have said, this exercise is not designed only to protect the rights of the accused but is equally important to protect the public interest in this matter so that the Garda, the public and the authorities who will adjudicate on these matters, ultimately in a trial, will have an independent record of what happened while such interrogation was taking place.</P>
      <P>I am pressing this amendment in the belief that, while putting other measures in place, it is equally important we ensure that specific provisions, such as audio visual recording of interviews and medical treatment of persons with an addiction to controlled substances, be properly implemented during their detention.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(11) the Minister for Justice shall place before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the operation of this section not later than 11 months after an order under section 10 (2) of this Act is made.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is no need for lengthy discussion on this amendment.  In light of the powers conferred by this legislation, its operation should be reviewed by the Oireachtas on an 11 month basis.  I note the Minister for Justice in amendment No. 25 provides for a report to be laid before the House on the operation of the detention section.  My amendment merely provides that the Minister for Justice would place a report before the House in relation to the operation of the detention section.  We are <i>ad idem</i> and there is no need for me to proceed further.  I welcome the Minister's amendment and will withdraw mine because they are quite similar.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 8 would appear to oblige the Minister to report on the operation of section 2 only. Given the nature of the debate on the Bill to date, and arising from a commitment the Minister gave on Committee Stage to look at the need to report to the Houses on the operation of certain sections, it would appear to be more appropriate to widen the scope of the reporting requirement.  Having examined the matter the Minister is proposing amendment No. 25 which will oblige the Minister for Justice to prepare a report on the operation of sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and have the report laid before each House of the Oireachtas before any resolution seeking to have the sections continued in operation as required in section 10 (1) is passed.</P>
      <P>It would have been difficult for Members to debate the issues properly prior to approving the continuation in operation of certain sections without the necessary information on the way the sections have been operating.  This report will enable the Members of each House to see how the sections have worked before they decide on continuing them in operation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2355" /> In page 8, to delete lines 32 to 37 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Section 2 of the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsections after subsection (8):</P>
    <P>(9) An officer of the Customs and Excise in the course of exercising any power under this section of this Act, may ask a person any question provided that, if the officer is of the opinion that the person has committed or is committing any criminal offence in respect of which the officer is exercising a power under this Act, he shall inform the person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  of his suspicion,</P>
    <P>(b)  that the person is not legally obliged to answer any questions put to him,</P>
    <P>(c)  that the answers given to any questions may be given in evidence in any prosecution brought against him.</P>
    <P>(10) Any question put to a person and the answers, if any, given to those questions shall, as soon as is practicable, be recorded in writing by an officer of the Customs and Excise and read over to the person at the termination of the interview or as soon as is practicable, thereafter.</P>
    <P>(11) Any failure by an officer of the Customs and Excise to observe the provisions of subsections (9) and (10) of this section, shall not of itself affect the lawfulness of the power being exercised by the officer or the admissiblity in evidence of any statement or comment made by the person in respect of whom the power is being exercised.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2356" /> At present under section 6 the Customs and Excise officers may participate in the questioning of a person detained under sections 2 or 4 of the 1984 Act in relation to a drug trafficking offence. The section specifies that he may not commit any act or make any omission which, if committed or made by a member of the Garda Síochána, would be a contravention of any regulations made under section 7 of the 1984 Act.  The section gives various powers and indemnities &mdash; to use that general term &mdash; similar to those given to a Garda Síochána in the course of questioning.  The difficulty with this section is that while it gives the Customs and Excise officers powers to participate in questioning it does not give them power to question suspected drug traffickers on their own.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in seeking to grant Customs and Excise officers powers to question and detain suspects, has exacerbated rather than improved the situation.  It has to be remembered that the Customs and Excise service is often at the forefront of law enforcement in drug trafficking.  By not allowing the Customs and Excise officers to question suspected drug traffickers without the presence of a Garda Síochána, section 6 demonstrates a profound lack of knowledge on the part of its authors of the realities of modern day drug importation. Frequently it is the Customs and Excise service which first encounters drug smugglers.  They are without the necessary powers to question and interrogate suspected drug traffickers in the first few vital minutes after they have come upon them.  I had hoped the Minister would recognise this reality and provide in section 6 at the point when Customs and Excise officials first come in contact with the suspected drug traffickers that as a matter of urgency Customs and Excise officers would be allowed to question the suspected drug trafficker.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I will spell out in detail why it is necessary to give Customs and Excise officers the powers contained in the Fianna Fáil Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996, <Col N="2357" /> published in January and why they should have those powers to interrogate without a member of the Garda Síochána being present.  Customs and Excise officials are frequently the first persons to encounter drug traffickers.  It is quite clear there is no adequate statutory power to enable them to question suspects in what I regard as the vital first moments.</P>
    <P>Widespread confusion exists as to whether the judge's rules apply to Customs and Excise officers.  These rules are relevant in this context because Chief Justice O'Higgins in The People <i>v</i> Farrell, 1978 <i>Irish Reports</i>, described the judges' rules as not rules of law but rules for the guidance of persons taking statements.  However, they have stood the test of time and will be departed from at peril.</P>
    <P>Agricultural officers are entitled to utilise judges' rules when investigating breaches of the animal remedies Acts and the same should apply to Customs and Excise officers.  The existing legal confusion can render comments made by suspects after detention by Customs and Excise officers inadmissible at trial. A statutory scheme to enable Customs and Excise officials to question suspects in the absence of a garda is both desirable and absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>As the Minister's Bill, if enacted, will be a criminal statue it will have to be construed strictly.  The courts will have to take the view that when it comes to questioning by Customs and Excise officials, the only powers conferred on Customs and Excise officials are the powers contained in the Bill.  This will result in potentially relevant answers being ruled inadmissible.  I had hoped the Minister would request her officials to look again at the situation.  When Customs and Excise officers are at a port of entry or wherever they may come across suspected drug traffickers, quite often the Garda Síochána will not be present.  There is no good reason I can think of or anybody has suggested to me that Customs and Excise officers should not have the power to question suspected drug traffickers without the <Col N="2358" /> necessity for a Garda presence.  It is in the first crucial moments that drug traffickers may feel at their most vulnerable. It is important that the Minister of State, the Department and the Government take my amendment on board.</P>
    <P>My amendment is straightforward and makes it perfectly clear that an officer of Customs and Excise in exercising any power under this section of the Act may ask a person any question provided he is of the opinion that the person has committed or is committing a criminal offence in respect of which the officer is exercising power under this Act.  The amendment tabled is lucid.  The Customs and Excise officer will have to advise the suspect of his suspicion, that he is not legally obliged to answer any question put to him, although with the proposed later amendment to the right to silence, account will have to be taken that the judges' rules on this caution will, of necessity, require amendment, that he says the answers given to any question may be used in any prosecution brought against him.</P>
    <P>We go on to provide that any questions put to a person and the answers given will be taken down in writing as soon as possible by the officer of Customs and Excise and read over to the person at the termination of the interview or as soon as is practicable thereafter. If some of the technical procedures are breached by the Customs and Excise officer in exercising the powers which we are attempting to confer on them under this section, this shall not of itself affect the lawfulness of the power being exercised by the officer or the admissibility in evidence of any statement or comment made by the person in respect of whom the power is being exercised.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the debate in as trenchant a criticism as I could muster of the Government, in relation to its attitude to crime, Deputy Shatter made clear his great displeasure at the efforts made by the Government to date to tackle the problem.  My party and I share his frustration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2359" /> In putting forward this proposal in the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996 we were saying to the Government that it was time to change the law so that it would reflect a changed society and that society, in turn, might be changed for the better. Our attempts to do so with this amendment on Committee Stage were frustrated. I am sure the Minister of State will acknowledge that the Fianna Fáil Party is not engaged in a legal manoeuvre, that this has not been put forward for political expediency, as an academic exercise or an exercise in philosophy or theory but as a concrete and practical measure to tackle the problem. I respectfully recommend to him that this amendment which has been refused a reasonable hearing to date should be accepted by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to delete subsections (1) to (3) of section 6.  They would remove entirely from the Bill the provisions relating to allowing Customs officers to be present at and participate in the questioning of persons detained by the Garda Síochána. In their place they would provide for the amendment of section 2 of the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988 with the purported aim of giving Customs officers additional powers to stop and question persons.  These are identical to the provisions of section 4 of the Deputy's Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996.</P>
      <P>The amendments are not acceptable primarily for the reason that they go beyond what is appropriate in the context of this Bill and would eliminate the sensible provisions it contains dealing with Customs and Garda co-operation. In devising its proposals for special organisational measures to be taken in tackling organised crime the Government is prepared to bring forward any legislation conferring additional powers which may be required.</P>

      <P>On this proposal <Col N="2360" /> the attitude of the Government has changed little since Committee Stage.  I would be amenable to accepting a reasonable amendment which would allow an officer of the Customs and Excise not just to put questions and interrogate on his or her own but to do so in the presence of members of the Garda Síochána.  With all the resources of the Department of Justice and the Office of the Attorney General behind it, it would have been easy for the Government to frame a simple amendment to meet the concerns expressed by the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The view of the Minister for Justice has changed slightly since Committee Stage in that the Minister of State said that the Government is prepared to look at the matter in the context of organised crime and is willing to consider legislation to tackle it.  Is this not the precise point Deputy Shatter was making?  He is unhappy with the manner in which the matter has been dealt with and cannot in conscience say that the answers given by the Minister of State in the House on 19 June represent what he would consider to be an adequate response to a serious problem.</P>
      <P>Through this and many other amendments, as well as legislation, during the past 18 months, long before organised crime decided that it could spread its evil tentacles into civilian life, I have put forward on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party practical and pragmatic measures which have been refused.  I must press the amendment to illustrate the Government's unwillingness to accept the reality which, whether it likes it or not, ultimately must be faced.  This amendment takes account of that reality.</P>

      <P>The shooting of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe a few weeks ago was one of the most shocking crimes to have occurred in this jurisdiction for a considerable time.  Although we have got used to killing, the nature of this crime &mdash; the murder of a garda by the IRA in the course of his duty &mdash; and the cold-blooded savagery of the manner in which it was carried out, made it uniquely awful.  Little did we know what was in store for us.  In the same way as the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe by the IRA caused the Government to revisit certain democratic certainties, such as the folly of backsliding on the threat posed to our State by paramilitary subversives mobilising within this jurisdiction and making bombs for use in England and elsewhere, the murder of Veronica Guerin jolted this lethargic and selfdeluded Government into agreeing the terms of this motion, which include reforms of the criminal justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The murder of Veronica Guerin marked a new low in Irish criminality. She was not shot because an attempted crime went wrong or because she was hindering a getaway.  She was shot because she dared to expose things somebody did not want exposed.  Her assassination sent a message we ignore at our peril, namely, that some people will stop at nothing.  They consider themselves above our laws.  Those untouchables will claim the right to a fair trial while intimidating those who would testify against them.  They rob banks and launder the proceeds of their crimes through the same institutions. The only time they pay tax is when they launder the proceeds of their crimes through tax amnesties.  They use the newspapers to build up a reputation based on fear and then shoot the <Col N="2366" /> journalists.  They use the proceeds of crime to buy respect in the same communities they have devasted with drugs. It is obvious that the criminal justice system has failed to stop these people and it is equally obvious that we must radically amend the system to stop them. We have tried before but failed.  This time we must get it right.</P>
    <P>This motion on crime was tabled by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil following the murder of Veronica Guerin.  It has forced the Government to concede at long last the measures contained in the Prosecution of Offences and the Punishment of Crimes Bill, 1996, introduced by the Progressive Democrats last Feburary but spectacularly voted down by this administration. The Government, on the run from the public who are rightly outraged at the level of inactivity and the inadaquacy of our laws to deal with serious crime, appears to have resolved the ideological difference which has paralysed it for the past two years.  It accepted a Fianna Fáil Private Member's Bill on illicit assets and has promised a constitutional referendum on bail.  It will spectacularly and with great media aplomb launch its proposals at Government Buildings later this evening.  It will wrap around itself in glory the measures it so recently dismissed with contempt.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition did not have the support of the public in pressing for reforms and forcing the Government to deal with this matter, nothing would have been done.  The Government has been persistently contemptuous of the Opposition and voted down every constructive proposal it put forward which could have made a difference.  It has not respected the Dáil.  Government Members voted down measures which in their hearts they support.</P>
    <P>Our February 1996 Bill aimed to restructure the creaking criminal justice prosecution service.  It put forward proposals to change the bail law, confronted the issue of the right to silence in serious cases, called for the modernisation of our criminal courts and sought to speed up criminal prosecutions.  It <Col N="2367" /> tried to tackle the revolving door chaos in our prisons.  Those constructive proposals were dismissed with contempt by this administration, but the Minister has suddenly decided she can no longer ignore them.</P>
    <P>I did not pretend that the present chaos in our prosecution system or in the courts and prisons was the personal responsibility of the Minister for Justice, but it has been her responsibility for the past two years.  Our Bill provided for major change in the laws relating to the prosecution of offences, criminal procedures relating to accused persons, the extent of the right to silence, bail, control and management of the prison service, sentencing and the law on temporary release.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the revolving door syndrome in our prison system. I am sure you, Sir, consider that, from time to time, we have a revolving debate on certain issues relating to criminal justice reform.  We have had a revolving, frustrating and repetitive debate on this matter and a disgraceful failure to bring about the changes everybody agrees are necessary.  The Government voted down all our measures but now, almost casually, concedes to them in order to give a signal to the public that there is consensus on the need for reform.</P>
    <P>When we introduced our Bill last February, the Minister for Justice said its provisions were &ldquo;fundamentally unsound&rdquo; and &ldquo;glaringly unconstitutional&rdquo;. She said the Bill was novel but not new, &ldquo;like the curate's egg, it may be good in parts&rdquo;.  She claimed the charge that there was an ideological difference and conflict between the Government parties on the issue of bail was &ldquo;fanciful nonsense&rdquo; and promised a decision on the bail issue in a matter of weeks.  That was on 27 February 1996. She stated that there were constitutional difficulties with the legislative bail proposals we put forward, but she now supports them.  The Minister claimed that the questioning of suspects by judicial officers, which will be nodded through under this motion, was radical and <Col N="2368" /> redundant.  When I spoke at length on the real need for reform of our prisons and their management and for planning for adequate prison spaces, she accused me of attacking civil servants.  When Deputy John O'Donoghue legitimately questioned her as to the timing of the publication of the Law Reform Commission's report on bail, she called Deputy O'Donoghue an idiot.</P>
    <P>I remind the House of comments by Deputy Dukes on the proposals in my Bill.  He said that they were &ldquo;nothing less than a fraud&rdquo; and he accused me of &ldquo;nauseating populism&rdquo;.  He also made a most unparliamentary and sexist comment, which, had I been in the House when he made it, I would have asked him formally to withdraw.  He accused the Progressive Democrats of charging into the Dáil on a white law and order charger and declared there was no good reason for doing the daft things proposed in our Bill.  What does Deputy Dukes say now?  I have said before, that much of Deputy Dukes's comments derive from an embittered heart.</P>
    <P>This Government has acceded to our proposal for a unified prosecution service. This interesting proposal came from the DPP in an article in communiqué magazine.  When I read the DPP's comments about the absurd duplications and delays in the current prosecution service, over which he has control, I asked the Taoiseach, who has direct responsibility for the Director of Public Prosecutions in the House, for his response.  As usual, the Taoiseach transferred the question to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>When in due course it was replied to by the Minister for Justice, I was flabbergasted to hear that she had not discussed these publicly expressed comments with the Director, not did she intend to do so.  She said she had met him socially but that the independence of his Office precluded her from discussing this matter with him.  That is the sort of nonsense that has this Government in the mess it is in.  The Minister for Justice felt she was precluded from <Col N="2369" /> discussing with a most senior independent office holder of 20 years standing, proposals he had made publicly on defects in the prosecution service and now it is being nodded through without a blush by this Administration.</P>
    <P>If ever there was an issue which has been well debated in this House, it is bail.  Not a week goes by, not a Justice Question Time is taken, and not an Order of Business is debated without a question on the law of bail and the need to reform it.  People are now saying that to change the law of bail will infringe civil liberties and we should not hastily introduce such changes.  There has been a need for constitutional reform of the law of bail since the early 1970s.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court's decision in the O'Callaghan case has been called a liberal bridgehead.  It was a liberal bridgehead too far, however, in that it guarantees that any person arrested and accused of a serious offence will be set at liberty pending his trial unless there is evidence to suggest that he probably will either not turn up for trial or will interfere with the proper conduct of the trial by interfering with witnesses.  Even if there is evidence that the accused will probably commit crimes while on bail, there is that guarantee.  That is a ludicrous guarantee available in this jurisdiction and not in any other country.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the only country in which the right to trial in due course and the constitutional right to liberty of the individual have been interpreted as giving an absolute guarantee to an accused person of his right to liberty unless, as a matter of probability, he will fail one of the two tests mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell, contributing to a debate on bail in this House, said there was a neat logic to the O'Callaghan case but that type of logic is detached from present reality.  The traditional notion of being innocent until proved guilty must be balanced against the fact that nowadays many criminals are persistent offenders.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for saying I believe in preventative detention if there is evidence that the public will be <Col N="2370" /> at risk should the accused go free pending trial.  We have consistently argued that to change the bail laws without providing adequate prison spaces would be a recipe for disaster, and I welcome the fact that the Minister has not got the support of Government to go ahead with a building programme to provide adequate jail spaces.  To run a criminal justice system without adequate prison spaces is like trying to run a tourist industry without adequate hotel rooms. Neither the rehabilitation of the accused or public safety can be achieved if we do not have space in which to place people who have been convicted by the courts, or those who are awaiting trial before the courts, and who would be a threat to the public if released pending trial.</P>
    <P>On the right to silence, I welcome the fact that the Government has committed itself in a Bill that has just been passed to accept one aspect of reform curtailing the absolute right to silence while in police custody, without a court being able to draw any adverse inferences from that silence.  The curtailment of the absolute right to silence should also be applied to other serious crimes such as murder.  I hope the Government will bring forward proposals to deal comprehensively with a reasoned curtailment of the absolute right to silence.</P>
    <P>These rights date back to a period when the rights of the accused were much more limited.  The accused had no right to speak at his trial or even to be legally represented.  The right to silence in police custody arose from the need to avoid the risk of untrue confessions being made as a result of oppressive questioning.  Because of this risk we accept that a person should not be forced to answer questions while in police custody.</P>
    <P>In relation to drug trafficking and the restrictions on the right to silence, I have already argued that we should be in a position to provide for an audiovisual record of all interrogations of suspects while in police custody.  It is in the interests of the accused as well as the <Col N="2371" /> authorities to provide for an independent record of all questioning of suspects while in custody, particularly if that detention is for long periods of time.  We have to take account of the fact that technology can now provide us with an independent record of interrogation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bring forward comprehensive reforms not only of the right to silence while in police custody, but also a curtailment of the right to remain silent while on trial without any adverse inference being drawn from that silence.</P>
    <P>There have been many debates in this House on prison reform.  Most recently the report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee was, in part, unpublishable because it contained such damning criticism of the prison service including the medical service being provided in that institution.  What proposals will the Minister bring forward on foot of that report which contained such criticism of our prison service?</P>
    <P>When I raised all these issues I was accused by the Minister of attacking civil servants.  The guts of the offensive and potentially libellous findings of the committee in relation to the medical service was that it provided no more that a sheep dip of a medical service to the prison.  Some 40 prisoners were seen in one hour and there are other inadequacies. What is the Government's response to sorting out the problem relating to the medical service in Mountjoy?</P>
    <P>This Government has made very few decisions.  It has been marked out as an Administration which has failed to take decisions across a range of areas.  The one decision it took, to cancel the prison building programme, was a bad one.</P>
    <P>We have consistently moved to change the law on temporary release but, as yet, no proposals or recommendations have been forthcoming from the Government on it.  We were accused of over reaction when we called for serious consideration of a state of emergency that exists here.  The State is weak on <Col N="2372" /> subversives and turns a blind eye to private army using this country to prepare bombs for use in another jurisdiction. A state that is weak in terms of that type of crime leaves itself open to being perceived as weak in terms of organised crime.  The Government is self-deluded and lethargic.  It is only because of the deaths of Veronica Guerin and Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and the massive public outrage following those deaths that the Government is conceding to the measures we have consistently proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party I have been deeply concerned at the threats posed to communities all over the country from organised crime, which is often drug related.  Soon after my election as Leader of Fianna Fáil I requested an examination of the legislative provisions which other countries have introduced in the battle against organised crime. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to consult with a number of legal experts in the United States, including senior prosecutors in drug related cases, officials involved in the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime, officials responsible for drafting criminal law statutes, a professor of criminal law at a leading American university and judges and defence lawyers engaged in the day-to-day implementation of law designed to deal with organised crime in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not all laws translate in the Irish situation without some, or perhaps even substantial amendments.  This is a task which requires careful examination and has been undertaken by the chairperson of the committee dealing with crime and our spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue. The principal legislative tools which this small but senior group of judges, academics and practising lawyers regard as essential include the Bail Reform Act, 1984, the Rico anti-racketeering law and a law specifically <Col N="2373" /> designed to deal with continued criminal enterprises where controlled businesses make substantial profits from crime.</P>
    <P>I little thought I would have to refer to this matter in the context of the murder of a person I knew well, but that is the sad reality.  The murder of Veronica Guerin, following so soon after the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and a spate of other murders, has cast a shadow over the safety and freedom of our democracy.  That shadow will remain as long as the killers and those who motivated them are at liberty.  It will last as long as we continue to tolerate the unhindered existence in our society of criminals who have brazenly accumulated vast and unexplained wealth and regard themselves as untouchable regardless of the crimes they have committed or conspired to organise.  As legislators it is our duty to banish that shadow and to ensure that the law enforcement agencies have the resources necessary to protect all members of society.</P>
    <P>The most basic civil liberties issue is the right to life and bodily integrity, to one's personal possessions and one's personal freedom.  The arguments for the unrestricted right to silence of an accused or the preservation of antiquated bail laws are academic by comparison. This House has the power and ability to push back the wave of crime. The question we must decide is whether we will exercise that power and that ability.  The time for rhetoric, slick soundbites and empty promises has passed.  Now is the time for action.  Now is the time for us to set out in a reflective and calculated way what we propose to do about organised crime.  The time for reviews, reports and surveys is over.  This is the time for considered action.  Veronica Guerin had some of the answers.  She knew what motivated organised crime.  Last Sunday her recorded voice was clear and unambiguous. She said that drug barons are motivated by one thing, that is greed, avarice.  The simple truth of that sentence is a signpost in the direction we <Col N="2374" /> must travel.  While we must react in a calm and considered way, we must ensure a well worked out agenda, which should have been put in place long before now.</P>
    <P>Petty criminals have built up mini empires of crime, gaining great wealth and power along the way.  For as long as we are prepared to tolerate criminals retaining the proceeds of their wrongdoing, it will be evident that crime pays. People with vast and unexplained wealth who consider themselves to be untouchable, to date have been untouchable.  Our detection services have not been able to fully penetrate this web of criminal activity and nip it in the bud for a variety of reasons, but there is no reason in logic or in law that it should be allowed continue.</P>
    <P>In 1985 this House moved swiftly to freeze the assets of illegal organisations. The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill of that year was published on 18 February.  On 19 February it was signed into law by the President and on 20 February the Minister for Justice used the powers conferred by that Act to freeze assets in a bank account in Navan, County Meath.  That is the speed with which a democracy must act to protect itself and it is the speed with which we should now act.  This House has the power to introduce legislation which would permit the freezing of the assets of those who are a threat to the fabric of democracy.  We have used that power in the past and it has proven to be constitutionally sound.  Mr. Justice Barrington described the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1985, as &ldquo;a permissible delimitation of property rights, in the interests of the common good&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no reason drug barons should be treated more favourably than members of illegal organisations.  There is no reason they should be permitted to enjoy their illicit assets without the most severe and stringent efforts of the State to deny them that enjoyment.  The only potential impediment to the assets of drug barons and organised criminals being seized is political will.  This House <Col N="2375" /> has the political will to turn these people out of their mansions.  With that political will and our determination to eradicate this scourge we must freeze their assets and force them to explain from where they came.</P>
    <P>I speak today not only for the Fianna Fáil Party but for thousands of citizens who are demanding urgent action.  The Ceann Comhairle kindly allowed me, on the Order of Business, on 15 or 16 occasions in this calendar year to raise issues relating to serious criminal acts. At many public meetings on crime, attended by the Minister of State, suggestions were put forward, but on every occasion proposals were put to the Government, it rejected the case put forward by our spokesperson and by Deputy O'Donnell of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I do not often criticise Ministers or Ministers of State in going about their business, but I feel aggrieved that, having spent practically all weekend dealing with this issue, discussing it with Ministers and holding late night meetings with my colleagues, some of whom had to come back from the country, at the time I, as Leader of the biggest party in the country, was about to stand up to make my contribution, the Government went to a press conference.  Does it really want our co-operation on crime or does it want to defeat us in a propaganda war on who gets the headline tomorrow?  I am interested in doing something about crime and I am glad there is a considerable number of Deputies on the Opposition side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week we published the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996. That Bill which had been in preparation for months by our spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue, as part of our anti-drugs initiative, was published last week because it was needed to send out the strongest possible message that we are serious about winning the battle and winning back the streets from the criminals. The organised crime Bill hits at the motivating factor behind the drugs barons.  It is a direct attack on the produce of their greed and avarice.  It must be enacted into law now.  I welcome the decision of the Government to accept the Bill in principle.  I ask it sincerely and earnestly to accelerate its passage through this House so that it becomes law before the end of the month.  Acting to implement it should follow immediately thereafter.</P>
      <P>The passage of legislation would part the mobsters from their ill-gotten assets and would represent a start, but by no means an end, to the war against organised crime.  We need to remove the legal impediments that stand in the way of convicting criminals.</P>
      <P>We must also consider whether we require a grand jury pre-trial investigative procedure, such as exists in the United States, to aid the Garda in the investigation of such crimes, which would be of a quasi-judicial nature.  I am aware that even though the laws of the majority of our EU partners are not based on the common law system, they have a system of pre-trial investigation designed to supplement a police inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other devices include the provision of a proper system of granting immunity from prosecution to witnesses prepared to give evidence against crime bosses, as well as a witness protection programme <Col N="2377" /> and the introduction of a properly structured system of plea bargaining to encourage criminals to give evidence against each other, ensuring more convictions in exchange for a lesser sentence.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government today to announce the establishment of a witness protection programme modelled on the one in operation in the United States. We need to give a guarantee to potential witnesses so that they and their families are protected after giving evidence. Some of these provisions have been in operation in the United States for more than ten years without any erosion of civil liberties.</P>
    <P>If protecting witnesses is vital and central to this whole issue, so too is providing speedy trials.  The delays now between arrest and trial are wholly unacceptable.  A delay of two years or more in the Central Criminal Court between the arrest of a person on a serious charge is unacceptable and a problem the Government can address. In four weeks' time, the Central Criminal Court will cease its sittings for a period of nine weeks when the backlog of cases awaiting trial has never been greater.  There is no good reason the Central Criminal Court cannot sit in five separate divisions during the legal vacation to make a substantial inroad into its backlog.  I ask the Minister to arrange for this to be done.</P>
    <P>The position in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court is also unacceptable. Almost 1,000 serious criminal cases come before that court each year yet only three judges are permanently available to deal with the work.  Cases now ready for trial before the court are having dates for trial fixed in February 1997, those cases have already spent months before the District Court and the continuing delay is unacceptable to victims and the public alike.  Again, this is a problem the Government can address.</P>
    <P>The appointment of judges does not achieve anything on its own and is not sufficient.  They must have appropriate back-up.  It is necessary also to appoint <Col N="2378" /> sufficient registrars, stenographers, and court officials to enable the criminal courts to function properly.  The necessary people should be appointed now and emergency sittings in the Circuit Criminal Court should take place throughout August and September.</P>
    <P>Improving the physical infrastructure and personnel levels of the courts will have some effect on the rate at which criminal justice is dispensed, but reform of the legal mechanisms of the courts is necessary for the efficient administration of justice.  On 8 June 1995 Fianna Fáil published a Criminal Procedure Bill designed to guarantee trial on serious criminal offences within 90 days of arrest unless that time is extended by the High Court.  The Bill identified the present system of preliminary examination in the District Court as being expensive, time consuming and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>We sought to abolish right to a preliminary examination in drugs cases in the Misuse of Drugs Bill which we published earlier this year.  That Bill was voted down and it remains the position that every person who goes before the Circuit or Central Criminal Court for trial has an absolute right to have every witness attend at the District Court to have their evidence written down in longhand by a court clerk.  That has to change.  We have published our proposals for change.  Let the Minister publish her proposals, but change there must be.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement last Friday that the Government will hold a referendum on bail on broadly similar terms to the Fianna Fáil Bill.  That is an obvious and necessary change which is long overdue.  Other changes are overdue also.  The absence of an adequate number of prison spaces sends a strong message that we are not serious about crime.  The fragmentation of approach by different State agencies sends out a similar message, and all that must change.</P>
    <P>I welcome the belated acknowledgment that the prison at Castlerea and the new women's prison in Mountjoy <Col N="2379" /> are necessary and that accommodation will be provided in a new prison at Wheatfield, but much time has been lost.</P>
    <P>Last year, with some fanfare, the Government announced the recruitment over time of 1,000 additional gardaí.  That did not involve any net increase in Garda strength but was designed to give the public that misleading impression that it did.  What effect will additional gardaí have on the permanent strength of the Garda Síochána as that is all that really counts?</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months Fianna Fáil has published nine separate criminal justice Bills setting out our views on the direction in which our society must move. They cover suggested reform of the criminal law in a variety of different areas including bail, criminal procedure, the proceeds of crime, mental disorder, sexual offences and drug trafficking. The absolute priority we have given in Opposition to this issue in Private Members' time is a clear indication of the priority we intend to give it when we return to Government.</P>

      <P>As a community we have now embarked on a war to row back the level of crime.  That war must be waged relentlessly and must be won. It must be directed at lifting the shadow which hangs over our democracy.  It demands and deserves the support of all and the first battle will take place today in this House, on it will depend a vigorous and effective anti-crime campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of urgent national interest we need to deal with our present bail law; freeze the assets of suspected criminals; grant immunity to witnesses; a much speedier court system; <Col N="2380" /> more judges and court personnel; pre-trial investigative procedures; more prison spaces and additional gardaí in real terms.</P>
    <P>We must not allow any other agenda to deflect us from this vital first step in battling against the criminal forces who thought they could continue to act with impunity, who had a brazen disregard for our forces of law and order and who felt they could take the lives of a detective garda and a journalist.  Let us make all the necessary changes soon in this House.</P>
    <P>Today the Fianna Fáil Front Bench, with other parties I am sure, discussed how far we can go and how much we can do in regard to this issue.  We had a balanced and detailed discussion of the civil liberties issue and how far we can go in that regard.  We also spoke about what must be done to turn crime back on the drug barons.  As a party we are conscious that we cannot go too far but it is our judgment, in the Bills we have produced, in this Private Members' motion and in the Bill we will debate later tonight, that we have a long way to go before we need concern ourselves in that regard.</P>
    <P>One year ago Deputy O'Donoghue committed our party to a White Paper on the whole criminal issue in which we would examine all the issues including civil liberties, prison space, types of crime and how far other countries have gone in this regard.  That announcement was made 12 months ago, not in the wake of the horrendous acts of recent days and weeks.  We will continue our work in this area but in the meantime the series of measures I and my colleagues have mentioned today, and those that will be referred to in the coming hours, will be debated and carefully examined.</P>
    <P>It is not just recently that members of the public became upset about crime; they have been upset for years.  We cannot continue to allow people to be forced out of their homes simply because drug barons do not like them.  We cannot continue to allow people to sell drugs on street corners simply because <Col N="2381" /> we are more interested in apprehending the godfathers.  We cannot continue to allow people to be chased out of the country or to be shot dead because they had an argument with somebody. People are being threatened and abused.  They are afraid to come forward as witnesses and that cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil intends to publish a co-ordinated plan that will examine the educational aspects of crime and how it is linked to unemployment and poverty. It is a fact that many people who were driven into a life of drugs would not have been so vulnerable if they had a job in a bank, the Civil Service or the insurance industry.  They are driven to the drug scene because their life is one of poverty and hard luck stories without any future.  We must remember that and we must work to get people employment. We also have a duty to protect the citizens on the streets.  As I said last week, if we cannot do that we are of no use to ourselves or to the people.</P>
    <P>I am glad to join with our colleagues in the Progressive Democrats to try to show the way forward.  If this Government has no ideas of its own and no leadership to give, it should at least have the grace to follow.</P>

People who are poor often have crime in their midst.  Deputy O'Donnell must address the consequences in social terms of the Progressive Democrats economic policies.  We must tackle crime, increase the number of prison places and change the laws, but we must do it in a balanced way.  We must attack not just crime but the causes of crime. That will cost money.  We must spend money on our education system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern spoke about consulting various people in the United States.  The United States is a model and a warning.  Many innovative developments there are worthy of copying or thinking about.

      <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern talked about a balanced debate.  A balanced debate must address crime and its causes.  We should have no illusions &mdash; organised crime is a threat to the security of the State.  If organised crime goes unchecked, it has the potential to subvert the institutions of the State and to make life impossible for decent lawabiding citizens.  There are many examples throughout the world of the damage which organised crime can do to the fabric of society.  I recently spoke to a congressman from New York city about the crime problem there.  Organised crime is clever and international. The changes in technology in the past decades have facilitated organised crime in a way nobody conceived was possible. Organised crime is a cancer which eats <Col N="2385" /> away at civilised society and seeks to render it helpless.</P>
      <P>The basic tenet of any democratic society is the primacy of the rule of law. Organised crime is nothing more than an all out assault on this principle. Criminals have shown contempt for the principles on which the State has been founded.  For these criminals, freedom of the press, as represented by Veronica Guerin, is an inconvenience to be ruthlessly brushed aside and suppressed when necessary.</P>
      <P>Her murder in broad daylight at a busy city traffic junction demonstrates the extent to which criminals believe they can operate without fear of the law. It is up to us in this House to show them that they are gravely mistaken in this assumption.  We can do this by action and that is what this Government is doing &mdash; taking action to tackle, once and for all, the menace of organised crime.</P>

Criminals have shown contempt for the principles on which the State has been founded. For those criminals freedom of the press and the murder of Veronica Guerin is an inconvenience to be ruthlessly brushed aside and suppressed when necessary.  The murder of Veronica in broad daylight at a busy city traffic lights junction demonstrates the extent to which criminals believe they can operate without fear of the law.  It is up to us in this House to show them they are gravely mistaken in that assumption. We can do that by action.  That is what the Government is doing; it is taking action to tackle once and for all the menace of organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addressing the threat posed by organised crime and developing an effective response, we must subject it to <Col N="2386" /> a rigorous and dispassionate analysis. The emergence of organised crime occurred in parallel with the growth and development of the drugs problem.  That is not to imply that the drugs trade is the only organised criminal activity.  On the contrary criminal groupings are involved in a number of wide-ranging activities.  However, it is the emergence of a lucrative drugs trade which, more than anything else, has shaped the nature and structure of organised crime. Drawing from the American experience, the extraordinary volumes of money that can be made in the organised drugs trade make it unparalleled in terms of the history of crime and make exceptional measures appropriate and necessary.  For that reason the Minister for Justice and her colleagues, the Ministers for Health and Education, have been implementing a series of measures, agreed by Government last year, to deal with the drugs problem.  Much has been achieved on a number of fronts: law enforcement, legislation, prevention, education and treatment.  I say to members of the Progressive Democrats that a balanced programme, which addresses the cause and the criminal aspect, is essential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>It delivers quite a lot in those areas where it has begun to work. In 1983 when Dublin had a heroin epidemic a type of balanced approach between taking action against the criminals and investment including, as Deputy Ahern said, an attempt to create jobs, was needed.  Those two aspects of crime must be dealt with if we are to beat the godfathers of crime.</P>
      <P>As profits have been made from drug trafficking and dealing, they have been invested.  Legitimate businesses can be bought and operate, to all practical purposes, within the law.  We must focus on these assets.  The key to our new approach is to intensify what we have been doing for some time already, targeting the proceeds and assets of criminal activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2387" /> The Government decided this will require a new type of anti-crime unit, one that will involve the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, which I am particularly keen to see established. It requires a good deal of planning, but that type of agency, with special powers that can draw on the expertise and co-operation of the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, will produce results. Last month the Government instructed the various Departments and agencies involved to come up with improved arrangements and they were given a deadline of 18 July.</P>
    <P>The murder of Veronica Guerin has given this task an even more urgent impetus.  Last week the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance addressed high-ranking officials from all the Departments and agencies concerned and gave them the task of devising the structure of the new unit and the arrangements and procedures which will govern its operations as a matter of urgency.  A report on those lines will be submitted shortly.  The Minister for Justice will be in a position to deal with this in detail when the Dáil reconvenes on 25 July.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice today announced further major resources, for which she has Government approval, to assist and enhance the Garda response to crime.  They include an accelerated recruitment of an additional 400 gardaí over the next 12 months, in addition to 350 recruits already planned for in the current recruitment campaign.  The intake of additional recruits will commence at the end of this month and will be completed in October next year.  In answer to Deputy Ahern's earlier point, taking into account retirements etc., this additional recruitment campaign will bring the strength of the force to over 11,000 when the new recruits have completed the first three phases of their training, 62 weeks, and have been assimilated to the strength of the force. <Col N="2388" /> Another response is the immediate activation of the civilianisation programme in the Garda Síochána through the recruitment of 200 civilians to release a comparable number of gardaí to operational duties.  There are already 150 posts occupied by gardaí identified and agreed with the Garda authorities as suitable for civilianisation and the Minister expects very early progress in identifying the remaining 50.  It is expected that those proposals will be fully implemented between now and early next year.</P>
    <P>The allocation of Garda personnel and resources is the responsibility of the Garda authorities and, in particular, senior Garda management.  It is something which must be kept under continuous review and changes made as necessary. Change, flexibility, innovation, additions and adjustments are inherent in the area of the allocation of Garda personnel and resources within the State.  The organisational issue is as important as the introduction of legislation. It is necessary to develop appropriate organisational responses to unprecedented threats and developments resulting from the activities of criminals.</P>
    <P>In the past year the Minister for Justice has undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure that the Garda have the means necessary to tackle crime.  These include a closed circuit television system established in the Temple Bar area of Dublin on a pilot basis; a Garda national drugs unit established in July 1995 under the control of a Deputy Commissioner and an increase in the number of youth diversion projects in operation in urban areas throughout the country from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I have been involved in the development of those initiatives.  Those involving youth workers working with local gardaí and other local agencies in deprived areas such as Cherry Orchard, parts of Tallaght and Blanchardstown are very effective in keeping youths at risk from falling into the criminal system.</P>

      <P>Why does the Minister of <Col N="2389" /> State not bring forward the Juvenile Justice Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a practical measure which gives young people who may be at risk an alternative.  In the context of reducing the number of young men, in particular, who engage in criminal activity in the long-term, those types of projects are essential.  If the Deputy is aware of those projects in the Cork area she will appreciate how well they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State does not have to tell me anything about juveniles in crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The other initiatives include additional funding to enable the Garda transport fleet to be replaced in a five year cycle and a regional command structure created in January this year.  It was the first major change to the organisational structure of the force since the foundation of the State.  The reorganisation of the force on a regional basis will provide a much more co-ordinated and cohesive approach on tackling, on an operational basis, all facets of crime, particularly mobile criminals.  Other measures include the expansion of the closed circuit television system to other areas and the expansion of the community based projects titled, youth diversion projects.</P>
      <P>The Minister is confident that with the measures introduced last year and in today's package the efforts of the Garda Síochána in combating crime have been greatly enhanced.  The Garda authorities continually review the deployment of the force and the criteria used for this deployment.</P>
      <P>In view of the very significant resources now being provided it is obvious that this review should extend to ensuring that the maximum effectiveness is achieved in deploying these resources and those currently available to the force and accordingly, the Minister would have no difficulty with the sentiments expressed in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenges of crime detection in <Col N="2390" /> the 1990s necessitate the availability of the most advanced and efficient technologies and the Government is determined to ensure that the Garda is geared to meet them.  The Minister is convinced of the major role information technology can play in assisting the Garda in its fight against crime.  The Garda Síochána relies heavily on information or, to use the professional term, intelligence.  The more it is enabled to access this information and correlate it in an appropriate manner, the greater will be its ability to prevent and detect crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, therefore, fully committed to the Garda information technology plan in which in excess of £26 million is being invested.  The plan is now at an advanced stage.  Already, approximately £5 million has been spent on the planning phases and on the purchase of equipment and work on the design and building of the systems will start within the next month.  The IT plan envisaged is a major and complex project encompassing approximately 17 administrative and operational Garda systems in an integrated structure in phase 1 of the plan.  It is anticipated that the new systems derived from the plan will provide for significant administrative and operational improvements in the Garda Síochána.  Not alone will it cut down the need for paperwork thus releasing members for operational duties, but it will provide the Garda with greatly enhanced capabilities in the investigation of major crime including drug trafficking and fraud.</P>
    <P>The new computerised fingerprint identification system &mdash; AFIS &mdash; which was formally inaugurated earlier in January, is the first major service delivered from the plan.  Preliminary results from the system shows a three-fold increase in fingerprint identifications since the new AFIS system was installed.  The new technology will ensure a rapid and comprehensive service to the operational force.  All scene of crime fingermarks submitted will be assessed for examination against the complete national fingerprint database, leading to <Col N="2391" /> the identification of a greater number of criminal suspects.  In the old manual system such searches took up to 500 man hours to complete.  The new AFIS system is capable of carrying out such searches in under ten minutes.</P>
    <P>The results this computerised finger-printing system is producing is clear evidence of the major role modern computer technology can play in the policing context.</P>
    <P>As well as providing the additional financial resources I have outlined, it is important that we provide a comprehensive and effective legislative frame-work geared to cope with the realities of crime.</P>
    <P>Before speaking about specific proposals there are two general points I should make about criminal law reform. The first is that, while some changes are clearly desirable, there is already in place a huge range of criminal justice legislation which is used daily to bring perpetrators of crime to justice.</P>
    <P>The second is that the Government accepts fully that this is no time to bring forward ill-considered proposals based on emotion rather than reason.  It would be disastrous if our response to recent tragic events were ultimately to perpetrate injustice rather than protect the community.  I can reassure the House on that score, because many of the proposals the Government is moving forward have already been subject to the type of searching analysis and painstaking assessment necessary to ensure that they are viable and appropriate responses.</P>
    <P>This is particularly the case in relation to bail.  There has been criticism in the House about the length of time it has taken to deal with this measure.  It is precisely because of the time taken in analysis in the Department of Justice and discussions between the Minister for Justice and her colleagues in Government that we are now in a position to agree fundamental changes in our bail laws.  The most important of <Col N="2392" /> these is the agreement to hold a referendum later this year to amend the Constitution to allow refusal of bail because of the danger of commission of serious offences.  People who have examined this issue in depth have fundamental concerns about the rights of the individual. The Minister can assure the House that the arrangements accompanying the amendment to the Constitution will contain appropriate safeguards.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed do not stop there.  We will also introduce new bail laws designed to tighten up on bail generally.  We will require cash or its equivalent to form part of bail.  Persons going bail will have to act as guarantor for good behaviour and lose the bail money they put up if the accused offends while on bail.  We will also take steps to strengthen the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 relating to consecutive sentences to ensure to the greatest extent possible that additional penalties are imposed when offences are committed by people while on bail.</P>
    <P>Probably the strongest message of all to the criminal fraternity was the imposition of consecutive sentences in a number of recent court cases.  By Irish judicial standards, extremely long sentences imposed in two recent cases will cause far more disturbance to professional criminals than anything else, including the recent debate in this House.  When people who have committed offences while on bail, are sentenced to 20 years imprisonment it transmits a very powerful message.  That legislation has been in place for some time but its application in recent cases will have greater effect on those contemplating committing offences while on bail.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made clear to the House on a number of occasions that she has been reviewing the laws on the right to silence.  In the context of that review she tabled an amendment today to restrict the right to silence in drug trafficking cases.  As the House will be aware, the amendment will allow inferences to be drawn from the failure of an accused to disclose matters which could <Col N="2393" /> reasonably have been expected to have been mentioned during Garda questioning. The drug trafficking Bill provided the legislative vehicle to allow this change to be made.  The Minister is continuing her review of the whole question to see whether further restrictions would be justified and effective.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned the drug trafficking Bill, it is worth noting that this measure which among other things allows for periods of detention of up to seven days in drug trafficking cases, is one of the strongest criminal law Bills ever introduced in this House.  It passes the key test which is that the measures it contains are proportional to the problem it addresses.  The House will be asked this week to agree to orders under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 to enable Ireland to play its role in the international fight against the drugs menace.</P>
    <P>Work is well advanced in the Department of Justice on a wide range of new criminal justice measures.  These include Bills dealing with juvenile justice, non-fatal offences against the person, fraud and criminal insanity.  The proposals in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill have already been approved by the Government.  The Minister is pleased to be able to announce to the House that the Bill will be published shortly with a view to its introduction in time for our special sitting on 25 July dependent on clearance by the Attorney General's office.  It will represent a very substantial legislative contribution to the fight against crime. It contains measures improving the efficiency of court procedures and reducing the amount of time spent by gardaí in courts.  It will also provide for the issue of search warrants in connection with the investigation of serious crimes.</P>
    <P>The existing procedures for giving evidence of arrest and other matters in our courts occupies a vast amount of Garda time &mdash; time that could be better spent preventing and detecting crime. These procedures also take up much court time.  The Bill will provide for a <Col N="2394" /> new system of written Garda evidence of arrest, charge and caution to be provided in court by way of certificate.  This should yield substantial savings in Garda time as it will avoid the need for gardaí to attend court in respect of many of these hearings and will also help to expedite criminal procedure in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill will reduce the amount of Garda time taken up by escorting prisoners to and from court by providing that the court where the accused first appears can remand him or her in custody to a court nearer the prison where the accused is held.  The Bill will also extend from eight days to a maximum of 15 days the existing statutory limit for remanding an accused person in custody on a second or subsequent appearance of the accused in court resulting in less frequent remand hearings.  In addition, existing restrictions on station bail periods granted by the Garda mean that the scheduling of court attendance by the Garda cannot always be matched with Garda rosters.  The Bill will provide for much more flexibility with regard to the appearance of an accused before the court where station bail has been granted again allowing for better more efficient use of Garda time.</P>
    <P>At present, there is no general statutory provision for the issue of search warrants in relation to serious offences such as murder and rape.  This can have serious implications for the detection by the Garda of the very worst types of crime.  The Bill will contain a provision for the issue of search warrants by a judge of the District Court to enable the Garda to search and seize evidence in cases involving murder or rape or other serious offences.  I hope the Bill will be available to Members on 25 July.</P>

      <P>Apparently the Government is in the process of either organising or holding a press conference to announce its proposals. It is hard to believe that the person who promised so much by way of Dáil reform, the person who spoke about the supremacy of the Dáil and of parliamentary questions, the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, should show such scant regard for the Dáil, particularly in relation to the matter before us.  Last week it was not to his partners in Government that the Taoiseach looked to find solutions to the present crime crisis.  I am not surprised that it was not to his partners that he looked.  If evidence were needed that the Labour Party was soft on crime, it was very much in evidence this evening from the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>The first duty of any state is the protection of its citizens. This State is involved in a host of activities that it need not be involved in and which could be much better done by other groups.  The State need not do such things as running ports, airports, restaurants or hotels.  The one duty the State has is to protect its citizens, and <Col N="2396" /> the most basic civil liberty of all is the liberty of citizens to walk down their local street, through their local village, to live in their home without fear of being attacked.  For too long many of our citizens have not had that right. Does the Minister of State know of many women who would walk down O'Connell Street late in the evening? They would have done it in the past, but they would not do it now because they are afraid.</P>
      <P>Law making is not the whole answer because it does not guarantee that there will not be law breaking, but it is certain that if we do not have tough laws, strict enforcement of those laws and an efficient and professional&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fighting poverty is not exclusive of being tough on criminals. Have there been many Revenue audits of the godfathers of crime?  Have there been many Revenue solicitor's letters sent to them?  I wonder how the Revenue have dealt with them in recent times when ordinary decent business people are hounded.  Why is it that the godfathers of crime have fast cars, horses, yachts, holiday homes, large houses and, in some cases, local authority houses?  If the property is in the name of their spouses, has anybody asked how the spouse acquired the property just as ordinary law-abiding citizens would be asked to answer such questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is evidence of ambivalence at the top.  Let me document some of it. Six times since the Dáil resumed after Christmas I asked the Taoiseach when the Government would finalise its consideration of the bail issue.  On 31 January he said that the Government's failure to act in the wake of the publication of the Law Reform Commission report on bail was regrettable and that the <Col N="2397" /> Government would make up its mind within about six weeks.  I allowed six weeks to elapse and on 26 March I again asked the Taoiseach about the issue.  He said he would be discussing options presented by the Minister in the reasonably near future but that the matter had not yet been finalised.  On 14 May I asked the Taoiseach about the issue.  He was, as always, evasive.  He said that the Government had not completed its consideration of the matter, but he assured me that it was at an advanced stage of consideration.  On 19 June last, just 13 days ago, there was still no sign of movement and I again raised the matter with the Taoiseach.  On that occasion I told him that I was blue in the face asking him about bail.  He repeated that the Government had not yet concluded its deliberations on the matter.  A brave young journalist has been murdered and, without even a Cabinet meeting, the Government last Friday night announced that it would hold a referendum on bail.  Is it any wonder the public are cynical about politics and politicians?</P>

      <P>In March 1995 the Minister for Justice announced on television that the Government would hold <Col N="2398" /> a referendum on bail.  It was not long, however, before a Labour Party Minister was busy anonymously telling reputable journalists that there would be no referendum on bail.  Let me quote what was printed in the columns of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 25 February 1996 when the Law Reform Commission report was first used as an excuse by the Government:</P>
      <P>He [a senior Labour Party Minister said: &ldquo;...the Government is preparing the ground to drop the referendum idea... You can take it that any proposal, which will be adopted by the Cabinet, will be exclusively legislative.  The exact nature of the legislation depends on the proposals brought forward by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He added strongly that any other course of action would lead to strong opposition within his party and Democratic Left and a threat to Government cohesion.</P>
      <P>In order that Government cohesion would not be threatened, Fine Gael, who knew better, were prepared to put up with this.

      <P>The Minister of State hears what she likes to hear.  The Labour Party always hears what it likes to hear and is blinkered on those things it does not like to hear.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that a remand prison would be built at Wheatfield.  She said that the capital cost would be £40 million and that £20 million would be provided in 1998.  That is two years from now.  Of one thing I am certain &mdash; the rainbow coalition will not be in power in 1998.  Deputy Shatter spoke in this House this evening, and it is worth quoting his remarks.  It is not just the Opposition and the public who are concerned about the crime crisis.  He said that what passes for justice in this House is Department of Justice scripts justifying the <i>status quo</i>.  They are the words of Deputy Shatter, a backbench Government Deputy, and there are many other backbench Government Deputies who feel equally strongly.</P>
      <P>I want to go through the record of this party since the Dáil reassembled in early 1993.  On 2 March 1993 I introduced the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill to deal with public order issues.  I said at the time:</P>
      <P>We believe it is time to effectively restore safety and security of home and property to every citizen.  It is about time the Garda were given effective powers to tackle the criminal, the thug, the unruly gangs and individuals, and to enable them to effectively carry out the job they are charged with doing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, currently a backbench Government Deputy, said: &ldquo;This Bill is clearly an attempt to restore the confidence of the ordinary citizen of the State in justice&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 June 1994, my colleague, Deputy McDowell, introduced a Criminal Justice Bill which addressed the <Col N="2401" /> need for changes in the law relating to insanity, bail, temporary releases and the remission of sentences.  Deputy Gay Mitchell, then the Fine Gael spokesperson, said: &ldquo;Fine Gael will be supporting this Bill.&rdquo; and also:</P>
    <P>On the issue of bail, whereas I welcome the provisions put forward in this Bill...they do not go far enough. I do not see why the matter has again been referred to the Law Reform Commission because we know that what is required is an amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is greatly concerned that hardened criminals continue to enjoy excessive protection from the law while ordinary law abiding people, especially the most vulnerable members of the community, such as the elderly, are being imprisoned in their homes.</P>
    <P>On 16 May 1995 my colleague Deputy O'Donnell introduced a Private Members' motion highlighting the drug emergency.  She called for the introduction of legislation to strengthen the law and penalties for drug importers, distributors and suppliers of drugs and she called for the implementation of the existing legislation to seize the proceeds of those criminals involved in drug related activities.  The Minister for Justice said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>My proposals will be far-reaching and wide-ranging.  They will be no mere tinkering with the problem, but a root and branch radicalisation of plans to tackle drug trafficking.  I am determined to do whatever is required and I will have no hesitation in asking the Government for the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>On 27 February 1996 Deputy O'Donnell introduced the Prosecution of Offences and Punishment of Crimes Bill, 1996 to deal with many of the outstanding issues relating to drug trafficking in our society as well as the need to change the bail laws, streamline our <Col N="2402" /> prosecution service, limit the right to silence and modernise and speed up criminal proceedings.  Again we had similar words from the Minister for Justice who said:</P>
    <P>It is neither realistic nor effective to suggest that fundamental issues such as bail, the right to silence and sentencing policy &mdash; to give just a few examples &mdash; can be dealt with effectively in a piecemeal or patchwork way...</P>
    <P>She went on to say that she did not believe it was possible to address properly such a fundamental issue as the right to silence in a Bill such as that before the House.</P>
    <P>On 18 June 1996 my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, moved an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996 and the Minister said in relation to limiting the right to silence:</P>
    <P>I cannot accept amendments Nos. 35 and 36 because I do not favour dealing with this complex issue, the right to silence, in such a piecemeal way...</P>
    <P>Later in June came the murder of a journalist and all seems to have changed.  We are now expected to believe that the Government is serious with a record of that kind.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt because I think the eye was off the law and order ball, but its members who are not present this evening and have shown scant regard for this House are to hold a press conference &mdash; a PR exercise &mdash; when they should be here listening to the debate given that the Taoiseach promised so much last week.  He said he knew I was frustrated with the slow progress but that he was taking on board everything that was said.  Are we to believe that when we see the spectacle before us tonight?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposals published this evening by the Labour Party. It is hard to take seriously the suggestions by the Labour Party for a drug <Col N="2403" /> enforcement agency when the Minister for Justice shot down this idea in this House on a number of occasions.  For a party that is almost four years in power the Labour Party seems to be behaving as if it was in Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must assert his authority in the Cabinet.  He must ensure that law and order is not just an issue today, tomorrow and for the next few days until the public memory of the awful murder of Veronica Guerin is gone.  That was a needless murder, but let us hope it was not in vain.  From what I see this evening I do not believe this Government will be tough on law and order and I do not believe that its eye is on the ball.  The Government is simply interested in a PR exercise.</P>
    <P>I see no reason the new prison project at Wheatfield cannot be given to the private sector.  All recent prison projects have grossly overrun their budgets.  If this prison is to be built speedily the option should be given to the private sector for its construction, and thereafter perhaps for its management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to refer again to the appalling situation we witnessed earlier.  There was only one member of the Government and no Government backbenchers present when the leader of my party stood up to speak on this important issue about which there was so much talk and for which there was so much concern for the past week.  It is an indictment of the Government parties that they are not present to pay attention to what is being said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past year has been an extremely depressing time here from the point of view of law and order.  We have had a combination of horrific incidents resulting in the loss of many innocent lives.  In certain instances it would be difficult to see what this House or our law enforcement agencies could have done to prevent the crime.  Regrettably however in many other cases there at <Col N="2404" /> least exists a reasonable doubt that if certain preventive measures were in place the crime might not have occurred.</P>
    <P>Particular concern has been repeatedly expressed in relation to two core issues, namely the perceived widespread abuse of our liberal bail provisions and the revolving door syndrome resulting from the grossly inadequate number of prison places to deal with convictions arising from the wave of serious crime. In my opinion it would be almost impossible to exaggerate the comprehensive damage which has been done to our law enforcement system by these major flaws.</P>
    <P>The effect on the morale of our excellent Garda force must be enormous.  It is only too easy to imagine their deep frustration and anger at the current situation. In many instances they have spent an enormous amount of time and effort to bring a criminal to justice only to be let down in one way or another. For example, they may see a determined criminal go free on bail with further opportunities to offend before finally facing a custodial sentence.  Then they often see a number of convictions condensed through the imposition of concurrent rather than consecutive sentences. Too often gardaí are taken by surprise to see a criminal back on the streets having only served a small part of their sentence.</P>
    <P>Is it any surprise that some gardaí wonder what they must do to successfully tackle the escalating crime problem? They feel let down when they are expected to pursue dangerous criminals, frequently at risk to life and limb, while other key components of the law enforcement system such as bail provisions and prison numbers are totally inadequate.  As if that was not bad enough any slight mistake on their part in the pursuit of criminals is likely to be exaggerated out of all proportion.  On occasion undue criticism may come from the Judiciary whose own performance in terms of consistency can sometimes leave much to be desired.  I do not have to remind this House that some of the <Col N="2405" /> major controversies over recent years did not relate to decisions of the Garda or this House but rather decisions of the Judiciary.  It is about time they got their house in order and that we got some consistency from them.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to delays in the prosecution of criminals because of inadequate numbers of judges and other matters such as drastically reduced court hearings during certain months because of legal vacations.  All of these issues are almost totally within the control of the Government.  Consequently, there is no acceptable reason they should not be tackled successfully as a matter of grave national urgency.  If one reviews the happenings of the past year or so one would get the impression that it is the law abiding citizens who are on the run and not the criminals.  This is patently absurd and must be reversed by the early introduction of a number of the measures before us today.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The killing of Veronica Guerin was a calculated attack on the freedom of each and every person in this country.  It was an act designed to silence not alone the late Veronica Guerin but everybody who might follow in her footsteps.  It was an act of unspeakable evil which was carried out for a specific and defined purpose. Veronica Guerin was killed because she investigated and wrote about organised crime.  She had become a threat to criminals and to their continued enjoyment of illegally acquired assets.  She was killed so that criminals could hold on to the proceeds of crime. Are we as a community, as my party Leader has asked continously in the past number of days, prepared to tolerate the continued unhindered existence in our midst of people who have <Col N="2406" /> accumulated vast and unexplained wealth?  If we are, I suggest Veronica Guerin died in vain.</P>
      <P>The Bill which I introduced on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party today is designed to separate criminals from the illicit proceeds of their crime.  It was published last Thursday in the immediate aftermath of Veronica Guerin's murder.  It had been prepared as an integral part of our anti-drugs initiative and is both necessary and urgent now.  I was disappointed, though not surprised, that the Minister for Justice saw fit to describe it on Thursday night as unnecessary and on Friday as unconstitutional before, belatedly, in the early hours of Saturday morning deeming it to be acceptable in principle.  In so far as echoes of her now lapsed criticism may still be heard reverberating in this House or elsewhere, permit me to dispel them one by one.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill are unique. The powers proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party are not contained in any existing statute.  The proposed powers are necessary to shift the balance of our laws to the detriment of the criminal.  The Bill entitles the High Court to freeze the assets of persons suspected of being in possession of the proceeds of organised crime on the evidence of a Revenue Commissioner or a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána.  It permits the court accepting opinion evidence.  In that it is unique.  It is not covered in any way by existing legislation.</P>

      <P>I understand that a member of the family of the late Veronica Guerin is in the Chamber.  It is important legislation for them in their darkest hour and I ask that their position be respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill places the onus of proving that assets were legally required on the <Col N="2409" /> person asserting that proposition.  These provisions are not contained in any statute concerning organised criminals.  This Bill is necessary to protect democracy.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that this Bill is in some unspecified way unconstitutional is equally unsustainable.  A clear and direct precedent exists for legislation of this type.  The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1985, permits the freezing of assets of illegal organisations. The constitutionality of that Act was tested in the High Court in the case of Clancy <i>v</i> Ireland, 1988 <i>Irish Report</i> page 326.  There, Mr. Justice Barrington stated that the Act in question was a permissible delimitation of property rights in the interests of the common good.  The two factors identified by Mr. Justice Barrington, as being necessary in order for such legislation to be constitutional, the right to apply to court to have the issue of ownership determined and the provision of a scheme for the payment of compensation are present in this Bill.  Similarly, a direct precedent exists for the acceptance by a court of opinion evidence from a Garda Superintendent. The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, provides in section (3) (2) that the belief of a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of chief superintendent is sufficient evidence on which to grant a conviction for membership of an unlawful organisation.  That is an offence under section 21 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and by virtue of section 2 (6) of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, and carries a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It cannot seriously be contended that the hierarchy of rights envisaged by the Constitution considers the right to the unfettered ownership of property to be superior to the right of liberty.  Let there be no doubt that this Bill is constitutional in its present form.  I regret that the Minister has seen fit to seek to undermine public confidence in it by uttering allegations of unspecified constitutional difficulties.  If there are problems between the partners in the rainbow coalition in relation to the policy <Col N="2410" /> on law and order, the blame should be placed where it belongs and not on the Opposition which is trying to be as constructive as it possibly can.  No amount of bluster or muckraking by Government Front Benches or back benches will gloss over those facts.</P>

      <P>I deeply regret that the Minister's utterances have slowed down the pace at which the Bill can be passed.  It is noteworthy that the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1985 was enacted on the day after it was published and implemented on the day after it was enacted.  The political will then existed to freeze the assets of subversives.  The question which must be on everybody's lips is why it is that the same political will and sense of urgency cannot be mustered today to freeze the assets of organised criminals.  Why is it that the rainbow coalition is proposing to serve one month's notice on organised criminals of its intention to accept asset freezing legislation?  If the same laconic approach had been applied to the passage of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act in 1985, the moneys which, as a result of the commendable swiftness with which that legislation was passed, were frozen would have been spirited abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister's initial reaction to this Bill typifies her attitude and that of the Government to criminal law reform.  The attitude of &ldquo;it is not necessary, it is unconstitutional and we will do it but slowly&rdquo; is partly responsible for the growth of organised crime. I appeal to her and to anybody who might have shackles on her in the rainbow coalition to bring a sense of urgency to bear on this issue and speed <Col N="2411" /> the passage of this legislation through the House.</P>

      <P>Organised criminals exist in order to acquire illicit assets.  This Bill is designed to deprive them of the use of those assets.  Organised crime is defined in the Bill as follows:</P>
      <P>Any criminal activity organised, undertaken or performed by two or more persons involving the theft, illegal acquisition and/or destruction of property valued in excess of £10,000 or the distribution of controlled drugs within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.</P>
      <P>This legislation cannot be used against petty criminals.  It is specifically directed at the criminal gangs which have become bloated on the profits of drug dealing and the proceeds of audacious robberies.  It permits the Garda Síochána, which is frequently unable to gather admissible conventional evidence against criminal godfathers, to strike at the heart of their criminal empires.</P>
      <P>Section 3 authorises a Garda chief superintendent or a revenue commissioner to apply <i>ex parte</i> to the High Court for an order restraining a person from disposing of or otherwise transferring the ownership or diminishing the value of any or specified assets for a period of 21 days.  That order can be made if the High Court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the person in respect of whom the application is made is in possession or control of the proceeds of organised criminal activity or assets acquired directly or indirectly from the proceeds of organised criminal activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that the provision permits assets in the possession of any person to be restrained.  It is not necessary that they be in the actual possession of the person suspected of being involved in organised crime.  If members of his or her family or entourage are in possession of such assets, they can still <Col N="2412" /> be frozen.  If the assets have been invested in legitimate businesses or commercial partnerships, they can be frozen.  The huge importance of this section is that it permits assets in the possession of any person to be frozen provided that the High Court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that they represent directly or indirectly the proceeds of organised criminal activity.  In short, there is nowhere in this jurisdiction when criminal assets can be hidden to protect them from the provisions of this important Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill authorises the initial application for a restraining order to be made <i>ex parte</i>.  This is necessary to ensure that assets are not moved or transferred with a view to frustrating the order of the High Court.  Where the High Court makes an interim restraining order freezing assets in the possession of any person it will be obliged by the provisions of this Bill to make two further orders.  It must order the person whose assets have been restrained to file within 21 days an affidavit setting out the assets owned or controlled by him or her.  It must also order the person to file within the same period an affidavit setting out the sources and amounts of his or her income over the preceding ten years. Section 5 (4) would prevent any application to discharge the interim order being heard until adequate affidavits had been filed.</P>
    <P>The Bill will compel persons in possession of assets which are suspected to be illicit to step forward and state openly where they came from and how they were paid for.  It also contains important ancilliary provisions designed to assist the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners in investigating the contents of affidavits.  Section 5 (5) authorises the High Court to order the discovery and production of relevant documents in the possession of any person.  Thus, accounts, bank statements and business records can all be ordered by the High Court to be produced for inspection and scrutiny.  It is important to note that this provision <Col N="2413" /> applies to documents in the possession procurement of &ldquo;any party to the application or any other person or institution&rdquo;. The important point is that there will not be under the provisions of this Bill any safe hiding place within the State for documents relating to assets arising from organised criminal activity.</P>
    <P>Once the necessary affidavits have been sworn and the necessary documents produced and examined an application can be made for an interlocutory restraining order.  The High Court has power at the hearing of such an application to direct that any person, including a party to the proceedings, be present in court to give evidence and be cross-examined.  It will not be possible for criminals to hide behind layers of obfuscation.  They will have to openly and publicly assert their claim of ownership and defend it in the face of crossexamination.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the court must make an interlocutory restraining order unless it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the assets, the subject matter of the interim restraining order, are not the proceeds of or acquired directly or indirectly with the proceeds or organised criminal activity.  The importance of this provision is that for the first time, despite the protestations of the Minister and some of her colleagues to the contrary, it forces or obliges people to explain the origins and sources of their wealth and property. Unexplained or inadequately explained assets will remain frozen.  The onus of establishing the legitimate pedigree of assets rests on the person espousing that proposition.  If he can satisfy the court, on the balance of probabilities, that the frozen assets are not the proceeds of organised crime then they are unfrozen and returned to him.  If he fails to satisfy the court about this then an interlocutory restraining order is made.  These provisions, the restraining order and the interlocutory restraining order, will operate to deprive a person of the use of illicit assets.  The assets remain in the ownership of that person but he is prevented from using or enjoying them. <Col N="2414" /> The interlocutory restraining order remains in operation indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The Bill also envisages that the High Court will have power to make disposal orders in respect of frozen property.  If no adequate affidavits as to income and assets have been filed after a period of seven years has elapsed from the making of the interim order the High Court can make such an order.  Similarly, once five years has passed from the date of making the interlocutory order the High Court may make a disposal order.</P>
    <P>In cases where the true owner of the assets can be identified the court can direct that they be transferred to that person, while in cases where the true owner of the assets cannot be identified the court can direct that the assets be transferred to the State.  There is a significant difference between the onus of proof required for an interlocutory order and the onus of proof required for a disposal order.  An interlocutory restraining order must be made unless the court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the assets are not the proceeds of crime.  In that instance, the onus of proof rests on the person seeking to have the assets released.  The importance of this provision is as follows: we are not at the point of disposing of the assets but merely at the point of freezing them and, accordingly, it is constitutional within the terms of a judgment on the matter for the State to freeze those assets and to shift the onus into the suspected person.  This was made very clear in the case of Alan Clancy and David McCartney <i>v.</i> Ireland and the Attorney General, 1985 No. 2912P., when Mr. Justice Barrington held that a permissible delimitation of property rights in the interests of the common good was not an unjust attack upon private property contrary to Articles 40.3 and 43 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Given that this is the legal position as interpreted by the courts it is difficult, if not impossible, for me or anyone else interested in the subject to justify the intimation by the Minister for Justice to <Col N="2415" /> the public that this Bill is unconstitutional. This was an attempt to undermine public confidence in the Bill at a time when such a Bill was never more required.</P>

      <P>A disposal order can only be made where the person seeking it satisfies the court, on the balance of probabilities, that the assets are not the property of the respondent.  In so far as the onus is shifted onto the State to prove that the assets are the proceeds of organised criminal activity and on the basis that this burden of proof is the balance of probabilities, it will be clear, given that we are talking about the disposal of the assets and not the freezing of them, that it is right in accordance with the 1937 Constitution that the onus should shift to the State. This is precisely what we are doing. How then can anyone seriously suggest the Bill is unconstitutional, unless he has an ulterior motive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains many safeguards which should be highlighted.  The provisions identified by Mr. Justice Barrington as being constitutionally necessary &mdash; that is the right to apply to the High Court to have the issue determined and the power to pay compensation &mdash; are dealt with in sections 5 and 8.  In addition, section 6 permits the payment of a portion of restrained assets as are necessary for reasonable living expenses or for the discharge of reasonable legal costs.  This provision will ensure that one cannot argue under statute law or the Constitution that the individual concerned is being deprived of his right to life or his right to discharge his reasonable costs.  The court is also entitled to make any order it considers necessary in relation to publicity at the time of making the interim order.  Thus, <Col N="2416" /> the High Court, if it considers it necessary in the interests of justice, may prohibit the publication of the name or address of the person whose assets have been restrained at an <i>ex parte</i> application.</P>
    <P>Members on this side of the House have become accustomed to attempts to undermine legislation published by us.

The initial response of the Minister and the Government to the legislation proves beyond reasonable doubt, and not on the balance of probabilities, that when it comes to the implementation of criminal law reform, the rainbow coalition Government opts for political expediency and not relevant action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents the will of the people.  I say this given the welcome it received throughout the length and breadth of the country from people who want to see organised crime rooted out and want a society in which they can live in peace.  The Bill is an example of democracy in action.  It is an historic occasion for the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition to move this legislation during Government time at this critical juncture in Irish life.  This is an example of the kind of leadership required.  I have stated on numerous occassions in the House that we would support legislation introduced by the Government when it was required, and that when the <Col N="2417" /> Government failed to introduce necessary legislation we would introduce it. The pity and sorrow is that every genuine effort made by my party in the House in the past 18 months has been thwarted, not in the interests of the public but for political expendiency.</P>

I thought the manner in which the Bill was being handled would have led Deputy O'Donoghue to at least accept that his Bill was getting a Second Reading in Government time.  There is only so much sanctimonious sermonising and arrogant certitude I can take from Deputy O'Donoghue.  If this legislation is so important &mdash; and it is important &mdash; why did his party not introduce it in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 or 1992 with its then new sweet-hearts, the Progressive Democrats, in Government?</P>

      <P>Why was it not introduced in 1993?  It was not until 1994 that the Fianna Fáil Party who has possession of the Department of Justice for nine years decided it was time to do something about the problem.  Frankly the public do not take a blind bit of notice of the politicking Deputy O'Donoghue engages in.  I can take all the Deputy can throw at me and I will do my job in an effective way but I do not need to sit here and listen to the literary quotes he considers humorous and which might get him a line in the newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that in accepting this Bill this evening he would understand that the Government was giving time for this serious matter to be debated and that he would have avoided the kind of politicking he has engaged in given that in <Col N="2419" /> 1994 the Government, of which he was a member, decided that the way to deal with the seizure and freezing of assets was the way in which his predecessor in that office, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, decided.  A couple of short years later the Deputy has changed his mind on that, as he is entitled to do, but he should at least have the honesty to say so in the House.</P>
    <P>I will go through the Bill and point out the areas where the advice available to me is that the Bill is unsound and ineffective and could be unconstitutional. I would never be so certain, as Deputy O'Donoghue appears to be.  I do not know who drafted the Bill to him but there is no guarantee that there is no constitutional weakness or impediment in it.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice I have a responsibility not to accept a Bill blindly, just because Deputy O'Donoghue says it is all right put it through and forget about the consequences until later.  The Deputy's two colleagues who are sitting beside him &mdash; Deputies Burke and Geoghegan-Quinn, former Minister for Justice &mdash; had to do precisely the same.  Fianna Fáil's record in Government of accepting Bills from the Opposition is paltry.  I do not believe it ever accepted a Bill from the Opposition during Government time.  I had not intended to say all of that but it followed on the sanctimonious sermonising I have to listen to everytime Deputy O'Donoghue speaks.  He is constantly trying to snipe at things that need to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe anybody would dispute that the objective of this Bill, the confiscation of proceeds of crime, is central to any modern criminal justice system.  This is particularly so in relation to those who organise crime and who in the process accumulate considerable wealth.  The fitting punishment <Col N="2420" /> for those who are convicted of organising serious crime must be lengthy terms of imprisonment, but there must also be effective mechanisms to enable the State to confiscate the proceeds of those crimes.  We must make sure that we can give reality to the maxim that crime does not pay.</P>
      <P>This House knows full well, despite the posturing of Deputy O'Donoghue to pretend otherwise, which is an insult to his colleague, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, that there is on the Statute Book legislation on the matter, and very modern legislation.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, contains the most detailed and comprehensive provisions on the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.  Those provisions have been in force since November 1994, only a little over a year and a half ago.  There is a perception, and perhaps in the past it has too often been justified, that this House, and successive Governments, have been slow to update our criminal laws to keep pace with the realities of modern crime.  On this occassion that charge is not justified and it is only fair to acknowledge that the legislation in question was brought into this House by my predecessor, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, and the last Government. The regulations giving it effect have been brought in by me, as Minister for Justice, and this Government.  Therefore, Deputy O'Donoghue should stop trying to imply that there is no legislation in place to freeze and confiscate assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be worthwhile to briefly examine the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, if only to see how the present proposals depart from the principles so recently agreed by this House.  Under the 1994 Act, where a person is convicted of an offence on indictment, the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the court for a confiscation order requiring the person to pay a sum equivalent to the benefit which the court is satisfied the person obtained from committing the offence. The standard of proof for determining whether and to what extent the person <Col N="2421" /> benefited from the offence is that applicable in civil proceedings, which is the balance of probabilities, although the conviction itself must be obtained on foot of the normal criminal standard &mdash; beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>Where the offence concerned is a drug trafficking offence, the court is empowered to make strong assumptions about the origins of the defendant's property, such as that any property transferred to him or her in the six years prior to the proceedings were as payment or reward for drug trafficking.  In addition, the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to court for a restraint order, which prevents any dealings in, in other words, freezes, specified property in anticipation of a confiscation order, even where criminal proceedings have not commenced but are merely contemplated.  A prosecution must then be commenced within a reasonable time, otherwise the restraint order will be discharged.</P>
    <P>The principle behind the Act, therefore, is that confiscation of the proceeds of crime is dependent on securing a conviction. In following this approach, the then Government, and the House, accepted the advice of the Law Reform Commission in its report on the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.  The commission considered the merits of a civil procedure for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime and concluded that: &ldquo;a civil procedure would either be ineffective or encounter the risk of a serious constitutional challenge.&rdquo;  The commission went on to say, not surprisingly, that it did not recommend the adoption of such a procedure.  Instead it recommended the availability of confiscation orders as part of the criminal process and the then Government and Fianna Fáil Minister chose to follow that advice.  That is the background to the Bill before us.  It explains why our modern confiscation law is based on criminal convictions.  This Bill, however, provides that a person may be deprived of property on the basis of allegations of criminal activity in respect of which there has been no conviction, or even <Col N="2422" /> proof to the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.  The standard of proof envisaged is that applicable in civil proceedings &mdash; on the balance of probabilities &mdash; and, once property is frozen under the Bill, and subject to proposals for the ultimate disposal of property, on which I will comment later, the onus is on the person claiming the property to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that it does not represent the proceeds of crime.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the contrast between the proposals in the Bill and what was so recently provided for in legislation raises some questions.  Following the proceedings in the House tonight the public will not be able to say of us as legisaltors that we ignored or neglected this issue.  They could, however, legitimately ask why those involved in promoting comprehensive legislation on confiscation are now, when the resulting Act has barely had time to settle in, introducing entirely different proposals based on principles so recently rejected by them.</P>
    <P>In any event, we have to deal with the situation before us, rather than dwelling on past events, and if it is put to this House that the existing legislation on confiscating the proceeds of crime is inadequate, then the Government, and I as Minister for Justice, take the matter very seriously.</P>
    <P>With absolute certainty, Deputy O'Donoghue said his Bill is constitutional and dare an institution of the State, such as the Attorney General's office, question him as to whether it contains any flaws.  Such arrogance does not have a place in the preparation of criminal or civil law.  We must be humble enough to admit that we do not always get everything right.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Donoghue was not brought up in that way, he has not learned that type of humility and I do not expect it from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the difficulties faced by <Col N="2423" /> an Opposition party in bringing forward proposals.  I realise it is difficult to bring forward well drafted proposals for legislative change while in Opposition, and that Fianna Fáil, in contrast to its position when bringing forward the Criminal Justice Act, did not have the benefit of the resources of Government in preparing these proposals.  Perhaps it would acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides the definitions of words and terms used in the Bill, the most important of which is the definition of &ldquo;organised crime&rdquo;.  It is worth nothing in passing, however, that the term used both in the long Title and in the body of the Bill is in fact &ldquo;organised criminal activity&rdquo;.  In any event, the scope of the definition and, therefore, effectively the scope of the Bill, is limited to activity organised, undertaken or performed by two or more persons and involving the theft, illegal acquisition and-or destruction of property valued in excess of £10,000, or the distribution of controlled drugs.</P>
    <P>The House will have to carefully consider the wording of this provision.  First, are the references to offences correct? Should the reference to &ldquo;theft&rdquo; be to an offence under the Larceny Acts?  Should the reference to destruction of property be a reference to an offence under the Criminal Damage Act?  What does the term &ldquo;illegal acquisition&rdquo; mean?  Even if these references can be made technically correct, should the Bill be limited to these offences?</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act apply to any indictable offence.  Even if the House wished to limit the scope of this Bill to offences normally associated with organised crime, it may be that a case could be made for the inclusion of more offences.  Persons running protection rackets, for example, commit offences not provided for here.  I am sure many Deputies could think of more examples, and that is something we will have to consider.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a general danger in limiting the Bill to particular <Col N="2424" /> offences, and to what I might call joint ventures in crime, that it would be a legitimate argument for a person to acknowledge that particular property represented the proceeds of crime, but that he or she had carried out the crime alone, or that it was acquired by means of an offence other than those set out in the Bill.  I raise this point not as criticism of the proposals, but by way of arising the implications of the Bill.  I will certainly need some time, as I am sure the House in general will, to tease out the finer points of the proposal before us.  It would surely be paradoxical if, in enacting legislation designed to make it easier for the courts to confiscate the proceeds of crime, we were to erect obstacles to that objective in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the making of an interim restraining order by the High Court on an <i>ex parte</i> application by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent or by a Revenue Commissioner.  This has to be read in conjunction with section 4, which provides that the court may receive as evidence the opinion of such a member of the Garda Síochána or a Revenue Commissioner.  In providing for this, the Bill borrows a concept from the Offences Against the State Acts, but adds the important proviso that while the court may act on such evidence, it may do so only if satisfied that the opinion has been formed on reasonable grounds.  Thus, the opinion of a senior Garda or a Revenue Commissioner will not be conclusive, nor will the mere fact of such an opinion, however deeply held, be sufficient in itself.  The court will have to be satisfied that the opinion has been formed on reasonable grounds.</P>
    <P>The effect of an interim restraining order would be to restrain a person from, &ldquo;disposing or otherwise transferring the ownership or diminishing the value of any or specified assets for a period of 21 days or such longer period as the court considers just&rdquo;.  The House would need to examine this formula to see if it achieves its objective, which is <Col N="2425" /> to freeze property.  There is no mention of a prohibition on removing property from the State or of powers for the Garda Síochána to prevent such a removal.  The reference to &ldquo;disposal&rdquo; may not be sufficient in this respect: A person who moves his or her property out of the State, while retaining ownership of it, may not be said to have disposed of the property.  If we are to have a provision along these lines, I know the House will want to be sure that it is as watertight as legal drafting can make it.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also requires a court, on making an interim restraining order, to direct the respondent to give details of all his or her assets and the sources and amounts of his or her income for the preceding ten years.  There are important consequences in regard to the ultimate disposal of property for a respondent who does not comply with this.  I might also mention the tie-in between this provision and section 5 (4), where it is provided that a respondent may not even apply for the lifting of an interim restraining order until he or she has supplied these details.  This requirement seems to be needlessly absolutist in nature and could raise serious constitutional questions.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that, after 21 days of an interim restraining order, application may be made to the court for an interlocutory restraining order, and the court would be obliged to make this unless satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the property did not represent the proceeds of crime.  In other words, the onus would be on the person claiming to own the property to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that it had been acquired legitimately.</P>
    <P>The effect of an interlocutory restraining order is described in section 5 (8), which states that the order shall freeze all or such portion of the assets of the respondent as are ordered by the court.  I have used the word &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; in my contribution tonight, but I know that Deputies understand my use of the word as shorthand for a comprehensive legal prohibition on any dealing in property. It goes without saying that there is <Col N="2426" /> no place for such undefined colloquialisms in an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the release of reasonable living expenses and legal costs from frozen assets, I have no difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the making of disposal orders.  This enables the court to make a disposal order either on the expiry of seven years from the date of an interim restraining order where the respondent has not given details of assets and income, or on the expiry of five years from the making of an interlocutory restraining order, where the court is satisfied that the respondent is not the true owner of the assets and that the assets represent the proceeds of crime.  A number of issues arise here for the consideration of the House.</P>
    <P>What is meant by the phase &ldquo;true owner&rdquo;?  A person who uses money derived from crime to buy property is the owner of that property.  I do not dispute that the law can, indeed already does, provide that the property can be confiscated, but it is that person's property which is confiscated.  The phrase occurs several times in section 7 and its effect could have the most serious implications for the process of disposal set out there.  It would mean that one of the two tests in section 7 (1)(b) might never be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The provision permitting disposal of property seven years after the making of an interim restraining order, and where the respondent has failed or refused to disclose adequate details of assets or income, needs to be examined. It seems to allow disposal effectively as a punishment for not having disclosed such details, even where the court may believe that the property is not the proceeds of crime.  I am sure that this is not what Deputy O'Donoghue intended, but that seems to be the effect of the provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will note that section 7, in providing for disposal five <Col N="2427" /> years after an interlocutory order, does allow a court, in making a disposal order, to rely on the opinion evidence provided for on the making of interim restraining orders, nor is the onus of proof that the assets are not the proceeds of crime on the respondent.  I understand that these omissions are intended and that they have been advanced as an argument in favour of the Bill's constitutionality but we surely must examine the practical implications. We must look beyond making the first interim restraining orders under this Bill and make some estimate of the likely effectiveness of the disposal process. One thing on which we can all agree is that there has to be an ultimate disposal of property.  We cannot provide for the indefinite freezing of property and, indeed, some might question the time limits already set out in the Bill in this regard.  The difficulty seems to be that, while the proponents of the Bill argue that to freeze property the courts need to be able to act on opinion evidence and to be able to place the onus of proof on a respondent, they envisage the disposal of property a more severe step than freezing without those special provisions.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to promote the absence of these special provisions in the disposal process as conservative drafting which underscores the Bill's constitutionality, although such an argument seems to carry implications for the earlier provisions, but what concerns me is their practical implementation.  There is surely a question mark over the making of extraordinary provision for freezing property, only to provide for the disposal of that property on principles deemed to be inadequate for making the original freezing orders.  Disposal may be five or seven years down the road but we have to look that far ahead and work through the consequences of the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully understand and share the concerns of this House on the need to deal with serious crime.  I agree that provision in our laws for the confiscation <Col N="2428" /> of the proceeds of crime is an essential element in a modern criminal justice system.  It must also be recognised, of course, that we have in place very recent and comprehensive procedures for such confiscation.  I again acknowledge that Deputy O'Donoghue's party &mdash; not him but Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn &mdash; played a part in introducing that legislation. The relevant provisions have now been in force for 18 months or so and the Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts are developing their implementation.</P>
    <P>I have already told the House that up to April 1996, in less than a year, there were already 300 reports of suspicious transactions in the financial institutions. Many of those cases are proceeding and will be taken to the DPP, I hope they will be followed by convictions.  They must be recognised as an important part of the legislation I put in place in May 1995.</P>
    <P>The proposals before the House represent a significant departure from the principles decided by the House so recently and go against the advice of the Law Reform Commission.  They raise constitutional concerns and certainly contain serious drafting errors, only some of which I had time to mention. That is not to say that the principle of this Bill, or a Bill along the same lines, should not receive the approval of the House.  If Deputy O'Donoghue feels that the legislation passed recently is not adequate, he is right to bring forward proposals for change.</P>
    <P>I have shown myself open to good ideas and willing to accept Private Members' Bills.  While I have not carried out an analysis, I have been more willing than many previous Ministers for Justice to accept Opposition amendments on Committee Stage.  If at times the level of acceptance of Private Members' Bills is low it is simply a reflection of the difficulties involved in drafting complex proposals properly. Acceptance of such Bills is often impossible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue made the case over and over again that I was willing to <Col N="2429" /> accept the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill.  While I accepted its principle &mdash; nobody could have been against it &mdash; I stress that I am now in the process of making substantive changes on a scale which are tantamount to a new Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue may think he has done a great day's work, but my officials and I must redraft those Bills when we get them.  Perhaps Deputy O'Donoghue could talk to whoever is drafting these Bills for him and try to get a little more substance into them so they do not have to be changed.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the effort which he has put into the Bill but, as I say, there are difficulties in preparing complex proposals. Even in this Bill, which Deputy O'Donoghue's party leader made clear had been published very quickly, I see a kind of hand-written additional amendments to the Bill even after it had been typed up.  I do not know their genesis but it is clear that even after the Deputy had prepared it he decided more changes were needed and they came over in hand written form.  Deputy O'Donoghue should recognise that sometimes he does not get it quite right. I have responsibility to get it right and all the roaring, shouting and sermonising will not make me any less responsible in introducing legislation.</P>
    <P>We must now &mdash; and I am already in consultation with the Attorney General &mdash; examine in detail the proposals to see how they may be improved or whether an alternative measure is needed.  I have given a commitment that I will do that in the coming week and I will report back to the relevant committee as quickly as I can.  My intention is to have the Bill fully examined so that I can see it passed by the House.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that in this instance Deputy O'Donoghue could not have dealt with these crime measures in a spirit of unity and with some acceptance that everybody has good ideas to put into the melting pot in deciding what changes can be made.</P>

      <P>The entire spin doctor response of this Administration to recent events is fiction.  The Minister's speech is a litany of criticisms of the Bill, not only technically but also of its substance. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The proposals before the House tonight represent a significant departure from the principles decided by the House so recently and they go against the advice of the Law Reform Commission.  They raise constitutional concerns and certainly contain serious drafting errors, only some of which I have had time to mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech gives the game away because, as Deputy Shatter said earlier, it was written by the Department and is a traditional script defending the <i>status quo.</i> The spin doctored message is that, in the light of recent events, this Government is accepting Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill. However, the truth is that she supports nothing.  The terms of her speech criticise the Bill from top to bottom, and from start to finish she has rubbished it. The Minister and the Government do not really accept this Bill, although a spin doctored picture goes out from the press conference that this Administration is accepting the Fianna Fáil Bill <Col N="2431" /> as well as the terms of an agreed motion with the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil on the need for radical reform of the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>The Government held a press conference when the motion was being debated.  The Administration's real response to recent events is a disastrous fiction.  It is amazing that this Government spends millions of pounds on its image and how it presents itself to the electorate, on programme managers, advisers and spin doctors, yet has the memory of a goldfish when it comes to the last blunder.  The first blunder was the response to the murder of Veronica Guerin, a courageous journalist whose murder jolted everybody in this House into believing that we must bring about change to deal with the untouchables. What we have heard tonight was a fiction of a response, and that is a disgrace. The House has been offended by this administration.  Yesterday I spent two hours carefully drawing up a motion with the Government Whip so that the Government could fictionally agree to its terms.  It went into Government Buildings tonight and launched a press conference instead of coming into the House to listen to the terms of the motion.  It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue is to be commended on bringing forward this Bill, which is a real effort, in so far as Private Members' Bills can be, to push forward the agenda and keep pressure on the Government.  We were accused of political point scoring, media hype, being over-reactionary and putting fear into people's hearts.  We were told it is our fault that people are afraid in their homes, that because of what Deputies Harney, Ahern, O'Donoghue and I say people are afraid, but it is the criminals who are responsible for instilling fear in people's minds.  The Government has been lethargic and has failed in terms of criminal justice reform.  It has voted down every constructive proposal put forward by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>This Bill is one measure to deal with crime.  The other measure, presented in Government time today, is the drug trafficking Bill.  Both these Bills are radical measures which are necessary to deal with the serious problem of organised crime and drug trafficking.  Our criminal justice system, our laws, the Garda and other State authorities are not equipped to deal with the sophistication and type of criminality posed by organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No democracy can accept a position where people see themselves as untouchable.  I do not accept, nor does anybody in this House, that those who did not like not only what Veronica Guerin wrote but what she knew, those who took her out in a contract-style killing, should be untouchable.  After the initial outrage, after the bouquets of flowers were placed outside Leinster House to give us the message that we must introduce radical measures to deal with organised crime, people caution us that we are going too far.  They caution us lest we enact laws in the heat of the moment and without due consideration. I accept there is need for caution, but I say to those people that they should not be afraid because this House is fully capable of introducing laws that are balanced, fair and relevant to present day circumstances, as are this Bill, the drug trafficking Bill and our motion of tonight.  They are reasonable, considered proposals which have been well debated in this House.  We have had a revolving debate on all those issues since I came into this House in 1992.  I could give a speech on bail, temporary <Col N="2434" /> release and the right to silence without a note.</P>

      <P>This Government is so intellectually bankrupt that the only statement it can come up with time after time is: &ldquo;Why did you not do that when in Government?&rdquo;  The time has come to balance the books in terms of fairness to the State in prosecution matters and to the accused.  There is a vast body of jurisprudence protecting the rights of the accused.  The improvement in the capacity of the State to prosecute and tackle serious criminality need not diminish the rights of the accused.  It is a question of balancing upwards, parity of esteem as between the State and the accused.  At present there is no parity, and that is very clear.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court has said that the potential damage to society from the use and distribution of controlled drugs is so great and constitutes such a pernicious evil that the Legislature has very wide discretion in reconciling the interests of the common good with the interests of the individual. I make no apology for supporting that view.  As has been said by Deputies Ahern and Haughey, the first duty of the State is to protect the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criminal justice system has three traditional aims: punishment, deterrent and reform.  In the case of the so-called untouchables, we have failed markedly in all three areas.  We cannot link these people with their crimes, and when they are caught and convicted, which is very rarely, they get temporary release because there is nowhere to put them. In the case of hardened criminals who <Col N="2435" /> have made crime their life's work, perhaps it is time to accept that reform and rehabilitation is not a realistic option.</P>

      <P>We need to reconsider this matter.  If traditional methods fail we must devise new ones.  If we cannot punish, deter or reform these people we must set a new aim, to stop them from operating their evil trade.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which forms the basis of that new approach, is long overdue.  We have given the courts power to seize the assets of those convicted of certain crimes and to restrain the assets of those facing certain criminal charges, but given the difficulties experienced in getting convictions, or even gathering evidence, a new power is needed to restain the use of assets outside the context of criminal proceedings.  To date we have dealt only with assets which are the fruits of past crimes.  What we need to do now is prevent assets being used as the seeds of future crimes.  To put it another way, if we cannot arrest the criminals, why not confiscate their assets?  That is the substance of Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest a few areas with which the parliamentary draftsman and members in committee can deal.  The title of the Bill refers to the restraint of illicit assets but it must be remembered, and we will debate this on Committee Stage, that in many cases illicit assets will be laundered and reinvested in legitimate ways.  We should treat those legitimate proceeds as being equally tainted.  If not, they will continue to be available to fund criminal activities.  Another area &mdash; the Minister referred to this tonight &mdash; is the definition of &ldquo;organised crime&rdquo; which must be examined.  I will not attempt to define &ldquo;organised crime&rdquo; but a number of features need to be worked into the definition.  We need to acknowledge that in many instances we are talking about a whole series of crimes.  For example, a drugs wholesaler funds a drugs deal by a bank robbery.  He will illegally import and supply drugs and then illegally launder the proceeds. What sets organised crime apart is the element of co-ordination.</P>
      <P>Another hallmark of organised crime is the element of fear, menace and intimidation, particularly in regard to protection money.  These criminals terrify and intimidate people in their businesses. They spead fear in communities by their power and the fact that they are armed.  That fear and menace renders them a threat to the security of the State and that is the reason we are moving ahead with such radical measures here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the type of interim order to be made, we should consider giving the High Court two options; to restrain the use of specified assets or, if assets <Col N="2437" /> cannot be specified with sufficient particularity, to restrain the use of all assets within a specified value.  We need to specify also the penalties that will be imposed on a person who breaches an interim order.</P>
    <P>Under the current wording the person against whom an order is made will have to file an affidavit setting out assets owned or controlled by him or her and the sources and amount of his or her income for the previous ten years.  One wonders about the impact of the tax amnesties on these provisions. As Gene Kerrigan stated in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in relation to the tax amnesty: &ldquo;If the criminals themselves had been asked to design a money laundering system, it is hard to see how they would improve on this one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the issue of evidence on which the application for a restraint order will be based, the proposal in the Bill is that the court will be able to act on the opinion of a Garda superintendent or a Revenue Commissioner if satisfied that the opinion was reasonably informed.  It is difficult to see how the court could satisfy itself on this point without the disclosure by the Garda or the Revenue Commissioner of the basis on which the opinion was formed.  That, in certain circumstances, might not be desirable, for example, if the opinion was based on the word of an informant.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable also to confer powers to investigate bank accounts before the application for an interim order is brought.  We should clarify whether the evidence on which the application is based is to be notified to the person against whom the order is made, whether it would be possible to restrict such notification&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that across a wide range of areas our criminal justice system needs reform.

The Opposition has been to the forefront in demanding these changes and keeping pressure on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On drug trafficking, we were accused tonight of only presenting a criminal justice response to the drug problem.  That is not true because in my other role as <Col N="2440" /> Health spokesperson for my party, I have consistently hounded the Minister for Health to outline his proposals for real intervention and real therapeutic responses to the problems of drug addiction among young people in particular. I accept that is not a one-sided penny and that there are two sides to this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>A criminal justice and a therapeutic response is needed to help drug addicts, but one need not postpone the other.  The Government has been paralysed by this dilemma.  The parties in Government, particularly the parties of the left, have an obsession.  They do not want to take the criminal justice approach because the therapeutic approach dealing with deprivation, poverty and drug addicts as victims must come first.  The two approaches must be taken in tandem but one should not postpone the other.  That is what has happened.  Because of the conflict in Government as to how to deal with drug addiction and the criminality related to drug addiction, there has been paralysis.</P>
      <P>There are areas in this country where drugs are an integral part of the lives of children.  People are growing up who do not know a life outside heroin addiction. Unless we do someting about this end of the chain, we will continue to have the drug barons with us.  Drug barons are in operation because there is a market for heroin and other substances which are abusive of the individual and the society of which they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Huge sums of money can be made from the sale of drugs and the drug barons know the authorities in this State do not have the wherewithal to tackle them, to investigate them, to take them to task, to prosecute them, to jail them and keep them in jail.  That undermining of the sense of confidence in the criminal justice system is central to this <Col N="2441" /> debate.  The people who murdered Veronica Guerin believed they were untouchable and they were right.  Unless we get our act together they will continue to be untouchable.</P>

      <P>I am glad we are having this debate this evening.  It is recognised by all Members that we are confronted with a new type of criminal problem which has been developing for some years.  The tragic deaths of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin illustrate that the gun has replaced the rule of law in parts of this country.  It is time to reclaim the freedom of ordinary citizens and their right to personal safety from the criminal gangs who consider themselves above the law.  Our criminal law is grossly <Col N="2442" /> inadequate and incapable of coping with the sophisticated violent type of organised crime with which we are now confronted and or bringing to an end the criminal gangs now operating in some of our cities as home grown Mafia.</P>
      <P>I have no time for the party political games we see in this House on a regular basis, some of which we saw this evening.  I have no interest in political parties which claim to be the sole fonts of wisdom in this area.  When in Government, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats had a less than praiseworthy record in these areas and were extremely short-sighted in the context of medium-term, let alone longterm planning of what reforms were necessary to deal with crime.  I have watched with increasing anger and frustration the Government's performance from the politically impotent stage of the Government back benches.  I have watched its public relations exercise where Ministers hold press conferences to announce initiatives, only portions of which are implemented.  I welcomed the announcement last July that there would be a new united approach by the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners to tackle the drug barons.  I was left speechless with anger on Thursday in this House when the Taoiseach told us that approximately two weeks earlier a committee had been formed to seek to implement that proposal.  That proposal was again announced this evening in the Government's crime package.  I do not want to take away from that package, which I welcome, but there are elements in it that, with any level of insight or knowledge of the extent of the problems with which this country is faced, should have been put into operation a long time ago by the previous Government and should have been implemented by this Government at an earlier stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I favour amending our bail laws in circumstances where there is a serious possibility that someone will commit a crime when charged with an offence or where there is a record of people committing crimes when charged with offences.  I favour changing our bail laws <Col N="2443" /> to allow the courts wider discretion to hold people on remand pending the hearing of their cases.  The most effective way to deal with that issue is to speed up the court processes.  It can only best by described as asinine for any Minister to constantly talk about the need to extend or reform our bail laws at a time when our prisons cannot cope with retaining people already convicted of crimes.  I recall five years ago haranguing the then Fianna Fáil Government from the Opposition benches for the fact that people were being released from prison on a daily basis long before their sentences had been properly served.  If we want to reform our bail laws, we must provide the prison places needed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the Minister of State's contribution earlier this evening when she told us about the Government's package, which was again released to the nation in a press conference at 8 o'clock.  Some of what is contained in it is repeating previous announcements, while other things are new.  I hope when we come to assess the position at the end of July or next October we will see that much of what has been announced has been implemented.  It is disappointing that some of the funds to be provided for additional prison places will only come on stream in 1998.  I wonder how that will match with the proposal to review our bail laws.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with proposals which are not in the Government's programme but which should have been brought forward some time ago and which no-one yet at Government level is considering or intends to bring forward. These are essential elements of any coherent package if our criminal justice system is to properly serve the people and provide them with the protection which they deserve and to which they are entitled.  I emphasise that we are dealing with a criminal justice debate and I accept all sorts of other initiatives are required to tackle the crime problem. In a justice debate there are issues <Col N="2444" /> which fall within the justice brief which should be addressed, but which are not being addressed.</P>
    <P>We need and should have a unified prosecution service, for which the Director of Public Prosecutions, the man at the coalface of prosecuting those charged with serious criminal offences, has been calling for some years.  Nothing has happened in this regard.  It is long since past the time when the manner in which we prosecute criminal offences in this State reflects the manner in which the British dealt with criminal offences in this State prior to 1922.  The office of the DPP was the innovation we introduced, but he has highlighted the inadequacies in the system which need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>We need to bring an end to temporary releases.  It is undermining the gardaí, the courts and the judges to see people released on our streets within weeks of being sentenced to serve longer sentences than they have served. Sentences should be fully served.  The criminals are laughing at the Judiciary and the Garda because they know if they are sentenced, there is little likelihood they will be required to serve more than half of the sentence they have been given.  We need what is known as RICO law &mdash; an anti-corruption and racketeering measure which reflects the type of legislation that had to be introduced in the United States many years ago to deal with organised crime.  Are we researching that?  Will we produce this legislation?  That is what we need if we are serious about tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>We need intensive community policing and surveillance to remove the drug sellers and drug pushers from the streets of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway. I watched the <i>Nine O'Clock News</i> on RTE this evening which showed a film of people selling drugs in Dolphin's Barn.  I presume that happened today, but perhaps it was a reply of what we saw on a current affairs programme on RTE a couple of week ago, If the RTE cameras can pick up the drug pushers, why can the gardaí not do so?  In <Col N="2445" /> Sweden the Government provided intensive community policing which stopped the sale of drugs on the streets. We do not approach this problem in the intensive way required.</P>
    <P>We also need to change our approach to events such as raves to which hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of young people go and which are attended on a regular basis by the purveyors of drugs.  We have seen young people die from taking ecstasy at rave events. There should be separate licensing procedures which identify rave events. Everytime there is a major rave event there should be undercover gardaí at them and they should be closed down if drugs are on sale.  However, that is not being done.</P>
    <P>In this House we have irregular and, on occasions, correct preoccupation with the need to change laws and some of what I said tonight emphasised that need, but we must also bring our policing methods into the 21st century. We must realise that radical change is necessary.  We must also realise that in fighting the drug barons and organised crime and getting the purveyors of drugs off our streets, the Garda must deploy different methods from those deployed to date.  They must learn from the successes of other police forces.  In saying that I do not want to take from the Garda's successful drugs seizures, but we are fighting a war and, as in the case of war, if one's tactics are not working, one must change them.  Members on all sides of this House have a duty to fight that war effectively and not to play foolish political games.</P>
    <P>As a Member of a Government party, it should have been my role presumably to come into this House and simply praise the Government's initiative.  I would not be doing my duty to the people or to my constituents if I adopted that approach and simply pretended all is well.  All is not well.  Some measures were announced this evening, but a great deal more needs to be done.</P>

      <P>This debate is taking place in a very hysterical atmosphere. There is hysteria on the streets and a certain amount of it in here.  I may have been expected to get up here and tell Members, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, but I will not do that.  I do not wish to see a repressive, knee-jerk reaction.  For that reason the Minister is correct in taking her time about introducing meaningful legislation in this area.  Unfortunately, the issue has become a political football and we all know what happens in the game in which we are engaged.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that if Fianna Fáil and the poor dears, the Progressive Democrats, had been in power, we would be saying what they said; that is the business of politics.  Opportunism when it presents itself is too compelling to turn away from.</P>
      <P>We are all in accord on the law and order situation and I regret that the issue is being used as a political football. I do not believe in confrontational politics. On an issue of national importance we should reach a consensus because we all believe this problem has resulted in an explosion of public outrage.  For that reason rather than shouting at each other across this Chamber we should reach a consensus on it.  Many of the amendments put forward by Deputies O'Donnell, O'Donoghue and Harney are worthwhile and similarly the Minister's approach to the Bill is very responsible.  I cannot see why we cannot work this out in an ordered manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I was elected to this House I have been suggesting that the main problem in society is the breakdown of law and order.  It did not happen overnight, it certainly did not happen in the past 20 months during which the Minister, Deputy Owen, has been subjected to stress, personal abuse and vilification in this Chamber, which she did not deserve, by people who should have <Col N="2447" /> known the difference.  Cancer does not appear over night, it is many years a-growing and the Irish crime problem is many years a-growing.  Virtually everybody in this Chamber ignored it, with the honourable exception of Deputy Kenneally who is very welcome to sit with me on the right any time and Deputy McDowell whose forthright views on crime are well known.</P>
    <P>All political parties ignored this burgeoning problem.  It was there in the eight years that Fianna Fáil and the poor dears were in power when I was told on a daily basis of protection rackets operating in Talbot Street.  The IRA terrorised this country for 25 years, burning and looting, robbing banks and shooting anybody that stood in its way. It laundered money all over Ireland, in hotels, pubs and anywhere it could hide it and there were no demands or proposals to seize its assets.  I welcome the proposals put forward and I hope all political parties will support the measure that should have been introduced years ago.  It does not matter who was in or out of Government.  It was not done when the parties opposite were in power.  There was complacency in all political parties.</P>
    <P>This debate has concentrated on seizing the assets of drug barons.  I have no difficulty with that.  I would open the Curragh and put them in for life.  I would not let them out.  The lack of sentencing policies in our courts system is the kernel of the problem in our society.  We have a philosophy that a jail must be rehabilitative instead of what it is meant to be &mdash; a punitive deterrent to regular and consistant criminals who Deputy O'Donnell believes are beyond reform.  A 20-year-old criminal who last year was sentenced for his 21st attack on tourists, whom he specialised in targeting, is beyond redemption and we should accept that.  Instead of building community halls in every county we should build jails.  In the affluent world in which we live, crime is here to stay. <Col N="2448" /> In recent years there has been no shortage of bleeding hearts and kinks in this establishment who poured derision on my theories and in the media when the <i>Sunday Independent</i> recently dubbed me &ldquo;Mr. Law and Order&rdquo;.  I charge the <i>Sunday Independent</i> with introducing the liberal ethos into this country which has undermined the political world and using what in the newspaper trade is commonly called &ldquo;human interest journalism&rdquo; to pour scorn on those who serve in public life.</P>
    <P>If repressive measures were brought in, which the media are now demanding because of its personal tragedy, the papers would be the first to put the opposite slant on them.  It is only interested in sales.  I want to point the finger at the management of Independent Newspapers and to ask why it did not take more care in protecting the late Ms Guerin following the shooting at her home.  They should have dropped her column to protect her and she might be alive tonight had they treated her with greater concern.  She wrote a newsy column which was very successful.  Sales and position on the Stock Exchange are what matter in newspapers.  When that girl was shot at her home, having been the recipient of threatening calls for many years, in her interests she should have been asked to write a column on something else.  Independent Newspapers should examine its position.  I believe in deterrents as their absence has brought us to this dreadful pitch. There should be mandatory sentencing, no parole in the case of persistent criminals, particularly those who assault, rob, rape or murder.  Prisoners should not have weekend visitors or facilities such as televisions or pool tables.  We should remember that prisons were meant to be punitive places.  In Alabama, of necessity, they have now reverted to a ball and chain.</P>

Since becoming a Member, a public representative of rural constituents, I have been consistent, believing in law and order.  I am also of the conviction that for far too long criminals have been treated much too softly, provided with televisions and facilities in prison.  Our Army, Navy and Garda should be provided with the necessary resources to tackle the drugs barons.  We know who they are, week after week we read about them.  I am glad the Government is making these resources available to the agents of this State to take them on.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from the manner in which she spoke, it appears she may well not accept this Bill.  The public wants swift, decisive action to apprehend those who perpetrated these callous acts, the perpetrators of general criminality in our society, but is unlikely to obtain it from a Government riven with disputes, contrary views and conflicting ideologies.  Not for nothing was this Government christened the rainbow Coalition.  It is on occasions like these that its deep-seated differences come to the fore.  While it is easy to <Col N="2453" /> apply political polyfilla to the cracks in economic policy or to compromise on social policy, when it comes to hard choices on the matter of law and order, it is obvious that common ground cannot be found among the Government parties.</P>

      <P>Just as a terrorist bomb in Sackville Place saved the neck of the leadership of the Fine Gael Party on the infamous night of the mongrel foxes in 1972, so too has it taken the deaths of two innocent people, two much-missed partners and parents, two key members of different branches of public life, to galvanise the reluctant parties of this Government into action. In the debate on my party's proposal to limit bail I said in this House in May last:</P>
      <P>I do not say that we should entirely remove a person's freedom, not even someone who has been charged with serious crime, but where a <i>prime facie</i> case has been established, where there are reasonable grounds and compelling evidence to show that a person may be guilty of a serious crime, then I feel we not only can, but indeed must, reasonably limit that person's freedom to whatever degree is necessary to protect society.</P>
      <P>I should remind the Minister that was a full 14 months ago in which we have heard many pious platitudes, empty promises and a package of measures trumpeted with much ceremony in July last which have seen the light of day merely in print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had barely made a dent in her chair when she announced that the Government would hold a referendum on the bail laws, but she had not reckoned with the parties of the left and their handlers who imposed on her the necessity for an embarrassing u-turn almost within hours of her announcement. Now, too late for many good people, they have been made to see the <Col N="2454" /> error of their ways and have at last had to concede that we have a real crisis on our hands.  Maybe they too saw the searing indictment of their ineptitude, misplaced loyalty and procrastination when the criminal record of a drugs mastermind was shown to the nation on television just a couple of weeks ago. The career of Tony Felloni was aided and abetted by the absence of a coherent bail policy, and countless lives have been put at risk by this Government which failed to live up to its duty and implement the course of action which it must have known was inevitable.  The Fine Gael spirit might indeed have been willing, but the Labour flesh was weak. The promises were shadows and, as we know, the substance in the shadows is non-existent.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to lay the full blame for the bail debacle at the feet of the Minister, for when she has to face her colleagues in Cabinet, who not only do not share her views but actively discourage her proposals, she is on a loser before she starts the much-vaunted tradition of a law and order Fine Gael is in tatters.</P>
    <P>Today we have in front of us a concrete measure to face up to the godfathers of crime in our cities, towns and wherever they are located.  At last the people will not have to gaze helplessly at neighbours who did not work a day in their crooked lives, as they polish their yachts, empty the ashtrays of their new BMWs or move to the lush pastures of Kildare, all without benefit of a visible income or, worse, with the assistance of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In maintaining any kind of criminal law system, it must be accepted that where people are accused of serious crimes, life for them will not be that of the ordinary citizen.  There will have to be curtailments in their freedoms, and society must accept that.  A genuine attempt to speed up the work of the courts would help to limit the time for which the life of the accused is disrupted. In the meantime, if he has to suffer a curtailment of his freedom, that <Col N="2455" /> is for the greater good and must be accepted.</P>
    <P>Likewise, if he has to survive without access to what are suspected to be illgotten gains, whether cash, bonds or buildings, he must suffer that upset in the current climate.  Constitutional freedoms are privileges we enjoy in an ordered and orderly society but which we may have to relinquish in the cause of the common good.  We have only recently taken back our flag from the IRA.  It is now time to recover our Constitution from the criminals in our society.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that while we slavishly copy all that is crass, obnoxious and objectionable in American society, we do not capitalise on its successes and achievements.  As far back as the 1930s it realised that people like A1 Capone, the very people for whom the term &ldquo;godfather&rdquo; was coined, would not be brought to justice through normal methods for the worst crimes they were suspected to have ordered or committed. The authorities adopted the then novel approach of seeking technical, but no less culpable, offences which were relatively easily proved and which carried substantial jail sentences.  We must adopt a similar approach, for there is nothing more dear to the criminal, nothing more valued by the gangster than the property or assets he has accumulated.</P>
    <P>There has to be a unified approach by all the agencies of this State to our current problems.  There has to be a body of public servants who can and will pursue all legal avenues until a valid conviction is gained for one or more of the crimes with which suspected criminals are charged.  If that takes special legislation, let us enact it; if it requires special people, let us recruit them; if it requires additional finance, let us provide it.  The time for kid gloves is over. The public are asking for, and are entitled to results, and we in this House are the people to whom they are looking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2456" /> I referred to the Minister's announcement of a package of measures last July which would, in her own words, &ldquo;wage an all-out fight against the drugs scourge&rdquo;, which she described at the time as a threat to the fabric of our society.  Frankly, the follow through on that much-heralded initiative has been less than laudable and, until the Minister's sleeping partners woke up from their slumbers over the weekend, there was not likely to be any progress on that initiative.</P>
    <P>As I read the Minister's press release of 19 July last, I was angered at the poverty of the attempts since to put into effect all that was promised there.  Talk of drug strategy teams, the extension of drug tretment centres, substance abuse programmes is all still &ldquo;pie-in-a-Rain-bow-coloured-sky&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The proposals before us today are realistic and hard-hitting, designed to hit the criminal where it hurts most, in the pocket.  This is a measure designed to target assets, not people, but which will effectively curtail the activities of evil men.  It will have the effect of stopping the known and convicted criminals from thumbing their noses at society.  By that I mean the person in the street who pays his taxes will not see those people who make a career of crime, walking the streets in defiance of any and all authority. At any time when most people are put to the pin of their collars to survive, carrying an unfair burden of tax, it is the last straw to see known criminals defy the law, elude taxes and, perhaps, draw social welfare benefit as well.</P>
    <P>The airwaves have been inundated for the last week with presenters reading letters from people who had been asked by the Revenue Commissioners to prove where they got relatively small amounts of money.  I have no difficulty with that, if that is the law.  However, it must be the law for everyone without exception, derogation, or special consideration. In the words of the Taoiseach, no one can be seen to be above the law; no one can be seen to be untouchable, and no one can have the inside track when it comes to evasion.  I <Col N="2457" /> just hope he continues to practise that, and that he can get his partners in Government to do likewise.</P>
    <P>These are hard-hitting measures, designed to be effective, to achieve a particular goal and to uphold the primacy of the courts and other institutions of the State.  I have no doubt we will be accused of chipping away at constitutional rights and of harming our democracy, but more damage was done to our democratic institutions in this House two weeks ago when a Minister railroaded through a transport Bill after it was defeated and in flagrant breach of democratic parliamentary principles.</P>
    <P>There is adequate precedent for the acceptance in evidence of the opinion of a chief superintendent that assets are the proceeds of organised criminal activity.  The Offences Against the State Acts were brought in originally, and subsequently amended, to combat a very real threat to the existence of this State, and there is little enough evidence of its misuse in the past 60 years.</P>
    <P>This measure is designed to counter a threat which is no less real, no less substantial, no less dangerous in its own way, as the threat from the IRA.  Let us act now, swiftly and decisively, to restore the confidence of the people in those institutions of State we seek to protect and uphold.</P>
    <P>There are adequate safeguards built into the Bill to prevent a miscarriage of justice.  The proposals, in the short-term, are for the freezing of assets only, and adequate time and opportunity is given to the person to prove they have been legitimately acquired.  If there is an application for their confiscation, the onus of proof is on the applicant and not the respondent.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donoghue said in his statement on this Bill, those involved in organised criminal activities have escaped justice and continued to enjoy lavish lifestyles because of the inability of the authorities, within the parameters of existing legislation and legal precedent, to prove their guilt.  This will level the playing pitch a fraction.  It will tilt the balance from the criminal just a <Col N="2458" /> little, and reassure honest people that there is still one law for everybody. Nobody should be seen to be untouchable.</P>
    <P>If the law is not adequate to the needs of society, it must be changed and strengthened.  We are in crisis and must respond accordingly.  I suggested in this House a few weeks ago that we take other decisive steps to deal with another aspect of serious crime detection.  I suggested that the time was right to avail of modern technology to solve serious violent crime by the more extensive use of DNA testing, more commonly described as genetic fingerprinting.  The public would not only approve of such a measure but would welcome it with open arms.</P>
    <P>The people are very angry and it is a righteous anger born of frustration and fear.  This is a legitimate attempt to assuage that anger.  The people are frightened.  That fear is no longer confined to elderly widows who fear night time attack but it is experienced on the streets of our capital in broad daylight. We must bring back respect for the law. If there are those who abuse it seriously and continually we must require them to confirm in the only way we know.</P>
    <P>This measure provides for the first time a realistic set of proposals to come to terms with the problems of organised crimes and those who mastermind them. The present situation brings our system of justice into disrepute and we need to reassure the public and take realistic steps to improve it.  This is a genuine attempt to face the problem and I commend the Minister for taking our proposals on board.  They are long overdue. The public expect them and the citizens who walk our streets have a right to see them enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the weekend I thought there was a change in the political scene, but having listened to the Minister this evening it is clear that she has no intention of accepting Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill.  It is clear that the Government, through the Minister, accepted this Bill and allowed this <Col N="2459" /> debate for purely political purposes and out of political cowardice.  This is the height of hypocrisy.  It would have been more honest for the Government to stick to its original decision for a meeting on 25 July, but it has lost its nerve and again shown itself to be incapable of making correct and wise decisions under pressure.  The Government should resign forthwith.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill attempts to deal with organised crime, which has grown and developed over the years.  He has put forward far-reaching proposals to tackle organised crime, including the seizing of assets and the restraining of the use of assets.  These proposals are necessary to shift the balance of our laws to the detriment of the criminal.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not open-ended.  It is aimed at organised crime which is defined as any criminal activity organised, undertaken or performed by two or more persons involved in the theft, illegal acquisition and/or the destruction of property valued in excess of £10,000 or the distribution of controlled drugs within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.  We must change our tactics, as Deputy Shatter said earlier, to fight a new type of crime which is destroying our country.  This Bill is an attempt to do so.  It is not excessive or oppressive but necessary and moderate.  The Minister would ignore it at her peril.</P>

      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of this Bill, particularly Fianna Fáil's late acceptance of the need to close all loopholes which allow the State's crime bosses to launder their profits.  They are slow learners.  We must remember that in 1993 the tax amnesty which they introduced was a charter to launder illegal moneys under the shield of anonymity.  I believe it was seized on <Col N="2460" /> eagerly by those who are running Dublin's underworld today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Fianna Fáil's contribution to the legislation of criminal bosses and their establishment as legitimate taxpayers.  Before dealing with the specifics of the Bill I would like to make a few points about the current situation.</P>
      <P>Few of us will forget where we were last Wednesday when we heard the appalling news that a journalist had been gunned down in our capital city. The news caused us all to halt in our tracks and take stock of where our society is &mdash; a society largely moulded by Fianna Fáil in power since the inception of the State &mdash; and where it is going.  In recent weeks we have witnessed too many violent deaths.  In my own constituency Josie Dwyer, a heroin addict and AIDS victim, was summarily murdered by a lynch mob.  Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was callously murdered by the IRA in the course of his duties and last Wednesday came the killing of Veronica Guerin.</P>
      <P>We do not know who carried out the killing or who ordered it.  I would caution both the media and the public against leaping to conclusions.  We do know however that ruthless criminals have launched a calculated assault, not only on individuals and society but on fundamental civil liberties and individual freedoms which were hard won and which many of us take for granted.  If in seeking to beat the criminals we concede these fundamental liberties the criminals will have won the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no exaggeration to state that when one buys a house and has to install a burglar alarm, one feels that one's civil liberties have been shattered.  When I grew up in a Dublin working class community we could leave the key in the door or the door open day and night with no fear of intruders.  Now one cannot buy a car unless it has a burglar alarm.  My civil liberties have been trampled on.  I do not like the notion of <Col N="2461" /> having to install alarms.  Sadly, under the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party, Irish society has been brought to the day when we must debate this serious onslaught on the democratic process and the assault on the Garda Síochána and investigative journalists.  It is surely clear by now that the band-aid system of legislative change, beloved of successive Governments, has served this country ill.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in recent days of the so-called rights of criminals. What people are referring to, of course, are not simply the rights of criminals but the rights of accused persons.  There is a significant difference between criminals and accused persons.  It has been said already that at the heart of our criminal justice system is the presumption of innocence.  It is a presumption which, while often infuriating for the general public, the legal profession and politicians, helps to guard against the miscarriages of justice which are commonplace in other jurisdictions.  Over the weekend there were detailed reports in the media about five alleged crime bosses.  These reports were written and published because of an understandable desire to lift the veil of secrecy which has protected organised crime bosses for too long.  However, I fear genuinely that if these individuals are ever brought to court a mistrial may be declared because of prior media coverage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There was already one such case in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the very real dangers we face as we try to come to terms with the present problem.  It would be a sad day if these criminals engaged the best legal minds &mdash; including possibly the honourable Member of the House here tonight who will be the first to jump to their defence, as would any barrister engaged to defend them &mdash; to declare that the media had found them guilty and subsequently walk free from the courts because of that media exposure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than adopting a scatter-gun <Col N="2462" /> approach which will target the innocent and the guilty, the petty criminal and the major gangster, the drug baron and the drug victim, we need to ensure that our response is targeted and specifically effective to deal with the real rather than perceived problems confronting us. The first prerequisite for such an approach is the establishment of a criminological statistics bureau to provide us with comprehensive data.</P>
    <P>At present we do not have reliable and up-to-date statistics on the types of crimes committed by persons on bail, the number of persons who previously committed crimes while on bail, recidivism rates for different types of crime or patterns of juvenile offending.  We are statistically ignorant of many facts which should be before us.  Unless we gather such data and ensure it is disseminated to those charged with formulating and implementing legal policy we may well find that our response by-passes the problem and that we will be sitting here ten years from now debating the same concerns.</P>
    <P>We also need to ensure that the worthwhile proposals in the Government programme, ranging from a thorough review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme to the establishment of a prisons board and the abolition of imprisonment for civil debt and the non-payment of fines, are brought forward and implemented.  It is outrageous that an itinerant could be sentenced to five years for robbing a bale of briquettes while criminals who have inflicted bodily harm are being released. It is outrageous that because two neighbours row with each other on Bride Street in my constituency one of them spends five days in jail.  That use of scarce prison space must be confronted.</P>
    <P>While we are operating largely in an atmosphere of ignorance there are some things which we do not know.  We know that organised crime is thriving and that it cannot be addressed using the same methods with which we tackle, for example, petty and opportunistic crime. We know that those at the top of the criminal gangs are rarely involved in <Col N="2463" /> executing criminal operations.  Their role is restricted to planning and financing. Above all their role is centred on gathering the profits.  Organised crime generates large amounts of cash and stolen property that needs to be laundered. This is where organised crime is most vulnerable.  The conventional criminal justice system is simply not equipped to bring the so-called crime bosses to justice since they can rarely be directly linked with the execution of a crime.  They can, however, be linked with the enormous profits generated by their crimes.  Targeting their financial resources demands a multi-pronged approach, highly intensive policing and the use of sophisticated intelligence by infiltrating their ranks and converting former associates into informers.</P>
    <P>Finance for such a programme should be made readily available.  Such an approach must also include highly sophisticated electronic surveillance methods.  We must ensure that the technical resources of those fighting crime match and exceed the resources of those committing crime.  Organised crime must be rendered unprofitable.  That will only be done if the illegal wealth is pursued with the same vigour that the Revenue Commissioners display when pursuing PAYE workers and those with small businesses.  The proposed profit busting squad should have sufficient financial, technical resources and personnel to construct a flawless paper trail of evidence tracing illegal wealth to its criminal source.</P>
    <P>Territorial jealousies which sadly periodically display themselves are unacceptable, such as Customs and Excise officials and the Garda Síochána fighting about the value of &ldquo;crack&rdquo; seized at Shannon Airport.  The Garda Síochána tried to rubbish the Revenue Commissioners' estimate of £800,000 by suggesting the seizure was worth a miserable £80,000.  That type of sniping between two State agencies has to stop and I have every faith that the Minister will guarantee that bitter bickering between agencies of the State will cease. <Col N="2464" /> Co-operation between State agencies such as the Garda and Revenue Commissioners must be put on a statutory basis.  I welcome recent assurances from the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>As well as establishing a profit busting squad, existing measures such as those in the 1994 Criminal Justice Act need to be ruthlessly implemented.  The measures proposed in this Bill, while they obviously need to be scrutinised, would complement the existing measures and will provide a valuable weapon in the fight against organised crime.</P>
    <P>Organised crime defends itself through a calculated vicious policy of intimidation.  The ultimate form of intimidation is assassination or the threat of assassination, the greatest threat to our social and political stability. During the past two years there have been 12 unsolved contract and inter-gang killings in Dublin.  The lack of detection in this regard is a cause for great concern.  Contrary to the popular myth most of these hitmen are not slithering through loopholes in our criminal justice system because there are no loopholes in regard to murder.  They are quite simply escaping because they are known only among the criminal fraternity and to the rest of us they are as anonymous and insidious as a deadly virus infecting the body of society.  The only way to deal with these hitmen is through effective, efficient and relentless policing which relies on high quality intelligence.  Once potential assassins are identified, the gathering of necessary evidence through sophisticated surveillance begins.  With specific regard to the Bill, it seems perfectly reasonable that an individual who with good cause is suspected of criminal activity should have their assets frozen until they can prove they have been acquired legally.</P>
    <P>There may be constitutional concerns about the provisions of the Bill in regard to the freezing of assets.  These may be addressed by the amendment, reportedly suggested by the constitutional review group in regard to property rights.  When the question of bail <Col N="2465" /> is put to the people in a referendum in November I appeal to the Minister to put another question on the constitutional rights to private property.  I do not want to come into this House at some later stage and discover that the biggest crime bosses who have had their assets frozen by the State appealing their cases to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court finding in their favour on the grounds of constitutionality. We cannot afford to allow that to happen and I appeal to the Minister to consult with the legal authorities in her Department to make sure that if we are to seize assets we have the constitutional right to do so.  If it requires a constitutional change to do that, I would be delighted to be out canvassing wholeheartedly on behalf of the right of the citizens to put criminals once and for all behind bars and out of business.</P>

      <P>I am pleased with the Government's decision not to oppose this Bill.  I welcome its introduction and compliment Deputy O'Donoghue on bringing it before the House.  The murder witnessed last week has galvanised the nation into action.  We have been facing the threat of drug barons and drug trafficking for years and those of us who represent and live in Dublin constituencies are more than familiar with the problem.  In working class areas it dominates the agendas of community groups and residents' associations. However, it took the murder of a crusading journalist to focus the public's mind on the issue in a way that countless other deaths in working class Dublin has not been able to do.  The speedy reaction to the crisis is understandable, and very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sound a note of caution.  I have no difficulty with the provisions of the Bill, but it is essential that they be within the terms of the Constitution.  The public <Col N="2466" /> would not thank us in the event of this Bill being passed by the Oireachtas and being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  On this evening's television news, inner city community leaders who are directly involved in the fight against drugs while welcoming the measures announced sounded a note of concern at the extent of them and their capacity to fully deal with the problem. I share that concern, even if it may not be entirely popular to say so.</P>
    <P>My party's document on drugs which was launched this afternoon took a wider view of the problem as well as the law and order aspect, which is essential. It is crucial that tackling the supply of drugs is complemented by a policy which deals with reduction in the demand for drugs.  As long as there is a demand for drugs I have no doubt that there will be gougers prepared to fill that demand.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, as usual, have been high on morality and long on blame and accusations.  To some extent they have a point in that we share a certain responsibility for this problem. However, it goes much wider than politicians. Politicians are one aspect of Irish life, but many other more important people have simply reneged on their responsibility in this matter. The Progressive Democrats have been long on law and order but in the past week or so they have not had very much to say and they have not been proposing effective action to deal with the drugs crisis in inner city Dublin.  That aspect of their policy is totally deficient.</P>

Some of the corporation estates of Dublin are crying out for management reform and change and, as Deputy McGahon said earlier, the breakdown of law and order in <Col N="2467" /> society took place quite some time ago. The culture of crime has been allowed to grow and develop.  This needs to be counterbalanced by an emphasis on obligations and duties and, above all, the need for fraternity.</P>

It is clear that in recent years organised crime and the methods and systems it uses have outstripped the capability of the State to respond.  What we have to do now is get ahead of the game.</P>
      <P>With regard to witness protection, when Veronica Guerin's death was reported it was said the woman who had witnessed what had happened was terrified and in hiding.  This is extraordinary. The approach to witness protection will have to change.  Will the Minister examine the possibility of cross-examination by video link and how we can move forward in this area.  This is an extremely important aspect which will require more attention as we take on the issue of organised crime.</P>
      <P>While the law and order package is extremely important, if we want to tackle the drugs problem comprehensively we will need the same sense of urgency in putting education and health services in place.  There are 40 drug addicts attending the clinic in Baggot Street and a waiting list of well over 100. Three local community treatment centres are needed in Dublin south-east but it is extremely difficult to establish them because of resistance from local communities.  While this is understandable we will have to deal with this problem.  There is a need for more GPs to run methadone maintenance programmes. This cannot be done with 20 GPs in one or two areas of Dublin.  Programmes will have to be developed throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for tackling the problem extends over a wide area.  It is not <Col N="2468" /> about any one approach but a combination of approaches.  If we focus on one approach, we will not get it right or deal with the problems of drugs and crime which are intimately linked.  We will only be able to break the cycle by introducing a comprehensive package of measures covering all these areas.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Government's announcement that it accepts the Bill in principle and commend my colleague, Deputy John O'Donoghue, on bringing it forward.  I read the Minister's speech with growing incredulity.  It seems the substance of what she said is that she does not accept it, that she will introduce something entirely different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have marked some of the objections she advanced to it in its present form some of which are interesting to say the least.  We have been told that the Law Reform Commission does not agree with the system proposed.  This is supported by a selective quotation from one of its reports. Apart from the fact that it does not have a monopoly of wisdom, did the Taoiseach not rubbish it in the House recently as a body to which Governments refer matters as a device when they want to delay them?  Is that not what Fianna Fáil was accused of on the bail issue?</P>
      <P>The Minister accused Deputy O'Donoghue of being arrogant in his certitude that this legislation is constitutional.  I do not think he was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>He was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>He made the reasonable point that in the Clancy case in 1985 a <Col N="2469" /> provision along similar lines but infinitely more draconian was accepted in the clearest possible terms by the courts as being constitutional and an acceptable delimination of the right to private property in the public interest.  Article 43 of the Constitution specifically allows the right to private property to be delimited in the public interest.</P>
      <P>There is a definition of &ldquo;organised crime&rdquo; in the definitions section.  The long title, however, refers to organised criminal activity.  If I understood her correctly, the Minister advanced this as a point of opposition to the legislation. Does she expect us to take that seriously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to be exact.  I thought the Deputy was supposed to be a barrister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that perhaps the Bill is limited.  On Friday we were told it was not necessary and today that it does not go far enough.  Which line do we accept?</P>
      <P>We have been told the Bill does not cover property transferred out of the State.  I have not studied it closely enough to comment accurately and the Minister may have a point but, if so, this can be rectified by a five word amendment on Committee Stage which should be taken this week.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the word &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill and is a colloquialism which has no place in statute law.  Section 3 (1) states that property is frozen &ldquo;where an order is made restraining that person or any other person notified of the making of the order from disposing or otherwise transferring the property or diminishing the value of any specified assets for a period of 21 days.&rdquo;  There is no need to define the meaning of a term the meaning of which is clear in the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The same objection was advanced by the Minister in respect of the phrase &ldquo;true owner&rdquo; in section 7 (1). <Col N="2470" /> The meaning of this term is clear on the face of the legislation which states that &ldquo;a person is not the true owner of assets if those assets are the proceeds of organised criminal activity or assets acquired directly or indirectly from the proceeds of organised criminal activity&rdquo;.  It seems she has been sent in by the Department of Justice or her left wing colleagues in Government to act as a political wood-pecker to nit-pick holes in the legislation. That is the reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>These objections are shoddy excuses for inaction.  The Minister made the extraordinary statement that we should ensure legislation drafted for us has more substance.  We would not be forced to ask people in the Law Library and elsewhere to help us draft legislation if the Minister did her job.  It is her job to draft legislation.  She has all the resources of the Department at her command.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the 1994 legislation.  As I was acting in a junior capacity when it was introduced, I will refer to it briefly.  That legislation allows assets which represent the proceeds of either general crime or drug trafficking to be confiscated in certain circumstances after a conviction.  It also contains a limited provision which allows the DPP to seek the right to freeze assets which represent the proceeds of crime in anticipation of criminal proceedings which have to ensure within a short period.</P>
      <P>It was introduced in good faith and regarded at the time as radical and innovative.  We honestly thought it would have certain consequences, but in practice it has proved disappointing.  It is clear that a more radical and new approach is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is being debated against a grim backdrop.  It is unspeakably tragic that it has taken two high profile murders in recent weeks to galvanise the Government into taking action.  The question is, will action follow.  From that <Col N="2471" /> point of view the Minister's speech has an ominous ring to it as has the press conference with which Deputy Shatter dealt adequately.  There is no need to repeat what he said.</P>
    <P>There is a danger as time passes and the sense of outrage diminishes that the civil libertarians on the left who once supported, espoused and defended the regimes of Stalin, Hô Chi Minh and Ceausescu will rediscover their so-called principles and continue to shirk their responsibilities taking refuge behind the usual bland and empty slogans.  If the experience of the past 18 months has taught us anything it is that promises from the rainbow Coalition to tackle crime head on should come with a health warning attached.  I warn the Minister and the Government that there better be no back sliding on this occasion.  The tolerance of the public is exhausted, the Rubicon has been crossed and the vaudeville which has passed for criminal justice policy for the past 18 months must come to an end now.</P>

      <P>Unbelievably, fears are still being expressed that the decision to proceed with this legislation and the other measures proposed is a knee-jerk reaction, an instant reaction to an immediate crisis, which will lead to a sort of semi-totalitarian regime and bad law.  I want to dispel that illusion.  The problems with which we are dealing tonight are not new &mdash; they have been around for several years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and constructive suggestions have been advanced, mainly by Members on this side of the House <Col N="2472" /> but also by independent commentators outside the House who have no axe to grind.  These proposals have been stead-fastly and resolutely rejected by the Government on every occasion they have been put forward, yet these are the same proposals the Government is proposing as part of its action plan.</P>
      <P>The legislation is not a knee-jerk reaction and it will not interfere to any significant extent with civil liberties. Thankfully we have not yet reached the stage &mdash; and we never will &mdash; where the substantial curtailment of civil liberties is necessary.  The proposals in the Bill are designed to prevent the leaders of organised crime from using their illgotten gains to interfere with the liberties of others, including the most fundamental liberty of all, the right to life.  No one wants to live in a totalitarian state but neither should anyone be expected to live in a state where life has been cheapened and devalued to the extent that, to coin a phrase, it is not worth a penny candle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is specifically geared to deal with organised crime and the pocket emperors who control it.  The growth in organised crime and the lifestyles of the tsars of organised crime have contributed significantly to the perception of a criminal justice system in terminal crisis. These people live like feudal barons and openly cock a snook at the law and the law abiding.  Its leaders, who fortunately are few in number, have been given innocently sounding names which apparently have been taken from a &ldquo;Batman&rdquo; comic.  Behind these cuddly pseudonyms are the most callous, odious and evil people imaginable.  They control their areas with a vice-like grip, fear is their weapon and anyone who crosses them will attract immediate and terrible retribution without any possibility of appeal.  Generally these people originated in the ghettos and their new and lavish lifestyles are fuelled by a generation of addicts.  Despite repeated declarations of war by Governments, the power, wealth and arrogance of the overlords of organised crime increase on a daily basis.  The Bill is directed at <Col N="2473" /> these people and it will make a difference.</P>
    <P>As the overlords of organised crime are comparatively few in number, the provisions of the Bill will not be widely used and the law abiding will have nothing to fear from them.  Surely it is blindingly obvious that if the State is given the right to freeze the assets of these individuals their capacity to continue to operate effectively will be severely curtailed.  Surely it is also blindingly obvious that this is precisely what society wants and desires.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed that the Minister persists in her refusal to take Committee Stage of the Bill this week and insists on pushing it forward until 25 July.  She will be aware that similar legislation specifically directed at the assets of paramilitaries was introduced in 1985 &mdash; it was published one day, debated and passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas the next day and signed by the President the day after.  Why is this legislation different?  The leaders of organised crime present no less a serious threat to the State than the paramilitaries did in 1985.  What is happening is that these criminals are being given one month's notice to take evasive action with the assistance of the best legal brains their limitless resources can purchase.  Where is the logic in this and can anyone begin to explain it?  The Minister has certainly not explained it.</P>
    <P>The notion that assets can be frozen, or that they can be frozen without anybody being convicted, is not new.  Such legislation has been in operation in the United States for more than a decade. That country also has a written constitution which contains express protection for civil liberties and robust private property protection rights.  The Minister should know that this legislation commenced in 1984 with the comprehensive Crime Control Act, 1984, and was subsequently amended, with the result that the United States now has legislation which allows for the forfeiture of assets which are suspected of being the proceeds of crime, even when a prosecution never ultimately takes place.  Recent <Col N="2474" /> statistics show that in less than 50 per cent of the cases where assets were seized, subject to forfeiture and sold, no prosecutions took place.  The United States, which has a written constitution and which protects civil liberties in express terms without any caveats such as those built in by us and protects the right to private property much more aggressively, has infinitely more draconian legislation on the seizure and forfeiture of assets and this has consistently withstood constitutional challenge.  The director of the forfeiture office of the United State's Department of Justice was recently quoted as describing the asset seizure legislation in the United States as, &ldquo;the most valuable and powerful we have against organised crime&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a good start in tackling the overlords of organised crime and the Minister should accept it substantially as it is.  However, it must also be accompanied by other legal changes which the Government has resolutely refused to implement.  The law must be changed not to look politically respectable or to present a cosmetic change or an illusion to the public that at last the penny has dropped with the Government, but rather to end the phenomenon of untouchability in this society. This is what the public craves and it is the least it is entitled to expect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, for introducing this Bill. He has been working on it for some time and it is appropriate that it should be introduced.  Members of the committees of the House have been calling for this legislation for some time and it is unfortunate that the points made by them have not been heeded by the Government.  I do not want to be critical tonight as this issue is above party politics and the people want us to attack it as a Legislature.  However, if the Government listened to the points made at committees it would have a better understanding of what is happening on <Col N="2475" /> the ground and of the action which needs to be taken.</P>
      <P>The legislation is important in two respects.  First, it gets to the heart of the matter by aiming to seize the assets of these criminals and to tackle them in a way they have never been tackled.  I am aware that there have been other Bills in this area &mdash; some years ago I proposed a draft Bill &mdash; but this Bill goes the route which needs to be followed at this time.  Second, the legislation is important to the families, relatives and friends of Veronica Guerin, Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and others.  People regard us all as politicians and they do not understand the difference between the executive role of the Government and the role of this House.  This is an occasion when the House must be seen to stand together in agreeing the measures proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The one problem I have with the legislation is that the Government is proposing too long a gap between Second Stage and the remaining stages. I appeal to the Minister and the Government to shorten that gap and to take the remaining stages as quickly as possible so that the legislation can be enforced.  Given that it has all-party support, we must have the courage to take these measures and to do so without delay.</P>
      <P>I know for a fact that the assets are being shifted.  At long last the criminals know that because of this legislation we are catching up with them.  I suggest, even at this stage, that the Garda track down immediately and demand an account from every estate agent who is selling property above a value of £200,000 or £250,000.  We have previously told the Government what is happening and how bad the situation is but the matter was put on the long finger.  It is important to crack down immediately and at least use the existing powers to check up on what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are making changes now because they know Dáil Éireann is on the move, that it is out to get them and <Col N="2476" /> that it will get them.  The actions proposed will be effective.  This must also be associated with action at Executive level.  I am disappointed the Taoiseach did not come into the House today as his authority, power and direction are needed to make these measures work. The Minister has made various efforts and has been up against difficulties.  She can command her own Department but only to the extent she is allowed by the Government.  The person who commands the Government and the executive action is the Taoiseach.  He must involve himself and follow through on all the necessary backup that should go with this legislation.  We have had the PR, the proposals by the Labour Party and the Government's proposals this evening and they must all be acted on in concert.  The only person who can ensure that happens is the Taoiseach.  I appeal to him to follow through on what his Minister for Justice is doing in accepting this legislation and to act immediately, urgently and decisively.  I assure the Minister those actions will be effective.</P>

      <P>I wish this was not a party political issue as it merits something much more serious.  With all due respect, when Deputy Woods said &ldquo;Dáil Éireann is on the move&rdquo; I cringed because I do not believe that is true.  I welcome the Government's measures announced this evening and the statement by the Minister but I do not think it is sufficient.  I do not believe one can defeat these people by conventional methods.  They have had the first run and have a grip on the country, in Dublin city in particular, which will not be loosened by conventional methods. These people constitute a Mafia, comparable with their counterparts in Italy, as they have been operating over the <Col N="2477" /> last 40 years and the type of criminal justice system in operation here will not defeat them.  The liberal agenda introduced over the past 20 years has been absolutely disastrous.  It has taken away the powers of the Garda Síochána, the powers of the Judiciary and we as legislators are literally powerless.  We all know Members are merely voting fodder.</P>
      <P>We must assert ourselves and take back the running of the country from the undesirable elements who can go out and kill at will.  We have had 12 unsolved murders in the past two years, all of which were carried out by professional hit men, and the savage murder of Veronica Guerin last week which brought about this sense of urgency which people feel will lead to a solution to the problem.  I do not believe that. The crime problem has gone too far.</P>
      <P>Deputies McGahon, Ring and I were rubbished in the House when we told the truth.  If I was perverse enough to tell some aspiring politician how he or she should succeed and be guaranteed a lifetime in this Assembly I would say: do not tell the truth, tell lies; be politically correct, never address the problem but talk around it; give into every pressure group and talk a lot of claptrap and gobbledegook. That is the unfortunate fact of the matter.  One gets the distinct impression that people with initiative and backbone are not wanted in politics. They are like lepers.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the bail laws will be reformed as a result of a referendum as reform is badly needed.  The proposal to limit the right to silence should not be confined to dealing with drug traffickers but should be mandatory for every type of criminal.  Given that we have been much too liberal we have to take draconian measures.  I would not be shy to support a move to suspend the Constitution and bring in emergency powers whereby the Garda Síochána and the law enforcement agencies in general would have the power to immediately intern or imprison people whom they suspect of serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any need for the office <Col N="2478" /> of the Director of Public Prosecutions because it is only another stalling mechanism where criminals are concerned.  If they commit a murder tonight they will be detained for questioning for a few hours, released in the morning and the file sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That type of remote control system of justice is not sufficient to defeat the criminals.  Let there be an end to it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I said here in February that the crime problem had got out of control and that the 10,000 members of the Army at our disposal should be brought in to help the Garda Síochána.  It was reported but I did not hear anybody comment on it. It is as if we would rather pretend there was not a problem and that it went away.  I am surprised the IRA has not tried to get Brownie points from the public.  It is the only group who has the arms and trained personnel and the killers in their midst who could eliminate the godfathers of crime.  I am surprised it has not done something like this, maybe it will.  I am not advocating it should but there is a possibility that we will have a very bloody war unless we take action.  It is a daunting task for the Minister and the Government but orthodox methods &mdash; conventional methods &mdash; will not succeed.  I see people being intimidated left, right and centre but people will not admit it.  Even politicians are intimidated.  People are afraid to speak their mind.  I am aware that gardaí are being intimidated.  The question is whether the Judiciary is being intimidated.  We are aware that social welfare officers and Revenue Commission officials are being intimidated. Intimidation is rife.  We will not have law and order, democracy or freedom of speech while intimidation takes place under our noses.  We need courageous people to tackle it.  We must take action.  The law should not apply only to law abiding citizens, which is currently the case.  It should apply to the criminals, to what I call the Mafia.  Those people have no ideals.  Murder and power is their only objective.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to adopt a hands <Col N="2479" /> on approach.  Solving murders and serious crime should not be an operational matter merely for the Garda. The day must come when the politicians will have to decide what to do.  Far too much power is seconded at present.  We must adopt a direct and solid approach and send out a clear message.  If that means suspending the Constitution and introducing emergency powers, then so be it.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I will support any measure the Government introduces to restore law and order.  I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for introducing the Bill and I will thank Members from any side who support the Minister in her efforts to restore a sense of normality to the lives of our citizens.</P>
      <P>The rancour in the House this evening is regrettable.  The tensions displayed are unnecessary.  We all know we must work together to restore a state or normality to the country.  The public want us to do that.  Let us work together to enact the necessary legislation.  I welcome the proposal to hold a referendum on the bail laws in November.  We should support the Garda in its efforts to bring criminals to justice.  Politicians, parents, the Garda, the church and the media have a part to play in bringing back a sense of normality to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before coming into the House tonight a constituent telephoned me to say how justice has affected him.  Last year he rented a house, at a modest rent of £50 per week, to a person employed by the State.  After the first week the man did not pay any rent and after ten weeks my constituent told him he would have to get out if he did not pay the rent.  The man left the house and, through Threshold, took action against the owner. Even though the case was thrown out of court, costs were granted against the owner and he received a Bill for £2,100. Members of the Garda have called to his house three or four times in the past week.  He will be arrested and put in jail <Col N="2480" /> on Monday if the money is not paid.  Is that the way law and order should operate? Our justice system must be examined thoroughly.  We should work collectively to do what the public want, to bring back a sense of normality to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and commend Deputy O'Donoghue on his proposal to give extensive powers to Garda chief superintendents and the Revenue Commissioners.  This is crucial if we are to deal with the vicious godfathers of illegal drugs who have treated the State with impunity and reduced many areas of my native city to a sense of helplessness and fear.  I commend the general approach adopted by Deputy Bertie Ahern and Harney to stamp out the terrible evil which endangers our democracy.  However, last year when I pursued the question of the powers that should be extended to the Revenue Commissioners, I was surprised at Deputy Ahern's bitter opposition to section 153 of the Finance Act, 1995. Fianna Fáil's ambivalence to tracking down ill-gotten gains and income that cannot be explained was surprising.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell dubbed section 153 as a snitcher's charter &mdash; whatever that is supposed to mean &mdash; when the Minister, Deputy Quinn, was simply trying to create the basic conditions which would have enabled us to do what Deputy O'Donoghue called for tonight, confiscate the gains these outrageous criminals have taken from, in most cases, the vulnerable in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt a sense of desperate loss and intense anger when I heard of the recent deaths of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and the journalist, Veronica Guerin.  Veronica interviewed me on a couple of occasions about the general crime problem in Dublin.  She lived not far from my home.  The people of Artane are especially outraged at the dastardly murder of such a noble, brave and fearless journalist.  It is with great frustration that I speak on the matter.  I have spoken on the subject of crime six or eight times since my election to the <Col N="2481" /> Dáil.  Approximately a year ago I spoke here following an outrageous gun attack on a senior police officer's house in my constituency.  It is appalling that we have had to wait for these recent tragedies to create the political will to attack the core of the problem.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed a relentless slip into a hell of drug-fuelled crime, with massive harassment, intimidation, the open sale of drugs and flouting of the law, particularly in the most vulnerable and deprived areas of the city.  Like many others I noted the concerns expressed in the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning.  Where were the people from <i>The Irish Times</i> during the past four or five years when night after night my constituents experienced relentless pain and suffering at the hands of criminals, whom I hope we have in our sights tonight?</P>
    <P>Our key failure has been a lack of political will and determination to co-ordinate State agencies to focus on the godfathers of illegal drugs and crime. There is a lack of Garda resources, which I have often noted in my constituency. I welcome the Minister's announcement of a significant increase in the strength of the Garda, many of whom I hope will be stationed on the northside of Dublin.  Community policing has been a successful preventative measure and should be extended.  There has also been a lack of political will to deal with the problems in our prison system.  I welcome the measures announced tonight by the Minister.  I look forward to her increasing the number of prison places and to the opening of the drug free unit in Mountjoy.</P>

      <P>It is open and I look forward to its further development.  At long last the Minister has tried to grapple with the problems of our court administration which is still somewhere in the mid-18th century.  Why do the courts close down for four months a year?  Even Deputies, who have often been criticised now work a full 11 <Col N="2482" /> month year in Committees and in the Dáil.  Why should judges not do the same?</P>
      <P>We have shown a remarkable unwillingness to deal with the terrible lack of resources in youth facilities and training, particularly in urban estates.  I welcome the Minister's announcement about the youth diversion programmes with the Garda.</P>
      <P>I noticed on Sunday, listening to a repeat broadcast of an interview with Veronica Guerin, that while she would have approved all the measures we now propose she said we needed to change focus and transfer resources to vulnerable areas.  The record shows that for years the most vulnerable parts of Dublin have been most deprived.  They have not received their fair share of national resources.</P>
      <P>Our other major failure has been to co-ordinate State agencies in directly taking on the crime godfathers.  That is why I applaud my colleague Deputy Shortall and my other colleagues in the Labour group who produced a report today on the drugs menace and organised crime.  They advocated the establishment of an organised crime unit and a national drugs enforcement agency, which we have needed for several years. I look forward to all our resources being focused on this area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the comments in that report about education and treatment, and particularly on estate management which I hope will have an airing at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs later this week.  I strongly support the measures that will be taken on the bail laws.  I welcome the Minister's announcement on the referendum in November.  I also welcome her determination to do something about the right to silence in drug trafficking cases and the Opposition proposal for a witness protection programme.</P>
      <P>I hope we at long last have the political will and are prepared to co-ordinate resources.  Enough is enough and we want to see action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time <Col N="2483" /> with Deputies Wallace and Gregory. There is an unbelievable sense of shock at the murders of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin.  Ordinary people are determined that those atrocities will prove to be the high water mark of the crime wave that has swept the country.  I welcome the decision of the Government to implement a crime package at the prompting of Deputy O'Donoghue.  We must be clear, however, that what is proposed is only a tentative first step.</P>
      <P>More prison places, more gardaí and a co-ordinated response from the Revenue Commissioners, Customs and Garda Síochána have been desperately required for some time.  It is a tragedy that these recent murders had to be the catalyst for action.</P>
      <P>We must not forget that Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin were not the first victims.  The country was horrified as elderly people were terrorised, beaten and murdered in their homes in isolated rural area.  The next wave of terror consisted of the gangland hits in Dublin.  It is a measure of the extent to which our society has been degraded by crime that many people felt these gangland hits were only the just deserts of thugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The murder of Veronica Guerin was proof, if proof was needed, of the extreme danger to all if the liberty or rights of one of us is taken away.  It is now clear this epidemic is not confined to Dublin's inner city or to the people of a certain social class.  A great deal of the complacency to date was based on the premise that it was.  As horrifically evidenced by the series of atrocities on elderly people in rural areas this crime wave has spread not only from one part of Dublin to another but into rural areas as well.  Representing Wexford, I am particularly aware of the problem of crime.  Wexford has the unfortunate distinction of having had the biggest rise in crime of any rural area.  Some of this is undoubtedly attributable to our proximity to Dublin but a great deal of our crime is home grown and is as likely to <Col N="2484" /> be fuelled by drugs here as it is anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The effect of crime goes far beyond the actual crime.  Fear is engendered in the victim and his family.  People's quality of life is seriously affected in many ways for a long time.  Society as a whole loses its sense of openness and friendliness. The image of rural Ireland as a place where the door is left on the latch is now entirely out of date.  Within ten years or less the society of the open door and the unquestioning welcome has been extinguished.  What we all took as being normal all our lives we have now let slip from our grasp forever. When Deputy Bertie Ahern said the political challenge is to win the streets back for the people, he had it right.  We also need to win back the boreens and laneways of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Wexford it is common knowledge there are two so called drug barons.  These people openly live far beyond their visible means and gardaí are virtually powerless to touch them.  By now this is a familiar story which has been dealt with exhaustively in the media.  I mention these people only to point out that this horrible phenomenon is not confined to Dublin. Drug barons are living off the fat of the land in many rural areas.  Inevitably, it follows there are also drug users and addicts with all the misery and crime that follows from this litany of abuse.</P>
    <P>There is much more I could and should say.  It is indicative of the problem we face that so many people wish to speak but do not have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>While the level and nature of crime in society is now alarming, there is one aspect which is particularly sinister.  This relates to the increasing evidence that widespread organised crime is now a fact of life.  It is clear that major crimes, such as bank robberies, require the co-operation of a number of criminals.  The overall supply and distribution of illegal drugs also depends on a high level of organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers the direct and <Col N="2485" /> indirect negative consequences on society of the illicit drug trade, it is clear that a comprehensive approach is required from the State to tackle organised crime as a matter of urgency.  While each and every possible strategy must be used to attack organised crime, it is extremely important to keep in mind that most crime is carried out with the clear purpose of illegally accumulating wealth.  Consequently, one of the most effective ways of taking on organised crime is to attempt to identify the destination of illicit resources and to remove them from criminals.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a significant step in the right direction.  Its early implementation has the potential to strike a major blow at the heart of organised crime.  It will have at least two major effects.  The wealthy criminal who has flouted the law to date will be put under serious pressure for the first time.  He or she will no longer be secure in the knowledge that no direct line of evidence exists to tie assets to specific criminal acts.  The requirement to clearly identify the source of their wealth will present them with an extremely unwelcome challenge. Ultimately, they will be likely to lose the greater part of such assets.  Furthermore, they will have little time or opportunity to plan for new crime if sufficient pressure is brought to bear on them regarding justifying current asset levels.</P>
    <P>I urge that renewed efforts be made by each and every one of us to remove the evil of serious crime from society. The task ahead is formidable and will require much patience, courage and determination.  However, it cannot be stressed enough that the battle must first of all be taken on with the full resources of the State and, subsequently, it must be pursued with vigour and determination.  At this stage we simply cannot afford to lose any more time before uniting to play a key role in furthering the battle against crime.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing a few minutes of their time <Col N="2486" /> with me.  I listened earlier to the Minister with as much attention as I could in the context of the exchange between her and Deputy O'Donoghue, but I am still not clear if the Minister's view is that the objective of the Bill can be achieved on Committee Stage.  She accepts the principle of the Bill although she detailed many flaws in it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that because the legislation is essential.  However, existing powers available to the Revenue Commissioners could be utilised against drug barons, but there is no evidence to suggest they have been.  The same will happen with this legislation if there is no effective agency to make use of the powers and target the assets of drug dealers.  That is why for some considerable time I have pressed that a special agency be set up consisting of the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and social welfare officials, people with expertise, that whatever powers it requires be given to it and that the Garda gives it a list of the main suspected drug dealers.  If those people were convicted there would not be a problem in targeting their assets.  They are suspects, but they are well known to the Garda.  Such an agency must be set up in tandem with the introduction of new legislation; one will not be successful without the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of law enforcement, gardaí should be redeployed in sufficient numbers to deal with drug supply and drug dealing.  I am aware this is not the Minister's responsibility but that of the Garda Commissioner and I lay much blame with the current Garda Commissioner for not dealing with this matter. It is evident to me, and I am sure to representatives who spoke before me, that the number of gardaí deployed to deal specifically with the drugs problem is inadequate.  I hope the new Garda Commissioner will change that position, otherwise many of the people involved in drug dealing at present will be as big <Col N="2487" /> as the main dealers in two or three years' time.</P>
    <P>I have lost confidence in the Judiciary.  The recent Felloni case is an exception, but other cases indicate that the Judiciary is out of touch with the problem.  There is little option but to introduce mandatory sentences &mdash; this suggestion was made by Deputy O'Donoghue &mdash; but they should relate to heroin supply.</P>
    <P>I have been told in the last day or two that a school in an area I represent, which experiences a serious drugs problem, is to lose a teacher.  If that can happen in a community battling against drugs, we are wasting our time debating legislation such as this.</P>

      <P>This is a unique occasion in that it is the first time in many years that a Private Members' Bill has been taken in Government time.  The reason for that is also unique in that for the first time in the history of the State a journalist has been murdered for attempting to expose the activities of one of the worst types of criminal.</P>
      <P>I had the great privilege of having known Veronica Guerin for a very short time and, like many people, I am still numb at the knowledge that this remarkably courageous lady was silenced, most probably, on the orders of one of the so-called drug barons.  In the circumstances it would be very easy for legislators to respond in a highly emotional manner to this horrific crime by enacting legislation without giving enough thought to the consequences, but I do not believe that any Member would be so disposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past 18 months my party introduced a succession of Bills covering a wide area of crime, including the type of organised crime which this Bill seeks to address.  It is said that the dogs in the <Col N="2488" /> street are aware of the manner in which the godfathers of organised crime flaunt their ill-gotten wealth.  My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, is to be highly commended for the work he has put into this Bill, which is designed to prevent these parasites from enjoying the fruits of their evil crimes.  The Bill has not been prepared overnight or with undue haste.  I am well aware of my limitations in the field of law, but I find it difficult to find any obvious flaws in the Bill.  It seeks, in the absence of direct evidence admissible in court, to make this an unprofitable crime.  Not only do the drug barons of Dublin and elsewhere deserve to be deprived of their loot, they must also be deprived of their liberty for a very long time.</P>
    <P>My abhorrence of drug barons did not begin with the death of Veronica Guerin.  More than six years ago I spoke on the Criminal Justice Bill which abolished what then remained of the death penalty.  Up to that time the death penalty applied only in the case of the murder of gardaí and diplomats.  The Bill changed that penalty to a mandatory sentence of 40 years' imprisonment.  I said then that if the ultimate penalty were to be justified, it should be used for the so-called drug barons who prosper from selling drugs to others, mainly youngsters, while being careful that they and their families do not partake of them.  I said that if we are to have a segregation policy in our prisons, those callous individuals should be confined where they belong, with other murderers. My opinion has not changed in the meantime, and what happened last week strengthens it further.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a caring person who is genuinely concerned about what happened. I believe that she would like to be regarded as the Minister who dealt with the participants of organised crime, who took the radical decisions presented to her tonight.  It is not entirely the Minister's fault or that of her party that that has not been done before now.  I heard her say on &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo; that she would support a referendum on bail, and her party supported building a <Col N="2489" /> prison in Castlerea, but what happened to change the Minister's direction?  The level of crime has never been as high as in the past 18 months and it demands action from the Minister.  Her speech tonight, however, represented classical Department of Justice hyperbolical procrastination. The Government agreed to this debate, not out of generosity as claimed by the Minister at the beginning of her speech, but because it was forced to do so by public pressure, evidenced by the mounting floral tributes outside the gates of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The criticisms of the legislation by the Minister for Justice tonight would have been more appropriate to Committee State, I will not have the opportunity in the short time available to me of answering all the points raised not just by the Minister but by other Deputies.  The Minister's speech was as pedantic as it was peripheral. The amendments which would be required arising from the Minister's contribution would take no more than one hour to draft.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that protection rackets, for example, are not covered.  I would remind her that demanding money with menaces is an offence under section 23 of the Larceny Act, 1916. Thus, if £10,000 or more is extorted, that offence is covered.  The Minister was incorrect when she stated there is nothing to prevent the removal of assets from the State.  Whoever told the Minister that has demonstrated an appalling lack of understanding of legal procedure. If a restraint order has been made, it is clearly in contempt of the court's order to remove the assets and that offence is punishable by a fine or imprisonment.  In this or any other legislation the High Court does not need any statutory provisions to enforce one of its orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the provisions of the Bill are needlessly absolutist but if she had cared to read section 6 it would <Col N="2490" /> have been apparent to her that an application can be made to the court for living and legal expenses prior to the filing of affidavits.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made recently both inside and outside this House &mdash; as if it had any relevance to this issue &mdash; that the tax amnesty comes into the picture.  Let us be quite clear about the tax amnesty.  If a person obtained assets by illegal means and subsequently availed of a tax amnesty, that person is guilty of a criminal offence.  That is the position and there is little point in drawing red herrings through the debate.</P>
    <P>This legislation does not hinder the Revenue Commissioners.  It will be of enormous assistance to them in relation to people who may have utilised the tax amnesty to launder money or to make themselves look respectable.  This legislation allows the Revenue Commissioners to say in court it is their opinion that the individual in question obtained the assets concerned through organised crime.  It allows the Revenue Commissioners to reopen the file on such an individual.  Unfortunately, there has been an attempt in the debate to divert attention from the issue at hand.</P>
    <P>The Minister questioned the constitutionality of the Bill.  I have stated before and reiterate now that the opinion of a chief superintendent is accepted in criminal trials for the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation contrary to section 21 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 by reason of the provisions of section 3(2) of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972.  If the opinion of a chief superintendent is sufficient to deprive a person of his or her liberty for up to seven years because he or she was a member of an unlawful organisation, it cannot be seriously argued that the opinion of a chief superintendent is insufficient to deprive a man or woman of the use of their assets. The argument simply does not stand up.</P>
    <P>The freezing provisions in this legislation are broadly similar to the provisions in the Offences Against the State <Col N="2491" /> (Amendment) Act, 1985.  That legislation was considered by the courts in 1985 and Mr. Justice Barrington, in refusing the declaration sought to the effect that the Minister's freezing of the assets in that case was invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, held that despite reversing the ordinary onus of proof by placing it upon the owner of property seeking to establish his entitlement to it, the machinery of the 1985 Act nevertheless provided for a fair hearing and compensation in cases of error, as does this Bill, and thus constituted no more than a permissible delimitation of property rights in the interests of the common good and that it was not, therefore, an unjust attack upon private property contrary to the Constitution.  The arguments on the constitutionality of this Bill do not stand up.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct when she states there is provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 &mdash; full credit to the previous Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for her work in that respect &mdash; and these restraint orders can be made by the court in relation to an individual's assets where that individual is convicted or where there is a clear intention to prosecute, but there is no provision for the freezing of assets on the opinion of a chief superintendent or a Revenue Commissioner &mdash; if nothing else came out of the debate tonight, that much is crystal clear &mdash; let alone a provision, following upon the freezing, for the confiscation of those assets by the court after a given number of years.</P>
    <P>In her contribution tonight the Minister engaged in what I can only describe as an academic excursion.  The truth of the matter is that the provisions of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Members who participated in the debate and acknowledge their resolve to take swift and effective action against organised criminals.  I confess to being disappointed at the contribution of the Minister.  Not for the first time she has failed to understand the purpose and effect of criminal justice legislation introduced in this House. She has displayed a capacity to erect obstacles where there were none, to create difficulties where none existed and to generally seek excuses for inaction.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed by the legal advice the Minister has received.  Presumably it is from the same source which told her the changes to the bail laws proposed by this party would be unconstitutional. They now form part of Government policy.  The Minister views the Constitution as an obstacle to progress. We view it as a sword to be used in defence of our citizens.  It is apparent that our two views will not meet and that we will never agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education for taking the time to deal with this debate.  I want to discuss a case involving a Dublin hospital which illustrates a shortcoming in the treatment of a child with salmonella and a lack of clear procedures for parents of young patients who have a grievance.  If the proper procedures were in place, I would not be required to raise this matter in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case involves a 20-month-old child who, over an eight-day period in June, went through a traumatic series of events which began on a Friday when the GP sent the child to the hospital with suspected gastro-enteritis.  The child was not admitted, although it was unable to give a urine sample or to drink water.  There was no change on Saturday.  On Sunday the child appeared listless, was rushed back to hospital but was not admitted, became sick on the way home and, on the advice of the GP, was immediately rushed back to hospital where treatment was administered. Although a cot was available, the hospital advised the parents to take the child home again because it would not be available the following day. There was no change on Monday and on Tuesday the GP wrote another letter to the hospital asking for the child to be admitted.  A new doctor who was on <Col N="2494" /> duty said the results of the tests were not ready and sent the child home again.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday blood was found in the child's stools.  The GP sent the child back into hospital but the treatment the parents and child received was careless and arrogant with the blood the child was excreting being likened to nothing more than a nose bleed.  The child was admitted into isolation as salmonella was suspected.  The parents were not told what the problem was, although they overheard salmonella being mentioned. On Thursday morning blood was found on two nappies.  Even then the doctor said the child was not sick but was in pain and would be miserable &mdash; that sounds like a sick child to me.  The child was put in a new ward with no curtains although the family were in the VHI.  On Friday the child drank and ate a little but two hours after saying it should be kept in isolation, the doctors said the child should go home.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder these parents feel aggrieved at the treatment they received.  It is important that lessons are learned from this case so that such trauma does not occur again.  Procedures must be put in place to alleviate parents' anxiety and to ensure proper communication between the GP and the hospital.  It is clear that writing letters was not the appropriate communication in this case.  A system must be put in place so that official complaints can be made to Eastern Health Board hospitals and other hospitals.  The doctor should realise the problem is serious if a child is not drinking water.  Sending a child home does not comply with proper medical practice.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to address the matter which has been raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Children's Hospital, Temple Street that the child in question was referred to the hospital's accident and emergency department on Friday, 7 June 1996 by his family doctor. The child presented there at 00.15 hrs on Saturday, 8 June 1996 with a 48-hour <Col N="2495" /> history of diarrhoea.  A diagnosis of gastro-enteritis was made and the child was sent home on standard treatment of oral rehydration.  The child was seen again on Sunday, 9 June 1996 at midday with the same symptoms.  Once again, clinical examination revealed his hydration to be adequate and again he was sent home on the standard treatment.</P>
    <P>He was brought back by his parents at 7 p.m. on Sunday, 9 June 1996 because of increasing concern on their part.  He was considered to be mildly dehydrated, was given some intravenous fluids and was sent home.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, 11 June 1996 he was brought to the hospital again with persistent symptoms of gastro-enteritis. Once again, he was examined and sent home on standard treatment.  On Wednesday, 12 June 1996 when his parents brought him to the accident and emergency department, he was examined by a consultant and found not to be dehydrated.  The consultant explained that the cause of the diarrhoea might well be a salmonella gastro-enteritis. I understand the consultant also explained at some length that initially there is no treatment for this complaint and that persistence of symptoms for a week or more would not be unusual.  The child was admitted on 12 June 1996 for observation to an isolation ward.  After the first night he was moved to another room with a lower level of isolation facility.  This room is used as an overflow ward when the hospital is busy.  The reason the child had to be moved was because another patient was admitted who required the full level of isolation facility.</P>
    <P>The hospital informed me that the result of microbiological analysis of the child's diarrhoea revealed he had salmonella, a bacterial gastro-enteritis, and his symptoms were typical of this condition. I understand that this condition does not normally require antibiotic treatment and oral rehydration at home is commonly advised by the Children's Hospital, Temple Street.  The child was discharged on Friday, 14 June 1996.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2496" /> I sympathise with the parents in this case and I appreciate how worried they must have been.  However, I am informed by the hospital authorities that the treatment of this child, having regard to the symptoms presented, was in line with standard procedures in place at Temple Street hospital.</P>
    <P>I have been aware that some of the present accommodation in Temple Street is in need of improvement.  It has been agreed in principle that the hospital will in time be relocated on the campus of the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>In the interim, however, I am anxious that the Children's Hospital will be provided with adequate facilities to enable it to perform its important functions in the delivery of paediatric hospital care. That is why last year the Minister approved a £700,000 major upgrading of the out-patient department at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street.  On the basis that the hospital authorities are contributing £275,000 to this project, the Minister agreed to make £425,000 available. He also made a capital grant of £60,000 to the hospital this year to refurbish the existing out-patients department. The work has now been completed. The next area of priority is the accident and emergency department and the Minister asked the hospital to submit a plan in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I attempted to resolve it by direct correspondence with the Minister and by way of parliamentary question and when those avenues failed I sought the recourse of the Adjournment Debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members may not be aware that St. Patrick's national school in Drumcondra is associated with St. Patrick's training school and viewed as a premier education venue.  Members may not be aware that it has a special facility for children on the northside with impaired <Col N="2497" /> hearing and provides an important education stream for those with hearing difficulties, but I do not raise this matter on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Two wheelchair bound children are being provided with mainline primary education in the school.  They require assistance for a variety of reasons including access to toilet facilities and the upstairs and downstairs of the two storey school built to accommodate mobile children.  The school employs FÁS trainees to assist the children in question, but those assistants, who are required to attend training courses on certain days, are not available every weekday and the children's parents have been asked to fill in for them. Those of us who are parents realise that parenting is difficult enough, but when one is the parent of a handicapped child, it is extremely difficult.  It is an additional burden on parents who are already very stretched to request them to present themselves at school to help their children.  If those parents do not present themselves, their children, who are aged ten to 12, are assisted by teachers or pupils of their own age who lift them up and down the stairs, with the consequent danger that poses.</P>
    <P>I made this case directly to the Minister and she has made an important and admirable strategic decision this year to concentrate all her resources this area in the provision of a 15:1 ratio in areas of special disadvantage.  Perhaps the Minister of State can explain why the Minister has not left herself flexibility to respond to the most serious cases of this kind, where there is no support for the teachers and pupils who share a classroom with the two children in question and who try to fill in for the classroom assistants, to facilitate this desirable development, the education of handicapped children in mainline schools, which we all support.  Surely there must be classroom assistants who do not require replacement in the existing venue.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's priority and I supported her attempt to break the cycle of disadvantage to which she <Col N="2498" /> will allocate all her resources in this area next year, but there must be flexibility to respond to these cases.  I argue that this case involving two wheelchair bound children, whose parents are required to come in on a regular basis to school to ensure that their children are able to manoeuvre the school and gain access to toilet and other basic facilities, is special.  If we are serious about integrating handicapped children, we must be able to provide these additional services.  It is no accident that people at the later stage of their lives were arguing for similar services outside this House today, but such services are equally important at this stage of those children's lives.  I ask the Minister to consider this case.  I know there are other cases, that of autistic children in the special autistic school, but I argue for the case I outlined.  The Minister should allow some flexibility to respond to such cases and I ask her to consider my case in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education is not in a position to make child care assistant posts available to primary schools.  Those assistants are generally employed in special schools to assist children with disabilities and their duties involve tasks of a non-teaching nature.</P>
      <P>Since her appointment to office, the Minister for Education has allocated an additional 155 child care assistants to special schools.  A total of 100 child care posts were allocated to special schools with effect from September 1995 on the basis of priority of need following recommendations from the Department's primary inspectorate and having regard to data supplied by schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substantial improvements which have already been achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of the Minister's committment to the needs of the children in question.  However, she has to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  The Minister must <Col N="2499" /> determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>During the period 1993-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 child care assistants, the Minister adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes. These include a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio in all facilities, a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates, additional remedial teachers and additional resources teachers for pupils with special needs enrolled in mainstream schools.</P>
    <P>In the current year, as Deputy Flaherty said, the Minister adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and has sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach a major new initiative was recently launched aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that substantial advances have been achieved across the spectrum of special needs, including the child care assistant area.  It is the Minister's intention to continue this process. However, the issue raised by Deputy Flaherty has been noted, it is understood by the Minister and will be taken into account in the context of any future allocation of child care posts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We politicians deal with constituency problems daily but now and again one comes across an appalling case of injustice.  I refer this evening to one involving St. Mary's national school, formerly the Presentation Convent school in Dungarvan with 450 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have requested repeatedly, by way of parliamentary question and otherwise, that that school be classified as disadvantaged so that its staff and pupils receive every assistance possible but, so <Col N="2500" /> far, unsuccessfully.  On Friday week, 21 June, the longest day of the year, I received a deputation, including the school principal, Sr. Mary, along with a number of her staff.  The story they related was absolutely appalling, stranger than fact; I could not believe what they have to endure.</P>
    <P>There has been a breakdown in our society, particularly within the past five to ten years which has not been adequately addressed.  Teachers are merely engaging in a task of containment rather than teaching which is probably typical of what is taking place in many other urban areas.</P>
    <P>My heart went out to that delegation when I realised what they have had to ensure.  They have a terrible job.  I want to see action.  I have a list of the statistics required when they sought disadvantaged status.  For example, the number of pupils living in lone parent households is 79; the number of pupils whose fathers or mothers did not even reach group or leaving certificate standard is approximately 155; the number of pupils whose parents are not interested in education is 122; the number of pupils coming from families where there is drug and alcohol abuse and violence is 83, the number of pupils whose parents lack parental skills is 105; the number of pupils whose parents have reading and writing problems is 96; the number of pupils with behavioural problems that interfere with other pupils' learning opportunities is 91; the number of pupils undernourished and neglected is 61; the number of pupils who are the subject of poor hygiene, inadequate sleep and a junk food diet is 118; number of pupils recommended for a school for handicapped children but who would not attend such a school is 27; the number of pupils socially or sexually abused is 102.  It portrays an absolutely appalling scenario.  It is amazing that school, its teachers and pupils cannot obtain disadvantaged status.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a deputation from that school attended the Department of Education on Thursday last and got a <Col N="2501" /> receitive response from the departmental officials they met.  I am demanding that this school be given disadvantaged status.  There is a tendency nowadays for affluent parents to take their children out of schools like this one.  While not decrying the laudable success of the Gael scoileanna, they have become elitist, children of middle class parents being sent there.  The same is true of schools on fringes of towns in urban areas, with a couple of good teachers and a small number of pupils where middle class parents prefer to enrol their children.  This leaves the children of working class, unemployed parents and of lone parents, grossly socially deprived, as is evident from the statistics I have just given.</P>
    <P>It is an appalling scenario not understood by the general public.  Perhaps politicians do not understand it either.  I thought I had heard and seen everything where deprivation was concerned, but this case begs comparison.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure these pupils and teachers are afforded every possible assistance by affording them disadvantaged status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the school in question applied for disadvantaged area status.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Deasy said, having portrayed this case in a very graphic, disturbing manner.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 primary schools were newly included in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The case put forward by the school in question was considered at that time. Unfortunately, when regard was had to the relative positions of competing schools, the needs of that school were not considered to be of such priority as to warrant their inclusion on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, schools have been selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators.  The indicators in question were developed by a <Col N="2502" /> working group comprised of representatives of the Department of Education, schools management and the INTO and have been in operation for some years.</P>
    <P>Factors taken into account included the incidence of unemployment; local authority housing occupancy and medical card holding among the parents of the children concerned.  Account was also taken of the views of the Department's primary inspectorate on the relative levels of need between applicant schools and the prevailing pupil-teacher ratios of the schools.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the Minister for Education commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to conduct a detailed review of our current approaches to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage. The Minister's decision to commission this study arose from a concern to ensure that our supports were properly targeted and children with real need were in a position to benefit from the scheme.  The criteria used in selecting schools for special support and the nature of the supports provided were among the issues addressed in the study.</P>
    <P>The report presented by the Combat Poverty Agency was one of the most comprehensive studies of educational disadvantage ever undertaken in the State.  It examined the concept of educational disadvantage as it impacted on pupils in the education system.  It reviewed the procedures in place to identify and address educational disadvantage. The report also evaluated the effectiveness of current approaches, using a wide range of national and international research data.</P>
    <P>While the report recognised the very considerable advances made in alleviating the effects of educational disadvantage, it also made a series of comments and recommendations aimed at improving current arrangements.</P>
    <P>Among the key issues raised in the report was a concern that under the current criteria, the scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage. It was recommended that the criteria be amended to better reflect <Col N="2503" /> educational disadvantage as manifested in rural settings as well as urban settings.</P>
    <P>It also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The report also considered that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the schoolgoing population.  In this connection, it was noted that the present scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>In response to the Combat Poverty report, the Minister for Education recently launched a new targeted initiative which aims to &ldquo;break the cycle&rdquo; of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  Schools are being selected for support under this initiative by reference to new selection criteria which have been developed by the Education Research Centre.  The new criteria take on board the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and address educational disadvantage in both urban and rural settings.  The initiative has both an urban and a rural dimension.</P>
    <P>For urban schools, a targeted programme of supports will be made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway urban areas.  In each of the selected schools there will be a maximum of 15 pupils in all junior classes.  The schools will also have access to special grant assistance for the purchase of books and materials.  A newly appointed co-ordinator will support the development of the programme in the selected urban schools.</P>
    <P>A special initiative will also focus on schools throughout the country with fewer than five teachers and particularly schools in rural areas which are serving dispersed populations and which have concentrations of disadvantaged children.</P>
    <P>In this case, supports will be made available to 25 clusters of schools.  Each <Col N="2504" /> cluster will be served by a newly appointed co-ordinator who will work with the families and teachers involved. Children attending schools in the selected clusters will attract a special capitation rate of £75 per pupil.  The schools will also attract special grant assistance for the purchase of books and other materials.</P>
    <P>The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the target schools and invited applications for consideration for support under the new initiative.  The centre will prioritise all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit fiveyear development plans.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problem of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>
    <P>Given the findings of the detailed studies to which I have referred, I am satisfied that the targeted initiative now being pursued by the Minister for Education represents the most appropriate response to the problem of educational disadvantage in our primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for his patience at this late hour.  I wish to share my time with Deputies Hugh Byrne and Batt O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>People are bewildered and frightened by the outcome of a recent murder trial which is serious.  Monstrous crime must be taken out of the system and, surely, in 1996 the powers of the State should be expected to co-operate fully with each other in denying liberty and freedom to those engaged in monstrous crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has a role in having the case referred to <Col N="2505" /> the Supreme Court.  I understand it is normal practice for the DPP to review judicial decisions.  He has all the legal expertise available to him and should immediately set about a review.</P>
    <P>I am also reliably informed that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions had this case on hand for quite some time.  I do not want to question the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution about its slowness in bringing this case to trial.  If more staff are needed they should be immediately recruited by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>For up to three weeks we read in the papers about the slowness of the investigation by the Garda Síochána of this tedious and difficult case.  The Garda has been unfairly criticised, and few people believe they were trying to subvert the course of justice.  I do not know the gardaí involved but people in the community in which they reside tell me they have the highest regard for them and were delighted at their success in bringing this case to court.</P>
    <P>The relatives of the victims in this case must not be forgotten, or the trauma they endured while waiting to hear of their loved ones.  It is terrible that monstrous people can road free in one of the most civilised countries in the western world.</P>
    <P>Every day we are told that it is time we moved against the criminals.  Here is a perfect example of a monster walking free.  Cases like this damage confidence in the Judiciary and the Garda Síochána. We must not forget the strain they put on the Garda and the frustration and disillusionment gardaí suffered because of this case.  The Garda, as a group work ably and forcefully in our community with their hands and little or no equipment.  Gardaí need all the help and assistance they can get.  I sympathise greatly with them and suggest that every assistance be given to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The magnitude of this case is unbelievable and calls for the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Supreme Court immediately to reopen the investigation into this case. <Col N="2506" /> We are all aware of what happened.  The family of one of the victims, the O'Brien family from Kilmore in County Wexford, want to being this tragic affair to a conclusion.  They want to know where their son's body is, and to bring him home for burial.  That is a reasonable request.</P>
      <P>This murderer also butchered the body, having committed murder.  In the course of the court case the defending barrister, in a legal sleight of hand to divert attention from the real issue, said that a message must be sent to the Garda Síochána regarding sloppy investigation. I am not so sure that the Garda Síochána were sloppy in their approach. I am happy the Garda performed well with their hands literally tied behind their backs.  The judge, unfortunately, fell for this sleight of hand and swallowed the tactic hook, line and sinker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed at the vehemence of the condemnation of one of the finest, most upright, responsible and meticulous members of the Garda Síochána in Cork, a member who has served in the Special Branch for many years protecting the State from subversion.  It was the ultimate insult to accuse that some member of subverting evidence in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2507" /> The question that arises is whether the defence evidence would have been admissible in any event, given that it was based on hearsay.  The defence obviously played this to its maximum, and the judge decided in their favour. The problem is that the person accused of murder is walking free in the streets of Cork and there is fear among the people in that city.  Is it not ironic that the person who brought the charge is now on trial together with his colleagues arising out of the judge's decision?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, no right of reply in court was given to that superintendent. Why does the DPP not appeal this decision?  Why does the Attorney General not get involved?  Surely it is fair to ask the Minister those questions given that the State would hardly have taken this case in the first place if it did not have substantial evidence.  An internal inquiry is going on in the Garda Síochána at present and we will allow that inquiry to take its course.  However, the Minister should show solidarity with the members of the Force and appeal this decision.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is precedent for such an appeal.  In one instance a decision of this judge was overturned by the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 16 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of environmental impact of transmitting antennae and associated masts is primarily a matter for local planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála.  I am aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is in the process of finalising guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae.  I also understand that this matter is the subject of a separate question to the Minister for the Environment today and it, <Col N="2028" /> therefore, needs no further elaboration by me.</P>
    <P>I have, however, requested the State companies under my aegis who have relevant infrastructure to facilitate colocation where feasible.</P>
    <P>According to the best available scientific authorities, endorsed in April this year by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, there is no substantive evidence that adverse health effects can occur in people exposed to non-ionising radiation at the levels associated with telecommunications masts.  These levels are well below internationally recognised safe limits.</P>
    <P>The international limits are mandatory ceilings under the terms of licences issues by me such as the ESAT DIGIFONE GSM licence.</P>
    <P>Forbairt has measured emissions from base stations at a number of locations and found them to be a small fraction of the recognised international limits.  I will ensure that that there will be an ongoing degree of monitoring of such emissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Euratom Treaty was drawn up nearly 40 years ago when nuclear power was in its infancy.  Its main objective was the promotion of nuclear power.  The health and safety provisions of the Treaty are <Col N="2029" /> relatively weak.  In the 1950's, the dangers of ionising radiation, and the environmental aspects of the nuclear industry such as waste management, reprocessing and the use of spent fuel were not fully understood or appreciated as they are today.  Ireland believes that the Treaty health and safety provisions need a complete review to reflect current thinking relating to the protection of public health and the environment.</P>
      <P>The possibility of strengthening the Euratom Treaty provisions concerning nuclear safety has been raised by Ireland in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference which is considering amendments to the Treaties of the Union.  Amendments to the Euratom Treaty require unanimity. However, Ireland is exploring areas where progress might be possible and is considering whether to submit amendments.</P>
      <P>The possibility of enhancing the nuclear safety provisions is of particular relevance to the further enlargement of the EU.  The safety of nuclear power reactors in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union remains a major cause of environmental concern worldwide.  Undoubtedly nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe acceding countries will play an important part in accession negotiations which are expected to commence in 1998.</P>

      <P>How can there be a genuine sharing of risk between the public and private sector?</P>
      <P>How do we ensure that there is significant equity participation where private investment is proposed. Otherwise there may be no real value in pursuing the option, particularly if it is just another form of borrowing.</P>
      <P>Where loan financing is involved the cost has to be comparable with direct borrowing by the State or the relevant public authority.  Loan-based investment in projects where the State is the eventual owner is likely to be regarded as public expenditure under the Maastricht debt and deficit criteria.</P>
      <P>Is private investment a cost effective option for the State?  This has to take account of the total rolled up cost of private investment compared with direct public financing.</P>
      <P>We have to ensure that private investment can be obtained and used in a way which is compatible with EU and national public procurement rules and, that where EU assistance is being sought, the proposed private investment is compatible with the rules of the particular EU fund.</P>
      <P>We also have to ensure that any such investment would be compatible with overall public policy and in particular with the relevant sectoral policy for transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These issues are not particular to Ireland alone.  At the Informal Transport Council in Rome in April of this <Col N="2031" /> year, Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock proposed the establishment of a high level group which would be mandated to help find new ways of accelerating the implementation of publicprivate partnerships, especially for priority projects on the trans-European networks.  Arrangements to establish the group are being made at present and my Department will be represented on it.</P>

      <P>The CCR agreement is a milestone event, crucially important to the future of ESB and of critical national significance for the competitiveness of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Implementation has commenced with staff categories who accepted the CCR. ESB is continuing to work with the group of unions to see how the situation with the remaining staff might be resolved.</P>
      <P>While the CCR is a costly deal, it is self-financing and according to ESB has a payback period of just over four years. From the year 2000 onwards annual gross savings are projected at approximately £85 million but some of this will be offset by annual ongoing costs of about £27 million, leaving the annual net savings at about £58 million. Government approval to the CCR was conditional on an agreed level of annual savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Future price increases are contingent on satisfactory implementation of the CCR.  The implementation of the CCR is being monitored on an ongoing basis <Col N="2032" /> by my Department and ESB's external auditors have also been requested to sign off on the savings.</P>
    <P>The Government earlier this year approved electricity price increases for the next three years.  The first increase is now being implemented and involves an average 2 per cent price increase effective from the May-June billing period. This is the first electricity price increase in over ten years.  The increases have been designed in a way to minimise the impact on the competitiveness of Irish industry and business.  Industrial and commercial customers will see rises of less than 2 per cent this year and domestic customers will see rises of 2.8 per cent in 1996.</P>

      <P>There are two separate changes emerging, namely a proposal for a directive on common rules for the development of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service and a proposed Commission Notice on the application of the competition rules to the postal sector and in particular on the assessment of certain State measures relating to postal services.</P>
      <P>It is clear that with liberalisation and harmonisation affecting all the main utility sectors, the postal sector would inevitably be reached.  The Commission proposal for a directive is not particularly ambitious or liberal and it seems likely that the version which will emerge from the negotiating process can be accommodated in Ireland without any particular difficulty.  The draft is structured as a guaranteed minimum universal service supported by a reasonable reserved area.  There are open questions still about liberalisation of direct mail and incoming foreign mail both as to the extent and timing.  There will likely be a political commitment to a second phase of liberalisation in 2001.  The quality of service targets are soft in a North European context but will apparently stretch some southern member states.  Progress with the draft directive has been slow and I intend to push it forward as much as possible during the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Commission Notice, which they are entitled to issue under their own authority, sets out a demanding set of interpretations of Treaty rules.  It would be highly desirable to have a directive containing positive law in parallel with this notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of scheduled road passenger services, other than those provided by Bus Éireann and Bus Atha Cliath, is governed by the Road Transport Act, 1932.  Difficulties with the implementation of this legislation have been encountered over the years and there is a general consensus that it is in need of updating in a number of respects.</P>
      <P>As I have advised the House on previous occasions, I have initiated a comprehensive review of the legislative framework within which bus services are provided.  As an essential part of that process, I began a round of consultations late last year with all of the major interest groups associated with the road passenger sector.  That phase of the review is well advanced, and when completed, will provide the basis for the preparation and appraisal of realistic options for a new legislative framework within which the road passenger industry can develop in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further factor to be taken into account in this review is the move at EU level towards further liberalisation of road passenger cabotage, that is the freedom for suitably qualified road passenger operators established in any member state to provide services in another member state's domestic market. At present, EU Council Regulation 2454/92 permits cabotage for all road passenger services, except ordinary scheduled services.  The Commission has now tabled proposals for the extension of cabotage to all scheduled services, including inter-city services.  These proposals in their present form could have <Col N="2036" /> very significant implications for Irish road passenger operators in both the public and private sectors and I am giving them very careful consideration on that basis.</P>
    <P>The public transport contracts, which it is proposed to introduce in 1997, will relate exclusively to socially necessary non-commercial public transport services provided by CIE.  These contracts will replace the annual global Exchequer subvention which CIE currently receives.  The purpose of this new policy is to place the provision of Exchequer support for CIE on a more transparent, closely focused and resultsoriented basis, in line with best international practice and with EU policy on State support for public transport services. The contracts can, however, be adjusted in due course to take account of the outcome of the current review of the Road Transport Act, 1932 and of any new EU legislation affecting public transport operations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 423 together.</P>
      <P>The development of An Post is a matter for the board and management of the company in the first instance and the company is entitled to conduct any new business which comes under the scope of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 and its Memorandum and Articles of Association. Since its establishment in 1984 the company has shown a capacity and willingness to expand into new areas of activity appropriate to its core business.</P>
      <P>However, proposals which involve investing in other undertakings or the setting up new subsidiaries are subject to the approval of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications with the consent of the Minister for Finance in accordance with the provisions of section 16 (2) (f) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post is keenly aware of both the threats and the opportunities that arise from the increased use of electronic communications.  The board of the company, as far back as 1990, recognised that changing technology and markets posed a challenge to the maintenance of <Col N="2039" /> the traditional mail business.  This analysis gave rise to the creation of a subsidiary company, PostGEM, founded specifically to respond to the changing market conditions through the development and marketing of electronic products.</P>
    <P>After Telecom Éireann, PostGEM is today the operator of Ireland's largest managed communications network, providing not just E-mail but electronic data interchange (EDI), hybrid messaging and internet services.  It aims to build on its success so far and to provide services that both complement and supplement the traditional business of An Post.</P>
    <P>My policy in relation to An Post, as with other State companies, is to have them provide good quality cost-effective services in the interest of their customers and on a profitable basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 402 and 403 together.</P>
      <P>The present Government, in its policy agreement document, A Government of Renewal, has clearly set out its views on nuclear threats arising from the British nuclear industry, particularly from Sellafield.  A committee of Ministers was set up last year to co-ordinate a strategy to progress the Government's policy in this area and develop a blueprint for action to implement various proposals. Action has already been taken on many of the commitments and is proceeding on others.</P>
      <P>Concerns about the British nuclear industry identified by the committee have received my priority attention over recent months and I have availed of every opportunity to raise my strong objections and concerns about the industry's activities.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I have voiced my concerns to the British authorities about specific incidents at nuclear plants and the safety aspects of facilities at Sellafield, THORP and the ageing Magnox reactors and the privatisation of the UK nuclear industry.  High level diplomatic approaches have been made to countries which supply spent fuel to the THORP reprocessing facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a public planning inquiry in January of this year, I also objected to NIREX's proposals for the establishment of a rock laboratory near Sellafield which I regard as a precursor to an eventual <Col N="2042" /> underground nuclear waste repository. It is expected that the inquiry inspector will complete his report by the end of October and that the Secretary of State for the Environment will consider the inspector's conclusion later this year. Pending the inspector's report and the UK Secretary of State's decision, I am consulting with the Attorney General about what further actions are open to me under EU and international law. If appropriate, I would also be prepared to make approaches at diplomatic level.</P>
    <P>Many of these issues I have discussed were also raised a recent meeting of the Ireland-UK contact group on nuclear issues.</P>
    <P>One of the commitments in the blueprint is to reassess legal opinion on the possibility of taking a court case over Sellafield.  The committee of Ministers on Sellafield has asked the Attorney General to reassess the possibilities for legal action against Sellafield.  A firm legal base on scientific evidence is, of course, a vital element in this matter. There are ongoing inquiries in this regard and the position is kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>Recently in the Supreme Court, counsel for the State supported the four Dundalk residents in their action against an appeal by BNFL over the decision of the High Court last year which established the jurisdiction of the Irish Courts to hear the substantive case against BNFL.  My Department is also making available to the Dundalk plaintiffs, on a voluntary basis, its files and documentation concerning Sellafield and other related aspects relevant to the Dundalk plaintiff's substantive case.</P>
    <P>These actions and positive steps are clear evidence of my commitment to action against Britain's nuclear industry. I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to an effective strategy to minimise the threat posed by all British nuclear activities and will ensure that no effort is spared in doing so.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he has taken to ensure that the Gypsum deposit at Glangevlin, County Cavan is extracted at the earliest possible date; the further measures, if any, he will take to ensure that the gypsum will be processed locally and that the maximum benefit will accrue to the local community in terms of job creation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is premature to discuss possible development of the Glangevlin gypsum deposit until such time as the extent and quality of the deposit and the commercial viability of mining it have been established. That has not yet been done.</P>
      <P>The current prospecting licence holder, Gypsum Industries, PLC, is undertaking a proper exploration programme in relation to the deposit and has commenced drilling.  That exploration programme is being monitored closely by my Department.</P>
      <P>Even if that exploration programme establishes in a year or two that the deposit could be developed commercially, no mining or processing could start until after the necessary planning permission, an Environmental Protection Agency licence and a State mining facility have been granted.</P>
      <P>Where and how gypsum would be processed would be a commercial matter for the developer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.</P>
      <P>The regional airports are owned and operated by private undertakings and as such the development plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are primarily matters for the individual airport companies.  I should also point out that since the establishment of the Single Market on 1 January 1993, all member states airlines are free to operate on any international route within the European economic area without any restriction on frequency, provided slots are available at airports.  The question of whether any airline wishes to exercise such rights is, however, entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgement.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that in order to improve access to the regions from abroad thorough the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department has introduced a programme of essential air services in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92.  This programme, which covers services between four regional airports &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and Dublin, is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.</P>
      <P>So far operating contracts have been awarded for Kerry/Dublin and Galway/Dublin routes.  This programme applies to routes within Ireland only.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, in order to assist the airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports, marketing grants were paid by my Department to the six regional airports during 1993 and 1995.  Furthermore, I announced just recently the Government's approval for a similar income of Exchequer grants for the six regional airports which will total £2.35 million over the four years to 1999.</P>

      <Quest>if he will address the alarming statistics regarding long-term unemployment in Dundalk, County Louth, in view of the recently published report by the OECD on Irish job creating initiatives as part of the Government's EU local development programme; if he will give detail of the the initiatives taken in this respect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The OECD report titled, <i>Ireland, Local Partnerships and Social Innovation,</i> was launched by Deputy Gay Mitchell, Minister of State, with responsibility for European Affairs and local development, on 30 May 1996 at a conference held in Dublin Castle. Copies of the report have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The report provides compelling evidence of the potential of local partnerships to be responsive and innovative in tackling local economic and social problems. A number of case studies were undertaken as part of the study one of which was Paksort in Dundalk.  The expert group found that the community in Dundalk displayed a striking level of ingenuity and problem-solving in the way they organised themselves, planned and worked to achieve their various objectives.  The report considered that the Paksort project and others like it were impressive and tangible examples of partnership and solidarity between all sectors in a local community for the benefit of that community's future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994&mdash;1999, 38 partnerships have been established in designated areas of disadvantage.  Twelve of these partnerships were in existence under the Area-Based Pilot Initiative under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> with Dundalk Enterprise Partnership being one of those Partnerships. Thus since 1991, the Dundalk Partnership has been successfully engaged in <Col N="2046" /> addressing issues of social exclusion, including long-term unemployment, in a participative way.</P>
    <P>Following the appraisal of the Action Plan of the Dundalk Partnership, Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd. has allocated £2,547,000 to the Dundalk Partnership for the period of the operational programme.</P>
    <P>Among the activities which the partnership is engaged in are: enterprise promotion and development; the Local Employment Service; business advice and support; education, training and childcare and environmental improvements.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Local Development Programme the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment made a series of recommendations to address long-term unemployment which are being put in place by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>The Government remains very concerned about continued reports of human rights violations in Turkey.  In common with our partners in the European Union, we have made it clear that observance of a rule of law and of fundamental liberties underlie the development of our relations with Turkey.  While recognising the difficulties posed by a sustained campaign of violence, we have insisted that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within the law and with full respect for human rights.  The <Col N="2053" /> Government believes, moreover, that the situation in south-east Turkey should not be approached purely as a security problem and has called for a political settlement which, while respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Turkish State, would allow for appropriate expression of the Kurdish cultural identity.</P>
      <P>The process of completing the customs union with Turkey has already given significant impetus to reform in Turkey, including the approval of a number of amendments to the Turkish Constitution in July of last year. Amendments have also been made to Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law which has resulted in the release of a number of detainees.  These changes are a step in the right direction.  Our concern, in common with our EU partners, is to see that these reforms are implemented both rapidly and effectively and Ireland, as Presidency of the EU, will seek assurances from the New Turkish Government that they will continue to pursue the reform process.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northen Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland.</P>
      <P>This programme is very much a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; one, and was approved following an extensive consultation process in the prospective eligible area.  As the Deputy may be aware, this process revealed that the issue of social inclusion was seen as the most important factor right across the range of the sectoral interests surveyed.</P>
      <P>While social inclusion is the specific focus around which the programme is built, several of the measures include actions aimed at improving the economic development of the eligible area in support of social inclusion.  Sub-programme 2 (Urban and Rural Regeneration) permits a range of actions to be implemented by county councilled task forces, or by ADM Ltd. if Community-led projects are involved.  There is also some scope for development under sub-programme 5 Measure 2 (New Industrial Development Services) again implemented by ADM Ltd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the European Commission was insistent that the programme reflect the wishes and needs of local communities, the Deputy will appreciate that the Government or individual Departments have no directionary powers in the matter. However, should application be made to the programme for support for the area mentioned by the Deputy the programme guidelines require that the <Col N="2055" /> relevant statutory agencies responsible for industrial development be consulted.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the decision in the North to fund the advance factory in Strabane under the programme has led to widespread criticism. The agencies charged with implementing the programme in the Border counties will need to consider the reason for this criticism if called upon to assess similar applications for funding.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland.  The programme was approved by the European Commission on 20 July 1995.  The Commission, resulting from the local consultation process carried out in the eligible area, had insisted on the maximum use being made of intermediary funding bodies (IFBs) to be funded by way of global grant on foot of legal agreements signed between the Commission and the IFBs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Departments with responsibilities relevant to the wide span of actions envisaged by the programme were involved in the preparatory period in the drafting of the programme.  In view of the extent of local development &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; actions and given the emphasis on social inclusion the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Social Welfare proposed, respectively, Area Development Management Ltd. <Col N="2056" /> (ADM), which already had responsibility for delivering the local development programme, and combat poverty as suitable IFBs.  This was endorsed by the Commission, and both bodies were charged with implementing a range of measures appropriate to their areas of expertise.</P>
    <P>The global grant agreements were duly signed by the relevant parties on 8 December 1995.  The agreements provide for a re-consideration of the suitability of any IFB to continue its role under the programme should its performance fail to attain the standard expected.  In this connection, the midterm review of the programme, which is required by the Commission before the question of further funding for the programme for 1998 and 1999, will cover all aspects of affecting delivery of the programme. The review will be carried out by independent assessors appointed following an open tendering procedure.  In carrying out the review the assessors will have regard to the views of the widely representative programme monitoring committee and consultative forum, as well as local target groups.</P>

    <P>The amount which may be claimed is the excess of the cost of health care over £100 for an individual or, alternatively, <Col N="2057" /> the excess of the aggregate cost of health care over £200 for the taxpayer and his dependants.</P>
    <P>The expenses for which relief is available include: the services of a practitioner; diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner; maintenance or treatment in a hospital; drugs or medicines supplied on the prescription of a practitioner; the supply, maintenance or repair of any medical, surgical, dental or nursing appliance used on the advice of a practitioner; physiotherapy, or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner; orthoptic or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner, or transport by ambulance.</P>

      <P>The European Regional Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF) are administered by my Department and EU receipts received in my Department in 1995 under these funds amounted to £358.1 millions and £102 million respectively.</P>
      <P>ERDF aided development is implemented through a series of economic sectoral operational programmes whereas the Cohesion Fund is project based.  Details of the programmes and projects in respect of which the above European Regional Development Fund and CF aid was received from the EU and the corresponding receipts, are outlined in the following annexes 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>ERDF and Cohesion Fund aid in respect of developments co-financed by Central Government accrues to the Central Fund as an Exchequer receipt which then helps to finance the Public Capital Programme.  Where EU receipts are not associated with central Government expenditure, they are generally disbursed on the instructions of the appropriate parent Government Department.  My Department does not operate any grant schemes.</P>

      <P>The Irish Red Cross Society has agreed to administer a humanitarian assistance scheme to aid the victims of flooding which occurred in January 1996 and to that end have recently undertaken at my request an assessment of the extent of the flood damages in County Tipperary and throughout the south and south east generally arising from that flooding and of the level of resources required to assist the victims.  Their report which I received within the past two weeks formed the basis of a submission which has been made to Government to provide additional Exchequer funding to augment the grant of 300,000 ECU's which was recently approved by the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>Pending a decision by the Government on the matter I am not yet in a position to confirm the total amount of moneys that will be available to the Irish Red Cross Society for disbursement under this humanitarian assistance scheme, nor could I yet indicate when the funds might be paid out.</P>
      <P>However, I would hope they would be paid out shortly.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who maintain the register of all vehicles in the State, that a breakdown on a county by county basis is only available in respect of all agricultural tractors, i.e. both new and used vehicles.  The Commissioners do not maintain a county by county record of new agricultural tractors only nor of general haulage tractors.  The retrieval of the additional data requested would involve a reprogramming of the mainframe computer which would be time consuming and costly.  The available information is shown on the following schedule.</P>
      <P>The local authorities which are mentioned in the Deputy's question are not the agents of the Revenue Commissioners and I am informed that the records kept by them are in respect of tractors which are licensed for road tax purposes.</P>

      <P>Work is progressing in my Department and in the Valuation Office on the preparation of the draft heads of a single, comprehensive and modern valuation Bill, which will streamline and update the valuation system.  As the current valuation code incorporates legislation stretching over a period of a century and a half, work on its replacement by a modern statute is a necessarily complex and painstaking task.  I would not expect that a fully drafted valuation Bill would be ready for the consideration of Dáil Éireann for some time yet.</P>

These sites were not on the market at the time.  However, it is understood that the owner of one of the sites is now prepared to dispose of it specifically for a Garda station.  The Commissioners will arrange to have the site examined as soon as possible to determine its suitability and will also have to ascertain what consideration is being sought for it.

      <P>I have no comment to make on the Deputy's reference to a drugs shipment through Castletownbere beyond what I have already said in the House at Question Time on 12 March 1996. As the House has been informed on a number of occasions previously, the Revenue Commissioners concluded that, in the new situation brought about by the introduction of the Single Market <Col N="2069" /> on 1 January 1993, the most effective means of providing a Customs service in the Bantry Bay/Beara Peninsula area was to have staff centralised in and operating from Bantry and deployed on a flexible basis to various locations, including Castletownbere, to meet the needs of the work.  In recognition of the large concentration of fishing vessels at the port at certain times of the year, however, the full time assignment of an officer of Customs and Excise is authorised during the peak period and, in fact, an officer was in full-time attendance there for over three months this year. As to the off-peak season, a Customs service is, as indicated, provided by means of the deployment of staff from Bantry on a flexible basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are fully alert to the dangers of drug smuggling along the coastline, including smuggling through ports in the south-west of the county.  Experience has shown that intelligence gathering and surveillance, rather than a static presence, are the best means of combating drug smuggling.  The Commissioners have made a substantial commitment in terms of staff and other resources to the Customs National Drug Team (CNDT). Sixteen members of the CNDT are based in Cork to staff operational, intelligence, maritime and sniffer-dog units. Intelligence units, each comprising two full-time members of the CNDT, are also based in Bantry and Tralee and are supervised by two higher executive officers, who become involved in drugs-related work as necessary.  All units are mobile and employ the most modern means of communication and have access to aerial and sea surveillance. <Col N="2070" /> Specialist CNDT Officers in the Cork and Kerry region can call on assistance, where the need arises, of other Customs and Excise staff.</P>
    <P>The Customs service has also enlisted the assistance of the business community engaged in the import/export trade in fighting drug smuggling through the memorandum of understanding programme as well as the general public through the drug watch programme, which encourages coastal communities and maritime personnel to report unusual occurrences in their areas to Customs by freefone or freepost.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the present measures taken by Customs, in co-operation with the other enforcement agencies concerned, provide adequate protection against the illegal importation of drugs along the south-west coast.  The deployment of resources is, of course, kept under review.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the work of the Domestic Violence Project being conducted at the Cork Marriage Counselling Centre in the treatment of violent men and in providing support for their abused partners and children.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been considering for some time now, from a health services point of view, how best to make progress in relation to this whole issue of domestic violence.  I recognise that the provision of emergency refuge accommodation and other family support services, while <Col N="2073" /> necessary, deals only with the symptoms of domestic violence and does not confront the issue of violence itself.  This is a more complex issue and one which no one Government Department or Agency can tackle in isolation.  The nature of the problem calls for a wide ranging interagency and interdisciplinary approach.</P>
    <P>I am also, of course, conscious of the fact that the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 came into force in March last.  I feel it would be important to monitor the effect of the implementation of this legislation before coming to any firm conclusions with regard to the planning of future developments on the health side for victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>In view of the multi-faceted dimension to the issue of domestic violence, the Government has decided that action to deal with the problem of violence against women should be co-ordinated across all relevant Departments and arrangements are being finalised in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose taking Questions Nos. 61 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>All Irish residents qualify for a comprehensive range of health services depending on their means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
      <P>Medical card holders are entitled to the full range of public health services free of charge.  No illness or disease is precluded under the medical card scheme and in this regard all medical card holders are entitled to the appropriate treatment.  In addition, general practitioners are obliged to ensure that no discrimination is exercised as between the treatment of medical card holders and private patients.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are, of course, entitled to the full range of public hospital and public consultant services for the treatment of illnesses and diseases.  They are also entitled to avail of the community drug schemes which provided assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with on-going medical conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified by their general practitioner as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.  Accordingly, I am <Col N="2075" /> satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State to those in the community with long-term medical conditions.</P>
    <P>I am advised that VHI members with ME are entitled to the same benefits as every other member of the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to research, the Health Research Board is the main mechanism through which State funding is channelled to medical and related research. The Health Research Board is not currently engaged in funding a research project in the field of ME.  However, this condition is the subject of widespread international research in a range of medical and scientific disciplines with a view particularly to elucidating its cause which at present is unknown.  The Department of Health, and indeed the medical profession in general in this country, monitor this research with a view to incorporating any new proven findings in the diagnosis and management of this difficult condition.</P>
    <P>Since ME is not a notifiable disease, national figures on the incidence of this conditions are not routinely available. International studies based on survey techniques have not proved reliable estimates of prevalence due primarily to the lack of consensus regarding positive diagnosis of ME.  Statistics on hospitalisation include a diagnosis category of &lsquo;Unspecified Encephalitis&rsquo; which accounted for 46 cases in 1995. However, it should be noted that most cases of ME do not require hospitalisation and, furthermore, that &lsquo;Unspecified Encephalitis&rsquo; may include other forms of encephalitis in addition to ME.</P>

      <Quest>if he will clarify the position of children who are abandoned by their parent/parents and who are looked after by relatives; the payments, if any, that are made to the foster families involved in view of the fact that it appears they receive no payments, whereas foster parents receive £60 per week and people looking after orphans receive £40 per week; and if he will make a statements on the matter in view of the fact that current rules seem to discourage families from assisting others.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995 provide for the payment of allowances to relatives who have children placed with them by health boards in accordance with the regulations.  The standard rate of allowance payable in such cases, effective from 5 June last, is £45.60 per child per week for those under 12 years of age and £61.80 per child per week for those over 12 years of age.  These rates are in line with those payable to foster parents.</P>
      <P>Health boards may pay higher rates of allowance in particular cases where children are placed by boards in either foster care or with relatives.  This may, for example, involve a child who has a disability or other special needs.  Boards may also make available a range of additional payments to cover items such as medical, school or clothing expenses. In cases where children placed by health boards also qualify for the orphan's allowance payable by the Department of Social Welfare, it is the practice of boards to reduce the standard allowances payable in respect of foster care or placements with relatives by the amount of the other allowance received.</P>

      <P>In order to address the growing problem of suicide in Ireland, I established a Task Force on Suicide in November 1995 with the following terms of reference: (i) To define numerically and qualitatively the nature of the suicide problem in Ireland; (ii) To define and to quantify the problems of attempted suicide and parasuicide in Ireland, including the associated costs involved; (iii) To make recommendations on how service providers can most cost-effectively address the problems of attempted suicide and parasuicide; (iv) To identify the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities and (v) To formulate, following consultation with all interested parties, a national suicide prevention strategy.</P>
      <P>The task force is already well advanced in preparing an interim report, to be submitted to me shortly, in which they will quantify and define the nature of the suicide problem in Ireland. The rest of 1996 will then be devoted to a major consultative process involving all interested parties and leading to the formulation of a prevention/reduction strategy.  The task force has already invited submissions from all interested members of the public, statutory and voluntary organisations.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is departmental policy that all health care staff who have regular contact with blood and are at risk from occupational injury should be vaccinated against hepatitis B.  The vaccination of staff working outside the health services is a matter in the first instance for the employing authority.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) Regulations, 1994 every employer has a duty to assess the risk of exposure of employees to hepatities. If that risk assessment reveals that there is a risk to the health of employees due to their exposure then vaccination must be offered free of charge to employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>I understand the person in question was placed on the Mater Hospital's waiting list, in February 1992 and at this time the hospital is not able to give an exact date of admission.  The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.  The patient's general practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>
      <P>The number on the cardiac surgery waiting list as at 13 June 1996 was 1857. The information requested concerning the number of persons on waiting lists under the various headings is not readily available.  I have sought the information from the hospitals and I will forward it to the Deputies as soon as it is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy to deal with cardiac surgery waiting lists has been to provided additional facilities and infrastructure <Col N="2089" /> within the public hospital service to increase annual activity.</P>
    <P>To date this strategy has resulted in an additional cardiac surgeon being appointed at the Mater Hospital where the annual activity for open heart operations has been increased by 250 per year to 1,000 per year; an additional cardiac surgeon being appointed to Cork University Hospital to increase the output from 200 to 400 open heart operations per year.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of this action will be to increase annual activity for cardiac surgery in the public hospital service to 1,400 per year an increase of 47 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to further expand the public hospital capacity for cardiac surgery. I am fully committed to the provision of additional capacity including the appointment of additional cardiac surgeons on a permanent basis within the public hospital system over the next two to three years.  This examination of the long-term requirements has already begun.  However, because of the need to ensure that future developments are well planned to allow sufficient time to put in place the type of permanent, expensive, high cost infrastructure required for cardiac surgery it will take some time before this additional capacity comes on stream.</P>
    <P>In the interim my Department is engaged in the purchase of open heart surgery from health care organisations at prices which are reasonable and affordable on a once-off basis.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress that the major objective is to increase the permanent capacity for cardiac surgery in the public hospital sector and in the meantime to provide additional procedures quickly to ease the problems of those awaiting cardiac operations.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the short-term approach together with the long-term planning initiative will ensure that waiting times for cardiac surgery are reduced significantly and I look forward to co-operation from everybody involved to bring this about as quickly as possible</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the scheduling of surgery is the clinical decision of the consultant concerned.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir &mdash; Registrar-General &mdash; and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>I am aware of one case in which the difficulty referred to by the Deputy has arisen under the provisions of section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the parties to an intended marriage, <Col N="2091" /> having served notification of their intention to marry on the Registar for a particular district, subsequently decide to change the location, i.e. church, place or building, at which their marriage is to be solemnised and the new venue is in another registration district, they must give three months notification of their intention to marry to the Registrar of Marriages for the new district in order to comply with the requirements of section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995. Alternatively, the couple may apply to the courts for an exemption to the notification requirement of section 32 of the 1995 Act under section 33 (1) of the 1995 Act, prior to the solemnisation of the marriage.  Applications for section 33 exemptions are a matter for the Circuit Court or the High Court.</P>
    <P>An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir is obliged to act strictly in accordance with the relevent provisions of the 1995 Act in relation to the prior notification of marriage. If, in a spirit of helpfulness, an administrative solution were to be offered to a couple who have changed their minds about the location of their marriage, doubts would be cast on the validity of the marriage and on the integrity of the carefully constructed system designed to protect the lawfulness of all marriages.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Because of the difficulty in formulating a precise definition of epilepsy it is not possible to give the exact number of epilepsy sufferers in Ireland.

      <P>People with epilepsy can avil of services provided in the normal course of health service position through the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People with epilepsy are not automatically entitled to a medical card because of their condition.  Entitlement to health services in Ireland is based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship to provided general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are <Col N="2093" /> revised annually in line with the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Epilepsy is one of the conditions which entitles people under the longterm illness scheme to obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of their condition.</P>
    <P>In addition, funding is provided each year through the health boards to Brainwave &mdash; the Irish Epilepsy Association &mdash; to enable it to provide support and information to people suffering from epilepsy.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be <Col N="2095" /> aware, the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and their families.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Over the past few years additional funding has been made available to the health services to implement key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  Whilst health boards do not maintain places in day centres and homes for the elderly specifically for Alzheimer's patients, the investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care, respite services and nursing home places has increased the support available to those with Alzheimer's disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  This is reflected in the ongoing progress being made to improve further health and welfare services for the elderly and their carers, including the development of specialist assessment and community support services for people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease.</P>

    <P>I might add that my Department allocates £80,000 annually in core funding to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in <Col N="2096" /> recognition of the contribution the society is making to the development of services for people with dementia throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which commenced on 1 September 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Almost £16 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>

    <P>The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 June 1996 is in the range of £202.88 &mdash; £214.79 per week.  This is the same rate as applies in the health services to group one nonofficer grades.  This scale applies throughout the country and is increased from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel.</P>
    <P>With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies considerably throught the country.  In particular in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups which accounts for the wide variation within the area.  In all boards the rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  There is no formal limit to the number of hours allowed each week for home help.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that payments made to part-time home helps do not come within the scope of the PAYE system. Neither is such income taken into account for the purpose of a means test where a part-time home help, or the spouse of a part-time home help, is in <Col N="2099" /> receipt of a means tested social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>The average rate currently applying in the health boards are as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 86, 98, 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to say that I welcomed the publication on Tuesday last, 25 June 1996 of the report of the Independent Review Group, chaired by Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien.  This was a difficult task and I would like to commend the chairman and the group for its thorough and comprehensive analysis of the issues involved.  My Department contributed to the report and endorses the overall findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On initial examination, it is clear that the report raises many important issues, a number of which fall to be dealt with immediately by the agencies concerned. In this context, I would like to acknowledge the hospital's acceptance of the review group's findings and its commitment to implement their recommendations. Similarly, the North Eastern Health Board has welcomed the publication of the review group's report.  I <Col N="2101" /> understand that the North Eastern Health Board and the International Missionary Training Hospital have set up a joint working group to assess the recommendations as they impact upon their respective agencies and their working relationships.</P>
    <P>The report also requires detailed examination within my Department to consider what actions should be taken to implement the report's recommendations on a national basis.  I note in particular the groups recommendation that a working party involving voluntary and health board hospitals, the clinical professions and the Department of Health should draw up common, written Protocols for dealing with allegations of sexual abuse by members of staff in hospitals.  As I stated publicly, and as indicated in paragraph 1.9 of the report, I support the introduction, on a national basis of such Protocols, practices and procedures as may be shown to be necessary.  In this regard, I will be establishing in the near future a working party on the lines set out in the report.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of appointing health board members to the boards of voluntary hospitals, I have no proposals of this sort in mind.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the question of the cost of counselling services to date, I understand from the hospital that the sum is in the region of £25,000.00, which includes the cost of setting up the helpline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Section 51 of the Medical Practitioner's Act provides that the Medical Council may apply to the High Court, in relation to complaints made against a registered medical practitioner, for an order suspending the registration of the doctor concerned where the council decides that it is in the public interest to do so.  This application, as provided for in the section, is made and heard in camera.  The order, if granted, is immediately furnished to the doctor.  The court, in granting the order, may direct that in certain instances the order may be published to other parties including the public at large.  The court would take into account in this regard the requirements of the public interest including the basis upon which the order was sought in the first instance.  The court requires that when it makes such an order that a sworn inquiry will be held into the complaints, as provided for in the Act, and the order remains in force, normally until the inquiry has been completed and a decision has been made by the Medical Council and all proceedings arising therefrom have been concluded.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, including the provisions of section 51, are being reviewed at present.  I hope to be in a position to bring forward legislation amending the Act by the end of the year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The management of the Western Health Board's 1996 allocation is a matter for the board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>In 1995, I added £3 million to the Western Health Board's revenue budget for acute hospitals.  In the current year £1.5 million of this sum was carried forward in the budget base. Within the past few weeks, I confirmed a further extra sum in recognition of the pressures throughout the board's acute hospitals.</P>
      <P>In discussions with the board earlier this year a service plan was agreed in which the board confirmed that they would meet the 1995 approved levels of activity within the 1996 budget.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Between 1992 and 1994, my Department centrally negotiated with the VHI Board a level of reimbursement for public health agencies in respect of VHI members.  This was appropriate at the time in the light of changes in eligibility arising from the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991.  My Department is no longer involved in such arrangements.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as the issue raised in the Deputy's question is one for negotiation and agreement between the insurer and the service providers concerned, it is not appropriate for me as the regulator of health insurance here to express views on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Question Nos. 93, 94 and 95 together.  The number of patients on hospital waiting lists nationally and in each health board area, in each speciality, at the end of December 1995 is set out in the following table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  This figure is 252 less than that given in a reply to the House on 23 April 1996 when a figure of 28,004 was given.  This was caused by double counting of 252 cardiac surgery cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Waiting List Initiative, which was <Col N="2106" /> launched in May 1993, has been targeted specifically at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times were causing the greatest hardship. These include: orthopaedics (hip replacement and others), ophthalmology (cataracts and others), ear, nose and throat, vascular surgery (varicose veins), plastic surgery, general surgery, gynaecology and urology.  The overall aim is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months for adults and six months for children in these particular specialties.</P>
    <P>Under the 1995 initiative, for which a sum of £8 million was allocated my Department entered into agreements with health boards and voluntary hospitals throughout the country for an additional 10,394 in-patient procedures and 6,728 out-patient appointments to be completed by the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>All agencies succeeded in meeting their agreed targets under the Waiting List Initiative 1995 and I am pleased to report to the House that the overall targets were exceeded.  The total number of in-patient procedures performed was 12,861, while under the out-patient initiative a total of 12,078 persons were called for appointment. One of the main principles underlying the waiting list initiative is the concept that maximum value for money is achieved in respect of the public funds invested in the initiative.  It is essential to the success of the initiative that agreed targets are met.  I am committed to this approach and will ensure that a focus on performance will continue to be a central condition attached to any further funding provided for the reduction of waiting lists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Approximately £17.5 million was paid in 1995 for medical indemnity insurance for medical consultants, general practitioners in the general medical services scheme, and those covered by the medical indemnity scheme, including non consultant hospital doctors and dentists employed in health boards, voluntary hospitals and other participating health agencies. The projected estimated medical indemnity cost in respect of these groups for 1996 is £20.6 million.  The latest available information for the cost of public liability insurance incurred by health boards and voluntary hospitals is in respect of 1994 and this amounted to £4.18 million.</P>
      <P>In view of the increasing cost of medical indemnity insurance my Department has appointed Mercer Limited on a consultancy basis to evaluate the existing medical indemnity insurance arrangements and to make recommendations on possible alternative more cost effective ways of providing this cover.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is in ongoing discussions with the North Eastern Health Board and the owners of the hospital, the Medical Missionaries of Mary, with regard to the transfer of ownership of the hospital.  There are a number of legal requirements which remain to be finalised before the purchase can be completed.  However, the Department has agreed a timeframe with the order within which the sale should be completed.</P>
      <P>Following the transfer of ownership, it is the intention that existing overall staff levels will be maintained and all staff will continue to enjoy the same benefits and conditions of employment. In regard to the other issues raised by the Deputy, these matters remain to be resolved in the context of the overall negotiations concerning the transfer of ownership of the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The accident and emergency department of Beaumont Hospital provides a 24-hour service.</P>
      <P>Due to the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of more appropriate beds.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>All patients, whilst in the accident and emergency department, are under the care of medical and nursing staff. Every endeavour is made to make patients as comfortable as possible and this includes the provision of food to patients while they are awaiting a hospital bed.  The position regarding the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis.  In this regard, for the winter of 1995-96 measures amounting to £2.5 million have been adopted to alleviate problems experienced by the Dublin accident and emergency hospitals, including Beaumont Hospital. The measures adopted were as follows: a 25 bed elderly care unit opened in Peamount Hospital in December 1995; 40 additional nursing home places in private nursing homes were made available; three new community ward teams for the elderly were approved; a 25 bed unit for the chronically disabled in Cherry Orchard Hospital opened at the start of February 1996 and a 46 bed community unit for the elderly on the Navan Road opened in the middle of February 1996.</P>
      <P>In the six accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin a number of measures were taken including: the opening of extra beds; additional staff recruited; medical equipment grants were approved for A &amp; E departments and observation facilities were opened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> A public education campaign on the appropriate use of accident and emergency services was launched on 15 January 1996.  In the case of Beaumont Hospital, there have been a number of occasions when, owing to pressure in the accident and emergency department some patients have experienced delays in being admitted to a hospital bed.  A number of initiatives have been taken in order to improve bed management in the hospital.  These include a review of the Hospital's Discharge Policy; the opening of St. Paul's observation ward the introduction of a regular bed audi to ensure efficient bed turnover and tighter control of the admission and dis charge policies for the five-day wards so that these beds are protected for elective admissions as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and I will continue to monitor the situation with view to taking further action if required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  Emergency dental treatment to relieve pain is available to all adults with medical card entitlement.  Each <Col N="2118" /> health board has a panel of private dental practitioners who are under contract to provide emergency dental treatment services to medical card holders on behalf of the health board.  A medical card holder who is in pain can make arrangements with a dentist on the health board's panel of dentists to receive emergency treatment.</P>
    <P>2.  Routine treatment is being phased in for the identified priority groups. Treatment is provided through health board dental clinics and by private dental practitioners on the health board's dental panel.</P>
    <P>Since 1 June 1996, routine treatment is available to persons with medical card entitlement in the following age groups: 16-34 years of age (inclusive); 65 years and over.</P>
    <P>Persons requiring routine treatment make application to the health board.</P>
    <P>Routine treatment will be extended at a later stage to other age groups on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>3.  Full dentures are available for all edentulous medical card holders.  Persons requiring this treatment make application to the health board.  This treatment is mainly provided at health board dental clinics.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A claim was lodged by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations in 1993.  The claim sought parity of basic pay with their counterpart grades in the Dublin ambulance service where agreement had already been reached.  In February 1994 during the pay talks which formed part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discussions, agreement was reached to restore basic pay parity with Dublin, payment conditional on agreement to a <Col N="2119" /> range of productivity-efficiency measures, with referral for binding third party decision in the event of disagreement on any of the proposed measures.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have been taking place since then to try to reach agreement on a number of productivity-flexibility measures.  This has been a complex set of discussions in the context of the publication, in December 1993, of the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service.  The report heralded a new strategy for dealing with the major policy issues which had arisen in the ambulance service and which had not been addressed in a comprehensive way by the health services.</P>
      <P>A number of outstanding issues were referred to the Labour Relations Commission in January 1995.  Arising from these conferences a set of proposals were agreed and put to a ballot of the membership.  In July 1995, SIPTU advised that the proposals had been rejected.  Three meetings have been held in recent weeks to try to progress these talks to a satisfactory conclusion and a further meeting is scheduled for this week.</P>
      <P>It is my hope that this issue can be resolved at a very early date.  With the monetary aspects of this deal already agreed, the Department are anxious, at this stage, to finalise the details of the productivity and flexibility measures as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Child Care Act was passed in 1991.  Since then additional resources totalling £39.7 million have been invested in the child care area for the development of services. Sums of £1 million and £2 million were set aside for child care in the 1991 and 1992 budgets.  The full year costs of the various new developments approved in these years was £4.7 million.  Following the publication of the report of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation the Government agreed the investment of a further £35 million, on an annualised basis, in the child care area.  The 1996 allocation of £5 million marks the final instalment of that figure.  In addition £3.6 million has been made available this year for capital projects throughout the country.  I am currently preparing proposals for Government for the financing of a new child care programme for the period 1997 to 1999. These will be brought to Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>An annual Survey of Children in the Care of Health Boards is conducted by the Child Care Policy Unit of the Department of Health.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Entitlement to health services in Ireland is based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of medical card eligibility is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. <Col N="2122" /> Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable, without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  In addition these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards.  A review group on medical card entitlement established by the chief executive officers is at present examining the effectiveness and efficiency of the arrangements for granting and renewal of medical cards.  In particular the review group is considering the manner in which medical card eligibility is reviewed.  It is expected that the group will bring forward proposals shortly which will include revised arrangements for persons aged 66 and over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the Grand Canal Corridor Study, which I published in July 1994, is to identify a physical planning framework for the section of the waterway from Grand Canal Dock (Ringsend Basin) to Lucan Road Bridge that will bring together the existing environmental, commercial and social elements in a co-ordinated and integrated manner.  In order to provide the necessary impetus for the implementation of strategy and proposals, I quickly set up a task force under the chairmanship of Senator Pat Magner. Furthermore, I arranged for the appointment of a regeneration officer last year to encourage and co-ordinate the activities of public, private and community interests in regard to the physical and environmental regeneration of the corridor.</P>
      <P>The budgetary allocation in 1996 for the Grand Canal Corridor area is £620,000.  This includes provision for logistic support and advice for community employment schemes organised by the regeneration officer in the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot areas.  A community sponsored barge restoration scheme will also be undertaken this year in the Clondalkin area with the support of my Department.  Furthermore, the waterways service, in collaboration with private sector developers, will organise landscaping works on the canal banks later this year at the Parkwest Business Park, Ballyfermot.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2127" /> Closer to the city, a number of lock gates have been replaced on the system, and the Buckingham Sea Lock at Ringsend has been automated.  A hard land-scaping contract is currently in progress at Charlotte Quay, Grand Canal Dock, and additional moorings have been installed at Grand Canal Quay.  Jetties have been erected at Mespil road and Portobello, and 70 mooring bollards have been provided in the Dublin area. Extensive dredging and a clean-out of the system was undertaken earlier this year and the Dublin Port and Docks Board kindly dredged outside the Sea Locks at Ringsend.  The fish stocking programme is to continue this year and fishing stands will be installed at specific locations on the system.  The tree planting programme will also be continued during the next tree planting season.</P>
    <P>The proportion of the budget which will be spent in the Grand Canal Basin area in 1996 will be approximately 48 per cent, or £300,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 133, 134, 135 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the new system of registration of private rented dwellings, including the processing of individual applications, is the responsibility of local authorities in their areas.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, which came into effect on 1 May 1996, the landlord of a house which was already let on that date had up to 1 July 1996, to comply with the registration requirements. Landlords of houses let after 1 May had one month to register the letting.  Information on the number of landlords who have so far registered, and the number of units of accommodation registered, is not yet available in my Department. This information will be published in due course in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are made available in the Oireachtas Library.  Data is not available in my Department on the number of houses to which the regulations apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing the regulations, there <Col N="2130" /> were extensive consultations with the interests involved, including representatives of landlords, tenants and local authorities.  More recently, I met with the Union of Students of Ireland to discuss matters of concern to them in relation to the new regulations.</P>
    <P>A sample application form for use by local authorities in connection with the new registration system was issued by my Department.  This form provides for the furnishing of all information required under the regulations, including information which is not for publication in the register, and local authorities are aware of the need for cinfidentiality in this regard.  Authorities may design their own application forms but they have been asked to ensure that the form contains the essential features of the sample.</P>
    <P>The operation of the regulations will be kept under review by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 145 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The making of a special amenity area order is primarily a function of the local planning authority.  Section 42 (1) of the <Col N="2131" /> Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 gives a planning authority power, as a reserved function, to declare an area to be an area of special amenity when it appears to them that the area satisfies the criteria listed in the section.  While there are powers available to me to direct a planning authority to make such an order, I consider that this is a matter which should be decided at local level as the elected local representatives are best placed to make decisions of this nature.</P>

      <P>In 1995, roads, water and waste water services, and urban and rural regeneration, were the main programmes in respect of which expenditure by my Department attracted EU aid &mdash; normally at aid rates between 50 per cent and 85 per cent.  Virtually all co-financed expenditure under these programmes involved payments to local authorities, the National Roads Authority, Temple Bar Properties Ltd. and the Environmental Protection Agency but, in addition, the trustees of three group water supply schemes received EU co-financed grants in excess of £100,000.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of local <Col N="2139" /> sanitary authorities to initiate proposals for sewerage schemes in their own areas where a need is established.</P>
      <P>In general, the disposal of sewage effluent to inland or coastal waters is being dealt with by reference to the Urban Waste Water Treatment directive, which lays down minimum standards in relation to effluent discharged from waste water treatment works and requires that these standards are met by the year 2000, or 2005, as appropriate. Much of the work required to comply with this Directive is assisted by the European Commission by way of funding from the Cohesion Fund, the Interreg 2 Programme, or the Structural Funds.  Towns in Donegal which must comply with this Directive by the year 2005 are Ballybofey-Stranorlar, Donegal Town, Ballyshannon, Killybegs, Buncrana, Carndonagh and Movile-Greencastle. Schemes required to comply with the Directive are accorded the highest priority by my Department in determining the make up of the annual water and sewerage investment programme.</P>
      <P>This year, I initiated a new sub-programme to support the Government's Resort Initiative and to facilitate the development of key tourist areas. Under this sub-programme, the Bundoran sewerage scheme, Stage 2, has been approved for Exchequer funding.</P>

      <P>Annagry sewerage scheme, which commenced in 1989 and was completed in 1991, was the last major sewerage scheme commenced in County Donegal.  However, there is now a substantial investment programme under way for the provision of sewerage schemes in the county.  Schemes for Muff and Ballybofey-Stranorlar have been included in the programme for 1996 and are scheduled to commence later this year.  Funding has also been approved in 1996 for a scheme in Bundoran. A major scheme, for which Cohesion Fund support was received at the end of 1995, has also been approved for Letterkenny.  Support has been sought from the Cohesion Fund for a number of other sewerage schemes in the county, including Donegal town, and decision on these are awaited from the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2141" /> County Donegal has been a major beneficiary of the substantial investment in the water and sewerage programme over recent years, accounting for expenditure of almost £2 million from 1993 to 1995.  Further investment in major projects in the county, including the £27 million Pollan Dam water scheme, is ongoing.</P>

      <P>The assignment to the Environment Protection Agency of responsibility for licensing of activities subject to integrated pollution control, necessitated a redefinition of planning authorities' responsibilities in relation to such development.  This was done to avoid overlap and duplication of effort on enviornmental issues between the licensing system and development control under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.  The arrangements made ensure that the highest standards are applied in controlling potential pollution arising from relevant new and existing development. They also mean that a consistent approach to this matter is adopted throughout the State.</P>
      <P>In general, the parallel procedures appear to be working satisfactorily. However, as the arrangements are a relatively recent innovation, I intend to keep them under review in the light of experience of their operation.</P>

      <P>I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy is in fact St. Brigid's National School, Haddington Road.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of St. Brigid's national school on 30 September 1995 was 254 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and eight assistants for the 1996/97 school year.  Accordingly, the ninth assistant's post at the school will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the staffing position outlined above, the school in question has a concessionary post on account of its disadvantaged status.  A maximum class size guideline of 29 applies to schools designated as disadvantaged.  If the enrolment at the school in September, 1996 cannot be managed within this guideline, the board of management of the school should then contact my Department in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  The initiative is in response to reports which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations in <Col N="2154" /> the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the schools in question, inviting their application. The centre will prioritise all applications in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my department of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five-year development plans.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>All schools may currently conduct their correspondence with the Department through Irish or English.  This situation will not change with the establishment of the education boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper <i>Charting Our Education Future,</i> sets our clearly the framework for the establishment of the Education Boards.  The White Paper indicates that each board must: provide fully in the educational system for the diversity which exists in the community, including the community of all-Irish schools; provide for the systematic planning and co-ordination of the provision <Col N="2155" /> of education in its area; provide a range of support services to schools.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the education boards will be able to service adequately the needs of all-Irish schools.</P>

      <P>Aid from the European Social Fund is made available to my Department to assist in the provision of services across the first, second and third levels of education.  These services are provided through schools, vocational educational committees, regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities. The overall cost of the programmes is provided in the annual estimates for grants to these institutions.</P>
      <P>In 1995 my Department received £114,886,681 in aid from the European Social Fund.  A sum of £120,000 was also received in grants under the SOCRATES Programme.  In addition to EU payments made to my Department, education sector agencies and institutions also received funding directly for projects under SOCRATES, LEON-ARDO, Youth for Europe and Community Initiatives.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to make additional remedial teacher posts available to the schools referred to by the Deputy or to any primary schools.  It would not be appropriate for me to grant priority status to any individual application for such a post.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>I consider that substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>During the period 1994-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers.  I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupils teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>Under <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for a Partnership (PPG) Government 1993-97, it was agreed that the statutory apprenticeship scheme would be improved by developing a &ldquo;standard-based&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;time-served&rdquo; approach.  A new apprenticeship training model, comprising of four-on-the-job training modules and three off-the-job training modules, was developed.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental working group representative of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, FÁS, the regional technical colleges-DIT and the Department of Education agreed on the basic operational principles underlying the arrangements between FÁS and the colleges for the delivery of the off-the-job training of apprentices.</P>
      <P>In general the first off-the-job training module will take place in FÁS training centres and the second and final off-the-job training modules will take place in regional technical college-DIT institutions. The new apprenticeship system is being implemented on a phased basis and will result in the rationalisation of craft apprenticeship programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the new system is fully operational and the traditional day and block release courses are phased out, some colleges involved in the delivery of day release motor apprentice programmes will no longer be required to be providers of such programmes.  These colleges will be notified in due course. Meanwhile, no specific provision has <Col N="2169" /> been made for motor apprenticeship programmes in the schedule of accommodation for the replacement school building referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The enrolment policy for primary schools is generally a matter for the board of management of each school and parents are advised to contact the board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>My Department expects that schools will cater for their immediate area in the first instance.  If, after that, places remain available, schools may enrol pupils from outside their area should there be a demand.  Where more than one school caters for an area or parish, it is expected that such schools will liaise to ensure that all pupils can be accommodated.</P>
      <P>You will appreciate that, with over 3,200 primary schools in the State, it is not possible for my Department to liaise with each school annually to ascertain where a problem might arise in the future.  It is expected, however, that individual schools will alert my Department in good time where the question of the provision of additional accommodation arises or alternative arrangements need to be made to accommodate pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department does liaise with local authorities and school patrons, particularly in regard to large urban areas, where major housing developments may lead to the need to provide new schools or extensions to existing schools.</P>

      <P>The Finance Act, 1995 provides for tax relief on tuition fees paid by students who are attending private third level colleges which are outside the scope of the free fees initiative. Such students or their parents, as appropriate, can avail of the standard rate of tax relief on tution fees paid in respect of full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in such colleges, provided that both the college and the course satisfy codes of standards laid down by the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1996 provides for tax relief at the standard rate on tuition fees paid by part-time students, including evening students.  The relief will apply to part-time undergraduate <Col N="2178" /> courses of a minimum of two years duration in certain third level institutions. The tax relief will be available to those in work who are paying for their course of study from their own income.</P>
    <P>The tax relief takes effect in the 1996-97 tax year in respect of tution fees paid in the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
    <P>The institutions which will be recognised for the purpose of tax relief are:</P>
    <P>1.  an institution which provide courses to which a scheme approved by the Minister under the Local Authority (Higher Education) Grants Act, 1968 to 1992 applies,</P>
    <P>2.  a college approved by the Minister for the purpose of section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995.</P>

      <P>The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 1995 was 254 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and eight assistants for the 1996-97 school year. Accordingly, the ninth assistant's post at the school will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the staffing position outlined above, the school in question has a concessionary post on account of its disadvantaged status.  A maximum class size guideline of 29 applies to schools designated as disadvantaged.  If the enrolment at the school in September 1996 cannot be managed within this guideline, the board of management of the school should contact my Department in this regard.</P>

      <P>An additional £2 million annually was provided by my Department so that post leaving certificate course fees could be abolished with effect from 1995-96.  This additional funding covers tuition-equipment charges levied by schools, but does not provide for certification-registration charges of professional or certification bodies.</P>
      <P>Student maintenance grants are not paid.  To provide a scheme for PLC trainees along the lines of the third level scheme would cost in excess of £10 million per annum.  The House will appreciate that a balance has to be struck between competing demands for resources in the education sector &mdash; between funding for the different levels of the system, between initial and second chance education, between student supports, investment in quality assurance, and special measures to combat disadvantage and under achievement. In the case of PLC courses I consider it more important to concentrate on improving the quality of the system, through investment in national certification and assessment arrangements, in programme development, in in-service training, and in providing courses in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible.  My Department will provide over £39 million this year towards the running costs of such courses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245, 246, 250 and 251 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in early 1994, I accepted the recommendations of Dr. Bannon's report and decided not to proceed with the construction of a post-primary school for the Knocklyon area.</P>
      <P>In light of the Knocklyon post-primary committee's response to the original report and the assessment carried out by Mr. Hendrik van der Kamp at the request of the committee, I asked that the position regarding the need for a school be re-examined by Dr. Bannon.</P>
      <P>This examination, which was completed in January last, concluded that no new information emerged in either the committee's response to the original report, or in the assessment carried out by Mr. van der Kamp, which would justify a change in the decision.  Dr. Bannon was satisfied that the latest information available was used to arrive at the conclusions and recommendations in his 1994 report and in his more recent review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I undertook in my reply to a question from the Deputy on 29 November last, a meeting, to explain the outcome of the review, can be arranged with officials from my Department.  In that connection, I pointed out to the Deputy in the House on 20 June last that there is no record of a request dated 4 February, 1996 from the post-primary committee for such a meeting.  I have since received a copy of the committee's letter and I am issuing a response, indicating that officials will be contacted with the group to make appropriate arrangements. However, I must stress to the Deputy that, in view of the extensive analysis of need carried out by Dr. Bannon as recently as last January, I would <Col N="2194" /> see the purpose of such a meeting as explanatory.</P>
    <P>A large number of campaign-type letters were received in June, 1995 from parents and students regarding the provision of a post-primary school in Knocklyon.  Subsequently, I asked Dr. Bannon to review the position and on 30 January last, as soon as he reported back, I advised all the Dáil Deputies in the constituency, including Deputy Brennan, of the position.  I am satisfied that, in this way, all concerned with the matter were kept fully informed.</P>

Consideration of possible breaches of the conditions of release is a matter for my Department in consultation with the Garda Síochána and the law officers. One such possibility is being considered at present.</P>
      <P>Two of the 36 prisoners in question were, on their release, re-arrested on foot of extradition warrants and subsequently granted bail pending the hearing of their appeals against extradition orders made in the District Court.  One of those persons has not adhered to a condition of bail and appropriate follow-up action is being taken by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice to indicate whether the whereabouts of any person is known or whether a person from any group of persons is a suspect in a Garda investigation or a member of any subversive group.</P>

      <P>Fifty-two of the 57 suicide prevention recommendations made by the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths have been or are currently in the course of being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining five recommendations include the provision of a committal assessment centre, a new female prison designed to meet the specific needs of women prisoners, with a level of services appropriate to them and the establishment of a unit to cater for psychiatrically disturbed violent prisoners. These recommendations are more longterm in nature, a fact which was acknowledged by the advisory group and will be implemented in the context of the overall development of the prison system.  The other two recommendations involve the establishment of a <Col N="2206" /> formalised information sharing system between the Garda, the Courts and the Prison Service on persons who are considered to be a suicide risk.  Such an informal system has existed for many years with the active co-operation of all concerned and has worked well to date.</P>
    <P>The last recommendation concerns the setting up of liaison meetings at each institution to discuss the cases of offenders who are considered as presenting management problems for psychiatric, psychological or discipline reasons.  Such an informal system is in existence for years whereby the more complex cases are discussed at monthly review meetings and case conferences involving representatives from outside agencies where necessary.  Officials from my Department are also in regular contact with governors from each institution in relation to such cases.  In the circumstances, I am not sure of the necessity of re-introducing liaison meetings for this specific purpose but I am prepared to give the matter further consideration.</P>
    <P>I have also recently established a national steering group, overseeing the local suicide awareness groups in the institutions, under the chairmanship of a senior prison governor.  The committee includes in its membership some of the most experienced representatives of prison management and staff and medical practitioners who are very involved in prison work.  The group met for the first time last week and will be reviewing and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths published in 1991.  The group will also provide a forum for collating the reports of the local suicide awareness groups within the institutions and disseminating significant findings or lessons learned through the prison system.  Trends in prison suicide in other countries and their prevention will also be monitored.</P>

Associated works in relation to the kitchen, including the provision of four modern food serveries, to meet current requirements in regard to food handling and distribution are continuing.

The unit will commence operations this week.  It will be staffed by personnel specially recruited for this project with experience in the field, including a general medical practitioner and qualified nurses.  In addition, prison staff who have accumulated valuable <Col N="2213" /> experience in the field over many years, will of course, make a major contribution to the operation of this treatment facility.</P>

      <P>Other services to be supplied within the treatment facility include, in respect of selected cases, and subject to strict criteria, such as sentence length, the provision of methadone maintenance. The most important aspect will, however, be the delivery of an integrated, structured, therapy programme specially designed in order to ensure the long-term recovery of drug addicted prisoners.</P>

      <P>In 1994, the cost of criminal legal aid was £7,043,000 and in 1995 it was £7,988,000. The statistical information sought by the Deputy regarding the number of cases in 1994 and 1995 in which legal aid was granted is not readily available.  The criminal legal aid system is geared towards the payment of solicitors and barristers on foot of claims and there may be a number of claims arising in an individual case.  The information requested in relation to cases could only be compiled by the allocation of a disproportionate amount of staff time which could not be justified.

      <P>The issue raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in this report regarding the administration of means tests is a matter of concern, both from the point of view of the inconvenience to claimants and of efficiency.  This has been an issue for successive Ministers for Social Welfare but only a limited amount of progress has been made in simplifying the present arrangements.</P>
      <P>Means testing criteria are broadly similar for all social assistance schemes. Nevertheless, there are variations in the manner in which some of the components are assessed.  These relate mainly to the treatment of capital and income from employment where different levels of disregards and rates of assessment are applied across the various schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The integrated social service system committee was set up to devise a more integrated approach to the administration, delivery, management and control of statutory services generally. The committee examined the issues associated with means assessments, including the number of means tests a person has to undergo to get various entitlements, the reasons why different assessments are applied across different schemes and the possibility of different <Col N="2234" /> agencies sharing data for means purposes. The committee has completed its work and its report has been approved by the Government.  This report will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>I intend, over time, to standardise the method of assessing capital across the various social assistance schemes so as to improve the equality of the system.  I have commenced this process in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, which provides for a new method of assessing capital in the case of the new disability allowance and the new one-parent family payment.  The Act provides that the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000 will be assessed at 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>In 1995, £11.6 million, representing 10,820 cases, was recorded as being attributable to fraud or suspected fraud.  This compares with gross expenditure of £4.2 billion.</P>
      <P>With regard to PRSI the Department makes a determined effort to detect employers who fail to honour their obligations under the PRSI system.  This effort is undertaken to ensure that all employers comply with their PRSI obligations and to prevent people in employment from fraudulently claiming social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A programme of employer inspections is carried out each year with some 8,000 employers visited in 1995.  A total of £16 million in unpaid PAYE/PRSI was detected in 1995 as a result of these inspections.  The programme of inspections includes a number of revisits to employers to ensure that they continue <Col N="2235" /> to comply with their legal obligations. All indicators show that there is now an increased level of employer awareness of, and compliance with, PRSI legislation.</P>

      <P>The position regarding funding of the resource centre in question is as follows.  The centre has been funded under the Community Development Programme.  However, certain difficulties have arisen in the running of the project as a result of which the Department is no longer in a position to continue funding it under the programme.</P>
      <P>There are some 80 projects at present in the programme or in the course of being set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably, some of the projects will experience difficulties.  The Department's approach in all such cases is to work constructively with all concerned <Col N="2238" /> to try to resolve the problem and reestablish the project concerned on a sound footing and this has been done in this case.  Unfortunately all such efforts over a period of years have failed.</P>
    <P>The Department has emphasised however, that the door is still open to the project in question if agreement can be reached on implementation of the compromise solution put forward in a letter of 11 June to the current management committee.  Withdrawal of funding to a Community Development Programme project is very much a last resort undertaken with reluctance when all other reasonable steps have failed over a long period of time.</P>

      <P>This year's Social Welfare Act provided for the introduction of Class A PRSI for new Community Employment (CE) workers with effect from 6 April 1996.  As an exceptional measure, existing CE workers on 6 April last were given until 30 April 1996 to opt for Class A if they so wished; otherwise, they continued to be insured at Class J PRSI.</P>
      <P>The introduction of Class A PRSI does not affect entitlement to the usual social welfare secondary benefits (such as Christmas bonus, fuel allowance and butter vouchers) while the CE workers involved are participating on CE as they retain entitlement to any secondary benefits they received immediately prior to going on to CE (subject to an income limit of £250 per week and to a ceiling of £250 per month on rent/mortgage supplement).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course, CE workers who have paid Class A PRSI and who subsequently return to the live register when their CE finishes, would have <Col N="2239" /> their entitlement to secondary benefits determined by reference to whether or not they qualify for unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or long-term unemployment assistance. The social welfare secondary benefits mentioned above are payable only to those getting long-term unemployment assistance.  I am having the special position of CE workers examined by my Department to identify ways in which existing entitlements may be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>As regards other income-related secondary benefits such as rent or mortgage supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former CE workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The small business expansion loan scheme announced in the 1994 budget made a £100 million loan fund available to small businesses in the manufacturing, tourism and international traded sectors, £25 million of which was allocated specifically for projects in the tourism sector.</P>
      <P>The scheme, which was administered by ICC Bank plc, provided low fixed interest (6.75 per cent p.a.), long-term loans (up to 10 years), of between £40,000 and £500,000 to eligible businesses employing less than 50 persons. Eligible tourism projects included Bord Fáilte registered accommodation and Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development approved tourism products and services. New projects and significant extensions-improvements to existing projects were eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> The success of this scheme is evident from the fact that the £25 million allocated for tourism projects was fully approved at end September, 1994.  All of the funds were drawn down at the end of April 1996.  A total of 120 tourism projects (borrowers) were assisted and over 2,000 associated jobs maintained or planned.</P>
    <P>Following from the success of this scheme, the Government introduced a new subsidised loan scheme, the access to finance scheme, on 12 September, 1995.  This fund is being administered by the AIB, Bank of Ireland, National Irish Bank and Ulster Bank.  A minimum of £52 million (25 per cent of the fund) is reserved for the tourism sector.  The loans are for a fixed term of seven years at a fixed interest rate of 6.5 per cent. This fund provides a minimum loan size of £20,000 while the maximum loan size is £500,000.  Projects are eligible on a similar basis to the small business expansion loan scheme.  Again, I understand that virtually all the funds available under the scheme have been approved at this stage.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the Casual Trading Act, 1995 is to achieve greater decentralisation, efficiency and flexibility in the regulation of casual trading by the local authorities than was possible under the less flexible regime provided by the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  The principle reforms contained in the 1995 Act are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  to devolve the licensing function from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to the local authorities and <Col N="2243" /> to provide for social welfare requirements with respect to the issue of casual trading licences;</P>
    <P>(2)  to provide for the use of by-laws by the local authorities as the method of regulating and controlling casual trading, thus facilitating greater flexibility and efficiency in regulating casual trading;</P>
    <P>(3)  to limit the list of casual trading activities excluded from the scope of regulation under the 1980 Act to (i) selling by a licensed auctioneer; (ii) door-to-door selling and (iii) charity sales.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph (3) above, the 1995 Act removed the exemption in the 1980 Act relating the selling of agricultural and horticultural produce by the producer, thereby making this type of selling subject to regulation.  As indicated above the primary purpose of the 1995 Act is to achieve greater decentralisation and in this connection section 2(4) of the Act empowers local authorities to exempt categories of trading previously exempted under the Casual Trading Act, 1980, or to exempt any new categories of trading that they may decide are appropriate for their own areas.</P>

      <P>The importance of telemarketing to Ireland was first recognised in 1992 when a target to create 2,000 jobs in this sector, between 1993 and 1997, was set.</P>
      <P>When I last answered a similar question on 21 November 1995, 20 telemarketing projects had been established employing over 1,300 people.  Now, there are more than 30 telemarketing operations in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Dundalk and Wicklow employing over 2,000 people.</P>
      <P>The initial target of 2,000 jobs has now been exceeded.  Indeed, I am anxious to ensure that Ireland continues to maximise the job potential from telemarketing and that the operations are spread as widely as possible throughout the country.  To date, one project has located in the Border countries.  This is the National Pen project in Dundalk which currently employs 11 people.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that many more telemarking projects will come on stream and that the regional spread of such projects can be maintained.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland which is responsible for the development and promulgation of Irish standards for products manufactured in this country or placed on the Irish market, that they have received no requests for the introduction of a mandatory standard in relation to ready-mix concrete and concrete products.  I have no plans at present to introduce such a standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there are a number of voluntary standards in existence for <Col N="2245" /> concrete and its constituent materials. In addition voluntary standards for precast concrete products have also been devised.</P>

      <P>Following consultation with the Department of the Environment on this matter, I would like to respond as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy document Recycling for Ireland (1994) sets out the general approach being adopted by the Government to promote recycling to end 1999. The comparative costs of different waste management options have been analysed in the paper <i>The Economics of Solid Waste Management in Ireland</i> (November 1995) which was commissioned by the Department of the Environment from the ESRI Environment Policy Centre.  Both documents are available in the Oireachtas Library and questions on them should be addressed to the Minister for the Environment. There has been, I understand, a significant reduction in the demand and price for waste paper.  This fall in both price and demand has affected the waste paper collection business.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, intends to consult with other EU member states and the European Commission regarding possible international action to improve the situation. I have no function in relation to this matter and questions on this should <Col N="2246" /> be addressed to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Guidelines are being finalised by the Department of the Environment for environmental management by Government Departments.  That could affect demand for such paper.  A study commissioned by that Department and National Newspapers of Ireland is also being completed by Teagasc on the use of shredded newspaper as bedding for dairy cows.  The Irish Business and Employments' Confederation has recently established a company, REPAK Ltd, to co-ordinate and finance the recycling of packaging waste, including paper packaging.  REPAK will be run and financed by industry as a voluntary, industry-led initiative.  These and other appropriate national measures to support waste recycling will be pursued by the Minister for the Environment in the context of the further implementation of the national strategy on recycling and of the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>As the above are matters for which the Minister for the Environment is responsible questions on them should be addressed to him.  As far as my Department is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that Forbairt provides financial assistance to developments which are based on the use of waste as a raw material and which are used to produce products in a traded sector.  Projects must satisfy normal commercial criteria and they are considered on their merit by Forbairt on a case by case basis.  Forbairt also provides assistance under the feasibility study grants programme to assist companies to investigate market opportunities for recycled products. Very basic processes such as collection, sorting, shredding and baling or incineration of waste materials are not and do not need to be supported by grants under Forbairt's scheme of aid. However, recycling enterprises would be eligible for assistance from the county enterprise boards, provided they satisfy the commercial, investment and employment criteria applied by the county enterprise boards.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware officials from my Department met members of the Irish Airline Pilots' Association to discuss the employment difficulties being encountered by qualified Irish pilots in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It appears that although Irish pilots may well be qualified the difficulty is that they need further training to become &ldquo;type rated&rdquo; for each type of aircraft.  This extra training is very expensive and is generally supplied by the air line company concerned.  At peak season and in unforeseen circumstances the air line companies need to look abroad, sometimes outside and European Economic Area (the EEA comprises the EU, Norway and Iceland), to find suitably type rated pilots.</P>
      <P>Following on that meeting my Department took the matter up with the air line companies concerned explaining our concerns and that future decisions regarding work permits in this area would take into account the training programmes in place in each company. Each of them have written to explain their training programmes which they hope obviate the need to recruit abroad and this information has been passed on to the Irish Airline Pilots' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has liaised closely with the Irish Airline Pilots' Association for a number of years and is very conscious of the current position.  The situation will continue to be closely monitored so as to ensure that where vacancies do arise they are as far as possible filled by Irish or EEA nationals.  However it has to be accepted <Col N="2248" /> that there will always be exceptional and unforeseen circumstances which require short-term remedies and that there are cases where it may be necessary to employ non-EEA staff to train or pass on their experience to Irish or EEA nationals in order to create or boost employment here.</P>

      <P>All European Social Fund transfers to Ireland come through my Department.  In 1995, a total of £256 million in such funds was received.  Of that, £37 million was transferred directly to other Departments for a range of programmes and initiatives involving ESF Funds.  The remaining amount &mdash; some £219 million &mdash; related to programmes for which my Department has an overall administrative responsibility to the ESF.

    <P>The implementation of these operational programmes which require the vast majority of these funds is, however, done by other Departments and agencies. For example, under the Human Resources Development Operational Programme, £106.8 million was transferred to the Department of Education, £25 million to FÁS, £19.8 million to <Col N="2250" /> NRB and £0.1 million to Department of Justice.  Similarly, of the ESF support received for the Industry Operational Programme, £6.2 million was transferred to IDA Ireland, £4.4 million to Forbairt and £3.4 million of the remainder between Údarás na Gaeltachta, SFADCo, the Crafts Council and the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programmes and Initiatives listed above also receive funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Operational Programme and from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF).  Such funding is provided through the Departments of Finance and Agriculture respectively.</P>
    <P>In view of the large number of subprogrammes and measures under the Human Resources and Industry Operational Programmes, the large scale of the European Community funding and having regard to the implementation role residing with other Departments and agencies the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for my Department, without a costly major administrative exercise, to provide a full list of all approvals or payments to individual final beneficiaries in 1995 of £100,000 or more.</P>
    <P>My Department is itself responsible for the implementation of the EMPLOYMENT ADAPT Innovatory Actions and RETEX Initiatives.  None of the 1995 EMPLOYMENT, or ADAPT or RETEX approvals or payments involved sums of £100,000 or more.  Under Innovatory Actions, however, six projects were approved for ESF assistance, all of them at support levels of over £100,000 as follows:</P>

      <P>Membership of the county enterprise boards is drawn from panels of elected members of local authorities and from representatives of the social partners, State agencies and local business and community interests in accordance with the memorandum and articles of association of each board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1993, my predecessor drew the attention of every city and county manager, who had been given the task of nominating the initial members to the boards to the Government's objective of achieving a minimum of 40 per cent of men and women among the initial nominees to the boards.  As the initial nomination procedure failed to secure a satisfactory gender balance in board <Col N="2261" /> membership at that time, my predecessor took positive remedial action to counteract the scarcity of women nominated to the boards by increasing the number of members on the boards from 12 to 14.  The wider canvass undertaken to encourage women with business experience to participate in the work of the boards has helped, in my view, to tap the significant potential of local employment initiatives for women.  As the Deputy will be aware, under the operating agreement signed between my Department and each county enterprise board, each board is required to ensure that its activities comply with and, where appropriate, help to promote Government and European Union policy objectives and legislation on equal opportunities for men and women.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for appointment of members of the boards rest with each board in accordance with its memorandum and articles of association.  While the CEBs are expected to take note of Government policy on gender balancing, the selective application of the gender balance requirement to nominations from a particular nominating body is not consistent with Government policy in relation to the representational character of the CEBs nor is there any requirement that a nominating body which previously nominated a woman should automatically nominate another woman.</P>

      <P>Community employment is designed primarily to provide temporary work experience, normally of one year's duration together with some training that would enhance the prospects of long-term <Col N="2262" /> unemployed people in obtaining a mainstream job.</P>
      <P>The programme consists of the following distinct options:</P>
      <P>Part-time Integration Option: Which is aimed at long-term unemployed people with reasonable prospects of employment and whose prospects of obtaining mainstream employment would be enhanced by participation on the programme.  Not more than 10 per cent of participants can be retained for further periods beyond the initial year by sponsors under this option.</P>
      <P>Part-time Job Option: which is aimed at long-term unemployed people with poor employment prospects. Participants on the part-time job option, have an annual contract of engagement for 12 months, and subject to availability of place can have their contract renewed for up to three years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the intellectual property unit of my Department has recently undertaken a comprehensive review of Irish copyright law, taking into account, inter alia, changes in technology, international legal developments, the need to counteract piracy and changes in EU law and that the Department is currently in the process of preparing draft heads of legislation to give effect to necessary changes identified by the review.  The review involved examining the Copyright Acts, 1963 &mdash; 1987 and the Performers Protection Act, 1968, which are the current legislative instruments giving effect to protection for <Col N="2263" /> Irish composers, Irish performers and Irish record companies, and was undertaken with the aid and assistance of the composers, performers and record companies representative organisations.</P>
      <P>Changes required on foot of the most recent GATT agreements will be incorporated in the text of the new Copyright Bill which is currently being prepared by my Department.  These involve signing up to the Paris Act of the Berne Convention, amongst other things, and I can assure the Deputy that I will bring forward this comprehensive, consolidating Bill as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The only new procedure required by FÁS prior to authorising the renewal of a Community Employment (CE) project is that sponsors are now required to produce a current tax clearance certificate.  I consider it appropriate that groups receiving grant aid from public funds should produce evidence that their tax affairs are in order and do not believe that this requirement will discourage voluntary/ community groups from sponsoring projects. For the information of the House, existing operating agreements FÁS have with sponsors already require them to register their affairs with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Present statistics indicate that (a) the total forage area declared by farmers applying for cattle headage and beef cow grants in the more severely handicapped areas in 1995 was 2,161,556 hectares; (b) the total forage area declared by farmers applying for beef cow headage in the less severely handicapped areas in 1995 was 487,795 hectares and (c) 15,978 cattle headage and beef cow applicants, 343 sheep headage applicants and 459 equine headage applicants had their headage payment claims reduced in 1995 due to insufficient forage area.</P>
      <P>It has been a feature of the disadvantaged area schemes since their inception that considerable numbers of applicants have had payments restricted due to the application of forage area limits.</P>

      <P>The number of farmers who have completed their first year in REPS on 31 May 1996 is 3,220. Following the implementation of more stringent control measures and the revision to the REPS specifications, arrangements were in train to deal with the backlog in three tranches viz:</P>
      <P>&mdash;14 May &mdash; 1994 applicants &mdash; 309</P>
      <P>&mdash;31 May &mdash; applicants due second year payments up to 31 March 1996 &mdash; 1,450 and</P>
      <P>&mdash;28 June &mdash; all remaining applicants due second year payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lists of those participants who joined the scheme in 1994 were issued to the Department's local offices on 14 May 1996 in order to facilitate farmer compliance checks.  A total of 309 participants were involved of which up to now only 190 have had compliance checks completed due to industrial action in the Department's local offices.  As a result, to date only 145 participants have been approved for second year payments, and only two had been paid by 31 May. Talks are taking place between the Department and the union involved in the industrial action.  Significant progress has been made in these talks and <Col N="2268" /> it is hoped that the dispute will be resolved shortly allowing compliance checks for the 1,450 participants who were due second year payments up to the 31 March 1996.  It is intended to commence checks on other participants who are now due second year payments by the end of the month.</P>
    <P>Information concerning the number of farmers who have completed their first year but for whom the Department is awaiting forms reps 1D or 1E is not readily available.</P>

      <P>In addition, a further £13.3 million is available for compensation to be paid Irish beef producers whose income difficulties are not fully addressed by the general increases in the special beef and suckler cow premiums.  I intend to use these funds to top-up the deseasonalisation premium in respect of steers slaughtered between 20 March and 8 June and to provide assistance to other categories of producers most severely hit by the crisis.  My Department will be finalising the details of these arrangements following discussions with farming organisations over the next few weeks.</P>

    <P>These claims are the only cases which have been referred to the Taxing Master for examination.  None of these cases have to date been finalised by the Taxing Master but an amount of £754,760.40 was made, on foot of an Interim Certificate of Taxation to Michael D. White &amp; Co., Solicitors who represented Deputy Pat Rabbitte and former Deputy Tomás MacGiolla. These are the only public representatives who have submitted claims for their costs.  This information should have been included in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 303 of 25 June 1996.</P>
    <P>The details of these payments are the subject of the public hearings by the Taxing Master.  The Minister for Finance is represented at these hearings and as has been indicated in previous <Col N="2280" /> replies a vigorous opposition has been put forward to the Taxing Master on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  It is the normal practice in proceedings involving taxation of costs that details of the bill of costs giving detailed breakdowns of fees for counsel, solicitors and expenses along the lines mentioned in the Deputy's questions are not made public until the full taxation proceedings, including any appeals to the High Court or the Supreme Court are completed. Details of payments made to date.</P>
    <P>Following details of payments made by my Department were given in reply to Question No. 257 of 12 March 1996:</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the afforestation scheme that land being planted must be of a sufficiently high yield class to produce a crop of wood that is commercially viable.  The site in question was found on inspection to be unsuitable to produce such a crop.  The adjoining land referred to by the Deputy is located over a mile away from the site in question.  It is the case that within the same general area, soil and site conditions can vary appreciably such that one area may be considered eligible for grant while another is not.</P>

      <P>To date over 16,500 farmers have been approved for first year payments amounting to £58 million under the scheme and a further 1,500 applications, approximately, are being processed at present in the Department's local offices.</P>
      <P>The number of farmers who had completed their first year in REPS on 31 May 1996 is 3,220.  Following the implementation of more stringent control measures and the revision to the REPS specifications, arrangements were in train to deal with the backlog in three tranches viz:</P>
      <P>&mdash;14 May &mdash; 1994 applicants (309)</P>
      <P>&mdash;31 May &mdash; applicants due second year payments up to 31 March 1996 (1,450), and</P>
      <P>&mdash;28 June &mdash; all remaining applicants due second year payments.</P>
      <P>Lists of those participants who joined the scheme in 1994 were issued to the Department's local offices on 14 May 1996 to facilitate farmer compliance checks.  A total of 309 participants were involved of which up to now only 190 have had payments amounting to £517,000, and only two had been paid by 31 May.  Talks are taking place between the Department and the union involved in the industrial action.  Significant progress has been made in these talks and it is hoped that the dispute will be resolved shortly allowing compliance checks for the 1,450 participants who were due second year payments up to 1 April 1996.  It is intended to commence checks on other participants who are now due second year payments by the end of the month.</P>

      <P>The Cattle Breeding Authority referred to by the Deputy has not yet been established.  The proposal for the establishment of such a body came first from an industry committee of organisations involved in cattle breed improvement activities. This proposal formed the basis for a feasibility study which was completed in October 1995.  The results of that study are currently being examined by an Interim Planning Board (IPB) which was formed out of the original industry committee.  The work of the IPB is <Col N="2287" /> expected to be concluded by the end of July.  It is only at that stage that it will be known whether or not a Cattle Breeding Authority is to be formed.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of a parliamentary question on this subject having been replied to in December 1995.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications last February regarding the price of gas to tomato growers.  In reply I was advised that the Minister of State at the Department had been informed by Bord Gáis Éireann that the company had entered into supply agreements during 1989-90 with a number of growers under the general auspices of the Irish Commercial Horticulture Association.  On expiry of the bulk of these agreements in 1993, new prices were negotiated with a team nominated by the association.  At the end of 1995 BGE again negotiated new agreements, on this occasion with IFA representing growers.  BGE has stated that its policy has always been to negotiate prices which are competitive with alternative fuels and they are satisfied that, on balance, growers have been favourably treated over the past few years when compared with industrialcommercial customers in general.</P>

    <P>A number of townlands in Cannaway <Col N="2289" /> were designated as disadvantaged, having satisfied all the criteria.  However, it was not possible to include Cooldrum in this group as to do so would have caused the group as a whole to exceed one or more of the criteria.</P>

Nothwithstanding this policy position, I will be obliged to consider CIÉ's application for a light rail order on an objective quasi-judicial basis and to consider any submissions made to me.</P>
      <P>During the public consultation process, a number of issues have emerged which the CIÉ project team decided merited further consideration.  In its review of these issues, the project team is considering a range of possible alternatives to the original preferred technical route alignment.  This may include the possibility of using very short underground sections to overcome particular local difficulties for example to underpass a very congested road junction or to resolve an especially intractable problem in a specific residential or commercial area.  The project team will publish the results of its review and invite further public comment before deciding what option to include in its formal application for a light railway order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the public consultation process some people have argued that the light rail system should be underground in the city centre.  While this is not in line with the Government's stated policy <Col N="2292" /> position, it is an issue which has been raised consistently during the consultation process and in Oireachtas debates.  It therefore merits clarification. In the light of this and as part of its preparatory work for the inquiry, independent transportation consultants engaged by the CIÉ project team are carrying out an assessment of the implications of this alternative.  I will instruct CIÉ to publish the findings of this work in due course.  Those people who favour an underground alternative will be able to review the published findings and offer their views to the inquiry, which will be an independent and open forum.</P>
    <P>In October 1994 the previous Government took a provisional decision to give priority to the construction of the Tallaght-Dundrum line.  As a result of that decision the CIÉ project team concentrated on the preparatory planning work for the Tallaght-Dundrum line.  Following the decision to conduct a comparative socio-economic evaluation of the Tallaght-Dundrum and Tallaght-Ballymun options, the CIÉ project team augmented its existing preparatory work by carrying out some additional studies directly related to the terms of reference of the evaluation.  All of this was passed over to the independent consultants on their appointment.  In addition the project team is carrying out a review of possible route alignments for the Ballymun line and will carry out some further preliminary planning work over the coming months.  However, because the Tallaght-Dundrum line, in keeping with the previous Government's decision, has been subject to much more detailed planning to date than Ballymun, it is already clear that if a decision were taken to opt for the Tallaght-Ballymun line it would significantly delay the overall implementation of the initial two line phase of the light rail network.  However, I again stress that the Government remains committed to the implementation of the core light rail network to Ballymun, Cabinteely and Tallaght.</P>

      <P>The main issues of concern to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are outlined in its annual reports, presented to me in accordance with the requirements of the Radiation Protection Act, 1991, and as part of its statutory advisory functions on radiological protection and nuclear safety set out in that Act.</P>
      <P>The major issues highlighted in the recent past relate to: (1) the risks to the Irish population associated with Sellafield and other aspects of the British nuclear industry; (2) the need to reduce the hazard to public health from exposure to radon gas; (3) the desirability of having a national facility for the long-term storage of low-level radioactive waste generated by medical and industrial use; and (4) certain anomalies in health legislation relating to the use of x-ray apparatus by chiropractors.</P>

      <P>Gas leakages from the old gas network, taken over by BGE in 1987, have been reduced to a level comparable to the best managed gas systems in any European city.</P>
      <P>These leakage reductions have been brought about through implementation of a costly mains replacement programme which will continue for many years to come.</P>
      <P>Other measures such as reduced operating pressure and improved pipe joint repairs have also contributed to the significant reductions in leakage.</P>
      <P>The small volumes of natural gas leakage in conjunction with the wide area over which the old network was constructed, are such that the leakage has insignificant effect on air quality.</P>
      <P>On the other hand the expansion of the natural gas grid and the increased use of natural gas for heating has resulted in significant improvements in air quality through the substantial reductions in carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Natural gas (methane) is a naturally occurring substance e.g. marsh gas.  It is non-toxic and being lighter than air is dispersed quickly into the earth's atmosphere.</P>

      <P>Detailed planning and preparatory work in respect of the proposed light rail network, including a programme of public consultation, is being progressed by CIÉ.  The Transport (Dublin Light Rail) (No. 2) Bill, 1996, has passed all stages in Dáil Éireann and will be considered by Seanad Éireann this week.</P>
      <P>As one would expect given the scale of the light rail project, many concerns and issues have been raised during public consultation and in the debates in this House.  They range from fundamental issues such as the need for light rail to questions on the details of the routes to be constructed.</P>
      <P>My Department, in consultation with the European Commission, has appointed consultants to carry out a comparative socio-economic evaluation of the Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum light rail lines in accordance with EU requirements for major infrastructure projects costing over 25 MECU (approximately £20 million). The consultants are expected to report during August 1996.</P>

      <P>The private bog development grant scheme was introduced in 1981 in order to stimulate the development of private peat resources.  The scheme provided grants towards access roads, drainage and machinery for bog development. Under the scheme, applicants submitted development plans to Bord na Móna who administered the scheme on behalf of the Department.</P>
      <P>The scheme was terminated in October 1987, having been deemed to have achieved its purpose.  It had not been possible to terminate financial outlay until 1995 as there remained work approved which had not been completed.</P>

      <P>As part of the requirement to ensure an efficient and effective Presidency of the EU a tender competition was held by the Department of Defence in accordance with EU competition regulations for the provision of an air taxi service capable of carrying up to eight people to all major cities within the European Union.  The competition was advertised in the European Journal in February 1996 with a closing date for the receipt <Col N="2306" /> of tenders of 11 April 1996.  In accordance with EU requirements, the award criteria were set out as being the most economically advantageous offer in terms of price, quality of service offered and ability to meet the specification. Eighteen sets of tender documents were issued to interested parties and seven tenders were received.  The tenders were fully evaluated on financial and technical grounds by the Department of Defence.  This evaluation involved consultation with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Corps.  Following the evaluation, the contract was awarded on the basis of the award criteria to which I have already referred.</P>
      <P>It was not a condition of the tender specification that the provider of the service should be the owner or operator of the aircraft used, hence the need for that company to hold a licence does not arise.  I can assure the House that the operators and aircraft being used are licensed to carry passengers.</P>

      <P>The objectives of the fisheries measure of the INTERREG II programme are to encourage cross-Border co-operation in the fisheries sector and to assist in the development, conservation and protection of fisheries.</P>
      <P>Funding totalling IR£2.5 million will be available under the two fisheries measures over the term of the programme. The EU aid rate will be up to a maximum of 75 per cent.  The actual aid rate will vary depending on the recipient body and the nature of the project.</P>
      <P>No projects have been approved to date under the fisheries measures.  A number of projects are undergoing assessment and evaluation and an announcement will be made shortly in relation to a major project in the Border region.</P>
      <P>While funds are not specifically earmarked for the regional fisheries boards under the programme it is expected that a substantial proportion of the available funding will be taken up by the relevant boards under their various fisheries development programme in Border regions.</P>
