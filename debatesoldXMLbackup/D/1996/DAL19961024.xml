      <P>It is proposed to take No. 10, statements on the beef industry (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, 30 October 1996 and that the sitting shall not be suspended from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. on that day.</P>

      <P>Last Thursday I asked the Taoiseach two questions the first of which was whether he would lay the documents relating to the Russian Protocol before the House and the second was whether he was consulted before the agreement was signed in Dublin Airport.  The Taoiseach avoided both questions.  If he had not done so, I would have known, as he did, that the Protocol was not signed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.  Is it acceptable to the Taoiseach and the Government that for a period of at least seven days the Minister misled the public by creating the false impression that a gun was put to his head in negotiating the contract, that he was there until the final stages and got the dust off the Russian veterinary officer's boot in the face? Will the Minister make a personal statement and apologise to the people today in the House?</P>

      <P>On 30 November 1994 the Taoiseach said in the Dáil that &ldquo;without truth there is no foundation for good Government&rdquo;. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, said yesterday in the House: &ldquo;I never said that I was in Dublin Airport on Saturday morning&rdquo;.  The Minister misled the Dáil. He said, both last Saturday evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misled the House yesterday.  This is a serious matter and I invite the Taoiseach to respond.  He responds when it suits him.  The Taoiseach who promised openness, accountability, transparency and that he would run his Government through a pane of glass refuses to even comment.  His Minister misled the Dáil yesterday.  Does he not accept that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter raised by the Leader of the main Opposition party, is it in order to ask the Taoiseach if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will make a personal statement?  The Chair indicated that may be the case but the Taoiseach did not choose to answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The Chair has ruled generally on this and other related matters.  I have indicated to the House how it should proceed.  If, on the other hand, the Taoiseach wishes to intervene at any stage he may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will make a full statement today on all matters affecting the beef industry. Furthermore, he will answer questions from the <Col N="1161" /> Opposition on any aspect of his statement, any aspect of the beef industry or his management of the present crisis.  Any question a Deputy wishes to put to the Minister, including those which are critical and cast aspersions such as those being cast here will be answered by him in an orderly and comprehensive way.  That is appropriate.  It is also appropriate that in a matter of this complexity the Minister, unlike the previous Government when the beef tribunal reported, should answer questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that the parties seeking to gain political advantage from the current difficulties in the beef industry, particularly Fianna Fáil, had a poor record in their management of that industry which required the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When that tribunal of inquiry reported, Fianna Fáil did not allow a single question to be asked or answered by any of its Ministers on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrast, on this occasion the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, will not only make a comprehensive statement, one of many he has made on the ongoing management of this issue, but he is willing to subject himself to questions from any Deputy who is not satisfied with the statement he makes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in marked contrast to the behaviour of Fianna Fáil &mdash; the party with which Deputy Harney now wishes to be allied &mdash; when it had responsibility for the beef industry. It commissioned a hugely expensive tribunal but did not answer a single question on any of the findings of that tribunal.  In spite of its record of non-accountability in regard to the beef industry, Deputy Harney seems to wish to ally herself in desperation with Fianna Fáil.</P>

Arising out of incidents at the Point Depot last night, this is very urgent indeed.  Will the Taoiseach bring together the Ministers for Education, Justice and the Environment with a view to bringing forward legislation as soon as possible to ensure that a criminal prosecution can take place if that is necessary.  The law is hopelessly inadequate on safety at pop concerts.</P>

However, following what I said in the House yesterday, I wish to announce that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Bernard Allen, is immediately taking on board the issue of safety at indoor concerts of this kind. He will seek in the first instance, to have a voluntary code of practice put in place quickly, and will meet all the relevant interests to that end.  If that needs to be underpinned by changes in the criminal law, those will also be considered. What is urgent at this stage is to get a voluntary effective code of practice that is enforced and that people attending these events know is being enforced.</P>

      <P>That might be the Minister of State's understanding of the gravity of the crisis. It is not mine.</P>
      <P>A week ago this morning when I stood up to speak I was tempted to describe the Minister as &ldquo;Ivan do little&rdquo;.  Now I am convinced I must call the Minister &ldquo;Ivan do nothing&rdquo;.  We now face the most critical period for our beef industry since the foundation of the State.  The beef industry is one of the most important pillars of the economy. It provides a livelihood for upwards of 100,000 farm families, several thousand workers in the processing sector, all of whom, I would like to remind the Labour Party, are PAYE workers, and several thousand more in agri-business and related industries.  In total, beef is worth about £2 billion a year to the economy.  This crucial industry deserves nothing less than a major united national effort at the most senior level of politics, industry and agriculture to confront and surmount the deep crisis facing it at this moment. Above all else, it requires a person of competence and conviction to lead and direct this campaign.</P>
      <P>I regret I am no longer convinced the Minister is the right person to get this country out of the crisis in which it now finds itself.  The handling of the issue from day to day since the BSE crisis hit last March has been complacent, incompetent and deceitful.  The Minister deceived this country when he gave the clear impression two weeks ago that he negotiated the Russian beef deal, that he defended the Irish position, struck the best available deal, and only conceded when the gun was put to his head, and he signed the Protocol with the Russian officials.  Now we know that none of this is true.  We know the Minister was holding a constituency clinic at home in Wexford when this crucial and critical deal was being signed by officials from his Department at Dublin Airport &mdash; I will come back to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> The Minister has forfeited the trust of the nation.  For that reason it is my belief that he is not the person to take this country and its key industry out of the present crisis.  What I respectfully suggest is that perhaps he should move aside and hand over this important task to somebody who is prepared to devote his time and make it a priority item in his daily agenda.  It is now clear that both the Minister and his Department have lost the confidence of the international markets and of the Irish markets as the confidence of the international and Irish markets and the credibility they should have on behalf of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the creation of a new national agency, which is independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to oversee food hygiene and quality.  This agency should report to the Minister for Health or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, or to both, but not to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It should be run by a board that is truly representative of all interests, not just farmers and processors but consumers, health and veterinary professionals and retailers.  Its starting point must be the welfare and well-being of consumers.  From now on this business must be consumer driven.  The new agency would, I hope, command more respect and credibility, domestically and internationally, than is held at present by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, whose reputation has been tarnished by successive scandals and has further been sullied by the performance of its Minister in recent days.</P>
    <P>What officials represented our interests at Dublin Airport when the Protocol was signed? Who signed the Protocol?  Who gave them the authority to sign it?  What right had they to single out three countries, two of them in Munster?  If Munster with its golden vale has always been known for anything, it is for the quality of its food &mdash;&ldquo;Macaire méith na Mumhain&rdquo;.  On what scientific evidence did unnamed officials sign away the selling rights of Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan to the Russians?  My questions must be answered.</P>
    <P>For many years public policy has sought to establish Cork as the food capital of Ireland.  It has one of the country's most respected food science faculties in University College, Cork and some of the best land in Europe.  It also has some of the best restaurants, as adjudged by international experts in that field.  The basis of that judgment has been the quality of the raw material and the quality of the food.  If the raw material is no good, no trick of the culinary trade will turn it into a dish that will meet with the approval which has been accorded to food in the restaurants of Cork.  In one fell swoop anonymous officials in Dublin Airport undermined a reputation which had been painfully and painstakingly built over years.  This Government should try telling the farmers in my county why <Col N="1171" /> their county was selected for exclusion by the Russians.  They should also try to explain it to the farmers in Tipperary.  I include County Tipperary because I know the county well.  It is part of the golden vale and enjoys the traditional reputation of that part of the country for the quality of its food and food production.</P>
    <P>Thousands of jobs are at stake.  We should not seek to set farmers against consumers in this debate because what is good for farmers is good for consumers.  When farmers have money in their pockets they will spend it in the towns, villages and cities.  That underpins the economy of those towns and employment in shops, garages and other businesses.  That message must be given to the Labour Party and Democratic Left who appear to have taken a position of splendid isolation in this debate.  If they have taken part in it, it has been to indulge in farmer bashing.  I hold no brief for any interests other than those of our citizens.</P>
    <P>Look at what has happened since the BSE crisis arose and at how little the Government has done.  A senior official in the Department was arrested and subsequently charged with illegally selling Irish cattle health certificates for British livestock.  That did not inspire much confidence in our international customers.  What image did it present of our capacity to police the beef industry?  The beef tribunal highlighted the extent of malpractice and maladministration in the Department.  Three years after its report was published little has been done to put our house in order.  Instead, we read about further additions to the Department's catalogue of disasters.  The Minister has called on the Garda to investigate farmers suspected of deliberately introducing BSE infected animals into their herds to claim compensation.  This is being done after a multimillion pound campaign to seal the Border with Northern Ireland was abandoned.  The scandalous abuse of illegal growth promoters continues unabated.  The recent conviction of several farmers seems to represent the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>News travels fast in this era of global communication.  Do we really believe that we can continue to tolerate rampant abuse and illegality in our beef industry and still expect foreign customers to have confidence in our product?  We produce wonderful food in the most natural and hygienic way.  We produce top quality food that is fit for our tables and for export markets.  What good will that be if nobody believes it?  What good will it be if the Minister, Deputy Yates, has conceded otherwise to the Russians?  The Russians, not the French, are the new experts on cuisine.  If they have decided beef from counties Cork and Tipperary is not fit for consumption that message will go to the French, British and Germans, our long-term customers.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Russians should take action to exclude Irish beef.  Russia is our single biggest market in terms of volume.  It imported approximately 100,000 tonnes of our beef in 1995. <Col N="1172" /> However, Russia is not a commercial market.  It is classified as a third world country by the EU and all beef sales to such markets are heavily subsidised through the export refund mechanism. Beef going to Russia attracts an export refund of about £1,400 per tonne.  The average market price paid by the Russians for Irish beef in 1995 was approximately £9,000 per tonne as opposed to £14,000 per tonne paid by other markets. Through the generosity of the EU Russia is getting our beef for next to nothing.  If customers who are getting our product at a knock-down price are raising questions about its safety, what does that imply for commercial customers who have paid four times as much for the same product?  There are already reports that the Iranians are proposing a county by county ban similar to the Russians.  How long before our top commercial customers in the lucrative European markets start doing the same?  If that happens we will be in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>It is a well known maxim that the consumer is king in the food business.  For a long time large segments of the Irish beef industry paid lip service to that concept.  We developed a dependence on intervention and on relatively undemanding third country markets, a business usually conducted by the State trading agency. This trade did not involve contact with supermarkets, retail butchers or consumers.  Our customers are much less demanding than the Sainsburys and Tescos of this world.  We must break away from our current unhealthy dependence on subsidised artificial markets. Armed with that knowledge we must put in place a new national agency, independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to oversee food hygiene and food quality. Producers and processors must be represented on the board of this agency.  It must include also people from the retail trade and primarily consumer interests.  If the consumer is sovereign in a market economy we should reflect that fact in our system for policing the food industry.</P>
    <P>The creation of the new agency need involve no increase in the overall size of Government bureaucracy.  It would simply involve a transfer of function from one area of Government to another.  That should happen in such a way that efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, independence and accountability are drastically improved.  A new agency reporting to the Minister for Health or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment would command respect.  We must set about putting such an agency in place sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>One of the essential priorities of this agency should be the introduction of the principle of traceability to all aspects of our food industry, including beef production.  This system already works in a small way with some supermarket chains.  The retailer can identify the individual farmer who produced the beef being sold and, therefore, can be assured of its quality.  If there is a problem with it, the producer ultimately pays <Col N="1173" /> the price.  This system must be extended across the whole beef industry and across the food and livestock industry.  Implementation of such a system would involve a certain amount of difficulty and expense but there is no reason for not proceeding and there is every reason to begin to proceed today rather than tomorrow.</P>
    <P>We have ignored the failures of our current control system for far too long.  These failures are now beginning to cost us dearly in terms of lost reputation, lost markets and lost export earnings. Since the beginning of March the Government has stumbled from one damaging incident to another, hurdled helplessly in a sea of inaction and failed to take any kind of initiative.  We believe we can prevent major international customers for Irish beef from exploiting our stumbling.  The position has gone from bad to worse.  That the Minister is not present only adds to his failure to be present at Dublin Airport when the famous Protocol was signed well in advance of the time for signing our contract with the Russians.  He has failed this House, the farmers and the workers.  He has no further useful constructive contribution to make to the development of the food or agriculture industry and as such must take the condemnation of this House.</P>

      <P>I have often said I welcome the opportunity to take part in a debate such as this. Unfortunately this debate is taking place for all the wrong reasons.  In the words of one of the elected representatives from my county it is intended to do the greatest amount of damage possible to the Government, the farming community and the nation.  Deputy Quill made an interesting comment that we should not have any more involvement with third country markets, that we should concentrate on European and other markets and should not depend on European export refunds.  At one time we were selling 1.6 million tonnes of beef with the benefit of export refunds, either on live cattle or dead meat.  Under the MacSharry agreement this year we will still be able to export one million tonnes. If we ignore that market we do so at our peril and at enormous damage to our farmers and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quill referred to the need for a serious and united effort to sustain our biggest industry. I question the sincerity of that statement.  I have not witnessed much serious or united effort in the House over the past ten days to try to save our single biggest industry.  I have seen the exact opposite.  I attended a public meeting of Monaghan farmers the other night.  While I am extremely annoyed that Monaghan, Cork and Tipperary have been called into question by the <Col N="1174" /> Russians, the farmers at that meeting were extremely reasonable and tolerant and their only interest was in ensuring the best possible deal was done on their behalf.  Had we not accepted the Russian deal we would have to rely on the MacSharry-Walsh safety net intervention of 78p per pound.</P>
    <P>What has taken place in this House during the past few days is nothing short of national sabotage.  The only interest of the two Opposition parties, especially the main party, is to ensure that whatever problem we have with Russia is highlighted in order to do the greatest amount of damage to other markets.  They say all one has to do is get on a plane and fly out to these markets. A former leader of that great party, none other than Charles J. Haughey, when in Opposition was able to get into a plane, fly out and write the contract in the sands of Libya.  The record when in Government was slightly different.  The record states clearly that we did not sell a beast to Libya in 1991 or 1992, when BSE was only being talked about.  So far as dead meat is concerned we did not sell one pound to Libya in 1988, 1989, 1990 or 1991.  The Iranian market, which it has been suggested could be opened by a visit, took only 12 tonnes in 1991 and none in 1992.  That record shows whether a simple air flight can solve all these problems.  Why was the Opposition not able to do it when in Government?  They had full access to intervention but ensured, by their negotiations, we would not have it at a later date.</P>
    <P>The record states that in 1995 580,000 tonnes of meat was sold out of this country, which includes 150,000 tonnes of intervention.  In 1995 we sold 105,000 tonnes of meat to Russia, which included 40,000 tonnes of intervention.  This means that in 1995 we sold only 430,000 tonnes fresh.  To date with all the problems and the sarcasm against the Minister, the Department and An Bord Bia we have sold 460,000 tonnes fresh and, as yet, only 40,000 tonnes into intervention.</P>
    <P>What possibilities were open to the Minister and his Department regarding the Russian deal? Is the Opposition saying we should have refused the Russian deal?  I suggest not.  Deputy Quill said the price being given was low but it still meant a major benefit to farmers, processors and those involved with the meat industry.  Some people who thought it would be difficult for me and my colleagues to attend farmers' meetings said the price of cattle would fall by £100 a head.  That did not happen and will not happen unless through their efforts to score political points because there never was more interest in the purchase of Irish meat and live cattle than today.  I accept there was a high level of live cattle exports for a few years but the record clearly shows that during the previous six years average exports were only 44,000 cattle per year.  This should be contrasted with the figure of more than 100,000 cattle this year.  In 1991 there were no exports of live cattle. <Col N="1175" /> That is the record of the Opposition in Government.</P>
    <P>It is important to clarify the action taken by the previous Government to deal with BSE.  I have read with interest the comments made by the former Minister for Agriculture, Senator O'Kennedy, at meetings in England and elsewhere.  He referred to the great job he did and how he organised matters.  He introduced legislation to curtail the use of meat and bonemeal but it was couched in such complicated language that no one could understand it.  He also failed to police the implementation of the legislation.  Many of the animals which have been diagnosed as having BSE were fed with meat and bonemeal even though this legislation was in place.</P>

Do they believe that cattle prices would have remained at the level they have been at for the past ten days if our trade with Russia fell asunder?

      <P>Unlike me, they do not stand beside the ring at marts and see what is happening on the ground.  We export 80 per cent of our beef and one either sells the beef or one does not; it is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this debacle began in March we have had to avail of intervention schemes.  Nobody wants intervention and we have done our best over the years to get away from it.  We want to produce the quality product required by consumers and to by-pass intervention.  However, EU Ministers for Agriculture have had no alternative since March <Col N="1177" /> but to open up cold stores.  At the same time we have been trying to rebuild our commercial markets.  The figures show that these markets have been gradually increasing over recent months but we do not know how they will pan out following the findings by English scientists yesterday.</P>
    <P>We have already dumped 1.1 million tonnes of beef into intervention.  In the past this meat was sold to Russia for next to nothing.  There is nothing to prevent the same thing happening next year but it would be much better to get these cattle out of the chain this year by selling several hundred thousand of them to Russia.  I dread to think what would happen to farmers if there was entire intervention this year and next year.  We must be realistic about this issue: irrespective of the price, cattle must be got out of the chain this year if next year's cattle are to be sold.  If this does not happen farmers will be in dire trouble in 1997.  This is why the deal with Russia is outstandingly important.</P>
    <P>I never liked the idea of regionalisation but the most important point is that such countries are taking their full import requirement throughout the winter and early spring.  Before the debate is concluded I want Fianna Fáil to say what other country would have bought that volume of beef from us.  I do not believe any other country would have done so.  This deal achieved a dual purpose in that it secured exports and ensured that this year's cattle did not have to compete with next year's cattle for the same market.  Anyone who knows anything about agriculture will understand this.</P>
    <P>Deputies do not realise &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle alluded to this on the Order of Business &mdash; that comments made in this Chamber or in the media are transmitted to European and world capitals within two hours.

      <P>There is a BSE problem and I do not know who can be blamed for it, the farmers of Ireland are not to blame.  There is loose talk about who is to blame.  There are seven million cattle in this country and while the number of BSE cases has at least doubled since last year, we have a low incidence of BSE.  We have a good quality product, which we must communicate around the world.  That is why the Russians dealt with us.  Should we not deal with them because they excluded three counties?  The other nations would say if it was not good enough for the Russians, it was not good enough for them.  There was no alternative on the day.  I agree with the chorus that we now have to do everything we can to convince the Russians there is nothing wrong with the three counties.  I think it was non-scientifically assessed and will be changed.</P>
      <P>Every time we hear a case of BSE confirmed in Ireland it is a nail in our coffin.  Irrespective of our political sides, a case of BSE is bad news.  We will have to take steps, however difficult they might be, to minimise any effort to introduce BSE.  I have no concrete knowledge that anyone tried to do that.  We need to ensure traceability, which we have talked about for long enough. Various Governments have discussed traceability but have not done much about it.</P>
      <P>We should deliver what the consumer wants. We have the cattle, the environment, the grassland and the know-how.  There has been a break in the link between when the animal is sold and when the meat is put up for sale.  We have to fill this gap.  There should be a birth certificate or identity card which has information on the animal.  This has been discussed so many times in this House that I will not waste time on it.  The consumer, on request, will know where the animal came from, what type of animal it was, the food it ate and what environment it was reared in.  Until recently some people would have laughed at this suggestion and said they had enough trouble with a blue card without adding a sheaf of papers.  We can convince the Russians that every single animal in Ireland offered for export is as good as they will get anywhere else, or better.</P>
      <P>In so far as other markets are concerned, there is intense activity to get more markets for cattle because we are not short of them and will not be in the future.  It is incumbent on us, and I have every confidence in the Minister for Agriculture and his officials, to make representations in every corner of the world to ensure we give our farmers a chance to sell their cattle.  When this matter has blown over, many people will ask why Fianna Fáil made such a rumpus about what is basically the farmers' income.</P>

      <P>A few weeks ago, I expressed satisfaction that the Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry was at last backing the case for the removal of the Border and a special status for Northern Ireland beef exports.  Deputy Cowen and I had argued for that in a number of debates during the year.  I did not think the Minister was about to agree to redrawing the border around counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.</P>
      <P>Farmers are appalled by the situation and how the Minister let them down in negotiation, not that he was even present at the final negotiation. We are not putting blame on anyone.  We were not being hard on Deputy Crawford, as I believe he only read the note given to him by the Government press officer when he said on radio that the deal was signed at the end of the steps of the plane.  We are not holding him in any way responsible for being misled on that particular issue.</P>

      <P>For months past, the Minister and the Government have been assuring everybody that Irish beef was the best, safe to eat, and that there was no BSE problem of any consequence here.  The Minister maintains that line, despite the Russian agreement which clearly carries the contrary message.  If the Protocol carries a misleading and false message about Irish beef to the world, should he have agreed to it? Will he not have some difficulty convincing the outside world of its harmlessness, especially when he cannot even convince his own colleagues? Yesterday, the Tánaiste was on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, making excuses for his diplomatic inaction, saying we had to sort out our BSE problems before we could export to Iran, contradicting, as Deputy Cowen pointed out, the optimistic message of the Minister that we do not have any real problem with BSE here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the rise in the number of BSE cases here in the last few months is disturbing, they are still of minimal significance compared with the situation in Britain.  Since March, there has been no increased incidence of a new CJD epidemic anywhere in Europe.  As a result, beef markets in Europe are recovering.  I read a report recently <Col N="1180" /> that said German consumption of beef was now only 10 per cent down, compared with last year. The latest scientific report, which is not conclusive, tells us very little that is new.  The authors are talking up the importance of their research, with reference to worst case scenarios. There is a good chance that BSE will go the same way as the egg salmonella scare a few years ago, which also came from Britain.  After the initial panic, and then the passage of time in which people notice that nothing in the real world has changed, they slip readily enough back into their old consumption habits.  There is nothing wrong with that.  There may be a residue of a problem for a while.  For this to happen it is right to take all sensible precautions to eliminate any risk from BSE, so that the risk of catching CJD from eating infected beef remains very low on the scale of risks to health.</P>
    <P>I am dumbfounded that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, whose job is to defend the reputation of Irish beef and food, would collude with any foreign authorities in discriminating against our beef on an unscientific county basis.  Even though he may not accept it, the Minister will be represented as advertising to the world that Ireland now accepts it has a BSE problem.  The principle of this is dangerous and the precedent more so, even if there is no major impact on beef prices or outlets in the market immediately.  The Minister has diminished the image of Irish food.  It gives competitors a stick to beat the Irish product with, which they will use, especially as we all know it is difficult to effectively police county boundaries.  I presume the Minister is not proposing to post Garda checkpoints on the county boundaries.</P>
    <P>The Minister is refusing any similar concession to Iran and Libya.  However, the principle is the same.  It is either right or wrong to regionalise the country from the point of view of animal health. I do not understand the logic of accepting county exclusions for one market and refusing it for others, effectively saying to those other buyers that we do not regard their trade as being of the same value or status as the Russian trade, which they will remember with interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister made our future negotiations with third countries more difficult to get out of a real short-term difficulty.  It has been implied that some pressure may have come from France, a large country with many regions.  Ireland is effectively one region as recognised in European negotiations on many issues.  We should never have allowed any of our competitors to undermine our animal health status as a single unit.  The choice of counties is totally illogical and does not relate to the incidence of BSE <i>per capita.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister had a keen political interest in ensuring that an objective criteria were not used. If he chose the three counties with the highest <i>per capita</i> incidence of BSE, Wexford would have been included instead of Cork.  It is sixth on the list and Tipperary is ninth.  To all intents and purposes, Tipperary is administered as two <Col N="1181" /> counties and Tipperary South Riding is free of BSE to date.  To have insisted on a scrupulously fair approach would have cost the Minister a seat in a keenly contested constituency in the next general election.  He did not push that argument too strongly with the Russians.  When the final crunch came he did not put the vital political arguments and make decisions.  As we now know, he was nowhere near Dublin Airport at the time. This matter is far too important to leave to veterinary officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister offered to travel to Moscow, but he did not travel up the road to Dublin Airport when it mattered despite telling the public &ldquo;I did a deal with the Russians last Saturday at 1 p.m. in the VIP lounge in Dublin Airport&rdquo;.  He subsequently said &ldquo;The gun was held to my head and I had to decide&rdquo;.  I accept the Russians good military technology but the gun held to the Minister's head must have been a long range Iraqi supergun.</P>

      <P>We were given the impression the Minister was some latter day Michael Collins, facing the threat of immediate and terrible war on the trade front if he did not agree immediately to Russian demands.  Why did he allow 11 days to elapse before correcting the record?  Did he hope to get away with it?  When he stated in the Seanad, &ldquo;I will not be signing any more Protocols&rdquo;, was he not effectively stating that he had signed the one at Dublin Airport?  When I asked last week for Protocol to be laid before the House the Taoiseach did not answer my question. If a Protocol had been placed in the Library last Thursday we would have known the Minister did not sign the Protocol and that he was not at Dublin Airport.  In all interviews, debates and television programmes since, he did not correct the impression given to the Irish public that he was at the airport.  Are those the sort of political standards this Government is prepared to stand over after all it said in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1921 we had to sign away Six Counties.  This time we signed away another three, but the ultimatum did not even come from a Russian Minister, it came from three vets.  This is no way to do intergovernment business.  Are we now being led to believe that the Minister made a decision on an ultimatum from three vets over the telephone &mdash; even a mobile telephone has been mentioned?  I would like a full statement from the Minister about where he was and what he was doing when those negotiations were taking place. Who contacted him?  Who did he consult?  An inexperienced Minister of less than two years standing does not make those type of decisions on his own without the Taoiseach's knowledge and backing.  The Taoiseach was nearer to the airport than the Minister.  The new M50 would have got him there in jig time to conclude the negotiations. Why was he not involved, or was he involved? <Col N="1182" /> What really happened on that Saturday morning? Unfortunately, the Minister has to come into the House to answer questions, but did he really know what was happening?  Who dealt with the correspondence with the Russians in the first place?  Was it the Taoiseach?  Was he carrying out the negotiations and was the Minister sidelined? Should we focus on the Taoiseach?  I hope the Minister can put the record straight today and tell us the Taoiseach's role in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>If it is the case, although I doubt it, that the Minister did all this on his own and was in his Department &mdash; although others believe he was in his constituency &mdash; and decided to send officials to conclude these important negotiations and sign a Protocol, is he really competent enough to be a Minister?  If he did not check with the Taoiseach, or the Tánaiste or travel to the airport himself, should he be sacked?</P>
    <P>One of the obligations in any Government is to provide justice and impartiality for all citizens in its jurisdiction.  I accuse the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry of maladministration in allowing foreign officials to treat parts of this country inequitably and in allowing such an agreement to be signed.  The farmers of Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan will not forgive a Minister who was prepared to allow blatant discrimination against them and foreign officials perpetrate an injustice against them, to protect his own political backyard.</P>
    <P>The farm organisations have lost confidence in this fair weather Minister, who is showing over and over again that he is not good at handling political pressure in a crisis although what pressure was he under in the case when he was not there?  How can anyone have any confidence in the Minister to protect or promote any vital national interest in future?</P>
    <P>The Minister breached the most elementary rule in the negotiating book by conceding to last minute ultimatums from vets.  Much though I value our trading relations with Russia, it is unacceptable that a Russian Government vet &mdash; no doubt in an effort to help the Minister out of the hole, and at his behest &mdash; should adopt the domineering tone towards the Irish people and the Irish market that we have heard in the last few days.  It is unheard of for a foreign vet to enter into public debate with farm organisations or political parties here, but I do not blame him. I blame the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>I question the Taoiseach's involvement in this. As he wrote a letter to the Russian Prime Minister he must have been fully briefed.  It is inconceivable that the Minister would have sacrificed three counties without the Taoiseach's explicit agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister was in an unenviable position, because he and other members of the Government had not done their legwork.  We would not be so dependent on the Russian market, if more effort had been made to reopen other markets, such as Iran and Libya, since <Col N="1183" /> March.  In this context, I single out Iran.  I am confident from our own contacts with the Iranian authorities that the problem arises from the political position of the Irish Government and not merely the incidence of BSE.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, has consistently refused, for political reasons, to authorise a meeting of the Joint Ireland-Iranian Commission or to travel to Iran.  This is because he does not want to offend other powerful Western interests.  I regard his attitude as craven and out of keeping with Ireland's independent foreign policy tradition which is well understood by others.</P>
    <P>Under Fianna Fáil Ministers for Foreign Affairs we developed excellent trade relations with Arab and Middle Eastern countries.  Good relations with Iran were restored when Deputy Collins secured the release of Brian Keenan and brought forward the day when other Western hostages were released.  Similarly, we helped maintain a good beef export trade with Libya and, while Deputy Crawford made little of this, the facts are on the record.  Deputy Haughey and others, in Opposition and in Government, developed those contracts and Irish agriculture interests have been grateful.  Deputy Cowen and others in my party endeavoured to maintain those relations in the past six or seven months while Ministers were travelling around the world but did not bother to stop off in any of the countries that might have helped us resolve some of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>I always get the feeling that in relation to issues other than Northern Ireland our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, is simply going through the motions without any particularly strong interest or commitment.  He is no doubt fatigued by his non-stop jet travel and overnight stays in overheated luxury hotels.  Management of foreign policy has become dull, uninspired and unimaginative.  The grandiose White Paper on Foreign Policy may have been worthy enough, but it said very little, and it is now virtually forgotten.  We rarely seem to have any ideas of our own.  We do not take many foreign policy initiatives these days.  Even though we want the Irish Presidency to be a success, it is being criticised as a damp squib and people are saying nothing will be achieved at the Dublin Summit. The Taoiseach said yesterday that I had to search for such criticism, but those were the reports in a number of British newspapers yesterday.  I hope the American President attends the summit and gives it some side shows and life.</P>

      <P>An important draft document which the Germans consider will be worth little or nothing.  However, that is not today's business. We do not see many foreign policy initiatives these days.  We are for the most part just going along with or speaking for the herd, mouthing nothing except endless bland risk free platitudes.</P>
      <P>I accept that we have the responsibility as holders of the Presidency of expressing the EU consensus but we miss the spark and enthusiasm that was there in the time when Deputies Lenihan, Collins and Andrews were Foreign Ministers.  Not to be too partisan about it, Dr. Garret FitzGerald at least put some life into it also.  We should not be afraid to pursue our commercial interests as vigorously as other countries pursue theirs.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry had too few cards in negotiation with the Russians.  Perhaps that is why he did not turn up. If the Russians had called off their deal he and the Government would have been exposed.  My argument is that if we had been as energetic as we should have been in securing other markets since March, the negotiating ploy of excluding certain counties would not have been possible.  If the Minister is right that he was left with no choice at such a late stage, it was because of the collective failure of the Government over the past six months and the lack of effective support from his colleagues.  We were urging action.</P>
      <P>It is a devastating sign of political weakness when officials on behalf of the Minister agree that three counties, Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, can be unjustly singled out, not even on the basis of objective criteria.  The moral is obvious.  The farmers deserve a better Minister and a better Government.  No Fianna Fáil Government would ever let the farmers down in that way.</P>
      <P>In severely criticising the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, I have no desire to create any increased difficulties for our farmers in foreign markets, and neither have my colleagues. That is why, in Opposition, we sat on the Russian story for three weeks.  We heard of the difficulties and discussed them.  Our spokesperson said it would be against the interests to say anything about it.  He tried to sound it out formally and informally to see if something was happening. When we attended the world ploughing championships the Minister told everybody there was nothing in the story, instead of trying to check what the real facts were.  We played along with that game of saying nothing because we might have hurt somebody and caused problems. Let no one say that we did not act responsibly, even though the Taoiseach jumps up and down in the House, ranting and raving.  When he is asked a question he never answers it but instead makes the same old speech about the beef tribunal.  I cannot even hear what he is saying.</P>

      <P>Having got itself into this situation, the Government will have to get out of it as soon as possible.  I would not care to be a Fine Gael or Labour Party candidate seeking votes among the farmers of Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan at the next election.  The House is empty now so they must be hiding.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House and to defend the record of the Government in its handling of this important and complex issue.  The truth is bitter so the Deputy may call it &ldquo;The Grapes of Wrath&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I note that after a week of often hysterical and over the top commentary an air of reality is beginning to return.  I welcome the assessment of some independent and respected commentators who, while accepting that the temporary restriction on exports from three counties represented a setback, stressed that the critical objective of keeping open the Russian market, our largest third country market, has been achieved.</P>
      <P>The decision to sign the Russian Protocol must be judged in its proper context and it is timely to recall the background leading to the situation we now find ourselves in.  While BSE has been around for more than a decade, the House of Commons statement on 20 March, which suggested a possible although tenuous link between BSE and CJD, sparked off the biggest public health scare regarding any product.  The result was an immediate and drastic reduction in beef consumption worldwide and a total ban on the export of cattle, beef and beef products from the UK.</P>
      <P>While the UK is the only country with a high incidence of BSE, all beef producing countries were adversely affected, even those which have never had a case of BSE.  We are still dealing with the fall out from this global public health scare and it is unlikely that full consumer confidence in beef will ever be fully restored.  Yesterday's announcement in the UK about new research findings highlights just how complex and difficult this entire issue is.  It also confirms, if proof were needed, that this is a technical and not a political matter.</P>
      <P>From the outset the Government has adopted a strategic approach to BSE and this was never more evident than in the aftermath of the 20 March announcement when my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia worked very closely together to inform our third country customers of the factual position on BSE in Ireland and the extensive controls which have been put in place to guarantee the safety and quality of Irish beef.  This work has continued unabated since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political initiatives have been taken where and when appropriate and with some success.  An <Col N="1187" /> example is the reopening of the Egyptian market following the intervention of the Taoiseach. However, this is firstly and primarily a public health issue which requires a detailed technical response.  It is naive and simplistic in this era of mass communication and sophisticated consumers to say that political intervention will overcome genuine food safety concerns.</P>
    <P>When the first case of BSE was confirmed in Ireland in 1989, a comprehensive programme of controls was put in place to deal with the disease, including the depopulation of the entire herd in which a case of BSE has been found.  This latter measure is not scientifically based but was adopted specifically to reassure consumers and purchasers of Irish beef about the safety of our product.  That policy has operated well although there have been periodic setbacks, notably when some new information on BSE came to public notice.</P>
    <P>The controls in Ireland have been continually updated in line with all new scientific data and we have been successful over time in keeping all major markets open to Irish beef.  I would emphasise, however, that while the depopulation policy is a central element of our control system, the overall situation is much more complex and we should not delude ourselves into thinking that we will completely reassure third countries by simply telling them that we have a depopulation policy.  Specifically in relation to Russia there were two occasions when there were difficulties in this market but these problems were overcome following visits from senior Russian veterinary authorities and inspections of our controls.  In recent years Russia changed from being a purchaser of intervention beef to becoming a major importer of commercial beef.  The import of Irish beef into Russia reached an all time high of some 100,000 tonnes valued at £325 million in 1995.  Russia was the biggest third country importer of Irish beef in 1995 and this situation continues in 1996.  The fact that Russia is by far the most important third country purchaser of Irish beef gives it a negotiating power and importance unmatched by any other third country.</P>
    <P>The Russian market remained open following the statement of 20 March in the House of Commons because of ongoing contacts with the Russian veterinary authorities and their familiarity with the comprehensive controls in place in Ireland to deal with the disease.  In addition, a veterinary officer from Russia had been assigned to Ireland to supervise the loading and shipping of contracts for that market.  The continuance of trade with Russia at this critical time helped to shore up the Irish beef market during a very difficult period and to prevent an even more serious fall in beef prices than we have experienced to date.</P>
    <P>The current difficulties with Russia commenced during the summer when the number of BSE cases in Ireland increased, albeit overall <Col N="1188" /> numbers are still very low in a cattle population of 7 million.  There have been 38 cases of BSE in Ireland in 1996 to date compared with 16 cases in 1995 and a previous high of 19 cases in 1994.  The increase was particularly marked during July and August.  I am completely satisfied that this rise does not represent more than a temporary blip which can be expected when dealing with such low numbers.  Nevertheless, it does raise certain technical questions for third country buyers, particularly in the post 20 March climate where there is heightened public concern relating to the safety of beef in the first case.  Third country purchasers now have to contend with not alone beef at the best price but with convincing a sceptical public that the beef being purchased is completely safe, particularly beef from a country with a record of BSE, no matter how small.  The reality is that it is a buyer's market.  We are the sellers of beef.  Russia is a major buyer and the issues have to be seen in this context.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the Russian authorities began to express concerns during the summer which were discussed with their representative in Ireland and there were also direct contacts with the authorities in Moscow.  However, the matter was raised again in mid-September when I met the Minister for Agriculture and the chief veterinary officer of the Russian Federation during a visit to the Moscow Food Fair.  On that occasion the Russian veterinary authorities said that they had decided to sign that very day an order banning the import of all Irish beef from I November.  I was faced with that stark reality when I visited those people in Moscow in September.  It was made absolutely clear that this action was being taken on public health grounds because of the increased incidence of the disease in 1996.  I protested in the strongest possible terms that the decision was precipitous and unjustified and outlined in great detail Ireland's record in relation to BSE and the elaborate controls in place to protect consumers of Irish beef.  I requested that any action be deferred until there had been full and detailed discussions at technical veterinary level.  The Russian side accepted that our controls were comprehensive but pointed out that, notwithstanding such measures, the level of cases had more than doubled this year.  They had a duty to protect public health and this required the banning of Irish beef pending further study of the incidence of the disease in Ireland.  They pointed out that Russia has a long record of public health concern and that they had been the first country to ban imports of beef from the UK.</P>
    <P>Following this meeting I sought and obtained an immediate meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Zaveryuka&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the help of the Irish Ambassador in Moscow and I would like to acknowledge the role he played in this crisis <Col N="1189" /> During that meeting I argued Ireland's case very forcefully and pointed to the political and economic consequences of the proposed action. The Deputy Prime Minister accepted these arguments and agreed that no action should be taken until there had been full discussions at technical expert level.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Taoiseach were kept fully briefed at all times of the developing situation. On my return from Moscow contacts were initiated at the highest political level to reinforce the points that had been made during my meetings in Moscow.  The Taoiseach contacted Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, the Tánaiste spoke to the Russian Foreign Minister and the Minister contacted the Minister for Agriculture. Following these contacts it was agreed that a high level veterinary delegation led by the Russian chief veterinary officer should come to Ireland to consider the matter at first hand.  An Irish delegation had been on standby to visit Moscow but the clearly expressed wish of the Russian side was for technical discussions to be held in Ireland so that they could assess the situation.  The Russian concern was a public health issue and a point had been reached where the matter had to be dealt with at a technical level.</P>
      <P>The Russian delegation arrived in Ireland on 7 October and following initial discussions with the Minister and me, they completed a comprehensive programme of inspection visits, which they had specifically requested, including beef and rendering plants and the depopulation of a BSE herd.  The delegation also met the Taoiseach and held detailed discussions with the Department of Health.  The final discussions commenced on 11 October when, following the assessment of our controls, the Russian side stated that they would no longer recommend an outright ban on Irish beef but instead would seek an export restriction on certain counties for a temporary period while they studied the continuing incidence of BSE in Ireland.  The Russian side made it absolutely clear that unless this compromise was accepted a ban would be implemented on all Irish beef with effect from 1 November.  They also made it clear that there was no question of delaying this decision.  The compromise had been put forward in light of the high level political representations and nothing further could be achieved at this time.</P>
      <P>The proposal was contained in a draft Protocol presented by the Russian side and it was initially proposed that seven counties would be excluded. There were other conditions in relation to age and labelling but they did not present any difficulties.  I would like to make it very clear that the counties were selected by the Russian side on their analysis of the data.  The basis for the selection is not altogether clear but it does take into account the level of cases in 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a case of swapping one county for another.  Adding a particular county would not get a county already on the list excluded.  The proposed categorisation was <Col N="1190" /> rejected and the meeting concluded without agreement.</P>
      <P>Following high level discussions within the Department and an assessment of the repercussions of the closure of the Russian market for the Irish beef market, the negotiations resumed again that afternoon.  The Russian side agreed to reduce the number or counties to three, Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, and to include a three months' review clause which allowed for the relaxation of the restrictions if the incidence of the disease had improved in those counties. Furthermore, the beef could be supplied by an approved plant in any county.  Again the proposal was not agreed and the Russian side reiterated in very stark terms their intention to implement a complete ban on Irish beef from 1 November.  In the light of these considerations, a decision was taken very reluctantly to accept the terms put forward by the Russians.  The agreement was signed prior to the departure of the delegation to Moscow at the end of a series of long and difficult negotiations.  A member of the delegation, an epidemiologist, is staying in Ireland to study the BSE disease further.</P>
      <P>The decision taken is the right one and it will be vindicated in time.  What were the alternatives?  The luxury of continuing negotiations was not an option as the Russian side had made it clear that a ban on Irish beef with effect from 1 November would be promulgated immediately on their return to Moscow.  In any case the trade needed to know where it stood because it takes a number of weeks to fill a contract.  A ban from 1 November would mean no contracts from now.  The compromise had been achieved following intense political representations at the highest level and no more could be achieved at that time.  The Minister could have refused the agreement and accepted the consequences of a total ban on Irish beef.  He would not have been thanked for this decision of principle and there would have been an even greater outcry if, as a result of this decision, producer prices had fallen by another 5p per pound and we were plunged into safety net intervention.  The decision would have resulted in the exclusion of Ireland from a market with an import requirement of 500,000 tonnes of beef and the loss of commercial contacts carefully built up over the years.  The international beef market is currently oversupplied by one million tonnes and our competitors would have been only too ready to stand in and supply Russia's short-term needs and we would have handed the market to them on a plate.  In the longer term, we would have succeeded in undermining Russia as a commercial market &mdash; an action which is in nobody's interest, least of all the Irish beef producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that the scenario I outlined is more acceptable than that in which we now find ourselves and that our BSE strategy is in a shambles.  The Russian market is open to Irish beef and our producers can continue to exploit <Col N="1191" /> the real trade opportunities in that market.  Our traders have established a dominant position in this market.  Continuation of this trade will maintain Irish beef prices and will ensure that the low level of take-up of Irish beef into intervention remains the position.  The only real strategy for the viability of the Irish beef industry is the development and maintenance of commercial markets.  Is anybody seriously suggesting that the loss of our biggest commercial market would have served any useful purpose other than to create even more serious problems for an industry already facing difficult times?</P>
    <P>I fully accept the farmers in these three counties are aggrieved and concerned that their beef could be regarded as an inferior product. There is no scientific justification for the exclusion of the three counties and the beef from these counties is safe.  However, we are dealing with consumer concerns and fears which are not scientifically based.  The Russian side would probably accept that there is no scientific basis for the exclusion of particular counties but they are dealing with an anxious public and have to take measures to justify why they continue to buy beef from a country with an increasing, albeit low incidence of BSE.</P>
    <P>If the shoe were on the other foot the Irish consumer would also question why beef was being bought from a country with BSE rather than one with no BSE and would not be overly interested in the detail of the controls which ensured the safety of the beef.  They would not accept the assurances of foreign politicians that the product was safe but would rely on technical, expert opinion.  Our control systems for food imports are based on technical criteria.  The consumer increasingly sets the standards for food products and we, the producers, must comply or else we will lose markets.  This is not to suggest that we accept indiscriminate demands but it is well to remember that the buyer sets the standards.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the market price for beef from these counties will fall as a result of this action.  The European market, which takes 200,000 tonnes of beef, continues to be open to the product from these counties as do markets in other third countries which take more than 100,000 tonnes of beef.  Despite doomsday forecasts, the price for beef in these counties is the same this week as that in other counties and sales at marts have not fallen.</P>
    <P>I am pleased Saudi Arabia has recently reopened it markets to Irish beef without restrictions.  Some 35,00 tonnes of beef were exported to that market in 1995 valued at £50 million.  While a limited, temporary categorisation of Irish beef was accepted in relation to our largest third country market, this will not be agreed in respect of any other market.  Recent reports in the press about Iran and Libya are unfounded and mischievous.  The Minister has already made it clear he had rejected a similar <Col N="1192" /> proposal from the Iranian authorities prior to the discussions with the Russians.  There have been no contracts with Libya in recent days and we are awaiting details of the technical delegation which it was agreed would travel to Ireland following the Minister's visit to Tripoli.  Ireland fully complies with the international trading code put forward by the Organisation for International Epizootics, OIE, and our product is traded freely to a large number of countries world-wide.  Much of the recent debate ignores the fact that Ireland has an incidence of BSE, albeit a low level, and that BSE has been linked to CJD.  The restrictions imposed by third countries are as a direct result of these facts and the position is that the rise in our cases during the summer has caused disquiet in third countries.  BSE is still making news world-wide and any report or reference to BSE carried in our newspapers is also carried in the international press with a resulting negative impact on consumers in our third country markets.  This is a fact we must live with and which the more intemperate commentators would do well to remember.</P>
    <P>The Department continuously monitors and updates its controls on BSE to provide the maximum possible guarantees to consumers and, in this context, it is proposed to introduce a full traceability system at the earliest possible date.  In addition, new controls have been introduced on the production and sale of meat and bonemeal. However, the Department cannot protect the industry single-handedly.  While we can and have stepped up our controls, it is up to all elements of the industry, including producers and processors, to ensure the highest standards are maintained.  The recent increase in BSE cases probably stems from the continued feeding of meat and bonemeal to cattle, notwithstanding the introduction of a ban on such feeding in 1990. The Department cannot inspect every cow byre. The industry must also act responsibly and play its part.  In this regard, some commentators would do well to examine their own patch rather than heap unjustified criticism on the Department. This is a team effort and the co-operation of all will be required if the objective of safeguarding the beef industry is to be achieved.  The Department is willing to play its part; I hope other sections of the industry are also.</P>
    <P>I defend the officials in my Department against the serious allegations made by Deputy Quill this morning.  It is unfair to use isolated incidents to brand all Department officials.</P>
    <P>This decision was taken in the best interests of the beef industry and this is now being acknowledged.  The agreement is a temporary measure and the Minister will travel to Russia to seek a relaxation of the restrictions on the three counties.  It is easier to seek a relaxation of limited restrictions under an agreed mechanism than to negotiate the lifting of an outright ban. Experience has shown us that once a ban is imposed it can be difficult to lift.  While the immediate reaction to this decision was <Col N="1193" /> understandable, it is now time for good sense and cooler heads to prevail.  There is nothing to be gained from talking ourselves into a crisis.  Rather we need to deal with this situation as pragmatically and effectively as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not one incidence of BSE in County Tipperary, yet farmers there are the victims.  The good news the Minister had for Tipperary farmers when he met the IFA and ICMSA, surrounded by Fine Gael councillors to ensure the matter would not get out of hand, was that if they bought bullocks last year in Kilkenny, Limerick, Clare or Galway, they could sell them <Col N="1194" /> to the Russian market, but they could not sell Tipperary born animals.</P>

A year ago I was a member of a deputation that met the Minister to raise with him an issue relating to the Abattoirs Act.  In compliance with that Act, ratepayers in south Tipperary pay £140,000 subsidy per year to ensure animals are inspected before and after they are killed so that consumers get the best product available.  Despite that fact, they are now the victims.  Such an inspection is not carried out in Kerry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have encouraged people to eat Tipperary beef, but the Minister has sold us out in every regard.  It is unacceptable to say that Tipperary farmers can sell to the Russian market bullocks bought in from Limerick, Kilkenny and other places which do not comply with the Abattoirs Act but they cannot sell their own cattle.  Why were they blacklisted?  I am angry, bitter and very disappointed about that.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt there was political intervention in terms of Wexford's exclusion.  Since Tipperary is ninth on the list of counties with BSE and Cork, the biggest county in Ireland, is seventh, why were those two counties excluded?  I hope the Minister will explain why he did not sit with the Russians in the final negotiations.

      <P>On 30 May last in a debate here on the beef industry the Minister, who had returned <Col N="1196" /> from Russia, stated: &ldquo;I have just returned from an extremely successful visit to Russia where I have been promoting the quality and safety of Irish beef and beef products&rdquo;.  Five months later, I am sure everybody agrees that the visit was not as successful as the Minister first thought.  He came into the House last week and implied that he was placed under enormous pressure.  He said that the gun was put to his head and that final agreement was not reached until the plane was about to leave.  Having listened to his replies at Question Time yesterday it is obvious he did not get involved in the discussions to the extent he should have.</P>
      <P>Shortly after his return from Russia last May the Minister indicated, as widely reported in the media, that a new £20 million promotion involving the introduction of fantastic measures would be launched to restore consumer confidence in beef.  We are almost in November and there is still no sign he will deliver on this great promise.  All we have had is a mickey mouse £500,000 promotion on the home front by An Bord Bia, all of which has gone straight into the pockets of the newspaper barons without an extra pound of beef being sold on the home market. The Minister has become known as &ldquo;promising Ivan&rdquo; as a consequence.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, gave no indication this money will be spent.  There is a crisis of confidence in the beef industry and the problem must be tackled in a serious fashion.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk this week about a new quality assurance programme to ensure traceability in the beef industry.  The Minister has promised to introduce such a programme since his return from St. Petersburg last May.  In agricultural circles as well as in his own Department the Minister has become known as &ldquo;banana skin Yates&rdquo;, he is sliding from one catastrophe to another.  He has suspended all of the farm investment schemes and failed to deliver on his promises to sheep and tillage farmers.  Not to put a tooth in it, despite the fact that he has four full time PR officers working on his behalf, no one can believe a word he says.  That is unfortunate.  On assuming office he went to great lengths to point out that he would resolve all of the ills of the farming community but his performance has been disappointing.</P>
      <P>Confidence in the beef industry must be restored and the consumer reassured on the safety and quality of the product.  Progress will only be made if every member of the Government understands the problem and is prepared to do his or her best to assist.  Given the reaction of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, the future looks bleak.  While the Tánaiste is available to fly to any corner of the globe for a photo opportunity, he is not prepared to bat on behalf of the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has never shown a great understanding or appreciation of the agriculture industry.  While he changed many <Col N="1197" /> of his policies to secure a seat at the Cabinet table, he remains baised against farmers.  While I would not expect the Taoiseach who has a difficult job to do to dress down the Minister for Social Welfare in public, he should take him aside and make him aware of his responsibilities not just to the small percentage of the electorate he represents but to the country at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues, Deputies Power and Davern, for sharing their time with me.  I understand the anger of Deputy Davern who represents the constituency of Tipperary South.  As someone who hails from the west, I have some understanding of the farming sector.</P>
      <P>For the past few weeks a colour photograph of a young, smiling farmer from Borrisokane, County Tipperary has been hanging over the meat counter in my local supermarket.  This was a novel way of reassuring customers about the origin of the beef on sale.  Thanks to the recent actions of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, that smile is fading rapidly and the effectiveness of this marketing campaign has been destroyed.</P>
      <P>The acceptance by the Minister of a partial ban on the export of beef to Russia opens up a Pandora's box of difficulties and complexities.  It is shortsighted and shows a complete and reckless disregard for the consequences of such a concession.  This decision brings into question whether the Minister legitimately represents the interests of this country and whether he is fit to negotiate on its behalf.  It brings into question whether he can any longer realistically and credibly function as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is not overly dramatic or in pursuit of narrow partisan political interests to state that he has betrayed the country.</P>
      <P>It tends to be forgotten that there is still a perception in the minds of people, if not the Governments of other countries, that Ireland and Britain are linked politically and economically. The acceptance of the ban by the Minister may be seen therefore in a populist sense as an admission that Ireland is rife with BSE, a problem which has led to a virtual blanket ban on British beef.  We are in serious danger of being tarred with the same brush.  The partial ban in Russia may well be the slippery slope to a succession of bans on Irish beef.  Following this debacle surely other countries will adopt more stringent criteria and have second thoughts about our livestock exports.</P>
      <P>In this context it is remarkable that, despite three requests from the IFA, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, has refused to travel to Iran, a country with which we are seeking to reopen export markets, to represent the interests of the industry.  This sits uneasily with statements by the Minister that there will not be concessions to Iran and Libya.  How long will it be before the actions of the Government provoke a response from those countries and further markets for Irish exports are lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> The Minister's decision to follow the French policy of regionalisation is both irresponsible and reckless.  By regionalising the market at home to save the Russian market which is worth £300 million he has put exports to so many other markets at risk.  Irish consumers were beginning to recover their confidence in the beef sector but this growing confidence has been shattered by the Minister's ill judged decision at the eleventh hour.  By accepting this deal he has effectively proposed a vote of no confidence in Irish beef.</P>
    <P>Consumers are now forced to ask questions which until now they believed did not need to be asked.  Immediate answers to the following questions are required from the Minister.  Did the Russians provide evidence to support their refusal to accept Irish beef from certain counties? Did the Minister provide evidence to the contrary?  From what countries does Ireland export beef to Russia and from what counties does the beef in the local butcher shop come? Why should the Irish consumer eat beef from counties which have selectively been banned by the Russians?</P>
    <P>In accepting this crude deal the Minister has shown scant regard for the sensitivities of the consumer and does not seem to understand market forces.  Markets are volatile and often work on a perception of success and a climate of confidence.  Once that is shattered there can be a domino effect.  Free floating fears and apprehensions as to the quality of Irish beef could lead to a virtual collapse of the industry on pure speculation, hearsay and rumour without any firm evidence to demonstrate that something is amiss. A partial success in the Russian market, a shabby deal will do nothing to save Irish beef from a possible universal blackball.</P>
    <P>The Government cares little about the beef industry.  When in Government in 1987 the Fianna Fáil Party established an Office of Food. The Department should be renamed the Department of Food, Agriculture and Forestry. Unless this problem is addressed and untangled immediately by the Government one of the central mainstays of the economy is in jeopardy. The Minister has sold the beef industry down the river for a fistful of roubles.  In doing so he has done untold damage to the green island image which has been nurtured during the years.  It will take much effort to restore this image as a producer of pure, wholesome and healthy food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on an industry which is of fundamental importance to the economy and my country in particular, the premier beef producing county in the country.  As an agriculturist by profession and agriculture consultant for almost a decade, I possess much <Col N="1199" /> more knowledge than Deputy Quill.  I am proud to chair a Labour Party sub-committee on agricultural policy and rural development.</P>
      <P>As a member of the sub-committee on EU legislation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I recall discussing in detail the agricultural aspects of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the implications arising for Ireland. Because of the importance of beef to Ireland's economy and the dependence of the beef industry on exports, particularly exports to non-EU countries, the problems arising from the agreement were magnified for Ireland.  Beef is more than 11 times more important to Ireland's economy than to the overall EU economy.  Only 12 per cent of Irish beef production is consumed in Ireland which means that almost nine out of every ten animals produced are exported. Exporting countries like ours are most vulnerable to market over-supplies.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a particularly high dependence on beef exports to non-EU countries.  While this country accounts for less than 7 per cent of total EU beef production, we account for almost one quarter of EU beef exports and are the largest net exporter of beef in the EU to third country markets.  I make these factual observations to indicate that we all knew the combination of the reformation of the CAP and the new GATT would impact on beef prices, and the new subsidy regime for each male animal was put in place to compensate for this reduction.  Likewise, area aid was introduced for cereal growers.</P>
      <P>I intend to be constructive in my contribution. Ranting and raving might sound good but it achieves nothing in our efforts to help an industry worth approximately £2 billion.  The Labour Party believes it is imperative that we adopt an approach that is in the national interest.</P>
      <P>The calamitous announcement by the British health Secretary, Stephen Dorrell, on 20 March triggered the greatest crisis ever related to consumer confidence in beef worldwide.  There has been a sustained effort, in addition to the necessary allocation of resources, to ensure that its effects on beef farms and our vital exports are minimised.</P>
      <P>The introduction of limited regionalisation is regretted and we hoped there would have been some other way of resolving the problems.  The exclusion of three counties from trade after 1 November leaves the industry open to the threat of similar type action from other market buyers. This is a serious problem and we must not lose sight of the fact that Russia takes more than half the steers we sell into third countries.  There is no scientific justification for what the Russians have done, and the quantification of the numerical occurrences of BSE in those counties indicate that the restriction is equally unjustified, but the fact remains that the Russians decided to exclude them.  What was the option facing the Minister? He had to ensure a major market like Russia remained open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> Before we engage in criticism and the unhelpful rhetoric we have heard from some of the farming organisations, let us examine this deal in a businesslike fashion.  What would be the position today for all our beef producers if we lost the entire Russian contract for 300,000 head of cattle?  It would be disastrous and would result in the safety net intervention network coming into play.  Farmers would receive at most 77p or 78p per pound, a loss of up to 5p per pound for beef.</P>
    <P>Securing the Russian market was critical to ensuring prices did not fall.  While it is deplorable and unsatisfactory that Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan were excluded the Minister did his best in difficult circumstances.  I hope the promised review will take place sooner than three months and that the Minister will travel to Russia immediately to seek to have the ban lifted.  We must not forget that the Minister had a choice: to continue selling £0.5 billion worth of beef or lose the entire market.  Engaging in doomsday predictions or behaving ostrich-like in relation to the problem will not serve the interests of the industry in the medium to long-term.</P>
    <P>Last year we exported 580,000 tonnes of beef of which 430,000 tonnes was sold on the commercial market and 150,000 tonnes out of intervention storage.  To date in 1996 we have exported 460,000 tonnes of beef which indicates we are successful in finding markets for this important product.  This week I learned from farming contacts and from farmers at the mart in Mullingar that prices are steady and improving. My advice to farmers is to continue to dispose of cattle as they become fat.</P>
    <P>I want to put forward some proposals which would help to confirm the credibility of our agricultural industry and the health status of our beef.  I note the Russian contract insists that age and labelling requirements be adhered to.  What are those requirements and how will they be satisfied?  We must put in place immediately an independent quality assurance scheme. Employees in factories work to ISO 9000 standards and strive to maintain those standards. We must have a totally independent authority which would put a stamp of quality on our beef. Such an authority was called for recently by the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners Association.  It recommended the establishment of a strategic forum on beef quality involving the Ministers for Health, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Foreign Affairs.  The forum would devise an independent quality assurance scheme similar to the ISO 9000 quality standard and would include consumers, health experts, beef processors, beef exporters, veterinary specialists, meat inspectors and beef farmers.  The establishment of such a forum is the way forward.</P>
    <P>The possibility of establishing an independent food agency which would deal with all aspects of food production and processing should also be explored.  It would deal also with the issue of traceability.  It should be possible to implement a <Col N="1201" /> system of tracing which would monitor the movement of the animal from the originating farm until it reaches the processing stage and eventually the consumer.  The consumer must be assured that our beef is of the highest quality.  The consumer is king and that is how it should be.</P>
    <P>There must be no equivocation about people who tarnish our industry by the use of illegal substances as their use has severely damaged the industry and the full rigours of the law must be applied.  If the law in this area needs strengthening, amendments should be immediately brought forward.  The public is not prepared to tolerate the use of hormones or growth promoters and, as the consumer is the central player in the food chain, we must act accordingly.</P>
    <P>We have legislation which is not being implemented countrywide.  We must ensure that meat destined for the domestic market is slaughtered under the appropriate veterinary supervision throughout the country and not just in local authority areas where the Abattoirs Act has been fully implemented.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to provide the required resources to cash-strapped local authorities to ensure veterinary inspections are carried out.  I call on the Department to provide the funds to allow local authorities comply with their statutory obligations under the Abattoirs Act or assume responsibility for those functions.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the then Minister for Agriculture, Senator Michael O'Kennedy, introduced what was known as the slaughter policy.  In 1990 a ban on meat and bonemeal was also introduced. These were positive measures in that it was vital to slaughter all animals in an infected herd and remove them from the food chain.  Did that happen and what is the present position?</P>
    <P>It is important that every ingredient in feed rations is clearly identified on the bag.  Were rations formulated subsequent to the ban in 1990 which contained meat and bonemeal?  Will the new controls be effective?  It is incumbent on farmers and the industry to act responsibly in this regard.  It would be opportune also to examine the proposal made recently by the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners Association to remove old culled cows from the food chain and give appropriate compensation including a subsidy for rendering.  Those measures would be part of a profound confidence building strategy as opposed to cosmetic moves.</P>
    <P>As a young agriculturalist in the late 1970s I warned farmers of the dangers of purchasing land when interest and inflation rates were volatile.  My words have subsequently become a haunting reality for many farmers.  I was involved in an advisory role as an agricultural consultant helping some of the farmers who found themselves in great difficulties at that time.  I take this opportunity to caution farmers not to pay <Col N="1202" /> outlandish prices for land with milk quotas attached.  The reason for that has been outlined by my former mentor, Professor Sheehy.  This debate is necessary and rather than acting in a defensive way we should be proactive and produce a long-term strategy to deal with this crisis.  There will be further problems when the new trade agreement comes in and when there is further reformation of the CAP.  We should be ready to meet those challenges and not react from the back foot as we have done since 1973.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry about his officials when he expressed his fullest confidence in them and his admiration for their work.  That is also my sentiment as I have known many of them professionally for many years.</P>
      <P>The timing of this debate is of some significance, not because of the Russian ban, which is political or the efforts being made to embarrass the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry because of his difficulties.  It is relevant and significant because of the paper published in the scientific journal <i>Nature</i> this morning.  That was of great importance and we would be foolish to dismiss it.  It is more convincing evidence that BSE can be transmitted to humans.  While that case is not beyond question, the balance of probability is now loaded in that direction.</P>
      <P>This paper indicates new, clear evidence that BSE is responsible for what has been discovered in recent cases, particularly the BSE found in younger people.  That is a marked change from past experience.  It also indicates considerable differences in the pathology of the disorder and that is also significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are inevitable consequences arising out of that discovery.  The first is that BSE is here to stay.  It will be a problem at least for the short to medium term.  Who knows if it will be a long-term problem?  The beef industry must accept that reality and behave accordingly, as does the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. There is no purpose in continuing to talk down this problem.  It is significant that there is a certain risk attached to the consumption of beef. We must assess that risk, put it in perspective and level with the public on it.  We must see the risk in the general context of food consumption.  A risk-free diet is not available.  It would be nice if it was.  Many foods contain contaminants in amounts which are quite toxic if consumed beyond a certain level.  Those would be levels in excess of what normal people eat as part of a normal diet.  That is the context in which we should see BSE.  Bland, reassuring statements that beef is risk-free are unsustainable and we should desist from making them.  I was fascinated by the tone of the statement from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry on the radio this morning which said they anticipated this discovery.  They might have but it is news to us to hear that because the &ldquo;spin&rdquo; of <Col N="1203" /> their public relations was not in accord with such anticipation.  Their reply was that there was no evidence.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Penrose's suggestion of the ISO 9000 concept being applied to the beef industry.  We need an independent assessment of the risk and to conduct this debate in the language of science rather than that of political point scoring.</P>
    <P>We also need to be aware of the enormous ignorance of this disorder.  It is very early in the history of this disease.  We do not know the incubation period for the disease; it may be five or 15 years.  We do not understand how it is transmitted.  These are important factors and will come into play as more knowledge becomes available.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Irish beef producers and the whole Irish economy needs to deal with those eventualities.  We must treat the public as rational, sensible adults and not as nervous children who need fairy tale assurances.  Life is not like that.  It is full of risk.</P>

Because of that, the treatment of this problem by the Opposition, certain people in the IFA leadership and the media is doing nothing to help this situation.  It is unbelievable.  The editorial of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 16 October and the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 20 October dealt with this in a serious way, analysing the problem sensibly.  The editorial of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 20 October has the headline &ldquo;Bluff Turns to Blunder&rdquo;.  The writer of that article should not play poker or advise anyone on how to deal with that problem.  I do not have time to quote from the article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this was a debating society in a university, the history lessons from Fianna Fáil would be a source of laughter from the audience.  No doubt we will hear of 26 March, September and October.  There has not yet been one sensible suggestion as to how one might force the Russians to take beef if they do not want to take it.  The Russians are sensible and well versed in science.  Their abbatoirs are top class.  They decided not to take beef from certain counties. Shakespeare told us long ago: &ldquo;There is nothing either good nor bad but thinking makes it so.&rdquo;  If the Russians decide they do not want beef from three countries and they are prepared to close the whole market it is serious.  It is nonsensical to suggest that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should have had all the counties of Ireland rejected.  What position would we be in now if we had no Russian market from 1 <Col N="1204" /> November?  Some of the discussion has been crazy.</P>
    <P>On the phrase &ldquo;a gun to his head&rdquo;, if I said: &ldquo;Most of the Opposition is talking through their hat&rdquo;, would there have to be a debate on whether they had hats on?  Using a metaphorical phrase does not merit the time the Opposition has spent analysing this nonsense.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy for the three counties left out because I agree with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that there is no scientific basis for banning them.  The beef from those counties is as safe as the beef from the other 23 counties and anyone in those three counties who thinks otherwise is a fool.  The same rules hold for the other counties but the issue was that the Russians would not buy beef from those three counties and were prepared to close the whole market.</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing sensible from the Opposition on what should be done.  If we had spent two days and three hours of private Members' time discussing what we could do about BSE and the danger to the beef industry we would have achieved something.  Most of the debate has been a waste of time and political point-scoring.  Despite the fact that some Opposition speakers said they would not score political points, they immediately attacked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. What would they have done in his position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing his time.  I did not intend to intervene but, listening to the debate, it was more than flesh and blood could stand.  This farce of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> keeping an eye on the Czar of Russia has been mentioned and the debate reminds me of that.</P>
      <P>It is like putting the large end of a telescope up to one's eye with the small end pointed at a distant country, making it a speck on the globe. This debate has been about magnifying one's own importance and minimising what one is looking at.  The performance of the Fianna Fáil party, from leader down, has been shameful.  The Fianna Fáil party and the IFA are using each other.  The end result is tremendous damage to the beef industry, agriculture and the consumers. The consumers are not fools.  The sooner we stop the nonsense in this House and deal with the situation the better.  Lives will be lost if angel dust is abused and we do not adhere to the strictest regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot tell customers what they should and should not do.  We cannot tell the Russian people they should buy from us if they have another idea in mind.  They could be wrong, but in this case the consumer is right.  As Deputy Browne said, to adopt a dog-in-the-manger attitude, as Fianna Fáil is doing, is wrong.  The Minister had to compromise &mdash; that is what negotiating is about. It is better to get nine tenths than to get nothing. That was the option.  There was nothing we could do.  We had no discretion in the matter.  The <Col N="1205" /> Minister did his best, and the sooner this debate is at an end, the better for all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to object again in the strongest terms to the agreement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to ban three counties, Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, from providing meat to Russia.  The previous speaker said that the debate should be conducted on the basis of scientific considerations.  However, I asked the Minister on two occasions the scientific basis on which he selected those three counties and he was unable to answer.  Such selection was unfair when there is no scientific evidence.  Three counties have been victimised but ten others have a higher incidence of BSE than Country Monaghan.  Five counties, Cavan, Monaghan, Mayo, Offaly and Wexford have had no outbreak between 1990 and 1996.</P>
      <P>I represent an area which is involved in intensive agriculture, producing poultry, pigs and cattle.  Cattle is produced intensively and Monaghan has maintained high standards of hygiene and husbandry.  Now it is being hammered by this ban.  Containers of poultry products go out every day from my village to the major supermarket chains in Britain.  My greatest fear is that this ban will mean that we are carrying a stigma, a tag on our shoulder, which will affect not just beef but poultry and pigs.</P>
      <P>The question of traceability of animal movements was raised.  I and others have been pressing for this for a considerable time.  Many years ago I recommended to Department officials and to Ministers that a stock register system similar to that operating in Northern Ireland be initiated.  At present traceability is poor in that a farmer in my area whose herd was tested last week could sell an animal in the west and there would no trace of that animal until another test was done in 12 months time.  That is a serious failure which needs to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>When TB was rampant in the Border region we had meetings with officials from the Department, with veterinary inspectors, etc.  We were told at that time that within two years computerisation of information relating to all animals would be in place.  Six years on we are still being told that this is on the way.  I am convinced that there have been delaying tactics.  According to what I heard at a meeting of a farm organisation recently, Deputy Joe Walsh brought in computerisation in Portlaoise when he was Minister but since then there has been a slackening off in the provision of money for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today a Fine Gael Deputy criticised me for saying on Tuesday that the Minister's action could haunt him.  What the Minister did amounted to partitioning an area of our country that is already partitioned.  The same Deputy's statements in support of the Minister could very well haunt him, because he was handed a script to read when he went out to RTE and he read it, which is a dangerous operation at any time.  I am <Col N="1206" /> critical because in the past few months the Minister has presided not alone over the BSE scare but also over the demise of the pig industry. I was also concerned to read a headline in a newspaper to the effect that the incidence of salmonella is up owing to imports of foreign junk poultry.</P>

North of a line from Dublin to Galway, there is no pig slaughtering.</P>

The Minister's selection of three counties, including Monaghan, has damaged the reputation of a county that has been so careful in the context of disease.  Monaghan poultry plants have the highest standard of hygiene and husbandry.  That has been proved.  What I contest is that we should be included in a ban which we do not deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the debate has centred around whether the BSE crisis is a technical or a political issue.  Strong cases have been made in support of both arguments but the truth lies somewhere between them.  There are technical aspects.  We are not getting much information in that regard &mdash; it has to be dragged out.  However, we know a certain amount about the political aspects.  Considerable time has elapsed since the issue came into the public domain and little has been done by the Government.  Most of those who look objectively at the problem have some sympathy for the Minister, Deputy Yates, and the choice that confronted him last week, wherever he was.  However, the reason the Minister is the subject of criticism is that he was faced with the choice at the last minute.  For several months he did little to ensure that he would not be put in such a position.  That, more than anything else, is a damning indictment of the Minister and those charged with responsibility for the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been slow to realise and accept that we must produce according to the wishes of the consumer and prevailing rules and regulations. We have been even slower to address the manner in which we might do that.  There are costs involved for farmers.  There are also costs involved in establishing a coherent policy.  That <Col N="1207" /> clearly has not happened and it has undermined public confidence.</P>
    <P>Everybody can understand the anger and frustration of the public representatives of the three counties affected.  They are representing the real fear and anger in their constituencies. However, the fallout from the decision to exclude those counties extends far beyond their borders; it extends to the heart of Irish beef production and the good name of Irish beef in general.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of confusion about what constitutes a Protocolumn There are so many versions and counter versions it is difficult to know what we have and do not have.  In that regard, I welcome the IFA's advertisement in the daily newspapers today.  The IFA in taking a leadership position on this issue is far ahead of those charged with political responsibility.  From the farmers' point of view that is welcome but it is worrying from the political point of view. Members of the House who have berated the IFA and Opposition Members for drawing attention to the crisis are mistaken.  They must realise that the consequences of a policy of concealment or denial are more damaging in the long-term than facing up to the truth in the short-term.  The difficulties the Minister will encounter later today are due to that fact.</P>
    <P>In some respects this issue has more to do with truth and trust than with BSE and beef.  That has implications for the Minister which he must face. It also has implications for the consumers' view of Irish beef and, in the long-term, for our ability to sell that product to consumers in this country and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton and others referred to an article which has drawn attention to a further possible link between BSE and CJD.  Simultaneously, other Members have said that Opposition politicians and the IFA should not draw attention to it.  Of course the article got publicity.  It received front page coverage in most newspapers because it was published in a learned journal. There was a suggestion in one of the newspapers that since a health element was involved the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, ought to become involved.  On the evidence of last week I strongly counsel against involving the Minister at any level.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Kemmy's contribution.  It was the opposite of what his party colleague, Deputy Upton, had said.  He obviously missed that contribution.  The Deputies' points were so strongly at variance that it is difficult to account for their coming from the same party.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the consensus approach urged by Labour Party backbenchers in today's newspapers.  However, I must contrast that with the Tánaiste's reference to &ldquo;your&rdquo; product when talking about Irish beef.  It is not &ldquo;your&rdquo; product, it is our product and it behoves the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and everybody who has an interest in Irish agriculture and its exports and in the Irish economy and people to regard it as our product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> As we gradually get more evidence of the Government's inaction we have more reason to be critical of the Tánaiste's inaction.  The balance within the Government has moved in favour of the left-wing parties and a strong anti-farmer bias was recently demonstrated by the Minister for Social Welfare, Prionsias De Rossa.  It is also apparent in the actions of the Tánaiste.  If he believes he suffered as a result of the beef tribunal and surrounding events he should not take it out on farmers and the beef industry.  If he handled the beef tribunal badly it is his own fault.</P>
    <P>There is much justified concern that the partial ban imposed by the Russians and accepted by the Minister and his Department will be reflected in other markets.  While the Minister assures us that it will not happen, his assurances do not have the same strength they might have had a week ago. Neither he nor the Government has given the issue priority during our Presidency of the EU.  It is not the only issue that has been neglected.  If the Government had been a little less concerned with being good Europeans and a little more attentive to national issues it would have served us better.  The Minister has committed himself to visiting Russia and Iran, but these urgently required visits are continually postponed.</P>
    <P>In the middle of this crisis we are threatened with a revaluation of the Irish green pound which will cost farmers £60 million.  Last weekend Mr. Robert Foster predicted that we face low beef prices for two years or longer.  Unless production in the EU drops dramatically and consumption increases even more dramatically major problems face the beef industry over the short and medium term.  These are the problems which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The singling out of three counties has rightly incensed farmers in those areas.  The beef industry is structured so that steers tend to be moved at least twice and sometimes more frequently in their lifetimes.  We have been told that animals from counties outside the three excluded counties which might be slaughtered in the nine plants in the excluded counties will be eligible for the Russian market.  It is difficult to see how that can be done.  Farmers are looking to the Minister and the Department for direction. They need to know what action they should take. Dr. Seamus Cross of Moorepark recently referred to the need for a major initiative to encourage young people into farming.  The way things are at present it will be difficult to tell young people that they ought to consider it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard referred to the pig industry and the axing of dairy hygiene grants and alternative enterprise grants.  There is a suggestion that the Government is considering imposing rates on farm buildings at a time when farmers are unable to contend with the difficulties already confronting them.  The economy's dependence on its beef exports and the number of jobs involved in farming and in the meat plants is of such magnitude that the Government should <Col N="1209" /> take this crisis more seriously.  It has let much time elapse during which little has been done.</P>
    <P>Much of the damage of recent days as a result of the Russian contract could have been avoided had the issues been faced up to sooner.  While the Minister may say that, metaphorically, a gun was put to his head, the reason was his inactivity and the failure of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to support him in ensuring these markets would continue to be open to the Irish product.  The ban on the three counties is bad news for the counties concerned but the admission at Government level will have implications which will be difficult to deal with in the short, medium and long-term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, on the magnificent work he did during his recent visit to Russia, on his successful efforts in convincing the Russian officials not to impose a blanket ban on our beef exports to that country and in persuading them to send a high level veterinary delegation to Ireland to find a solution to the problem.  It is vitally important for our beef industry to ensure we have a premium type product to offer to our customers throughout the world.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Yates, and the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, on their strategy and wisdom in protecting the export market for Irish beef and defending the interests of the overall sector and helping it overcome the serious effects of the BSE crisis.</P>
      <P>Listening to the hyped up hysteria of Opposition speakers during the past two weeks on the Adjournment, it is evident they are trying to gain short-lived kudos for their respective parties and showing no leadership in this serious crisis.  I remind some of the Opposition speakers who are highly critical of the Minister that this was a legacy which the Minister, Deputy Yates, inherited on becoming the occupant of that high office.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s when Fianna Fáil had the privilege of occupying the Agriculture, Food and Forestry ministry there were outbreaks of BSE and both Ministers involved did nothing to arrest the disease and nip it in the bud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made several representations during that time to the then Minister for Agriculture regarding a suspected outbreak in a herd in my constituency; I asked him to depopulate the herd but he sat idly by.  A ban was imposed by the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. O'Kennedy, in 1989 on the importation of meat and bonemeal for bovine feed.  If this had been a real ban rather than a cosmetic exercise the present crisis may never have occurred.  One can only describe that ban as a mickey mouse one.  During the Kennedy-Walsh <Col N="1210" /> era of 1989, 1990 and 1991 one week's work only was devoted to the outbreak of BSE.</P>
    <P>The statement in the House of Commons on 20 March set off a sequence of events which has impacted on every aspect of our beef industry. Why did the previous Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry not treat this matter in a serious fashion rather than imposing a mickey mouse ban on the importation of meat and bonemeal in 1989?  Why did the then Minister not take action to depopulate herds when outbreaks of BSE were notified to him in the late 1980s and early 1990s?  No action was taken on that occasion by the Ministers concerned to arrest the serious outbreak of BSE.  It is clear the Minister had only one option when the Russian veterinary team visited this country.  There was a choice between signing or not signing the Protocol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Either decision would have consequences.  It was a question of weighing the balance and making the right decision for the beef industry and that is what he did.  Had the agreement with the Russian veterinary team not been signed, a complete ban on imports of Irish beef into Russia would have been automatically imposed.  What would have been the outcome for the beef industry?  Iran would have followed suit and banned the importation of all our beef, so also would Libya, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and all other outlets to which we are exporting.  This is only a temporary ban and if there are no further outbreaks of BSE within the three counties the ban will be lifted automatically within three months.</P>
      <P>I do not have to outline to Opposition Deputies the serious consequences which would have been created if this deal had not been concluded with Russia.  We could have been cut off from our most important market to which we export almost 500,000 tonnes of beef per year.  There is a surplus of 1 million tonnes in Europe, so there are plenty of competitors to seize that market. The only alternative would be the safety net of intervention and producer prices would fall by 5p to 10p per pound.  What would be the reaction of the Opposition to that scenario?  By signing the Protocol the Minister has protected our position on the Russian market and in the other 80 outlets throughout the world.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Opposition Deputies to stop trying to score goals at the expense of our major export industry, the beef industry.  I urge them to put the country before their political play acting and act as responsible Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every statement that appears in the national press finds its way into the various embassies throughout the world.  Not one logical proposal has come from either the Fianna Fáil spokesman on agriculture or the leader of Fianna Fáil or any of his backbench or frontbench members that would enable the Minister, once and for all, to <Col N="1211" /> wipe out the BSE disease which is the scourge of the beef trade throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I attended a mart in Bandon in my constituency on Monday last.  Each farmer to whom I spoke was highly complimentary of the action the Minister was taking in trying to alleviate the serious problem of the continuing outbreaks of BSE.  All agreed every effort should be made by everyone concerned, from public representatives to members of local government, the farming bodies and the farmers themselves to ensure this disease is wiped out.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive package of over £70 million to assist farmers was paid out to them recently.  It may not cover all the losses but it will go a long way towards relieving the difficulties posed by the outbreak of BSE.  The only feeble suggestion offered by the Opposition was that we should threaten the Russians and seek to have their refunds cut.  The EU would not agree to such a proposal.  It would alleviate our customers and give an advantage to our competitors in the beef market.  This is the time for a cool approach to this major crisis which hangs over the beef industry.  Together we stand, divided we fall.  I call on the Opposition parties to row in behind the Government and the Minister to ensure he is in a strong position to negotiate with the senior Russian veterinary advisers to remove the ban from the three counties concerned as quickly as possible, thereby ensuring that nothing will frustrate his efforts in having this decision accepted by the Russian Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the IFA for having the wisdom to publish in the national newspapers a code of practice on quality assurance.  This will help restore credibility to the beef industry.  I also congratulate the ICMSA and the UFA for the way in which they have dealt with this serious issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate which is of importance to everyone, particularly farmers.  By keeping the issue in the headlines we have done more to harm the beef industry than was ever done by anyone, including the Russians, Libyans and Iranians.  The message given to consumers is that beef is dangerous and they should not buy it.  I specifically blame Fianna Fáil for keeping this issue in the headlines.  We would be up in arms if the Russians, Iranians or Libyans did to us what we are doing to ourselves.</P>
      <P>In 1990 the then Minister for Agriculture stated that meat and bonemeal should no longer be used.  This was like saying to a four year old child that he could take sweets from the jar in front of him.  The enforcement of this decision is long overdue but at least action is being taken.  It is a tragedy that this was not done previously as it has cost farmers a substantial amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Yates, has dealt with this matter head on.  The end result of signing the <Col N="1212" /> Protocol does not matter to me but the reality is that if it had not been signed the Iranians, Libyans, Saudi Arabians and Russians would not have taken any more of our beef.  One can imagine the consequences for the economy if we lost our export markets for beef and its impact on everyone, regardless of whether they live in a town, city or rural area.</P>
    <P>If we are united and serious about this issue then we can make a major impact on those markets.  However, we will not achieve this by fighting among ourselves and keeping the issue in the headlines.  One would think that Ireland was the only country which exported beef.  New Zealand, Australia and France also export beef and they are ready to move into our markets.  If we do not do an effective job in an organised way the public and, in particular, farmers will pay a high price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of which party we support or where we come from, we have a common interest in ensuring that beef exports to Russia are handled in the best possible way.  We all know there was no scientific basis for this regional ban and that it was wrong, but it was the decision of the Russians, the consumers.  The question which arises is whether the Minister, Deputy Yates, could have secured a better deal and retained the entire Russian contract without the imposition of these restraints.  Fianna Fáil states, predictably, that it would have been possible to secure a better deal, but it is secure in the knowledge that this cannot be proven one way or the other.  All the indications are that the Minister secured the best possible deal.</P>
      <P>There have been many references to the great deal Fianna Fáil secured with North Africa.  If I recall correctly, all Fianna Fáil Deputies came back from North Africa with were shoes full of sand.  Having considered all the advice available to him, the Minister made the correct decision. He did not want to take this decision but it has now been accepted by farmers as the right one. As Deputy Sheehan correctly said, there has been a change in the mood among farmers.  The Minister weighed up all the options and agreed this deal which is in the best interest of farmers and the nation as a whole.  He has safeguarded the export of 120,000 tonnes of beef to Russia each year.  This is equivalent to 350,000 cattle.  If he had not secured this deal the position at marts today would be very different and Fianna Fáil would be shouting the opposite of what it is now shouting.  The Minister has obviously made the correct decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter called for a low profile reaction &mdash; take what is on offer, get on with the job and ensure all the necessary stringent regulations are imposed to keep herds disease free.  The row about the deal has done infinitely more damage to the beef industry than the ban.  This row is being fed and fanned and kept in the world headlines by the Opposition.  It is important to <Col N="1213" /> remember that it is consumers who make the final decision on whether our beef is bought.</P>
    <P>The ban on the export of cattle from counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan was unfair and there was no scientific basis for it.  This unpalatable deal was accepted by the Minister in the national interest and in the interest of farmers.  Apart from the Opposition, this deal is now accepted by everyone as the best possible one.  Fianna Fáil is engaging in opportunistic politics with this issue.  While this is its function, this is no ordinary issue.  The Opposition also has an obligation in so far as the beef industry is concerned and it should reconsider its actions which are creating major difficulties for the industry on an international level.  I hope the ban will be temporary and I have every confidence that the Minister will renegotiate it in three months so that counties Tipperary, Cork and Monaghan are rightly restored.</P>

      <P>This is our third opportunity in recent weeks to debate the beef industry, during which the crisis has got worse.</P>
      <P>A British programme last night broadcast something as fact when it was not a fact.  This is frightening and does untold damage to consumer confidence and the marketplace.  The price for beef has dropped.  In January it was approximately 225p to 230p per kilo while now it is about 180p, which represents a significant drop for those involved.  Despite that drop in income, headage payments due have not been paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Premium payments made last year in October have not been paid this year.  This is a source of major problems because this is the time of year when many farmers have to pay bills accumulated for rented land and other commitments regarding procurement of fodder and feed for the winter.  I appeal to the Minister to arrange those payments immediately.  They are processed and await the pressing of the button of a computer.  When I ring the local office in Sligo I am told the payments have been processed since last September and have not been paid.  This is hard to explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the importance of the Russian market.  However, it is a volatile market for a number of reasons.  The situation should have been resolved long before the Minister says a gun was put to his head.  The veterinary personnel should have taken their instructions from the Minister.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan said yesterday this problem had arisen six weeks ago and he had to <Col N="1214" /> use influence to persuade a Deputy Prime Minister to continue the trade.  That is when the first warning bell rang and something should have been done.  Last week it was Hobson's choice as to whether it was a three county ban or a total ban and the Minister did not have a bargaining position.</P>
    <P>We were in that position last week because we lost the Libyan and Iranian markets and a question mark hung over some of our other Middle Eastern markets.  What was done by the Minister or the Department to try to get those markets reopened?  Will the Minister outline the efforts he and his Department made regarding the reopening of the Libyan or the Iranian markets?  They were two of our main third country markets.  I gather he went to Libya on the understanding the Libyans would sign a contract but he returned and said they were not prepared and would do nothing until November.  The day after the Minister left Libya they signed a contract for 50,000 head of cattle from Australia.</P>
    <P>An Iranian veterinary delegation visited Ireland a couple of weeks ago.  I hope the Protocol to be agreed with Iran will not exclude certain counties and we will be in a position to certify the health status of the cattle to fill contracts there.  I know the Minister wishes this approach to be taken.  It is important that the departmental veterinary people take the same attitude, and be prepared to certify the animals from herds which have had no contact with BSE. That is what is being proposed in another part of this island at the moment as a way of getting back into international trading.  The Minister gave this his support in Belfast recently when he said he was prepared to support a traceability policy.  In that context we need to deal with the use of illegal growth promoters.  I am glad the courts have decided to take positive action on the issue, which affects consumer confidence.  If someone in Iran, Russia or Ireland feels his health is under threat, he will not eat meat.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Minister arrange subsidy payments due to farmers to help them weather the crisis.  All the necessary processing has been done and claims have been with the Department for payment for the past two months. The Minister made a submission to Brussels regarding headage payments.  In view of the present crisis, I ask him to withdraw that.  If he does not, he will force 50 per cent of the population of the west of Ireland out of farming because these payments constitute their entire income.  If the exclusions proposed regarding age etc. are implemented, they will suffer seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for giving me an opportunity to speak on this important topic. We are experiencing one of the worst crises ever in our largest industry.  It is out of control and unfortunately the Minister is not exerting any positive response.  He is merely reacting to the action of others, who are dictating the agenda as far as BSE and the future well-being of the beef <Col N="1215" /> industry is concerned.  Capitulating to the Russians and allowing them to ban beef from three of our counties was a monumental error and has had a devastating impact on the perception of the beef industry.  Like politics, marketing or selling is perception business.</P>
      <P>We have tacitly admitted we have a BSE problem.  We are saying to the Russians and our other valued customers that there is a BSE problem in our national herd. Eradicating that perception from the minds of customers will take a long time.  The beef industry is low margin, capital intensive and is not well structured at primary production level. It is the largest industry within agriculture.  It should have been restructured at primary production level, in addition to making the fundamental structural changes needed at the processing end.  Because of the interdependence between farmers who produce calves, those who produce stores and those who produce finishers, there will be many casualties in the next six months.  Is there light at the end of the tunnel for those who want to remain in the industry?  What decisive action is being taken to resolve this crisis?</P>
      <P>Members of the Opposition and the Minister have accepted the need for a quality assurance scheme for our beef.  Figures of £9 million and £14 million have been mentioned as the cost for introducing such a scheme.  There must be a traceability system and customers, Irish, Russian or Iranian, should be assured of the quality of our produce.  We need a fully integrated computerised animal identity system.  When will such a scheme be introduced?  Do other parties around the Cabinet table not want funding provided for this urgent scheme?  Last Sunday in our newspapers and on the radio we had a parade of typical Democratic Left prejudice when the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, trotted out plenty of anti-farmer bias.  If a member of the Cabinet can publicly berate members of one of our industries in such a manner, what type of judgment does he bring to bear on decisions about our crisis-ridden beef industry?  Is he prepared to row in behind the Minister's proposal to introduce a quality assurance scheme?  I doubt it.  Are members of the Labour Party prepared to support it?  How soon does the Minister think he can introduce such a scheme?  It is only one of the measures &mdash; but an important one &mdash; that must be introduced to restore confidence and stability in the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Government backbenchers berated spokespersons and backbenchers on this side of the House and claimed we had talked up this crisis.  However, we have stumbled and staggered from one crisis to another and we have lost control.  Our economy may be booming in particular sectors, such as services, but some people attribute the stagnant employment level in manufacturing to the difficulties in the beef <Col N="1216" /> industry.  We cannot afford to lose our biggest industry, which exports an estimated 75 per cent or 80 per cent of its produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as stating that he foresees the day when the numbers in full-time employment in the agricultural industry will steadily or dramatically decrease and that there will be approximately 60,000 full time farmers by the year 2006.  That would be a significant decrease on current figures, but if this crisis is not resolved there will be an accelerated exit from our largest industry.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to introduce a quality assurance scheme so that consumers can be assured about the quality of Irish meat.  Our customers abroad must know that we have the best beef in Europe.  We have been sinned against in this débâcle.  There are other sinners in the arena but because of the export oriented nature of the industry we have been taking the rap.  We must confront the matter and resolve the crisis. Let us adopt a more proactive approach to the crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecelia Keaveney Cecelia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecelia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for giving me an opportunity to express my condemnation of the Minister's decision to agree a ban on the export of beef to Russia from Counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.  His mishandling of the issue is admirable only in its consistency from 20 March.  With the Irish Presidency has come a greater sense of helplessness in the agricultural domain.  At the outset there was a call to open up third country markets, to restore consumer confidence and to set up a system of traceability.  While the compensation in June was welcome, it was insufficient and did not go to those most in need. In July there were proposals to introduce culls, from which Britain opted out.  We were encouraged to kill our calves, healthy young examples of prime Irish beef and part of the quality Irish grass-based breed that other countries envy.  Those calves would go into intervention, discarded as relatively unimportant. Whatever about killing off the older members of the cattle herd and thereby reducing production and intervention levels, we should not take young calves out of the system when farmers rely on them for premia and jobs.</P>
      <P>Funding from a 7 per cent reduction in the area aid scheme is also unacceptable.  Why rob Peter to pay Paul?  How can we ask for increased production while taking away our source of support?  That is a dangerous precedent.  What has been done about a traceability system?  Is operation matador on or off?  As a Border Deputy I see both scenarios.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What assistance has the Department of Justice provided to make our units mobile?  What assistance has the Department of Health provided to outline the lack of conclusive scientific evidence to link CJD and BSE or to promote our healthy product?  What assistance has the Department of Enterprise and <Col N="1217" /> Employment provided to secure the jobs of the 9,000 PAYE workers in the meat sector?  While people abroad considered the North and the South one country in terms of beef, they can no longer do so because of the three county border. That was a dangerous precedent to set.  We will not have any recourse if other countries want to jump on the bandwagon and ban exports from other counties.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that there has not been any real intervention from the Taoiseach or Tánaiste in this matter and there are only promises of a computer system.  I want the Government to make political and diplomatic representations at the highest level and to introduce a quality assurance scheme so that we can save thousands of jobs.</P>

      <P>While we all realise this is a serious problem, if any of the parties in Opposition were in power we would be dealing with a crisis.  They made it clear that had they been in power they would not have had negotiations with the Russians and would not have signed an agreement.  In that case every Deputy would be in my situation; representing a county that had been excluded from exporting beef to Russia.  Yet, every Opposition Deputy will now try to conclude that the logical decision was to turn away a contract for 100,000 tonnes of beef and see cattle prices drop by £50 a head.  That is the Opposition's solution to the negotiations with the Russians.</P>
      <P>Many Opposition contributions in the House today, including one by a Deputy from my own constituency, consisted of volume but no commonsense.  There was hysteria but no logic, criticism but no solutions.  The Opposition told butchers how sympathetic they were.  They are bleeding the crisis for political gain but doing nothing for beef farmers.</P>
      <P>The same scene occurred last week when we discussed the serious issue of hepatitis C.  Once the Opposition thought they had an opportunity to get a political victim, the welfare of the victims of the scandal took second place.</P>
      <P>In this case we should concentrate on three priorities.  We should try to protect what we have of the Russian market as well as our other markets.  In parallel we should try to get the ban on the three counties lifted and to get rid of BSE, although no one has concentrated on that in this House.  From some of the contributions made in the House, one would think we did not have a problem and the disease was not in our herds.  We boast that the incidence of BSE is not high but we have it, so we should take immediate measures to control it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken firm and positive action in putting forward proposals to prevent BSE.  If we do not control the outbreak of the disease we will not be talking about a ban on three counties but on every county, in addition to other markets following the Russian line.  It is crucial to <Col N="1218" /> concentrate on that message not only here but in farming.  People have sabotaged the industry through their own decisions.  We must send out a signal to them that every step they take is detrimental to the industry.</P>
    <P>I have already told the Minister, Deputy Yates, and the Russian Ambassador, that South Tipperary has a genuine grievance.  There has been no case of BSE in the constituency yet as part of County Tipperary we are included in the ban.  Efforts are being made in Moscow to try to get the ban on South Tipperary lifted immediately.  It should be said in this House, as it has been said to the farming organisations, that this is a crisis we must approach in partnership for the benefit of the beef industry.</P>

      <P>By any standards there has been a full and thorough debate on this issue and on the background and circumstances leading to the signing of this veterinary Protocol.

I stand over the version of events I have given to this House both in the statement I made last week and in the Private Members' Motion this week. They are accurate and true.</P>
      <P>As I explained on many occasions on this visit the discussions were of a technical nature.  I have laboured this point consistently and indeed the main criticism from the other side of the House was that there was not sufficient political intervention.  I indicated that I met Mr. Avilov and his delegation during the visit.  I did not take part in the technical discussions and I am quite adamant that I did not give, any indication to that effect.  It has traditionally been the case that veterinary Protocols are discussed at the appropriate technical and official level and are signed by officials, usually at chief veterinary officer level.  This has always been the case and there are numerous veterinary Protocols in my Department going back over a number of years which have been signed on this basis.</P>
      <P>I also indicated to this House that I monitored the situation on a continuous basis and the officials consulted me each step along the way. The decision to sign the Protocol was taken by me in circumstances where I was fully convinced there was no alternative other than a total and immediate ban on Irish beef going to Russia.</P>

These officials signed as authorised officers and with my authority and agreement.  The Russian officials were aware this was the case.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks on this issue last Thursday, Deputy Cowen indicated he was holding me politically responsible for this issue and I have accepted that political responsibility.  I have not tried to hide behind officials who signed on the basis of authority vested in them.  The two Deputies who have been most vocal on this issue have ministerial experience and surely know the procedures on issues like this.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of the circumstances under which this Protocol was signed.  The most important issue is that the Protocol was signed, as well as the content of that Protocol which allows the continued export of our beef to Russia.  I took the right decision and I have accepted responsibility for it.  I have defended it and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>There has been reference to a comment which I made on the &ldquo;Politics Programme&rdquo; last Saturday which was brought to my attention last evening. I accept that I made that comment which was one of many comments in many interviews.  It is one comment in what has been a two week debate on the matter.  If I have created a misleading impression I apologise for that.  I regret also that in a comment in the House yesterday, I may have unwittingly mislead Deputies on this subject.  I had simply forgotten that I had used the sentence. What I meant was that I effected the deal, agreed to it, took responsibility for it and authorised it.</P>
      <P>The public and the agricultural sector are interested in the impact of the agreement.  I monitored these discussions closely and nothing was agreed without my approval.  The impact of this Protocol is that it will facilitate our continued presence in our largest third country outlet for beef; a market with vast potential.  It prevents us from falling into safety net intervention or from becoming completely dependent on intervention. It prevents cattle prices from falling by 5p per pound.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been held with the Russian authorities and with the meat trade about the implementation of this Protocol.  The details are such that it can be done in a way which prevents disruption and avoids any necessity for a regionalised price.  I have already indicated that this Protocol has not created a precedent, it has not caused any of our customers to come forward and seek a similar arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complexity of the BSE issue has been manifested by the latest research findings which were published in Britain yesterday.  While the findings are undoubtedly interesting and important, they are not entirely startling.  Once the possibility of a link, however tenuous, between BSE and CJD had been raised it was factored into our control system.  Therefore, no <Col N="1220" /> new additional control measures are necessary to deal with the consequences of this research.</P>
    <P>Considerable research is taking place into BSE and related conditions.  This is good but we have to recognise that the consequence of such research is that new information and findings will continue to come forward.  I cannot emphasise enough the need to have water-tight controls in regard to BSE and I believe this to be the case. Neither can I emphasise enough the fact that we have to be prepared to provide assurances in a public health context and to deal with the genuinely held concerns of our third country customers.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the concerns I have as regards problems caused by the use of meat and bonemeal in feed.  To address these problems I have already introduced a series of additional controls dealing with both mammalian meat and bone meal and animal feeds containing such meal.  The new arrangements which apply from 17 October last, provide for extended controls at various levels, including the manufacturing, retail and farm stages.  At manufacturing level, a special licence is required for the manufacture of meat and bone meal as well as for the manufacture of feeding stuffs containing meat and bonemeal intended for feeding to non-ruminant animals or poultry.</P>
    <P>There are also strict controls on the possession of meat and bone meal at feed manufacturing premises and mills producing feed for ruminants will not be permitted to have animal feed containing meat and bone meal on their premises except in packages for retail purposes.  A licence is also required to purchase any such meat and bonemeal with the exception of packages of less than 5 kilogrammes which are intended for uses other than feeding to animals or poultry. Labelling requirements for such packages are to be introduced with effect from 1 January 1997.  It will also be an offence to sell meat and bonemeal to any person who does not hold a licence unless it falls within the above exception.</P>
    <P>Stricter controls have also been introduced at farm level.  It is an offence to feed a ruminant animal any animal feed which is intended for non-ruminant animals or poultry.  Farmers who have cattle or sheep will require a special licence to have on their land any meat and bonemeal or animal feed in which meat and bonemeal has been incorporated.  I have also introduced strict rules on the storage and transport of meat and bonemeal products.  Those who store or transport meat and bonemeal, or any animal feed containing meat and bonemeal have been put under strict obligation to ensure that these products do not contaminate any other product stored or transported.  The granting of licences will be subject, in all cases, to requirements as regards the keeping of records which will enable the location and distribution of meat and bonemeal to be fully verified at all times. Conditions will also be attached to such licences to ensure proper controls on meat and bonemeal. <Col N="1221" /> Additional powers to enforce the terms of the Order have also been given to officials of the Department and gardaí.</P>
    <P>I intend to make it an absolute priority that there will be strict compliance with the new controls.  To this end, the special investigation unit of my Department will be expanded to oversee implementation.</P>
    <P>I have also been considering how labelling requirements can provide better information to farmers and others and to remove any doubts about the position as regards the use of meat and bonemeal.  The House will be aware that current labelling requirements provide that compound feedingstuffs may not be marketed unless the packaging, the container or the label show all the ingredients used in the feed in descending order by weight.  Alternatively compounders have the option of declaring categories of ingredients. These requirements follow the provision of community legislation.  In Ireland most compounders have exercised the option of declaring categories of ingredients.</P>
    <P>Having carefully reflected on the position and in the BSE context, it is very desirable that additional information should be included on packages and containers which contain meat and bonemeal and-or feedingstuffs which include this product.  In particular, I consider that such packages and containers should be clearly labelled to this effect and should also contain a notice that it must not be fed to ruminants. Accordingly, I propose to introduce legislation to require that, where appropriate, packages or containers must include declarations to the effect that they contain mammalian meat and bonemeal and that the feeding of that product to cattle, sheep and other ruminants is prohibited.  The precise detail of the declaration to be included will be set out in a statutory instrument which I intend to adopt as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There have been more than enough recriminations about this matter, to little avail.  It is time to move on.  The same market which existed in Russia prior to signing the Protocol is still there.  Our beef trade wants to supply that market and has carved out a dominant position for itself over the past two years.  Are we to throw all that away?  I have not heard any argument from the other side of the House which leads me to believe that I took anything other than the right decision.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have an hour of questions and answers on this matter after Question Time.  I wish to make a few comments on points my officials told me were made in today's debate. Work has been continuing intensively in my Department on the issue of an animal location file and traceability.  I intend to have consultations with all interest groups and to put such a system in place as soon as possible.  I have received a positive indication from the Department of Finance as to the receptiveness of such a proposal.  The main problem is the logistics <Col N="1222" /> of putting the necessary computerised technology together, but that is well in hand.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a political point.  The difficulties concerning the trade in Russia and other areas arises from the increased incidence of BSE here. I note that when I defend myself by pointing out that reality Fianna Fáil, in particular, has accused me of hyping the disease.  It is a matter of &ldquo;tails I lose&rdquo; and heads &ldquo;that party wins&rdquo; in that if I try to sweep the incidence of BSE under the carpet it will raise points about my complacency and state that Government inaction is responsible for the difficulty in the markets.  Leaving aside the link between BSE and CJD, the truth is that if incidence of 16 cases last year had fallen, the high age profile had continued and cattle born after January 1990 when the ban was introduced on meat and bonemeal were not affected, we would not have any problems.  I assure Deputies that I have no interest in hyping this issue or adding to the vulnerability of the beef market, but the number of cases of BSE is still a significant problem.  I hope people will understand that is the problem.</P>
    <P>I want to be unequivocal about the other matter.  I wish to apologise if, for whatever reason, people genuinely feel I misled them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and I have approved a proposal by the ESB to lease a part of Moneypoint, involving approximately one third of the value of Moneypoint, to US investors who will then lease it back again to the ESB for rental paid over a period of about 21 years.  A benefit arises under the transaction because it allows the US investors to defer their tax liabilities.  After transaction fees and expenses, the net gain will be about $50 million of which the ESB will receive the lion's share of $32 million or £20 million.  This represents a positive benefit for Irish electricity consumers.  The transaction does not involve any change of ownership of Moneypoint or impact on its operation or use by the ESB.</P>
      <P>State power and rail utilities in several other EU countries including the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, France and Belgium along with Switzerland and Australia have concluded such transactions.  The total value of such deals amounted to US$3.3 billion in 1994 and US$8.2 billion in 1995.</P>
      <P>The benefit to electricity consumers will come about from the up-front £20 million cash realised by the ESB resulting in lower borrowings and consequential interest savings of between £1 million and £2 million per year by the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transaction is a recognised form of financial engineering of a kind transacted on a regular basis in the main international financial <Col N="1225" /> markets both in Ireland, Europe, the US and elsewhere.  The transaction is clearly permitted by US taxation regulations and forms part of overall US taxation policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated, the proposal involves the ESB leasing one third of Moneypoint to a US trust for £250 billion and then subleasing it back.  The US trust receives a tax break under US laws, which is legitimate, and the ESB's share of the benefit is £20 million which represents a positive benefit for electricity consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a US trust.  I am not privy to its membership, which is a matter for the ESB.

I look forward to the benefits of this deal accruing to the ESB and particularly to the consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">

      <P>This is the first time this has ever happened in the State.  Moneypoint is our largest power station so it is an extremely important issue for all semi-State companies.  The Minister has still not given us the name of the consortium.  Will he publish the agreement so we can examine the small print?  Does colluding with trusts and other concerns to avail of what seems to be a United States tax loophole raise ethical questions for the Government?  I presume the Labour Party supports helping other Administrations to avail of tax loopholes.  Has the Minister discussed this ethical aspect with the United States Administration?</P>

      <P>The agreement is already in the public domain and has been referred to in several articles.  I have no difficulty providing the Deputy <Col N="1226" /> with the details of the agreement.  It is a matter for the ESB as it has already been approved by its board.  The agreement is freely available and the Deputy or the public should have no difficulty getting access to it.  This proposal is permitted by US tax regulations and forms a part of overall US taxation policies.  It complies with US tax regulations.  Furthermore, such transactions are being concluded by large companies and State owned utilities across the world.  Such deals are well known to the US authorities.  State power and rail utilities in several other European countries, including the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, France and Belgium, along with Switzerland and Australia, have concluded such transactions.  I have already given the Deputy the moneys involved in those transactions.  This arrangement is common practice and complies with both Irish and US taxation law and regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have repeatedly stated the Government's commitment to the phased implementation of the core light rail network recommended by DTI, serving Ballymun, Cabinteely and Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> Last week I reached a very satisfactory agreement with the EU Commissioner for Regional Policy, Monika Wulf-Mathies, which clears the way at EU level for the construction of the Tallaght to Dundrum route as the first phase. Planning and design of the Ballymun to city centre route will be brought forward and will proceed in parallel with the construction of the Tallaght to Dundrum route.  I am committed to the construction of the Ballymun route as soon as possible and at latest immediately after the completion of the Tallaght to Dundrum route. The Commissioner expressed a willingness to co-finance the design and planning work on the Ballymun line within the current Community Support Framework envelope and also indicated that the Commission would be favourably disposed to co-finance its construction should the Structural Fund situation for Ireland post-1999 make this possible.</P>
    <P>I have asked the CIE project team, in the course of the design and planning work on the Ballymun line, to investigate possible alternative alignment options which would take account of the wider needs of the north Dublin area and also to consider an extension to Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>DTI also recommended that a conventional rail link, but not necessarily a DART type system, from Dublin Airport to the Dublin-Belfast railway line should be evaluated as a longer term option.  This proposal is under consideration as part of the Government's ongoing commitment to the implementation of the DTI strategy.</P>
    <P>As part of the public consultation process for the Tallaght to Dundrun line, the CIE project team examined and costed the underground option.  They have already published their findings which among other issues identified the additional cost for underground as being in the range from £124 million to £300 million depending on the length of the tunnelled section. These findings, together with the work that was done for the DTI, confirm that the strategic and cost advantages that arise from an on-street light rail system make this the better option for Dublin.  On-street is what the public have indicated they want.  It can best meet the needs of this city and is the only realistic option. Underground is less accessible, less attractive and less safe, and would cost more to build and operate.  The Government is committed to providing an on-street system and has asked CIE to concentrate its efforts on putting forward a proposal on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that it will cost between £124 million and £300 million for an underground system in the city centre.  Is that figure given by CIE's consultants or is it an independent figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure arises from work conducted by professionals and specialists in the <Col N="1228" /> area of public transport, consultants who were appointed to conduct the evaluation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Deputy is so out of touch.  This information is in the public arena. The report has been published and is available.  I suggest that the Deputy contact the CIE project team who will make a copy available to him.  He will see from the report that a detailed analysis was conducted of the pros and cons of light rail and underground systems.  The DTI &mdash; this goes back to the time the Deputy had responsibility for this area &mdash; conducted widescale negotiations with relevant State agencies, public bodies and all those involved in public transport in the city, and they were firmly in favour of an on-street light rail system.  They catalogued several reasons such a system would be the best option for Dublin. The consultants operating on behalf of the CIE project team were also strongly in favour of an on-street light rail system for the reasons outlined in the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House is fully supportive of the light rail proposal involving three lines, to Sandyford, Tallaght and Ballymun. I appreciate that he is studying the airport route, for which he has my support.  I take the Minister's advice that I should do my homework but perhaps he could help me.  He outlined the minimum figure of £124 million for an underground system in the city centre.  If it is practicable and financially possible to build such a system in the city centre, that should be done rather than taking away half of St. Stephen's Green, Dawson Street and the city centre generally.  How authoritative is the cost of £124 million to £300 million?  If this information is in the report I apologise that I do not know it but perhaps the Minister will tell me the name of the consultants and whether they are independent of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say £124 million; I said between £124 million and £300 million, depending on the extent of tunnelling required. The evaluation was conducted by consultants who have expertise at European level in designing, planning and costing such schemes. Those consultants were employed by CIE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been put on the record many times.  The Deputy's statement on the city centre contradicts previous statements made by him in respect of light rail, which is nothing new.  He put <Col N="1229" /> down two key questions today asking when the line is to be extended and it is not being extended to Sandyford.  He is now asking why it is not proposed to tunnel the city centre.  Those questions would qualify for a nomination, possibly the Harry Houdini hypocrisy award.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy was suggesting that passengers should buy tickets for light rail and that he will meet them at the canal and offer them boots for the remainder of the trek into the city centre.  That is effectively what he said.  He suggested that a light rail system be built without a bridge, that passengers would be dropped at the canal and would have to make their own way into the city.  That is the kind of policy the Deputy is advocating on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  It is hypocritical and full of contradictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to confirm what we have heard today.  The consultants who came up with the figure for an underground system in the city centre were appointed by CIE, but since CIE is committed to an overground system the report is not totally independent.  I ask the Minister to give independent figures for an underground system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I said for the benefit of the Deputy who was obviously not listening.  The Deputy and his party were involved in the DTI process at corporation, county council and Oireachtas levels.  That was the most extensive consultative process on public transport ever undertaken in the history of the State.  The DTI favours an on-street light rail system and in its findings it gives numerous reasons that is the best option.  The Deputy should not make disparaging comments about consultants of international repute, who value their reputation and are held in the highest regard in the public service sector throughout the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>All requirements arising in relation to EU directives currently in force in the public transport area are being met.  The most recent of these, and one of the most important directives in the public transport area in many years, is EU Directive 91/440 on the development of the Union's railways.  The railways share of the passenger and freight transport market throughout Europe has been in decline for many years.  EU Directive 91/440 was a first step towards arresting and reversing that decline.  It also marked a first step toward a liberalised single market for rail services in the European Union.</P>
      <P>Transposition into Irish law was completed with the making of the appropriate regulations under statutory instrument 204 of 1996.  These regulations gave formal and positive legal force to the access provisions contained in the directive. Those provisions give railway companies throughout the European Union specific rights of access to the networks of other member states, albeit under restrictive conditions.  The other requirements of the directive, including management independence and greater commercial freedom for railways, were implemented in Ireland under the Transport (Reorganisation of Coras Iompair Éireann Act, 1986.</P>
      <P>Two further directives in this area which clarify the conditions under which access to railway infrastructure must be granted have yet to come into force.  I am anxious to ensure that these directives are speedily given effect in Irish law. The mechanics of their transposal is being examined in my Department, in consultation with the office of the Attorney General.  Once that examination has been concluded, I intend to proceed as quickly as possible with the transposal.</P>

The extent to which competition is allowed in this sector under the directives is being fully examined and explored.  I look forward to receiving his proposals at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The declared aim of the European Commission is to press ahead with liberalisation in the bus sector.  Member states, including Ireland, have insisted on a cautious step by step approach which is carefully managed.  There are proposals before the Council of Transport Ministers to provide for limited liberalisation in two specific areas, the international carriage of passengers by bus and coach and cabotage in the course an international bus journey.  As the Deputy is aware, cabotage means that a foreign operator on a journey from another member state can pick up and set down Irish passengers in Ireland.  This has implications for the domestic bus sector.</P>
      <P>It is clear from repeated statements by the European Commission that we are embarked on a gradual process of liberalisation in the public transport sector throughout Europe.  Member states will, to some extent, be able to set the pace. With the adoption and transposal of existing directives, market forces and competition will play a far greater role than they have up to now. It is up to CIE in particular to place itself in a position where it will be able to respond to this development.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the current direction of transport policy; the agenda he has set for CIE; and the discussions, if any, he has had recently with the management and chairman of the company.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I came into office CIE was experiencing serious difficulties.  It was not facing up to the reality of competition and to the need to adopt a more commercial approach.  It was poorly managed and providing an inadequate service to its customers.  I took immediate action by instituting a series of top management changes which saw the appointment of a new chief executive and new function heads in the major areas of finance, programme and projects, human resources and marketing.</P>
      <P>When I announced my proposals to restructure the top management, I clearly outlined the Government's mandate to the company, which placed the emphasis on a much more commercially-driven and customer-focused CIE, delivering quality services at competitive prices.</P>
      <P>In the period 1994-99 an investment of over £600 million from European Union and national sources is being made by CIE in its infrastructure and services.  This investment programme will significantly enhance the group's ability to offer attractive, efficient and cost-effective services.  To ensure that the full benefits of these investments are realised, the group must identify and address its weaknesses and make the transition to a new culture of service delivery to survive in the more competitive environment that is already emerging.  The public service contracts regime which I propose to introduce in respect of socially necessary, non-commercial services will facilitate that transition by emphasising transparency, accountability and performance.</P>
      <P>A key requirement at this stage is the reduction of the undoubted imbalance that exists between the group's costs and revenues.  As Deputies are aware, the managements of the three companies have developed cost containment plans aimed at ensuring the viability of the companies through reduced costs and increased efficiency.</P>
      <P>I have been in constant contact with the chairman of CIE and have had several discussions with him this month to keep myself informed of developments in the group, especially those related to the implementation of the cost containment plans.  I have made it clear that the cost reduction issue must be negotiated by unions and management on a basis of partnership.  They have a common interest in developing realistic and workable plans to promote the competitiveness of the company to enable it survive and prosper in the new competitive operational environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, on behalf of the taxpayer, has given CIE a mandate to deliver the quality products the consumer is demanding.  This mandate will ensure that the CIE group of companies will be fit to compete in the commercial climate that will ensue from European Union deregulation and internal competition from Irish operators.  To fulfil this mandate the board of CIE has examined the cash flow requirements of each of the constituent companies and has requested the chief executives of each company to achieve the necessary savings. The management of the CIE group of companies is publicly committed to managing change in line with the ICTU policy document on that subject. The accounts of each group of companies have been opened up to the trade unions involved and discussed in detail with them at the highest level. A joint working group was established in 1995 and is currently planning change which will give staff, through their trade unions, a greater say than ever before in policy making and strategic planning.</P>

      <P>Last week the leader of Fianna Fáil attacked the semi-State companies.  The members of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench are hypocritical mourners bringing flowers to the funeral of someone they had ignored and neglected.  The people now in Opposition starved CIE of money and leadership.  Through their neglect they forced CIE to remain in the slate and pencil era while in the real world new technology was becoming essential to business management and development.  We have identified the problems at CIE.  The management and the unions in CIE, working together in a spirit of co-operation, can overcome the difficulties they face.  There is no room for an adversarial confrontational approach between the management and the unions.  I want them to sit down together, address the problems and negotiate a future for the company and its employees.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from the unions through various sources including public representatives.  Their concerns have been brought to my attention.  I have brought those concerns in the appropriate way to the attention of the chairman and chief executive of the company with whom I have had extensive discussions, particularly the chairman, in recent times.  I have told the company there is only one way forward.  It has identified the extent of the problem and realises that its cost base must be reduced if it is to compete in a competitive environment and that it must not lose more business and have its revenue base eroded further.  The company must plan for the future but that plan involves rationalisation and sacrifice and it can only be concluded when all procedures have been complied with.  There is a raft of procedures and support systems available to both the management and the unions which will act as a basis for the negotiations to commence and conclude successfully.  As I stated clearly on a number of occasions, and I am happy the management agrees with my view, this process can only be brought to a successful conclusion if it is approached in a spirit of partnership.  There must be co-operation between management rather than an adversarial approach.  There is no room for confrontational tactics by management or unions in concluding this issue.</P>

      <P>The chairman received instructions to prepare CIE and make whatever changes were necessary to prepare the company for the inevitable liberalisation of the market, which means competition which the company has not had to confront before.  That is his first and principal task.  His second task is to ensure that we get value for the £100 million the taxpayers are putting into CIE.  The third thing I asked him to do, something Deputy Brennan neglected to do, was to ensure that the consumers get a better deal, a quality service at the lowest possible price.</P>

I am sure the term &ldquo;democratise&rdquo; is just a fancy name for privatisation.  The Deputy should go back to the manual which is Fianna Fáil's gospel for the semi-State companies and put a meaning on &ldquo;democratise&rdquo;.  Then they will know where they are going.</P>

      <P>The new management in CIE which I put in place last year, operating to the clear mandate which I gave them, took a genuinely realistic approach to the CIE Group's financial situation, based on hard facts which previous management had chosen to ignore.  As a result, we got the full picture of CIE's financial situation, warts and all, in the 1995 annual report and accounts.</P>
      <P>The accounting methods used by the company in framing the 1995 accounts were approved by the board of CIE and its auditors.  I understand that the financial statements of CIE for 1995 were prepared in accordance with accepted standard accounting principles under the historical cost convention.  It is the board's policy to comply with Irish company law and with the statements of standard accounting practice and financial reporting standards which are set by the UK Accounting Standards Board and approved for use in Ireland by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.  The changes in accounting policy adopted in drawing up the 1995 accounts are set out in the notes accompanying the annual report.  They were instituted to provide greater transparency and a more accurate reflection of the group's true financial position and were clearly indicated and fully explained.</P>

      <P>Given that customer receipts were up in 1997 compared with 1994, that the operating profits from 1994 were over £1 million and that there was a further increase in receipts and further cost savings within the company, how did an operating profit of £1 million turn into an £8 million loss?  Will the Minister outline exactly what made up the £8 million.  The kernel of the problem is that the board created the worst possible scenario so that it could dictate to the workers on the basis of accounts drawn up <Col N="1243" /> through guile.  Nothing illegal happened, but let us say that the books were fairly well cooked to meet the demands.</P>

      <P>The notes on accounting policy in CIE's published annual accounts for 1995 explain in detail the changes in accounting policy and why they have been introduced.  In effect, the new management elected to confront certain problems now rather than putting them on the long finger, as was the case in the past.  In any realistic view of CIE's situation, including the level of subvention likely for the future, it is in the interest of all sides to take corrective action now rather than when matters get out of control.  The accounting policies of which the Deputy complains are just one example of the change of approach necessary to deal with CIE's problems in a realistic and straightforward manner.</P>

Is it the same type of accounting practice witnessed in the Dáil when £60 million was put aside for hepatitis C in a year when it would not be spent?

My final question is about building and civil engineering projects.  A sum of £1 million was set aside to build canteens in two areas where they were not required.

      <P>The board of the company cleared the accounts and they were audited by independent auditors.  The accounts contain several notes to explain why the changes were <Col N="1246" /> necessary.  I will outline the principal changes and the reasons for them.  Depreciation of fleet applies to buses and locomotives.  In the case of buses, depreciation was reduced from an incredible and unrealistic 16 year period to a more realistic 12 years.  In fact, if it was to conduct its business properly the depreciation should take place after eight years.  In addition, higher depreciation charges were introduced in the earlier years of operation to reflect more intensive use of new buses.  The acquisition of new locomotives has added substantially to the depreciation cost of the rail fleet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>These items total approximately £12.5 million in costs.  Increased third party and employer's liability provisions, that is, the impact of claims against CIE by staff and members of the public, were recommended by CIE's actuaries to reflect the rising cost of claims and not a rising number of claims.  This added £8.9 million to costs.  That is a realistic, accurate and professional assessment of what should be included in CIE's accounts for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>

      <P>The CIE accounts make grim reading.  There is no substitute for this kind of transparency in matters connected with the public finances.  In effect, in its latest accounts CIE has called a spade a spade.  There can be no doubt about the seriousness of the groups financial position which is set out in black and white in the balance sheet.  The 1995 figures are the stark reality on the basis of which CIE management and unions must work together to reduce costs and turn its financial position around.  The reasons changes in policy were adopted in these areas have been outlined in the group's annual report and financial statement for 1995.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for tabling this question which reflects his interest in this area. On 28 September 1996, contaminated material was discharged into the sea at Dounreay, North Scotland, representing 1 per cent of the site's overall authorised discharge limits.</P>
      <P>The source of the leak was the reprocessing plant, D1206, which was shut down via automatic safety systems.  I understand that UK regulatory approval will be sought before the plant is restarted.  Pending the final report of the UK regulatory authorities, the incident has been provisionally rated one on the international nuclear event scale, i.e. an anomaly beyond the authorised operating regime.  I have made known my concerns about the incident to the UK authorities.  In particular, their attention has been drawn to the fact that the Department was only alerted of the incident through media reports on 1 October 1996.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Dounreay incident mentioned, my Department has been notified of four other incidents in the UK which involved an unauthorised release of radioactivity in 1996.  All nuclear incidents are unacceptable to the Irish Government and I am continuously monitoring the frequency and totality of UK incidents with a view to highlighting the need for significant safety improvements.  My Department is also pursuing the establishment of formal bilateral arrangements between Ireland and the UK concerning the transmission of information subsequent to incidents at nuclear installations and general matters related to nuclear safety and radiation protection.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and congratulate him on his ongoing concern about British nuclear plants.  Will he agree it is outrageous that it should have taken so long for the authorities to inform their neighbouring island of an incident of this dimension which occurred on 28 September?  What steps is the Minister taking to impress on the British authorities, with whom we share a common ocean, that it has a responsibility to this island's <Col N="1249" /> inhabitants, as well as its own?  Has he been given a commitment by the British authorities that it will notify his Department on the occasion of any future incidents of this nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, the longstanding informal notification arrangements have been working satisfactorily.  These were put in place by the then Minister, Deputy Spring, in 1984.  My Department is notified of incidents of a radiological nature as soon as the UK authorities are informed by the nuclear operators.  On receipt of the notification, this Department seeks immediately the views of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland on the radiological and health implications for Ireland.  On-site incidents that compromise worker safety are reported to the nuclear installations inspectorate of the health and safety executive in Britain.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications does not receive formal notification of such incidents.  However, the arrangements in place are such that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is notified by the NII of these incidents who in turn pass this information on to me.  The health and safety executive in the UK also publish a general statement about incidents on a quarterly basis.  As mentioned in my reply my Department will have discussions during December with the UK authorities to continue negotiations on the establishment of a formal bilateral agreement on nuclear safety and radiological protection matters.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and Deputy Byrne for tabling the question.  Would the Minister favour raising an incident such as this, which relates to Dounreay, and incidents from other BNFL installations, as ongoing items at the Anglo-Irish Conference, in view of the fact that the STAD group in Dundalk has propelled the issue of nuclear safety onto a higher political plane with the Supreme Court ruling?  This ought to be a matter between the two Governments at the highest possible level in view of the fact that Unionist and Nationalist politicians on this island share a similar view as to the gravity of the matter.</P>

A recent report from the British Geological Survey refers to seismic difficulties under the Irish sea and under the two islands and the existence of nuclear installations along the west coast of Britain which are particularly hazardous. In regard to the successful case by the four County Louth residents, will the Government, following two years of an each way bet, take over the running of this case and indemnify the four residents on their costs to date?</P>

The report on Sellafield does not deal with underground storage but with the much more dangerous overground storage of highly active liquid waste.  This report is the subject matter of a later question to which a full reply has been given.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate in greater detail some aspects of this issue which has become a matter of public controversy in an effort to obtain more information.</P>
      <P>On 17 October the Minister said that the chief veterinary officer of the Russian Federation, Dr. Avilov, and a delegation of veterinary experts visited Ireland from 7-12 October to review controls.  He also said that they completed a comprehensive programme of visits covering meat plants, rendering plants, ports, laboratories and farms.  Will the Minister expand on where they went and whom they met during their visits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the absolute details of the itinerary to hand.  They were engaged in substantive discussions from Tuesday until Saturday and wanted to see a rendering plant, a slaughtering plant and several meat factories.  An Bord Bia was involved in all aspects of the itinerary and we paid the costs.  Deputies will recall that we were visited by an Iranian delegation the previous week.  One of the groups wanted a herd to be depopulated.</P>
      <P>The Russian delegation had a meeting in the veterinary laboratory.  This week their permanent representative visited Abbotstown where analysis on the heads is carried out.  The delegation also visited a rendering plant and two meat factories and saw a herd being depopulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today the Minister gave details of the controls on meat and bonemeal he proposes to introduce from next month.  Why does he not ban the manufacture and importation of meat and bonemeal?  Given that it is perceived as a probable cause of BSE, what is the point of <Col N="1252" /> allowing its continued manufacture here?  Why not ban it entirely?  The regulations are very complex.  If farmers and others were prepared to use angel dust when it was illegal, it is very likely that they will use meat and bonemeal even though it is illegal.</P>
      <P>Several herds which have had BSE for some months have not been depopulated.  Would it not be appropriate to slaughter the herds first and arrange compensation later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of banning meat and bonemeal, it has been banned entirely in Britain.  The difficulty is that one devalues the fifth quarter if it is incinerated.  We have a ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to ruminants, that is bovine animals, and to ovine animals, that is sheep.  I have received an epidemiologist's report on the extra number of cases this year.  No reason could be given for some cases and the principal reason given for most cases is that cows born after 1990 had consumed meat and bonemeal.  It has transpired that there was no policing of rendering plants and it was possible for people to buy a bag of meat and bonemeal from them.  One must now have a licence to buy or sell meat and bonemeal. This is one of the strictest controls imposed.</P>
      <P>The best scientific information is that they are not ruminants, the disease cannot jump that species and there is no danger.  In France and other continental countries meat and bonemeal are fed to such animals.</P>
      <P>Culling is a matter of local controversy.  If a suspect animal is staggering we immediately take all the blue cards so the herd is restricted.  Even though we have not depopulated, the animals cannot be moved.  I cannot prove all these animals are ill and therefore there is a constitutional difficulty for me in slaughtering them and someone could say I do not have the right to do so.  I can either negotiate for depopulation, or I have the power to slaughter them but I would have to go to an arbiter.  In one case when we investigated a cow we found that the tag indicated that the animal was 15 years old, but examination of the teeth showed the cow was only eight years old.  We might go to the former owner with a photograph of the cow and he might say &ldquo;that is not the cow in question&rdquo;.  One case was referred to the Garda because the cow seems to be an imported BSE infected animal.  This is serious and a penalty for feeding meat and bonemeal or importing such an animal would be applied in such cases.  Obviously, this could be subject to legal proceedings and I do not want to prejudice any individual case.  If there was any suggestion of an animal having been imported, I do not see why I should immediately write a cheque on behalf of the taxpayer.  There is a combination of negotiation, pressure and applying penalties in suspect cases. Because of the large number of cases in the past few months, the settling of cases has not been as speedy as I would like and I am anxious to expedite it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he and the Taoiseach met the Russian delegation after it made its programme of visits.  When and where did the Minister and the Taoiseach meet the delegation and what was discussed?  What are the details of that contact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>From a Russian perspective, it would be improper to go into every detail.  I met the delegation on two occasions, in the Department and for a meal in the evening.  The Taoiseach also had a separate evening meeting during a meal.  The discussions covered the good relations between Ireland and Russia, the price competitiveness of our beef and the strict controls in place.  The detailed discussions were at official level, as was the discussion on counties.</P>
      <P>The decision on the implementation of this was agreed last Monday with the remaining vet and it relates to ear tags.  Tipperary is represented by the letter V, so a steer coming into a meat factory with that tag will be ineligible to go to Russia. This is fair to the three counties.  If I used herd numbers it would cement the geography of the herds in Counties Tipperary, Monaghan and Cork.  A Meath farmer could have Tipperary adult animals which would not be banned.  It will now be hard for the factories and marts to discriminate against a particular county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from what the Minister has said that the political contact between the Taoiseach, the Minister and the delegation was in a social context.  Having a meal with the delegation was the extent of the Taoiseach's involvement, which demonstrates the priority this matter has received from the top down.</P>
      <P>Was there a draft Protocol or any indication of the contents of the Protocol before the delegation's visit?  Was there prior notice of what was on their minds in terms of a partial or full ban?  What counties were originally included in the proposed exclusions?  The Minister said the delegation selected the counties and the basis for the selection, while not altogether clear, was based on their study of the figures.  Is the Minister asking the House to believe there is some confusion as to the basis of the Russian's selection of these counties?  On a number of occasions, the Minister has glossed over the precise basis of the selection.  What counter arguments were made to the Russians by our delegation?  Can the Minister explain the process by which certain counties were eliminated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dismiss a discussion because it took place over a meal.  The draft Protocol first came on the agenda on Friday morning.  The delegation asked for the figures first and then proposed the draft Protocol. When I met Dr. Avilov earlier in the week, I asked him whether it was an open and shut case. He twice said he had an open mind on the issue and did not have a hidden agenda.  Their epidemiologist studied the figures for one day and presented the Protocol on the Friday morning.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not involved in discussions on counties, but the arguments as I understand them concerned the number of cases in the past year and the total number of cases.  Towards the end of the discussions, when the Protocol was put on the table, we hotly disputed the scientific basis for it.  As the Deputy knows, the subsequent circumstances were such that it was take it or leave it.</P>

I have not asked whether the Minister was involved in the discussions.  I presume he has been informed by his delegation as to the basis of selection for the counties.  He stated he was responsible for the removal from the list of four of the seven stated counties.  I presume if he was responsible for removing them, the reasons they were put there in the first place must have been indicated to him. He cannot have it both ways.  He cannot claim he was not involved in the discussion on the counties and then he removed four from the list.  What was the basis of the selection?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the 110,000 tonnes of beef exported to Russia is meat from steers, not bulls or cows?  If that is the case, can we not give a 100 per cent scientific guarantee that there is not one BSE infected animal in the consignment of beef exported to Russia?  Why was that simple common sense argument not put to the Russians?  Surely that could not be defied.</P>

      <P>Since I became Minister I have told foreign delegations on many occasions that Ireland has never had a case of a BSE infected steer, but they claim I cannot prove the disease does not incubate in steers because they are slaughtered within two and a half years of birth. Because there is no live test of the disease or commercially available post mortem test, it is impossible to guarantee that beef from anywhere in the world is technically scientifically BSE free. The major breakthrough in the disease will not come from confirmation of a link between CJD and BSE, but from a commercially available test.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister state the average age of animals infected with BSE?  In the United Kingdom the average age is 13 months and over and it is mainly in female animals.  The export of 110,000 tonnes of beef, involving approximately 300,000 cattle, is a substantial deal.  What quantity of that beef is exported in live trade and what quantity is exported in slaughtered form?  We have not always had a happy trading relationship with the former Soviet Union.  The beef tribunal revealed that boxes of meat dispatched to Russia were effectively offal.  Did Dr. Avilov and his officials raise with the Minister the question of our previous record in beef exports to Russia?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to my earlier question about a total ban on meat and bonemeal, the Minister stated that while this had been considered it was decided not to ban it totally because &ldquo;it would reduce the value of the fifth quarter&rdquo;.  Does the Minister agree he is giving the impression that he is putting short-term commercial considerations above public health? Since public health would be served by banning the manufacture, importation and use of meat and bonemeal &mdash; this has been done in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland &mdash; would it not be advantageous to ban it here? Does he agree it is not good enough to say it is used in France to feed poultry and pigs?  France does not have a problem selling its beef, Britain and Ireland do.  Should we not ban meat and bonemeal and ignore the pleas of certain vested interests who make money out of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures I put in place to control the use of meat and bonemeal are the strictest in the world and they are credible.  Under a new labelling requirement which will come into effect on 1 January next, meal bags must be labelled stating that they contain meat and bonemeal and that it is illegal to feed it to animals or, alternatively, that the bags do not contain meat and bonemeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Herds were being depopulated and smuggled animals were being brought in.  We are storing meat and bonemeal and under international law we cannot dump it at sea.  We do not have a national incinerator and a landfill site would be horrific because of a rotten smelling odour.  We <Col N="1258" /> must consider rapidly the question of a national incinerator.  An interdepartmental committee is currently considering the matter, but we are awaiting an EU directive.  Such a directive will probably be issued next year stating that the heads of all sheep and cattle cannot go into meat and bonemeal and that they should be incinerated.  We must address that crisis next year.</P>
    <P>I was asked, should we feed meat and bonemeal to pigs and poultry?  The best scientific information available to me is that in every member state, barring Britain and Northern Ireland, they do allow it.  We export meat and bonemeal to them.  Leaving aside the practicalities of what else we would do with it &mdash; it is a waste management problem in that context &mdash; I assure the House that I am trying to crack down using the task force that was used in illegal substance abuse to get them to monitor and police stocks of meat and bonemeal not accounted for.  We must be tough on anyone buying it.</P>
    <P>If I was to pinpoint one reason we have run into difficulties and continue to do so, it is because the ban was there in letter but not in name.  I regret that but it is a public health issue. When I am asked how these cases can be explained, that is the best explanation I can come up with.  It is the reason younger cows contract BSE, although the three cases announced today are all pre-1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been 41 cases to date. The study in the scientific journal <i>Nature</i> involved new technology which fingerprints the strains of prions.  The technology is important and will be able to prove whether scrapie in sheep is the same as BSE or CJD.  Since March we have operated on the working assumption that there is a probable link.  Our controls already in place anticipated this report and, therefore, we see no need for further controls arising from the report.</P>

They came back and firmly said, &ldquo;No, take it or leave it&rdquo;.  It was not my intention to mislead anyone and I regret if my remarks did mislead people.

Was the decision made on the basis of the Minister's criteria supplied by his Department or on the basis of the Russians' own criteria?

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter point, it was totally a Russian decision.  I have named the four counties before, they are Longford, Wexford, Donegal and Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the list of incidence of BSE, Tipperary was ninth while Wexford was third so how could the Minister possibly allow Tipperary to be included in the ban while Wexford was excluded, apart from selfish interests he may have, some of which I would justify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not justifying the inclusion of Tipperary and I am certainly not justifying the inclusion of South Tipperary.  I am told that the basis upon which they selected was the incidence of BSE over the past 12 months.  I accept that since then some counties may have higher numbers but I strongly believe that no other market will follow suit.  Some 74 per cent of our sales of beef abroad are still eligible from these three counties.  Following my announcement last <Col N="1260" /> Tuesday week, the information I have from affected farmers is that there is no price variation. The Department is closely monitoring meat factory prices.</P>

Has he not allowed national and EU policy to be breached by allowing them to exclude three counties, in view of the fact that the UK is the only country within the EU that is identified as having a problem?</P>

      <P>I admire the Minister's attention to constituency duties, but did he not consider it would have been in the interests of our agriculture and food industry to have made his way towards the meeting that morning to satisfy himself that he had done everything possible to resolve this matter in the best way possible?  The Minister's contention as to how the counties concerned were selected is an interesting line of defence.  Under questioning today his consistent line of defence has been that he was not involved in those discussions and, therefore, he knows nothing about them.  Is he asking the House to believe that the people who attended that meeting have not briefed him fully on a step by step basis as to how the number of counties was reduced to three?  Is he suggesting that he was not contacted during those negotiations and asked what he should do about the seven counties?</P>
      <P>I would not regard it as a total criticism of him, but he should frankly say he indicated to his negotiators that they should make sure his county was not included.  Did that not happen?  Is the Minister suggesting that he was blissfully ignorant of all that was happening and arranging a house for someone in Enniscorthy while there were three counties, involving 25 per cent of the national steer herd, about to be excluded from what he regards as the most vital strategic market for the beef industry between now and next April?

      <P>That is very important to me.  I do not want any impression to emerge that my officials took the decision on their own.  That is not the case.  I had two serious conversations with the secretary of my Department, Mr. Michael Dowling.  After ten days of discussing the issue with the Iranians, it came down to the wire and I said that I would not contemplate such a measure for the Iranian market nor did we sign for it.  I <Col N="1262" /> asked for official advice on the implications of the implementation of a Russian ban and if this was the best deal that could be made.  I then put forward the proposal that we hold the draft at three counties and that I would negotiate it.  Dr. Avilov at one stage threatened to walk out of the discussions if they were to be politicised.  I do not want to go down the road of exactly what happened and who said what, but I am absolutely satisfied that these negotiations were carried out in the best possible way and if they were done again they would be done the same way.</P>

I wish to inform our consumers, who consider there may be some danger associated with eating beef from the three counties concerned, that I have put in place the most rigorous control systems to reassure them.  We remove depopulated meat entirely from the food chain.  We have three sets of controls <i>vis-á-vis</i> licensing, implementation and labelling of meat and bonemeal.  We are going after the cohorts of the animals that ate the same feed even though they may be in a different herd and we will take out the progeny.  No country in Europe has in place those controls in addition to a depopulation policy, which has been in place here for some years.  I reassure consumers that we have an effective eradication plan in Monaghan as elsewhere.  This pragmatic step was taken to ensure a volume and value of trade which is strategically critical and on that basis I justify it.</P>

Why was it necessary to sign a Protocol with Algeria in respect of exports if trade is proceeding on the normal basis?

      <P>I understand the Protocol with Algeria was signed over two years ago.  I was using it as an example because Algeria does not take beef from every European Union member state.  The volumes are quite significant, particularly at present.  It is common to have individual Protocols with third countries.  At that time there was no request for regionalisation.  The Russians sought regionalisation because of the stance taken by the French in other third country markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this urgent matter this evening.</P>
      <P>I have tabled three parliamentary questions about the water supply in the Churchill area of County Donegal.  A number of local schemes are involved, including Glenswilly, Felbane, Drimicanoo, Leiffrin, Roishin, Drumcavney and Lacoo.  The headworks of the entire area are in Churchill and the problem is twofold.  First, there is bacterial contamination requiring boiling orders when water is available and, second, there is no water supply at many times of the year. Until recently, a boiling notice was in operation. This was not the first time and it certainly will not be the last.  I am sure the Minister can imagine the conditions under which these 300 families have to operate.</P>
      <P>The scheme is using a private source which is more difficult to maintain than if it was connected to the ordinary mains.  It is a complicated scheme and too large to be maintained by a local community group which does not have direct access to the expertise and backup of the county council.  The county council is helping the 300 families who are dependent on the private scheme and it would be willing to take over the scheme if it was in a reasonable condition.  Hence, the urgent need for upgrading.  Accordingly, last May the county council applied for an upgrading grant for the treatment works at an estimated cost of £71,810.  This is not a great deal of money for the number of people affected.  I trust the Minister will treat this as a matter of urgency and expedite the grant application which would rectify the problem.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McDaid for affording me this opportunity to reply to the debate on behalf of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Churchill group water scheme was constructed almost 20 years ago and served 23 <Col N="1267" /> houses and associated farms at that time.  The scheme uses a lake source and the water is filtered and chlorinated prior to distribution. Demand has increased over the years and the scheme now serves 33 households and farms.  The pumping plant, as well as parts of the distribution system, are unable to meet this increased demand.  The filters are operating at only 50 per cent capacity and are in need of total replacement.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid will know that in the case of group water schemes in County Donegal the county council has devolved responsibility for processing applications and for the technical supervision of the schemes.  In May of this year the council submitted grant application forms, together with tenders and technical details, for upgrading the Churchill scheme.  The proposal involves the provision of new pumping equipment, a new 50,000 gallons slow sand filter and repairs to pipelines.  The overall cost is estimated at approximately £72,000.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently examining the outstanding demand for new schemes and for improvement works on older schemes.  In the context of the finances likely to be available for group schemes in 1997, it hopes to be able to make an announcement on the work programme for 1997 fairly soon so that group scheme organisers can finalise their planning arrangements and be ready to commence construction early in the new year.</P>
    <P>I note the Deputy's concern that improvement works should commence on the Churchill scheme at the earliest possible date.  I assure him that this will be borne in mind when drawing up the list of schemes to go ahead next year.</P>

I have always found the Minister most helpful any time I had to seek her assistance.  The Minister is aware of the lack of response and assistance from the Department of Education for the multi-denominational school in Crumlin.  There are 33 pupils in the school at Islandbridge and they have to vacate the premises.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Eric Byrne.</P>

      <P>Some parents did not send their children back to that school last September because of the uncertainty involved. Accommodation is required which would be suitable for between 40 and 60 pupils and the school would accept premises in Crumlin.  An offer was made of a school in Nutgrove in Rathfarnham, but as one parent who sent her child there said, the transport for one year costs £448.  Other parents believe that to transport their <Col N="1268" /> children in a minibus would be unacceptable because some of them live in the Drimnagh-Crumlin area.</P>
      <P>Schools were offered in Ranelagh and Glasnevin but they are already full and have huge waiting lists.  The committee of the Crumlin multi-denominational school emphasises that the parents are not malcontents or difficult people, and since I have met them on a number of occasions I assure the Minister that is so.  There is a great demand in Dublin for multi-denominational schools and the parents involved believe that progress is held up by senior officials in the Department of Education.  The board of management, Deputies Eric Byrne and Upton, the Minister, Deputy Gay Mitchell and I met Department officials in July this year and they gave the impression that they would respond reasonably quickly, if I recall correctly within ten days to two weeks.  That was 14 weeks ago and we are still awaiting a response.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Briscoe for sharing his time with me.  This week we debated the Employment Equality Bill during which time I expressed considerable concern at the exceptions granted to institutions under religious control.  It is clear that our laws and practices have not kept pace with society, which is becoming increasingly secular and pluralist. Crumlin multi-denominational school has been treated like rolling stock in a shunting yard and is once again under threat of eviction from its premises in Kilmainham, a threat which no doubt will be carried out.  That site has been proposed for redevelopment as an apartment block. Parents want their children educated in accordance with a specific religious, pluralist ethos and the Government should respect and facilitate that wish.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education grants large sums of money to churches to build schools and by the same token the board of management of Crumlin multi-denominational school should be facilitated in acquiring or building permanent premises.  The White Paper on Education states that recognition of full entitlement to capital grants will be given to all schools including all-Irish and multi-denominational schools from the date of their establishment as soon as the Minister is satisfied in each case that there will be a continuing need for the school.  The parents of children attending Crumlin multi-denominational school are determined to deliver a multi-denominational education for their children.  It is clear that there is a demand in the area for a multi-denominational school since there are 33 children registered and two teachers in the school at present.  I urge the Minister to ensure the school finds permanent premises so that it can continue its very valuable work of providing a pluralist education without the threat of eviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents' group involved believes that their back is to the wall and has instituted legal proceedings in the High Court to seek to <Col N="1269" /> vindicate their constitutional rights.  It is a very sad day that because of the threat of eviction, a minority group has to take the State to the High Court to seek to vindicate its constitutional right to a multi-denominational education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for using this forum to put their case for recognition of the school.  It gives me an opportunity to clarify the position.  The Crumlin multi-denominational school was given provisional recognition by the Department with effect from September 1994.  It is now in its third year of operation and the enrolment at September last was 30 pupils.  The school has been requested by the landlords to vacate its current temporary accommodation in Goldenbridge House, Inchicore.  As with all new multi-denominational or all-Irish schools, initial recognition was granted to the Crumlin school on a provisional basis.  When such schools have been in operation for a number of years and can satisfy the Department with regard to their conduct and future viability, permanent recognition may be granted.</P>
      <P>During the period of temporary recognition it is the responsibility of school management to provide temporary premises to house the school. It is only when permanent recognition has been granted that such schools can claim capital grant aid from my Department.  Crumlin multi-denominational school has temporary recognition and, accordingly, does not qualify for capital grant aid at present.</P>
      <P>The school has applied for permanent recognition and the application is being processed as a matter of urgency.  I wish to put on record my recognition of the work put into this matter by the officials of my Department.  They met a deputation from the school and Educate Together on Wednesday, 16 October 1996 to discuss the issues.  The views put forward by the deputation will be taken into account in examination of the application for permanent recognition.  I assure the Deputy that there will be no undue delay in processing the application and that the accommodation problem will be reviewed immediately in light of that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for coming in to reply.  We are all aware of the drug marches organised in recent months throughout the inner city and suburbs against the drugs scourge.  Local residents' and tenants' groups who feel betrayed and let down by the system have taken to the streets to highlight the social consequences of the problem in their areas.  The cry &ldquo;pushers out&rdquo; is a common one as tenants try to reclaim their areas. According to reports, several tenants have left their local authority flats and houses following requests and hassle from concerned tenants. Some left before they were thrown out and, <Col N="1270" /> regardless of whether we like the methods used, they have been successful.</P>
      <P>The understanding is that drug pushers evicted by tenants or legally by local authorities have set up house a mile or so down the road and are still carrying on their drug pushing activities.  Worse still is the perception that the State is giving them a rent allowance towards accommodation costs. Is data of all evictions, legal or otherwise, collated by the four Dublin local authorities and supplied to the Department?  Has the Department issued specific instructions that drug pushers be refused rent allowance?  It is unacceptable that these people should qualify for rent allowance.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister does not quote regulations to the effect that everybody has a statutory right to apply for rent allowance.  I am aware that legislation is promised, which will be introduced soon, but we need answers.  Regardless of whether there is a statutory base for action it should be taken. There is a perception that the State is helping drug pushers who are only laughing at the rest of us.  Let a do-gooder of a solicitor take the Minister to court on behalf of a pusher client, if he or she so wishes, but we must take a commonsense approach.  I hope the Minister will tell me I am wrong but there is a perception that these people qualify for the allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to reply to this question which is a moot one in certain parts of the city.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent payments to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for such a payment the claimant must satisfy the general conditions of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance set out in the Act and the conditions of entitlement to a rent supplement set out in the regulations.  Those generally excluded from receiving assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme include people in full-time employment, full-time education and involved in trade disputes.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of reasonable rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This represents the minimum contribution which claimants are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> The grounds on which an application for rent allowance may be refused are also set down in the regulations.  While I accept and understand the points made by the Deputy &mdash; this problem was not foreseen when the Acts were framed &mdash; under the regulations health boards cannot automatically refuse a rent supplement to a tenant evicted from local authority housing by the local authority concerned.  Unauthorised evictions are not recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is deemed that a person is engaged in illegal activity &mdash; it is an offence to trade in drugs &mdash; one would assume other statutory bodies are taking an interest.  One should not presume however that he or she is guilty until a conviction has been obtained in the courts.</P>
      <P>Each case would have to be decided on its merits, taking account of the legislation and the unique circumstances of the case.  The legislation would have to be amended to specify that it is a condition of entitlement to a rent supplement that a person must not have been evicted from local authority accommodation under section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966.  While this is an emotive and serious issue, it has to be recognised that introducing such a condition would have serious implications for the dependants of any person evicted from local authority accommodation.</P>
      <P>It is proposed by the Department of the Environment to introduce legislation to give community welfare officers the right to refuse an application for a rent or mortgage supplement in cases of this type.  The legislation will be introduced as soon as possible.  It is intended to define the term &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; in a way that will meet the requirements mentioned by the Deputy and at the same time ensure there is no abuse.  It is the statutory authorities alone which determine whether a person is engaged in antisocial behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, for coming into the House to respond.  Listening to the Minister for the Marine <Col N="1272" /> on RTÉ radio this morning it was clear that he has adopted a heartless and callous approach to the plight of the 200 permanent and temporary employees of Irish Ferries who will be laid off from November to June next year unless he takes immediate action.  The reality is Irish Ferries management broke all the normal industrial relations rules and procedures in announcing its draconian proposals at a meeting with the workers' representatives on 25 September.</P>
      <P>These proposals involve tying up the <i>St. Killian</i> on 3 November leaving 200 workers without pay until June next year.  This will have devastating consequences for these individuals and their families.  I have met the representatives of the workforce and I am aware they are deeply concerned about their future.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that Irish Ferries management has a hidden agenda.  The company hopes many crew members will be obliged to take up other jobs during the layoff period giving it an opportunity to hire what are known as yellow pack or low cost crew members.  As the Minister is aware, the practice of employing a non-EU, low cost labour force is widespread in the shipping sector.  Such a policy approach must be strongly resisted by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister must put his full weight behind the workers in their efforts to save their jobs.  The French Government provided subsidies to Brittany Ferries.  Why can we not come to the assistance of Irish workers at this critical time? The Minister has the option of pursuing the provision of a subsidy or using in an imaginative way the taxation system to resolve the crisis.  I am aware that both he and the Department have been examining how the taxation and PRSI regime applicable to seafarers in Irish Ferries might be amended to make the company more cost effective and competitive.</P>
      <P>The time has come to make a decision on the matter.  I was astonished at the Minister of State's statement in the Dáil on 26 September when he described the decision of Irish Ferries as a commercial one taken by a privately owned firm. The implications of this decision are serious not just for the workers and the company but also for the island of Ireland.  If implemented, it will mean that there will be no direct sea link between this island and mainland Europe for Irish livestock exports during the next seven months.</P>
      <P>The position of the workers' representatives is more than reasonable when one considers that during the past 23 years not one day was lost through industrial action.  There has been no significant investment over the same period.  The <i>St. Patrick</i> and the <i>St. Killian</i> are 23 years old and seriously outdated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument that Irish Ferries and its workforce do not have a special case.  This dispute is of national significance.  I urge the Minister to ensure this important service is not severed for seven months and to intervene either by amending the taxation <Col N="1273" /> and PRSI regime applicable to seafarers or by providing a direct subsidy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The behaviour of Irish Continental Group in this matter has been outrageous.  Workers employed by the company for over 20 years will as a result find themselves out of a job.  New conditions governing holidays, pensions and sickness benefits will be introduced from next May when workers will be employed on a two weeks on-two weeks off basis.  This should not be countenanced by the House.</P>
      <P>Within days of announcing this despicable reorganisation the company launched a £60 million vessel.  We must take whatever action is open to us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt outlined the measures in relation to subsidisation, the fact that the only major route to France for livestock exports is being obliterated, a critical point in the light of today's debate, and the replacement of these workers with non-EU nationals.  Approximately 100 of the workers come from north Dublin constituencies which have a long seafaring tradition.  Many families in Raheny and Kilbarrack will be devastated by the action this company is taking.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House and I am grateful to him and the Minister for listening to our representations and those of the unions.  This is an urgent matter and I ask him to use whatever powers are available to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt and Deputy Broughan for raising this matter.  I am very concerned about the continuing lack of progress in relation to this matter.  The House will be aware that on 20 September Irish Ferries announced it intended to cease sailings on its continental corridor between Ireland and France for the winter, starting on 3 November.  Deputies will be aware also that I asked the Labour Relations Commission on 10 October to intervene in the matter with a view to finding a solution which would keep the service in operation over the winter period.  Intensive negotiations under the aegis of the Commission are ongoing and it is my strong desire that both parties to the dispute are allowed to address the serious issues involved in a workmanlike and constructive environment.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the initiation of talks in the Labour Relations Commission the company formally sought from my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, the grant of an operating subsidy of £12 million in total which, the company represented, was essential if the continental route was to stay open over the next three years.  The Minister responded to this by letter to the company yesterday in which he indicated he could not grant the operating subsidy sought by the company.  He also appealed to the company, which is financially strong and robust, to maintain operations during the coming winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> I share the view of my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, that an operating subsidy is not the answer to the current financial circumstances of the route.  Such a subsidy would open up the likelihood of requests for subsidies from operators in other areas of marine transport and aviation.  It would represent a major reversal of the long standing policy of creating efficient and competitive private sector companies in all cases where the normal justification for public intervention did not exist.</P>
    <P>There has been a long history of subsidisation and State ownership in the shipping sector.  It has been broadly accepted in recent years that this was not conducive to the creation of cost-effective, flexible and predictable services.  It is not the Government's policy to revert to this position on foot of one operator's threat to close down one route.</P>
    <P>The decision of the company to close the route was a commercial one taken by a privately owned firm.  That is not an opinion expressed by me, it is a fact.  As I mentioned in my reply to the Adjournment Debate on 8 October a decision to take disruptive action would, likewise, be one for the employees concerned.  I am sure the House will share my view that it would be a matter of considerable regret, however, if such action were to further undermine the company's competitiveness and threaten more job losses.</P>
    <P>I reject the assertions made by Deputy Kitt in relation to the Minister's interview on radio this morning.  My Department has a good record in terms of supporting the shipping sector over the past 12 months.  We have achieved much in terms of tax measures and the financing of training but we intend to do a great deal more.  I appeal to all concerned to resolve this dispute without disruption of services to the travelling public and our exporters and importers.  As an open economy and an island nation we simply cannot afford a serious interruption in the flow of goods and visitors to and from the country.  I appeal, therefore, for calmness and reflection on all sides.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, 30 October 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 13 of 2 July last I set out Ireland's general position concerning review of the health and <Col N="1275" /> safety provisions of the Euratom Treaty.  In that reply I highlighted the particular relevance of additional nuclear safety provisions to the further enlargement of the EU.</P>
      <P>On 19 July last the Irish delegation to the Intergovernmental Conference submitted a discussion paper on the subject of the Euratom Treaty in the context of EU enlargement.  The main purpose of the discussion document was to promote discussion on the challenges of enlargement as regards ensuring high standards of nuclear safety and radiological protection in the EU.</P>
      <P>On the basis of initial consideration of Ireland's discussion paper there would appear to be little support for addressing this issue by means of an amendment to the Euratom Treaty at present.  As the Deputy is aware, any amendment of the EU Treaty requires unanimity.  There are, of course, widely diverging views among member states about the benefits of nuclear power.  There are also different perceptions as to whether the strengthening of nuclear safety can best be addressed by means of a Treaty change.  The future approach by the Irish delegation to the issue will take account of the above considerations.</P>

      <P>The EU high level transport group referred to in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 14 on 2 July 1996 was established by the Commission to help find new ways of accelerating the implementation of partnerships between the public and private sectors in the financing of priority transport infrastructure projects in the context of the trans-European transport networks.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the high level group is to take stock of the major obstacles, especially of a financial nature, encountered by some of the TENs priority projects and to propose new, concrete solutions to these problems with the aim of avoiding delays in their implementation.  These solutions may be drawn either from experiences of existing public-private partnerships for TENS projects which have been successfully implemented, or from other innovative ideas or initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has met twice to date, on 23 September and 11 October, and has established five specialist sub-groups to consider specific <Col N="1276" /> aspects of its mandate.

      <P>The ESB published its strategy document, entitled ESB: Confident and Competitive, last month.  Prior to its publication the chairman and chief executive of the company formally presented me with a copy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporate strategy represents ESB's blueprint for the strategic development of the company in the coming years.  The strategy document agreed by the board sketches corporate strategic direction in the light of the ongoing implementation of the CCR agreement and is a follow-on from the CCR process.  The strategy builds on the change and cost <Col N="1277" /> improvement programmes already under way in the ESB.</P>
    <P>The main planks of the ESB's strategy are the defence of the ESB's position in the Irish market and the securing of profitable new market opportunities with the overall aim of ensuring a successful future for the ESB in the new electricity supply industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the strategy are: profitable growth, market positioning, driving competitiveness, and customer focus.</P>
    <P>The strategy sets out certain key targets including: 2,000 voluntary exits, £58 million in net annual savings agreed in the CCR, movement towards a new corporate financial target of 12 per cent and a new customer charter with performance targets.</P>
    <P>Clearly the ESB, Ireland's first established State company, is heading into a period of great change.  The elimination of its monopoly position and the introduction of competition into the electricity market will subject the ESB to new and powerful challenges.  It is vital that the company is prepared for the new environment and a strategy which clearly sets out its objectives as well as the means of their achievement is crucial to its future success.</P>
    <P>The success of the strategy is principally dependent on the successful implementation of the CCR.  I am pleased to say that implementation is proceeding satisfactorily and achievements to date are well on target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>First, in view of a recent misleading newspaper headline in <i>The Examiner</i> concerning the Government's position on legal action against Sellafield, I take this opportunity to clarify the matter to the House.  The particular article gave the impression that an imminent legal challenge was being planned by the Attorney General concerning British Nuclear Fuels' facilities at Sellafield.  This is not correct.  My Department, acting on the advice of the Attorney General, is organising the gathering, investigation and processing of the available scientific evidence which might provide grounds for legal redress by the State.  The editorial in the newspaper concerned accurately reflected my comments as did a subsequent article in the same newspaper on the following day.</P>
      <P>As to the disclosure of the studies under consideration, I am advised that it would not be prudent, nor would it be to the State's advantage, to divulge details about the authorship, date of publication and content of such studies.  This Government has always been and continues to be committed to legal action against Sellafield if a case for it can be shown to exist.</P>
      <P>One possibility includes the question of recourse to arbiration under the Paris Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Land Based Sources.  Additional scientific information and studies which have recently come to hand concerning the storage arrangements for highly active liquid waste at Sellafield are under consideration.  Proposals have been made for further research which is considered to be necessary into this aspect of the matter and these proposals are under active consideration.</P>
      <P>The House will also be aware of the Government's opposition to the proposed construction of an underground rock characterisation facility or laboratory at Sellafield by UK Nirex, the radioactive waste management company in the UK.  I see this facility as a precursor to an eventual nuclear waste dump. Earlier this year I appeared before a public inquiry in Cumbria and made a detailed submission opposing such a facility.  In addition, I am consulting with the Attorney General about what further actions are open to me under EU and international law in the event that the appeal by Nirex against the refusal of planning permission is successful.</P>
      <P>Vigilance relating to activities at Sellafield will remain a priority for this Government and I will continue to avail of every opportunity to eliminate the threat posed by Sellafield.</P>

      <P>A steering group was set up in December last year by myself and my colleague the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, to look at the issue of Ireland-US access.  The group comprises senior officials from both Departments, Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>During the course of their work, the State agencies involved met with a number of US airlines to ascertain their interest in and plans, if any, for the Irish market.  An interim report has been prepared by the group and has been submitted to both myself and the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  While certain US airlines have expressed general interest in the Irish market, none of the airlines approached has at this point indicated to us any firm proposals to inaugurate new services to Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have instructed the group, however, to continue its efforts to identify opportunities for new services and to bring those opportunities to the attention of airlines.  This includes opportunities for marketing arrangements such as code-sharing as well as direct services.</P>
      <P>In 1996 there was a planned overall increase in direct transatlantic capacity of over 16 per cent. It is too early to predict a pattern for 1997 as airlines have not yet finalised their plans, but I will be closely watching developments in that regard over the next few months.</P>

      <P>The criteria mentioned by the Deputy, commonly known as DPTAC standards, are applicable to buses used for local transport services.  These standards are now applied on a voluntary basis by the two CIE bus companies in relation to their urban fleet renewal programmes.  I am advised that, approximately 60 per cent of Bus Átha Cliath's total fleet incorporates a wide range of DPTAC features.  Bus Éireann is also guided by the DPTAC criteria in renewing its urban fleet and as a result, over 75 per cent of its city buses comply to a substantial extent with DPTAC specifications.  In both companies, the proportion of vehicles incorporating DPTAC features will automatically rise according as the urban fleets are renewed.  Furthermore, on BUS Éireann's Expressway services, to which DPTAC standards do not apply, over 60 per cent of its fleet incorporates a feature whereby the front of the coaches may be lowered to facilitate boarding.  As <Col N="1281" /> the Expressway fleet is renewed, some of the existing coaches with this special facility will be assigned to local routes in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The development and implementation of proposals for enchanced bus and rail accessibility are matters for the transport operators themselves.  In line with my policy in this area, both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann continue to give a high priority to accessibility requirements when purchasing new vehicles. Because of the additional costs and possible operational limitations associated with fully wheelchair-accessible buses, there are as yet no vehicles of this type in normal service with either company.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that Bus Éireann is expecting to take delivery in January next of a low-floor, large-capacity single deck bus, accessible to wheelchair users, for the purposes of evaluation under typical operating conditions.  Bus Átha Cliath also plans to acquire a number of similar vehicles for the same purpose.  Plans are also well advanced in Bus Átha Cliath, in consultation with representatives of people with disabilities, to provide a limited, off-peak, wheelchair-accessible minibus services on the north side of the city.</P>
      <P>These are very welcome developments which reflect the commitment that exists in CIE to maximising the degree of accessibility of their fleets for all potential customers, where this can be undertaken on an affordable and cost-effective basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the second round of the Energy Challenge competition which I launched on 26 September last.  This is a joint North-South initiative funded under the INTERREG II programme.  The aim of this initiative is to encourage local entities in the INTERREG region to asses their energy supply and demand situation and to seek local solutions to their energy problems.</P>
      <P>Under the second round of Energy Challenge, grants of up to £20,000 per project are available towards the cost of carrying out feasibility studies in the following areas: biomass potential, including energy crops, biofuel, biogas and energy from waste; local wind energy potential; local hydro power possibilities; energy efficiency in buildings; and community or district heating systems.</P>
      <P>The deadline for receipt of completed applications is 1 December 1996 and supported studies should commence in January 1997. Studies must be completed by 30 November 1997.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, I am circulating a list of projects supported under the first round of Energy Challenge in 1995.</P>

      <P>This conference brought together, for the first time, renewable energy developers, financiers and policy makers to investigate the commercial opportunities associated with renewable energy development in Ireland.  The conference allowed for information exchange on available finance options and facilitated a better understanding, by the banking sector, of the needs of developers.  An evaluation exercise has been undertaken by the Renewable Energy Information Office to assess the impact of the conference and the results confirm the success of the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme which runs up to the end of 1999, a total of £15 million in European Regional Development Fund funding is available for the development of renewable energy.  The Deputy may be aware of the AER 2 competition which I launched in December 1995.  This competition will result in the construction of a <Col N="1285" /> biomass/waste fuelled electricity generating plant of up to 30MW electrical output.  I have allocated a sum of £7.5 million in European Regional Development Fund aid to support this project. The actual sum paid to the developer will depend on the size of the winning plant.</P>
    <P>With the aim of developing the necessary support framework for renewable energy development, I launched <i>Renewable Energy</i>&mdash; A <i>Strategy for the Future</i> earlier this year.  In addition to the AER 2 grant fund, I have allocated £7.5 million for project support up to the end of 1999.  A total of £6.5 million of this will be paid to developers on the basis of £65,000 per MW installed for wind energy, hydro, biomass and waste-to-energy technologies.  In addition, I have earmarked, subject to EU approval, a sum of £1 million for the construction of a wave to energy pilot project.</P>
    <P>I have also allocated £200,000 over the period of the operational programme for the renewable energy feasibility study grant scheme.  This is designed to support studies which investigate the viability of harnessing renewable energy resources.  The scheme is administered by the Renewable Energy Information Office and will pay up to 50 per cent of the cost of studies up to a maximum of £6,000 per study.</P>
    <P>My renewable energy strategy guarantees electricity market access for successful renewable energy Thermie projects.  This initiative has substantially increased available support for renewables.  The EU Commission has welcomed my initiative and under the 1995 Thermie call, four Irish renewable energy projects have secured, between them, grant support of £2 million.  The actual capital investment value created by this support is over £5 million.</P>

      <P>Full details of existing air services to Kerry Airport are available from Kerry Airport.</P>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regional airports, including Kerry Airport, are owned and operated by private undertakings and as such the development plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are primarily matters for the individual airport companies.  I should also point out that since the establishment of the Single Market on 1 January 1993, all member state airlines are free to operate on any international route within the European Economic Area without any restriction on frequency, provided slots are available at <Col N="1286" /> airports.  The question of whether any airline wishes to exercise such rights is, however, entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that in order to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department has introduced a programme of essential air services in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92.  This programme, which covers services between four regional airports &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and Dublin, is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.</P>
    <P>So far operating contracts have been awarded for Kerry/Dublin, Galway/Dublin and Donegal/ Dublin routes.  In so far as Kerry Airport is concerned Aer Lingus is contracted to provide two daily round trips.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, in order to assist the regional airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports, marketing grants were paid by my Department to the six regional airports during 1993 and 1995.  Furthermore, arising from financial and other difficulties being experienced by most of Ireland's privately owned regional airports, a review of policy relating to these airports was carried out by my Department earlier this year.  As a result of this review the Government approved a strictly time limited scheme of Exchequer grants totalling £2.35 million over the four years 1996 to 1999 for the six regional airports to assist the airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports.</P>

      <P>It is clear that in the context of Commission Directive 96/2/EEC regarding mobile and personal communications, the Commission expects at least one licence for DCS 1800 digital mobile telephony to be issued by each member state before 1 January 1998. DCS 1800 technology is similar to GSM but operates in a higher frequency range and is generally regarded as a technology for urban areas.</P>
      <P>Consistent with the Commission Green Paper on Mobile Telephony dated 27 April 1994, commitments were given to GSM applicants and to Eircell that DCS 1800 licences would be offered to the GSM operators on a non-exclusive basis.  The question of offering an additional DCS 1800 licence will be decided in 1997.  The question of mast proliferation is one for planning authorities in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I can confirm, however, that I fully support the idea of the co-location and sharing of telecommunications facilities, where feasible.  I have already made my views on this question known to all relevant State bodies under my aegis and to other telecommunications operators that have suitable sites and infrastructure.  I have also requested my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, to bring my views in the matter to the attention of RTÉ.  Furthermore, as I started in this House recently on the subject, if difficulties arise about sharing/co-location the Telecommunications and Radio Regulatory Division of my Department is there to provide assistance.</P>

      <P>Over a period of almost two and a half years the Dublin Transportation Initiative carried out the most extensive ever evaluation of the transport situation in Dublin.  This included consideration of a wide range of options for the improvement of <Col N="1288" /> the city's public transport, from an underground DART system to bus based alternatives.  The details of this evaluation are set out in the DTI final report.  The transport strategy recommended by the DTI has been accepted by Government as the general policy framework for the future development of the transport system in the greater Dublin area.  This strategy includes the core on-street light rail network providing for lines to Ballymun, Cabinteely via the Harcourt Street line and Tallaght, at a cost of approximately £300 million.  The first phase of that core light rail network involves the construction of a line from Tallaght to Dundrum at a cost of £220 million.  As part of the public consultation process, the CIÉ project team examined a number of options for constructing this line and they have already published their findings.</P>

      <P>The Telecom Éireann strategic alliance transaction is now moving towards closure.  The principal transaction documentation was signed on 26 July. However, before the alliance deal can take effect a number of enablers must be put in place.</P>
      <P>The alliance transaction is subject to the standard competition clearance procedures of the EU.  This process is on-going.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996 which is currently before the Oireachtas, makes the necessary legislative amendments to enable the sale of equity in Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>It is likely that the alliance transaction will conclude before the end of this year.  At that stage the purchase by the strategic partner of the first tranche of equity under the agreement can take place.</P>
      <P>The alliance agreement is confidential to the Irish Government, Telecom Éireann and KPN/Telia.  This is the normal commercial practice in such arrangements.  However, the main terms and features of the strategic alliance agreement were made public at the time of signing last July.</P>

      <P>Telecom Éireann currently owns 75 per cent of the share capital of Cablelink with the remaining 25 per cent being held by RTE.  RTE's shareholding is, however, subject to an agreement which gives RTE an option to require Telecom Éireann to purchase the shares at market value.  This option must be exercised by July 1998.</P>
      <P>The Forfás recommendation is, in fact, a conditional one.  In its report entitled Telecommunications and Enterprise, Building and Investing for Our Future it states that &ldquo;Telecom Éireann should be required to sell its interests in Cablelink unless it can show a development plan for the delivery of a broad range of advanced services on an integrated basis.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government, in its mandate for the strategic alliance negotiations of July 1995, stated that Cablelink should be the subject of a separate dynamic business plan.  This plan should lead without undue delay to the development of a platform for delivery of a range of communications services and which is open to a variety of competitive service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis.  I believe that this objective can be achieved without a change in ownership of Cable link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the terms of the strategic alliance deal contain specific initiatives in relation to the development of Cablelink.  Therefore, the demerger of Cablelink is not envisaged by the terms of the alliance deal, and it is clear that the KPN/Telia consortium are committed to bringing their considerable expertise to bear on the future development on an open access basis of Cablelink as part of Telecom's business.  It is my belief that, <Col N="1290" /> assisted by the expertise of KPN/Telia, Cablelink will develop as a provider of advanced communications services.</P>

      <P>The extent of expenditure to date under the Operational Programme for Economic Infrastructure 1994-1999, is one of the issues which is being examined at present by Indecon Economic Consultants, who have been appointed to assist the mid-term review of this particular Operational Programme. The consultants' report is expected before the end of the year and it will be considered by a special meeting of the Economic Infrastructure Monitoring Committee in mid January 1997.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the competitions for the consultants on the peat fired station project, the Deputy will be aware that it was originally intended that the ESB would run the competition for a new peat power station.  On this basis, a firm <Col N="1291" /> of consultants, Combustion Systems Inc., were selected by competitive tender and were engaged to provide me with technical advice, in order that I might be assured with regard to the technical specification which the ESB proposed for the competition.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, acting on legal advice, I decided that the competition for the peat station should be conducted by an independent panel of consultants, rather than by the ESB.  This assignment was a far more complex and onerous one, which required a much broader range of skills.  Following a selection process in accordance with EU procurement rules, the consortium which was selected for this task comprises &mdash; Stone and Webster Management Consultants (Consulting Engineers, USA and UK) &mdash; Matheson Ormsby Prentice (Solicitors, Dublin) &mdash; Allen and Overy (Solicitors, London) &mdash; NCB Corporate Finance Ltd.

      <P>Under the income tax code a child who is not the child of a claimant but who is in the custody of the claimant and is maintained by the claimant at his or her own expense for the whole or part of the year of assessment qualifies as a &ldquo;child&rdquo; for the purposes of:</P>
      <P>(a)  the income tax widowed parent and lone parent allowance (currently £2,150 and £2,650 respectively);</P>
      <P>(b)  the special income tax allowance for widowed parents in the three years following the year of bereavement (£1,500 in the 1st year, £1,000 in the 2nd year and £500 in the 3rd year);</P>
      <P>(c)  the child additions to the income tax exemption limits (currently £450 for the first and second child and £650 for the third and subsequent children); and</P>
      <P>(d)  health expenses relief.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that this income tax treatment is based on the concept of the actual maintenance of the child not on whether the child is unofficially adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For capital acquisitions tax purposes a gift or inheritance taken by a child who has not been formally adopted qualifies for the Class III exemption threshold of £12,170 where the child is a stranger in blood to the disponer.  The transfer of assets from parents to children of the parents (including adopted children) is dealt with under the Class I threshold, which allows assets up to a value of £182,550 to be transferred free of capital acquisitions tax.  The Class II threshold of £24,340 applies to transfers between certain other relatives such as brother/sister, uncle and aunt/nephew and niece and grandparent/ grandchild.  In addition under section 58 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 certain lifetime gifts for the purpose of support, maintenance and education are exempt from capital acquisitions tax where the disponer is <Col N="1293" /> acting in <i>loco parentis.</i> This provision is, thus, in line with the income tax treatment where the income tax allowances are in recognition of the expense involved in the maintenance of children.</P>
    <P>The three different thresholds in capital acquisitions tax mentioned above are based on the different legal relationships of the beneficiary and the disponer.  An unofficially adopted child does not come within the definition of a child for the Class I threshold for legal reasons.  The concept of unofficial adoption is very vague and it would be inappropriate to extend the Class I threshold to such situation based on such a vague description.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, last year I established an interdepartmental committee to thoroughly investigate the issues involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers.  I would like to remind the House of the main finding of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee found that the treatment of cross-Border workers for the purposes of income tax is fair and reasonable <i>vis-á-vis</i> other Irish taxpayers.  Consequently, the committee felt that there is no justification for any special income tax treatment of these workers as compared to any other category of Irish resident taxpayers.  The committee did however, make other recommendations, most notably, to exempt cross-Border workers from the health and employment and training levies.  As the Deputies are no doubt aware, I announced such an exemption in this year's budget and this was introduced in this year's Social Welfare Act.  The committee also recommended that cross-Border workers should avail of the direct debit system as a means of paying their Irish tax liability and this now applies for the preliminary tax payment due on 1 November 1996 and on 1 November of subsequent years.  Full details of this system, <Col N="1294" /> including an explanatory leaflet are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>On the question of equity, it has been suggested that the Irish tax system should be used to equalise the differential in pay rates on both sides of the Border.  However, it was never intended that the Irish tax system be used for this purpose.  While income tax liabilities in this country are high, it is not true to say that cross-Border workers do not have tax equity, they do. They are treated the same for income tax purposes as any other resident taxpayer.</P>
    <P>As part of its work the interdepartmental committee examined the application of the relevant provisions of the 1976 Irish British Double Taxation Agreement.  It recommended that consideration should be given to the renegotiation of this treaty with a view to resolving differences of interpretation which exist at present.</P>
    <P>Since the committee reported, the Revenue Commissioners have been in negotiations with their UK counterparts with a view to resolving the differences of interpretation which exist in the present treaty.  However, as the negotiations are still ongoing it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this matter.</P>
    <P>I cannot overstress the fact that the issues involved in cross-Border taxation are complex, involving two jurisdictions, and the examination of these issues takes time.  There are no easy solutions which will cater directly for the individuals affected while being fair to all the taxpayers involved i.e. both the cross-Border workers and all other Irish resident taxpayers.</P>

      <P>The medical criteria which must be met in order that a disabled person may qualify for tax relief are set out in Regulation 3 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  Six different types of disability are listed and a qualifying person must meet at least one of them.  The disabilities include:</P>
      <P>(b)  &ldquo;persons wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs&rdquo;,</P>

      <Col N="1295" /> These regulations were drawn up after consultation with a wide range of interested parties including the organisations representing the disabled.

However, the operation of the scheme is kept under periodic review and the point raised by the Deputy will be taken into account in that regard.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Acute in-patient beds for the Dublin north city and county are provided in St. Ita's Hospital. This catchment area is also serviced by a range of community services &mdash; out-patient clinics, day hospitals, day care centres, group homes and a vocational and sheltered employment facility. The Eastern Health Board has been pursuing a policy of transferring mental health services from institutional settings to community care settings, in line with the recommendations of the report on the development of the mental health services Planning for the Future (1984) which has been accepted as mental health policy by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>With the development of a localised community-based catchment area services, admissions to large psychiatric hospitals such as St. Ita's Hospital will be curtailed and in the longer term discontinued.  Since 1984, the psychiatric in-patient population in St. Ita's Hospital has reduced from 475 to 266.  The long-term objective is to provide all acute psychiatry for the catchment area in Beaumont Hospital. The board's development plan for St. Ita's Hospital will effect the phasing-out of all hospital wards in the main building over the next four to five years.  St. Ita's campus will then consist of the following buildings:</P>
      <P>Psychiatric Service: Admission and Assessment Unit.</P>

    <P>Elderly Service: Reilly's Hill &mdash; This complex has been extensively refurbished over the past two to three years and will serve the specialist needs of the elderly in north Dublin in relation <Col N="1296" /> to the frail elderly with functional illness; and the elderly with disturbed behaviour, secondary to dementia; Hostels on Campus.</P>
    <P>Mental Handicap Service: Units 11, 12 and 13; Units R and S; Group Homes/Hostels on Campus.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has been considering the needs of the elderly in north Dublin and has developed proposals to respond to unmet needs.  The board outlines in this report that it expects that further developments will take place in the community ward scheme and that the specialist psychiatric service for the elderly will also be extended to north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the development of community facilities requires the transfer of staff from the institutional service to the community. These resource transfers can only take place on a phased basis and requires continuous consultation with all staff disciplines, staff associations and voluntary agencies.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> My Department has made inquiries of the Eastern Health Board in regard to the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the board that to date in 1996 the Eastern Health Board has spent a total of £185,000 on the manufacture and supply of dentures.  Up to 30 June 1996, 100 per cent of this work was carried out on contract by eight Irish-based companies.  However, since 1 July 1996 all dentures and denture repairs are being provided by a U.K. based company which is under contract to the board.</P>
      <P>As the annual value of the contract exceeds the allowable threshold for exemptions, 200,000 ECUs or £154,000, the board was obliged last March, under EU directives on public procurement, to advertise the contract for the manufacture and supply of dentures in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Award criteria for the contract were detailed in the advertisement and in the tender documents. The contract was also advertised in a national newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that prior to advertising the contract the eight Irish-based companies who had been supplying the service up to then were invited by the board to attend a meeting in Dr. Stevens' Hospital at which the new arrangements were explained.  The contract was awarded for a two year period to 30 June 1998.  It was awarded <Col N="1299" /> on the basis of the economically most advantageous tender having regard to price, quality, turn-around time, infection control measures, clinical acceptability, after sales service, delivery-collection costs, technical and performance standards and any other criteria necessary to ensure that the best value for money is achieved, as specified in the tender documents.</P>

      <P>The enforcement of the anti-smoking regulations rests with the environmental health officers and unfortunately is being affected by an industrial dispute.  The fact that this dispute is affecting enforcement does not alter the legal and moral obligation on proprietors to ensure compliance with the law on their premises.  I am aware that certain proprietors are taking advantage of the dispute to ignore their responsibilities in this regard, and this attitude shows a disgraceful contempt for the law and for the health and welfare of their customers.  I can assure the Deputy that the law will be fully enforced once the industrial dispute is resolved; in the meantime I would urge those whose legal right to a smoke-free environment is being denied to make their dissatisfaction clear to the proprietors concerned.</P>

Such plants are, for the most part, constructed substantially below groundlevel and are designed, among other things, to minimise visual intrusion. Notwithstanding the higher thresholds set in EU legislation, all proposed waste water treatment plants in this country with capacity above 10,000 population equivalent, must be subjected to environment impact assessment (EIA) procedures.  These are designed to allow for public participation in the decision-making process and to ensure that the impact of the proposed development on all aspects of the environment, including the impact on local residents, is fully considered.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he is taking, in conjunction with the Department of Health, to resolve the problem of the disposal of toxic clinical waste, following the action by the United Kingdom Environmental Agency in stopping such waste imports on 9 October 1996.</Quest>

      <P>It has been the deliberate policy of the Government to improve the environmental management of healthcare risk waste.  Accordingly, the use of most hospital waste incinerators has been terminated.  A comprehensive programme for the management of healthcare waste is being advanced jointly by the Department of Health and the Northern Ireland authorities; this will involve the early establishment of non-incineration treatment facilities in our jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The situation regarding exports of Irish wastes to the UK is set out in the reply to Question No. 38 of 9 October 1996.  In addition the Department of Health has now agreed in principle to the export of certain healthcare risk waste to the Netherlands so as to alleviate the present temporary shortage of treatment facilities.  I would emphasise that current arrangements present no environmental or public health risk.</P>

      <P>My intention for the present is to continue concentration of available resources on the development of school based strategies for children with specific learning difficulty.</P>
      <P>The educational needs of pupils with specific learning difficulty (dyslexia) are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher and, in the case of post primary pupils, guidance counsellors and subject teachers.</P>
      <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools dedicated to this area.  Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have established a pilot support unit for children with specific learning difficulties in a primary school in north County Dublin.  I will be keeping the operation of this pilot unit under close review.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education sets out a range of measures aimed at ensuring early detection and intervention where children with special educational needs are concerned.  The fundamental objective is to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, that children with special needs will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area. To this end, the White Paper provides for a continuum of provision ranging from specialised back-up services for children attending ordinary schools, to the provision of special facilities dedicated to children with more serious needs.</P>
      <P>The needs of children with specific learning disabilities will be addressed within the comprehensive range of measures set out in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>The objective of the early start pre-school pilot project initiative is to expose young children to an educational programme which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful educational attainment in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forty centres of greatest disadvantage, were selected for the provision of this service on a pilot scheme basis.  The areas in question were selected after detailed consideration of needs across the disadvantaged areas.  The pilot project is a one-year preventative strategy which is offered for children in these areas.  Accordingly, children <Col N="1308" /> may be enroled in an early start pre-school class for one year only.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, therefore, the child in question who is currently attending the early start pre-school would not be eligible to enrol in the early start class for a further school year.</P>
    <P>However, if it is proposed that the child continues her primary school education in the school referred to by the Deputy, she will have the services of a remedial teacher in that school.</P>
    <P>My Department also makes provision for children with speech and language disorder through the establishment of special classes.</P>
    <P>The establishment of such a class depends on sufficient numbers of children being in need of such classes and on the availability of adequate speech therapy services.  The provision of speech therapy and the appointment of speech therapists is a matter for the relevant health board.</P>

      <P>As this is considered to be a good level of service in the overall context of the scheme, and as extra State cost would be involved in extending the service, the current arrangement is the most that can be offered by my Department.</P>

      <P>Bus Éireann, who is my Department's agent for the operation of the school transport scheme, have advised that the incident to which the Deputy refers occurred on Thursday, 17 October 1996.</P>
      <P>The vehicle concered is a private contractor's vehicle, which was registered in 1970.  It is serviced every six to eight weeks, and is subject to regular inspection by experienced Bus Éireann personnel to ensure its reliability throughout the school year.  The inspection and maintenance of tyres are a priority in these routine checks.</P>
      <P>The Department of Environment is responsible for testing vehicles in respect of their roadworthiness.  All vehicles operating under the scheme meet rigid safety standards and, where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass the Department of Environment tests in regard to roadworthiness.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann is justifiably proud of their safety record in operating the school transport scheme. They place special emphasis on safety and, to this end, have a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service which are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that standards are maintained.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the case of a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath who is in receipt of a deserted wife's benefit and who has been requested to make payments to the social welfare following the granting of a maintenance order; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this woman is currently finding it difficult financially to support her family; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions, contained in part IX of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, the spouse of a person receiving, <i>inter alia</i>, deserted wife's benefit must contribute to the Department towards the cost of that benefit in respect of his family.  This liability may be offset, in whole or in part, by the transfer to the Department of any maintenance payments which are being made in compliance with a Court Order.  Where agreement to the transfer of such an Order is not forthcoming, provision is also made for reduction of the relevant social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is receiving deserted wife's benefit at the maximum rate of £85.10 per week for herself and one dependent child.  At the time of her claim the person concerned was working part-time, and it is understood that she is in employment currently.  She was awarded £180 per month maintenance for herself under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 in the District Court.  She is required, under the provisions mentioned, to transfer this Maintenance Order to the Department.  The position has been explained to her and her consent to the transfer has been sought.  If her consent is not received, her deserted wife's benefit will have to be reduced, though she would then retain any maintenance payments made by her husband under the court order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is acting under legal provisions which are based on the widely accepted obligation on people to maintain their spouses and children.  The payment of deserted wife's benefit guarantees the person concerned a regularity in weekly income which she might not <Col N="1313" /> otherwise enjoy if solely dependent on maintenance payments.  The system also ensures that social insurance contributors generally are not unduly required to bear the cost of income support for one-parent families in situations where deserting husbands have the capacity to provide direct support through maintenance payments.  The transfer of a maintenance order is an important element in ensuring that these objectives are met.  If the maintenance payments are not transferred, the Department has no option under the legislation but to reduce the deserted wife's benefit.</P>

However, I understand that individuals who have mortgage protection with Norwich Union arranged through the Trustee Saving Bank are, for the most part, neither policyholders nor members of Norwich Union. The payments made to the Trustee Savings Bank <Col N="1314" /> act as a reimbursement for the policy premium paid by the Trustee Savings Bank which is the actual policyholder.</P>

      <P>Arising from the BSE crisis I have recently imposed strict controls on the use of meat and bonemeal in animal feedingstuffs.  Since 17 October 1996 a licence is required for the purchase of meat and bonemeal or for the incorporation of meat and bonemeal in feed for non-ruminant animals or poultry.  The product has, of course, been banned in ruminant feed since 1990.</P>
      <P>As regards home-grown cereals, my Department's policy is to increase production to pre CAP level so as to provide adequate supplies of grain to the feed industry at reasonable costs. In this connection I have supported measures at EU level to facilitate the use of eligible land and to reduce the requirement for set-aside.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 403 of 2 July 1996 which has clearly set out this Government's position in relation to Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The safety of the British nuclear industry generally and of Sellafield, the THORP reprocessing plant and the Magnox reactors, in particular, and the continuing threat they pose to the health and safety of Irish people and our environment remain a cause for concern.  As Minister of State with responsibility for nuclear safety, I have availed of all opportunities to raise these concerns bilaterally and at a wider international level.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have in the recent past written to the UK authorities and expressed the Government's and the Irish public's concerns about the age, safety and reliability of such Magnox reactors, especially those at Sellafield, Wylfa and Dungeness and, indeed, the level of safety in the UK's nuclear industry generally.  In this respect, I would refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 139 of 23 April 1966 where copies of my correspondence were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the interest of openness and transparency.</P>
      <P>Officials within my Department recently requested the Europen Commission to carry out inspections and verifications of the facilities of Magnox reactors in the UK under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty so as to ensure that they are in compliance with EU standards.</P>
      <P>In July of this year, Ireland ratified the Nuclear Safety Convention which enters into force today. Every effort is being made by all member states of the EU and the International Atomic Energy Agency to ratify the convention as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Formal, high level diplomatic approaches have been made to EU and other countries involved in spent fuel reprocessing argreements with the THROP facility, which set out the concerns of the Irish Government in this area.  Irish concerns were sympathetically received but no commitments were given to intervene with companies dealing with BNFL.</P>
      <P>These actions are clear evidence of this Government's commitment to pursuing all realistic and effective courses of action to convey to the British authorities the concerns of the Irish people about the British nuclear industry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly stated the Government's commitment to the phased construction of the core light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative, serving Ballymun, Cabinteely and Tallaght.</P>
      <P>Work on the planning and design of the Ballymun to city centre route will proceed in parallel with the construction of the Tallaght to Dundrum route.  The Government is committed to constructing the Ballymun line as soon as possible and, at the latest, immediately after the completion of the Tallaght to Dundrum route. Project team staff will be transferred to work on the Ballymun route immediately they complete planning and design work on the Tallaght to Dundrum route.  The planning work on the Ballymun route will include investigation of possible alternative alignment options and consideration of an extension to Dublin Airport. No final decision on a route will be taken until full local public consultation has taken place and the statutory requirements have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> Apart from the proposed extension of the Ballymun light trail line to Dublin Airport, DTI also recommended that a conventional rail link, but not necessarily a DART type system, from Dublin Airport to the Dublin-Belfast railway line be evaluated as a longer term option.  CIE and Aer Rianta recently set up a working group to consider this proposal.</P>

Once I have received that application the statutory timetable set out in the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, will come into effect.  I expect that a public inquiry will be held early in 1997 and that project should be in a position to commence construction in the second half of 1997.  This would enable the first phase to be in operation by 2001.</P>

This matter was also raised at a meeting with UK officials in Dublin.  My Department requested greater and speedier vitrification of the high-level waste products in the interests of nuclear safety and radiation protection.  The UK authorities have indicated that another vitrification plant to transform the waste into glass form would be ready by the year 2000 to reduce the backlog of stocks of this liquid waste.</P>
