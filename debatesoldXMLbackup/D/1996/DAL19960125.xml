      <P>Francois Mitterrand's election, and re-election, as President of France were evidence of his great political skills and his ability to build a majority for the centre/left in a divided nation.  He came to the Elysée Palace after almost 40 years at the very centre of French politics, a Minister and party leader and as a profound political thinker and writer.  His extraordinary contribution to the modernisation of Paris through a series of great projects, such as La Defense, the Bastille Opera and the reconstruction of the Louvre, will form a monument to his lengthy presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Francois Mitterand united the diverse strands of the democratic socialist movement when he created the <i>Parti Socialiste</i> in the early seventies.  He brought together Marxists and Catholic social thinkers, trade unionists and intellectuals and established structures in which they could work together for a progressive and modern France.  The party has replaced the Communists as the standard bearer of the left and it has produced outstanding figures such as Jacques Delors, Michel Rocard and, most recently, Lionel Jospin who is well <Col N="1218" /> placed to restore a socialist presence in the Elysée.  The <i>Parti Socialiste</i> has become a most significant force in national and international politics with which the Labour Party is happy to co-operate on many issues of mutual concern.</P>
    <P>Francois Mitterand was a great European.  His commitment to European integration was long standing, going back to the congress of the Hague and to his involvement in French Governments in the 1950s.  As President, his partnership with the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has been a central feature of the life of European Union for more than a decade.  At the heart of his European views was his conviction for the necessity of a social Europe and he saw the social dimension extending to the world stage, basing international economic relations on &ldquo;respect for fundamentals &mdash; the rights of workers, of women, of children.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his European dealings, Francois Mitterrand often proved himself a good friend of this country and a supporter of policies which have benefited our economy. Successive Taoisigh have pointed to the examples of his understanding of Irish concerns and of practical assistance at moments of vital Irish interest.</P>
    <P>Francois Mitterrand was a man of vision and of principle.  His first act as President was to abolish the death penalty which he saw as incompatible with French civilisation.  President Chirac stressed the significance of that act in his recent tribute to his predecessor.  He was a strong supporter of human rights at home, in Europe and across the world, for example, in South Africa and the Middle East.</P>
    <P>As many commentators have attested, Francois Mitterrand was a complex and controversial man.  A whole library has been written about the many elements of his public and private life.  He was at the centre of French and European politics for some 50 years and he was a dominant figure in both settings.</P>
    <P>He never gave up his interest in good writing and ideas and his many books <Col N="1219" /> and essays reflected his deep analysis and insights.  At the end, he displayed a degree of personal courage in the face of mortal illness and a remarkable philosophical approach to the mystery of death.</P>
    <P>Francois Mitterrand was one of the truly great figures of his age and, in a period lacking perhaps in great political leadership, he was outstanding.  I wish to convey my sympathy and that of the Government and my party on the death of a great Frenchman, a great socialist leader and a great European statesman.</P>

      <P>Former French President Francois Mitterrand was one of the great European leaders of our time. In his 14 years as President, with his German counterpart, Chancellor Kohl, he continued the creative and constructive Franco-German leadership of the European Community, now the European Union, from its beginning.  He was a man of breadth and vision, tempered by Government experience stretching back to the end of the Second World War.</P>
      <P>Francois Mitterrand had a political career of astonishing length, spanning ministerial office in the Fourth Republic, a prolonged spell in Opposition under the Fifth Republic and, finally, two terms as President.  Involved both in the Vichy regime and the Resistance, a right winger turned socialist, he faced problems of domestic political instability in the 1950s and colonial wars.  He provided honourable domestic opposition to the charismatic authority of Charles de Gaulle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ironically, his advent to office consolidated the institutions of the Fifth Republic by putting them through the test of democratic alternation and cohabitation. Although he brought the Communist Party which dominated many of the trade unions into Government, he crushed them in the embrace of power, leaving them much reduced on the margins, their dominance of the French Left lost forever.  Not for <Col N="1220" /> nothing was he nicknamed &ldquo;the Florentine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Like Ireland a few years earlier, his first Government in the early 1980s attempted a one-country reflation as a means of fighting the effects of international recession, the failure of which experiment pushed him toward a more coherent European strategy.</P>
    <P>In concert with Chancellor Kohl former President Mitterrand played a key role in a remarkable number of strategic initiatives to revitalise a stagnant European Community and economy.  The Community and Union were enlarged to include, first, the Mediterranean and then the Nordic countries.  The Single European Act came to pass, followed by the Maastricht Treaty establishing European Union and the parameters of economic and monetary union.  In the interim, reaching its climax during the highly successful Irish Presidency of 1990, Germany was reunited.  The European Community assisted the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to emerge from Communist tyranny.</P>
    <P>Former President Mitterrand, continuing an age old French policy, was sympathetic to the political and economic needs of Central and Eastern Europe and was a strong supporter of President Gorbachev.  One of his most important legacies was the appointment in 1985 of his former French Minister, Jacques Delors, as President of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Former President Mitterrand was also a good friend of Ireland.  He supported and assisted Ireland and the Mediterranean countries on two separate occasions to obtain a doubling of European Union Structural Funds which underpin much of our capital investment today.  He enjoyed an excellent relationship with successive Taoisigh, as both Dr. Garrett FitzGerald and Charles Haughey will testify.  French support also enabled former Deputy Ray MacSharry to become the European Commissioner for Agriculture. Indeed the MacSharry CAP reform package, assailed at the time, has <Col N="1221" /> become vital to the livelihood of Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>Former President Mitterrand will also be remembered and admired for his mark on the French capital, in the tradition of other great French rulers since the 17th century &mdash; La Defense, the Pyramid at the Louvre, housing the world's greatest museum, an Arab Studies Institute, a new Opera House at the Bastille, a new National Library all being among his monuments.  Indeed our National Library could benefit from a fraction of the same support the French Socialist President gave to one of the most basic elements in any national cultural heritage.  We will look back on his Presidency with regret and nostaligia.</P>
    <P>We convey our sympathies to the French Ambassador and the French people.</P>

      <P>Francois Mitterrand as President of France and as a man who had seen the horror of war at first hand, worked tirelessly to create a political union in Europe that would banish war forever from our continent.  His vision enabled him to give a political leadership that overcame temporary or technical setbacks in the construction of the European Union.  His distinguished career in the service of his country, culminating in 14 years which he served as President of the French Republic, will remain as a tribute to him.  He was truly a stateman of world stature.  He was also, as the Tánaiste has said, a very good friend to Ireland both in our bilateral relations with France and in the context of Ireland's membership of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Francois Mitterrand, more than most, understood the importance of perseverance and fortitude in the face of adversity &mdash; qualities that I wish he was here to talk to me about.  Throughout his life he faced daunting challenges and many setbacks.  He refused to abandon his principles and objectives.  In no episode in his life did he display his outstanding courage and fortitude more <Col N="1222" /> than in his final illness.  In his ability to give practical effect to his ideals through the adoption of pragmatic and effective measures he set an example for us all.</P>
    <P>His death marks the passing of one of the outstanding persons of his generation, a generation which managed to steer Europe from the vicious cycle of conflict and war to the path of integration, prosperity, democracy and peace.  We who have never experienced the horrors of war must ensure that the achievements of Francois Mitterrand and his generation are never forgotten and are consolidated and enhanced.</P>
    <P>I extend my deepest sympathy to his family and to the people of France.</P>

      <P>The death of Francois Mitterrand marks the end of the Second World War generation of French politicians. Perhaps his greatest achievement was serving in two consecutive terms as President of the Fifth Republic, whose architect was his long time opponent Charles de Gaulle.</P>
      <P>Despite his traditional left wing background, Francois Mitterrand transcended the traditional left-right divide in French politics.  He modernised and liberalised the French economy.  He moved it away from being a highly regulated State dominated economy to being a liberal modern European economy.  In his passing, Ireland has lost a great friend and France has lost a loyal son.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saddened to learn earlier this month of the death of former French President, Francois Mitterrand. He came to political maturity as the continent emerged from the shadows of World War II and he left political life while Europe was coming to terms with the troubled legacy of the Cold War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His passing brings to a close a crucial period not only in the history of postwar France but also in the development of the European Union.  Francois Mitterrand is probably the last European statesman whose politics were forged in the conflagration of World War II.  His role during that period, and in particular <Col N="1223" /> his associations with the Vichy regime, have been surrounded by controversy. That controversy is unlikely to abate with his death but it should not be allowed to obscure his very real achievements.</P>
    <P>During his term of office, Francois Mitterrand witnessed enormous changes in Europe.  When he entered office there were just nine members of the European Community, when he retired that had mushroomed to 15 and the number of applicant countries had spiralled. Many of those applicant countries were, and are, seeking stability in the midst of social and political upheaval. The promise of <i>perestroika</i> and the concept of a &ldquo;Common European Home&rdquo; had been swiftly overtaken by the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Yeltsin regime and unfettered, rampant capitalism.</P>
    <P>Having survived the horrors of World War II, President Mitterrand recognised the dangers inherent in mindless nationalism and he recognised that the best guarantee against resurgent nationalism was the development of a strong and vibrant European Community.</P>
    <P>Together with former Commission President Jacques Delors, Francois Mitterrand placed the social dimension at the centre of the European idea.  It is unfortunate that some in Europe, who see it as little more than a free market, are seeking to replace that with a very narrow view of Europe.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to Francois Mitterrand's strength of character that he was able to forge alliances &mdash; national and international &mdash; with people holding political views vastly different from his own. Domestically, he forged an alliance &mdash; albeit a short-lived one &mdash; with the Communist Party which ushered in post-war France's first left of centre Government.  In European terms, he formed an enduring relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl &mdash; a relationship which transcended fundamental ideological differences in the interests of European cohesion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> As a socialist and as a democrat, Francois Mitterrand placed accommodation, co-operation and consensus above narrow dogmatism.  In the course of an often troubled career he learned what some never accept, that compromise requires courage, but that mere expediency is never a substitute for the politics of conviction.  That ability to compromise was both his greatest strength and, perhaps in some cases, his greatest weakness.</P>
    <P>The jury is still out on Francois Mitterrand's long-term legacy to the Fifth Republic.  The few words we might say here today cannot give credit to the depth and the breadth of that legacy. His greatest legacy to the European Union is that of social solidarity and inclusiveness.  It is a legacy we would do well to hold on to.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree that it is tragic, following the favourable initial response to the Mitchell report yesterday, that the hope of a breakthrough in the peace process was dashed within a few hours?  Will the Tánaiste accept there is intense and widespread anger among Nationalist Ireland this morning at the way in which the Mitchell report was brushed aside by <Col N="1225" /> the British Prime Minister yesterday? There is a question of public faith here. The reality is that what the Prime Minister posed yesterday is a false choice between acceptance of the Washington III&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is certainly not irrelevant. Will the Tánaiste agree that the British Prime Minister has posed a false choice between Washington III and an elected assembly?

      <P>Where is the co-ordinated response to the Mitchell commission and what action can we expect to see over the next number of days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the Mitchell report which the House agreed yesterday is a solid and independent assessment. This report should form the basis of discussions on the political track which should take place as quickly as possible.  We are seeking to have a range of bilateral and trilateral meetings with the parties to discuss the report and get their detailed responses to it.  Yesterday the British Prime Minister expressed his preferences for decommissioning or an elected body.  However, he has not given the Government any indications that he wishes to resign from the firm aim which he signed up to in November, that is to have all party talks by the end of February.</P>
      <P>There are stated conditions to be met before any elected body can be practicable &mdash; there must be broad agreement and a clear mandate and it has to come within the three strands.  No one has shown the Government any model which meets those conditions and if someone has such a model then they should come forward with it.  If Mr. Trimble or anyone else has a model which meets these conditions then he has a duty to discuss it with the Government and the other parties as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of elected body proposed yesterday does not represent a way out of the impasse and the real danger is that we will send out a message that as soon as we have got over one hurdle we have another one to cross.  It is our firm view that any proposals which espouse the position of one community over the other in Northern Ireland are not acceptable.  Such proposals have not worked in the past and will not work in the future in Northern Ireland.  We will not back such an approach as it is totally at variance with the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Downing Street Declaration. We want to get back into discussions and the summit is arranged for <Col N="1227" /> mid-February.  At the summit we will seek reassurances from the British Government that it is still on target to have all-party talks by the end of February.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The peace process is fragile and the possibility of all-party talks taking place before the next British election looks very bleak.  Given that we do not want to see a return to megaphone diplomacy it is important that the two Governments meet to discuss the Mitchell report.  Does the Tánaiste have any plans to meet with the Secretary of State in advance of the summit between the two Prime Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue also involves a question of public faith.  I accept what the Tánaiste said this morning but I am concerned at the announcement yesterday by the British Prime Minister that there was contact between him and the Taoiseach.  If the Taoiseach knew about these matters why did he say in reply to a question from Deputy Harney that there would have to be co-operation with the British Government?  Did he know in advance what the response of the British Prime Minister would be yesterday? May I ask the Tánaiste where the co-ordinated approach by the British and Irish Governments to the Mitchell Commission now stands?</P>

There will be discussions between the Irish and British Governments and we will seek reassurances that the firm aim of both Governments as set out in the November communiqué that all-party talks should be held by the end of February is still the position of the British <Col N="1228" /> Government.  We have had no indication that there has been any resigning from that commitment.  Obviously many issues have been raised by both Governments during the discussions in recent months and various proposals have been put forward.  It is for the British Government to put forward its views and it is for us to put forward our views. It is most important that meetings now take place and we discuss with the parties the contents of the Mitchell report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When debating the annual budget one usually discusses and assesses its provisions.  However, on this occasion it would be totally inappropriate not to address what can only be described as the media circus which characterised the lead up to the Minister's Budget Statement.  The performance of a number of Ministers over the <Col N="1230" /> past few months has been incredible to say the least.  I have been a Member of the House since 1977 and every year the introduction of the budget was a very important occasion for the State.  It was also very important in terms of ordering fiscal matters for the year and there was a degree of confidentiality regarding the proposed provisions.</P>
      <P>Last year the former Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, was unceremoniously forced to resign from office for a minor indiscretion &mdash; he leaked some of the provisions on budget day.  This year we did not have to wait for the Minister's statement to find out what was in the budget.  On budget day the Ceann Comhairle went through the humiliating charade of asking Members not to take their copy of the budget out of the House until the Minister had concluded his speech.  I hate to see the status of the Ceann Comhairle reduced to that level.</P>
      <P>His reminder that the budget was a confidential document was a farce as Ministers had held press conferences prior to the introduction of the budget in order to curry favour with their constituents. At his press conference the Minister for Social Welfare said there would be major changes in PRSI, which there were.  This was followed by a press conference by the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who said he was seeking £10 million and predicted a number of changes which, of course, came to pass.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs did not want to be left out of the picture and he told us some of the provisions which would be contained in the budget.  Details of some provisions were also contained in business journals and newspapers prior to budget day.  One newspaper went so far as to leave a blank column after certain provisions so that people could write in their comments.  This is no way to run a country or to deal with a budget.  Does the Taoiseach still believe that investigations should be carried out into these serious and widespread leaks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the sight of a Minister rubbishing a colleague in Cabinet may be good media copy unfortunately it has <Col N="1231" /> serious implications for our reputation at home and abroad.  It should be remembered that the actions of the Government are continually monitored. The IDA, which is doing a very good job, has been given the task of convincing industrialists that we have a good economy and operate in a professional manner.  It is critical that the status of our democracy is upheld, particularly in relation to the annual budget.  The citizens of this State require continual reassurance that our democratic institutions are functioning properly and in their collective interests.  Indigenous and foreign investors are assessing the medium to long-term potential for allocating substantial resources to industrial developments within the State.  Like that of any other sovereign state, our international political status is constantly under evaluation.</P>
    <P>Why was the budget seriously undermined, some might say fatally damaged, before the Minister outlined his proposals to the House?  It cannot be denied that the Government comprises a number of extremely able and decent people who have made important, personal contributions to political life &mdash; none more so than my colleague from Cork, the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, who was, unfairly, a victim of the nonsense which has characterised some of the decisions of the Government. However, on reflection, there can be little doubt that its deep malaise has its roots in its origins in that the people were not asked to make a decision in an election, which makes it unique.</P>
    <P>In an insane grasping for power, irrespective of the cost, the three parties concerned came together to form the most politically incompatible coalition possible within the State.  As a result we have a combination of far left and far right policies with the Labour Party in the middle &mdash; a case of &ldquo;whatever you are having yourself so long as it does not bring down the Government and remove us from our cushy positions&rdquo;. Sadly, the outcome of such chaotic <Col N="1232" /> government is both predictable and unfortunate.  All involved in this sorry fiasco are only too well aware that any serious attempt to develop fundamental policy initiatives is doomed to failure because of the incompatibility of the Government parties.</P>
    <P>This is the reason a press conference is held one day and another the next at which one Minister makes a statement to the effect that a certain policy document is a definitive response which is later denied by another who at least attends Cabinet meetings.  That was another ploy to put a Government in place.  Because the Constitution could not be changed to increase the number of Ministers to 16, a stunt was pulled to placate Democratic Left which has 1 per cent electoral support.  As a result of this ruse it was offered a Minister of State post who could attend but not speak at Cabinet meetings and would also be given a State car.</P>
    <P>After the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs had told all and sundry that the report on long-term unemployment was a definitive response the Minister of State decided to contact Joe Mulholland at RTE &mdash; this constituted interference with the State broadcasting service &mdash; to complain.  The constant bickering and instability whereby Ministers constantly look over their shoulders to see what their Cabinet colleagues are doing have left us in a disastrous position so far as the making of coherent policy decisions is concerned.</P>
    <P>The net result is nothing short of disastrous, especially for those most in need in society.  It gives me no pleasure to recall the appalling irresponsibility of the 1983-87 Coalition which brought the economy to the verge of bankruptcy. When it entered office the national debt stood at £12.5 billion but at the end of its period in office it was £25 billion.  It took a great deal of courage from the late 1980s onwards on the part of Fianna Fáil led Governments, first with the Progressive Democrats and later with the Labour Party, with the support of Deputy Dukes when leader of Fine Gael, to restore order to the national <Col N="1233" /> finances and our credibility internationally. Without the consensus of the majority parties in the House this could not have been done.  Great sacrifices had to be made, particularly by the less well off.  It is a pity that the orderly restoration of the economy to good health has not been continued.</P>
    <P>For the first time in 27 years there was a surplus at the end of 1994, but the benefits are being frittered away.  In times of recession the poor and companies under pressure fall by the wayside. In times of boom there is a need for retrenchment and to put something aside for a rainy day.  This is certain to happen because of the cyclical nature of the economy.</P>
    <P>This time last year there was a great sense of anticipation and it was confidently expected that the main problems facing society would be tackled in the budget.  These continue to be social deprivation, unemployment, spiralling crime and increasing levels of drug abuse.  Unfortunately, our expectations were betrayed and a truly appalling budget was presented, with the exception of a few provisions.  It displayed a chilling indifference to the plight of the needy and the only seemingly acceptable excuse offered by the Government was the brevity of its tenure in office. The same excuse cannot be put forward on this occasion as a justification.</P>
    <P>Despite the clear obligations of the Government parties to meet people's needs, in the weeks prior to the budget there were signs of what lay ahead. These included ministerial squabbling and the opportunistic leaking of details of the budget.  At one point I felt the Government could have used the Welsh national emblem &mdash; the leek &mdash; as a symbol.  There were indications, however, that the budget could be a good one.  When one goes to Lansdowne Road or Croke Park one will see the players limbering up before the game begins.  One in particular will do many tricks with the ball and engage in fancy footwork, but when the whistle is blown the player concerned who showed great promise will trot off <Col N="1234" /> towards the dugout and put on his track suit.  That is what the budget reminds me of.</P>
    <P>The contents of the budget are bitter for two sections of society in particular, those living in poverty and those involved in job creation.  Its provisions are an insult to those most in need in society as we approach the end of the 20th century.  Following the lamentable 2.5 per cent increase provided last year, we could have confidently expected the poor to be granted a higher increase because of our good economic performance, but despite all the talk about the 7.5 per cent growth rate and low inflation they were granted only an increase of 3 per cent in what is supposed to be the best economy in Europe and in a time of boom.  In other words, a person in receipt of a non-contributory pension will now receive £64.50, an increase of £2.</P>
    <P>In a recent report, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul indicated that over 80 per cent of the elderly on fixed or static income have only one pair of shoes. How could they afford to buy another pair of shoes on £64.50 per week?  Many of them have only one overcoat because they cannot afford to buy another.  In a time of economic growth it is disappointing that the less well off are not being assisted.  In real terms, the budget has done nothing to improve their unacceptable standard of living and this is even more upsetting than the miserly increases.  We were promised last year that the payments would be brought forward, but in the small print of the Principal Features it states that they will not be introduced until September.</P>
    <P>Even though they make extremely depressing reading I will outline some of the studied insults contained in the budget.  The orphan's non-contributory pension will be increased by a paltry sum of £1.20 per week.  A similar miserable largesse has been bestowed by Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, on a blind married couple by way of supplementary allowance.  The real <Col N="1235" /> extent of the Government's commitment to the family is exposed in its failure yet again to provide any increase in the child dependant allowance for a range of social welfare and social insurance payments.  People over 80 years of age will receive a shameful increase of 20p per week.  I can only assume that the attraction of rounding up £4.80 to £5, rather than a caring instinct, motivated this increase.  Our elderly population is increasing, but unfortunately their position will not be improved as a result of this budget.</P>
    <P>In the not too distant past age bestowed almost total protection on the individual from personal assault or insult, but unfortunately the current position is much different.  The recent attacks on the elderly have horrified us and our primary concern is for the victims. I was appalled yesterday when the Taoiseach blocked the introduction by Fianna Fáil of the Misuse of Drugs Bill while saying that we must be mindful of civil rights.  Of course we must be mindful of civil rights and of the rights of criminals, but in the first instance we must be mindful of the rights of victims. It is regrettable that party political advantage is put before the horror of living alone in rural Ireland today.  I work 200 miles away from home and when I am away my wife locks the doors and keeps the dog in the house because she is frightened.  It is regrettable that in such circumstances the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, has not done something tangible in the past year rather than making empty promises. The Government blocked the provision of additional prison spaces last year.</P>
    <P>Two days ago I brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice that the Department of Social Welfare assesses at the rate of 10 per cent the sum of, say, £2,000 that a pensioner may have on deposit in a bank to cover the cost of his or her funeral.  It is not possible to accrue interest at a rate of 10 per cent on a deposit account; one would be lucky to get 1 per cent.  When handling <Col N="1236" /> charges and so on are taken into account, in the case of small amounts on deposit one would accrue only £5 or £10 in interest per annum.  Yet the Department of Social Welfare assesses the notional income of pensioners at a rate of 10 per cent.  Consequently, the elderly keep their money at home and we are all aware of the consequences of that.  I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to charge them the actual interest rate.  Most banks provide machines so that people can get a printout of their accounts stating the interest accrued and so on.  I fail to understand why the actual interest accrued on such accounts cannot be taken into account.  It is probably a case of indifference and that is regrettable.</P>
    <P>We have heard the nonsense about giving people tax relief for installing burglar alarms.  What good would that be to the elderly in receipt of non-contributory pensions who are not in the tax net?  How would they avail of the tax concession?  Why not give them a few pounds so that they could afford to install alarm systems?  I hope the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare are not serious about that because it is nonsensical. Irrespective of the arrogance of office, one must not lose touch with reality.  Some of the measures proposed in this budget are far removed from reality.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Justice to accept the generous advice from this side of the House and to accept legislation such as the Misuse of Drugs Bill. The Government should cease hanging on to party political advantage and respond to the frightening problems that face us.  Every morning on the radio one hears the relatives of victims asking what the Government or the Department of Justice are doing about the problem.  I appeal to the Minister to respond to this particularly depressing and tragic problem and accept our proposals.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for diverting from the fiscal implications of the budget to address the needs and concerns of a most valued but vulnerable section of <Col N="1237" /> our society.  The protection of their wellbeing should be a priority.  Lip service is useless.  We on this side will ensure that the Government is kept on its toes in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for increasing the carer's allowance by £5, the child benefit allowance by £2 and for the changes in the back-to-work scheme, the family income supplement, the extension of the application of child dependant allowance and the criteria associated with assessment for unemployment assistance.  Those measures will benefit the people concerned. However, it is stated in the Principal Features that an allocation of £10 million has been set aside to cover all those measures.  An allocation of £5 million has been set aside for VTOS, £4 million for community employment and £1 million for recruitment.  A sum of £1 million has been provided to cover a subsidy of £80 per week, £4,000 per annum.  That will mean the creation of 250 jobs, but the small print states that there are up to 5,000 places.  There will be 1,000 places under the community employment scheme and a further 1,000 under VTOS, but a sum of only £10 million has been set aside to cover all of those.  Take 5,000 places at £80 per week, 5,000 at £4,000 per year that is £20 million.  This is another confidence trick being perpetrated in this budget.  The Minister cannot have it both ways; he cannot say he will allocate places if he does not put the money aside for them.  It is nonsense to say one thing in the general introduction to the budget when, on reading the small print, it is obvious that the rhetoric is far removed from reality.  This is more of the tinkering and tokenism that is part of this budget.</P>
    <P>The depressing pattern of shadow boxing which emerges from consideration of the social welfare provisions of budget 1996 is repeated again and again throughout the document no matter what one examines, whether it is income tax, PRSI, enterprise monetary measures, benefit in kind, taxation of unemployment or of disability benefit or farming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> Agriculture gets 13 lines in this budget speech, the largest sector of our economy gets 13 lines.  Many agricultural issues need to be addressed.  For example, the export refunds which were painstakingly negotiated and put in place have been reduced by one third. Export refunds are valued at over £300 million.  We were told by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry last November that this was only a temporary measure, that the export refunds would all be restored, that it would not affect cattle or meat prices.  Of course it has; it was bound to.  The difficulty in this budget is that the footprints of tinkering and tokenism are uniform throughout.  There is not a single bold move, flash of inspiration or imagination in any part of it.  The Minister for Finance and his colleagues have indulged to the point of absurdity in the tinkering and tokenism that applies to this budget.</P>
    <P>This business expansion scheme is very good.  It has allowed many projects to go ahead, putting money into worthwhile projects and jobs.  The tinkering that has taken place with the business expansion scheme in this budget is unnecessary and makes no sense.  If there is something wrong with it, why not abolish it?  Do not tinker around with it.  The same applies to the film industry.  We have had a couple of well highlighted problems in the film industry but, by and large, it is a good scheme and we have had some notable successes with it.  If there is a problem with it, do something radical or get rid of it, but to tinker around with it is appalling.</P>
    <P>A committee attitude has applied to decision making by the Government in relation to this budget and we all know what these laborious committee situations produce.  The committee attitude by the bevy of advisers and programme managers is now to be adorned by the left wing cell in the Department of Social Welfare.  The left wing cell is exclusive to the readers of the forum pamphlet, which is available to members and supporters of the Democratic Left.  Never before in my political <Col N="1239" /> lifetime have I seen a situation where applications for a job for which people will be paid at Civil Service rates are handled in this way.  To whom do they apply?  Normally applications are made to the Civil Service Commission and the application form contains the words &ldquo;canvassing will disqualify&rdquo;, but in this case applicants are to send it to Mr. John Gallagher at the headquarters of the Democratic Left.  This is the kind of Government we have, this is the kind of appalling situation we have come to.</P>
    <P>The Minister already has programme managers, special advisers, special assistants, and now apparently there is to be a complete cabal within the Department.  I have been speaking to some people in the Department of Social Welfare and they are appalled, because they have done a good job.  We have a comprehensive social welfare system, the Department has been modernised, it has a good computer system and modern technology, but what happens? If you want to get research done now you go to the Democratic Left cabal within the Department because they have a unit there.</P>
    <P>This unit is paid for by the taxpayer but the real reason for such a unit is that the Minister for Social Welfare and Leader of the Democratic Left wants to match the Leader of the Labour Party who has a special unit in the Department of the Tánaiste.  This habit of Ministers watching one another is a real problem in this Government, which was brought into being without an election; in a desperate attempt to grasp at power no sacrifice was too great to offer to the goddess OTA &mdash; that is, openness, transparency and accountability.  We have seen over the last year what arrant nonsense that was.  Openness, transparency and accountability have been replaced by the DES factor, that is, deception, evasion and secrecy.</P>
    <P>I read in a newspaper recently that this Government is the most secret since the foundation of the State.  Evasion is the order of the day.  You have to ask the right question or you are in dire <Col N="1240" /> trouble.  I have been here for a good while but I have never worked so hard at couching parliamentary questions because if you do not ask the right question you will get either no answer or the minimum of answers.  At this stage the best we can hope for is that these problems will be controlled to some extent until the current rainbow is relieved of power.  That will happen at the earliest possible opportunity because this Government has had two excellent opportunities to tackle with effectiveness and imagination the profound problems facing our society in the mid-1990s. It failed in the 1995 budget and it has failed in an even more abject fashion in the 1996 budget.  It would be irresponsibly optimistic to think that this Government was likely to change its spots at this late stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is a clear statement that this Government values work, wants to encourage job creation and enterprise and, at the same time, and with just as much vigour, wants to ensure that everyone shares in and gains from the successes of the economy.  The Opposition is unable to find fault with the content of this budget.  I listened to Deputy Walsh and he had very little in real terms to say about the budget. Clearly he could not find much to criticise. The Opposition's fanciful notions and wishful thinking about alleged differences in the Government hardly amounts to a serious critique of economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Justice, I wish to answer two points which Deputy Walsh raised in relation to crime.  In respect of the tax relief for older people in the installation of burglar alarms, the Minister for Finance is actively examining how that tax <Col N="1241" /> relief could be availed of, for instance, by family members who may wish to purchase an alarm system on behalf of an old age pensioner, which would frequently be the case.  The Department of Social Welfare is examining how old age pensioners on a social welfare income might be assisted to acquire a security system.  A committee in the Department is actively examining that at the moment and possibly the community welfare officer system or some other suitable mechanism in the Department of Social Welfare will implement it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fundamental debate on the budget and the question of reducing tax, everyone wants to pay less tax.  The essential difference between the Labour Party approach and that of the Progressive Democrats is that the Progressive Democrats simply want to reduce taxes no matter what the cost in terms of loss of social and other services. Tax reduction, not tax reform, is the primary aim to which all will be sacrificed. They like to call their proposals &ldquo;reform&rdquo; but reduction is what they are talking about.  We in the Labour Party want to ensure that all members of society share in the fruits of ecomomic growth.  The truth is that the Progressive Democrats are madly envious of the fact that this Government is succeeding not just in controlling public expenditure but in ensuring a greater share for the less well off.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are trying to appeal to self-interest and the public interest at the same time.  Their recipe is similar to that of the new American right &mdash; a seemingly attractive set of slogans which the American unemployed and low and middle income workers now realise is a recipe for poverty and social disaster.  In the context of the debate which we are rightly having at this stage about crime, the social consequences of our policies in relation to expenditure must be given equal consideration with policies in relation to tax cutting.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the enormous disparity between the rhetoric of the Opposition and their record in <Col N="1242" /> Government.  Deputy Harney and her Progressive Democrats colleagues who were Ministers in the previous Government to November 1993 will want to bury forever from public view the end product of their three years in office.</P>
    <P>Under Deputy O'Malley as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the number of people at work at the end of 1992 showed only a minuscule increase despite a budget in that year described by Deputy Harney as a &ldquo;liberation budget for taxpayers&rdquo;.  By contrast this year there are at least 40,000 more at work at the end of 1995, the first year ever of a Labour Finance Minister.</P>
    <P>Do homeowners remember the agony they endured as interest rates reached 13 per cent and 14 per cent in 1992? Today the rates are less that half that level with reasonable prospects of a further reduction and both the housing market and the associated construction industry are working full throttle.  The Progressive Democrats obviously think its tawdry record in office has been forgotten as it now launches more of its wild promises.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is happy to match its record in office over three years under any heading with that of the Progressive Democrats in the previous three years.  No one can argue that more progress has been made towards peace in the North and on broad social issues during Labour's period in office, but even on their own chosen ground we can match them and do better.  Public spending is a case in point.  It holds pride of place in the party's stated policy. Yet in 1995, under a Labour Minister for Finance, the share of national wealth devoted to public spending, current and capital combined, was less than in either 1991 or 1992.  Again this is something Deputy Harney will want to sweep under the carpet.</P>
    <P>I have read at length the Progressive Democrats document, although I have not completed my analysis of it and I would like to make some points about the hidden traps in the document.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats do not, of course, draw attention to the fact that <Col N="1243" /> they will not give double the tax allowance and tax bands to one income married couples.  Buried among their much heralded proposals for reduced taxation is the abandonment of the principle that married couples get double tax allowances and tax bands.  This is a fundamental change in tax policy and the document does not even advert to it.  In other words, they do not want attention drawn to their failure to have regard to families and their welfare.  They are proposing that a married couple would get less in tax allowances than two single people.  This is discrimination against marriage.  They need to answer questions about this &mdash; how do they propose to deal with married couples where each has an income?  Are they going to deliberately treat such couples less favourably than a two income non-married couple?  I do not believe it can do that under tax law.  What do they have to say to the woman or the man working in the home?  In their enthusiasm for tax reduction at any cost they forgot to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>The other great unmentionable in the PD document is child benefit.  That party will never increase child benefit because of its view of never allowing public spending to increase.  I am proud to have been the Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare who started the increases in child benefit in 1993 and to have been in Government for the past four budgets during which child benefit doubled in value.  Child benefit is a central plank of the attack on poverty in families.  The major increases in this benefit in the past few years are testament to our commitment to families and children; there is no sign in the Progressive Democrats document that families and children were even considered.</P>
    <P>I would like to give practical advice to Deputy Harney and Deputy Michael McDowell.  Child benefit, for women without an income from working outside the home, is usually the only income over which they have direct control. It enables them to spend the money <Col N="1244" /> on their families.  Why should Deputy Harney decide to completely ignore child benefit?  She must answer that serious question.</P>
    <P>As regards education, the Progressive Democrats document says that &ldquo;A falling birth rate will ease demand for primary education and child support services&rdquo;. Again, the difference between the Labour Party and the Government's approach from that of the Progressive Democrats is that we will use the advantage of a falling birth rate to improve primary education and child support services.  Deputy Harney and Deputy O'Donnell have often spoken with genuine feeling and commitment about the need for child support services, but they are obviously low on their list of priorities in relation to spending because Deputy Harney is now saying that desirable social services have a lower priority than reducing taxation.</P>
    <P>This is part of the PD hidden agenda. They will reduce tax for single people but at the expense of married people, particularly married people where one of the couple has chosen to stay at home or has no option but to stay at home.  I say to the Irish public &mdash; beware of large print tax reduction; read the small print and the unprinted; the cost of tax reduction is a major loss of essential social services.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democratss want to remove employee PRSI altogether.  This sounds very attractive but people should be reminded of what can happen if the contributory principle is lost.  The New Zealand social welfare system is non-contributory. It was, therefore, possible for the New Zealand Government to end a much cherished right of people to a non-means tested old age pension. This is what removing the contributory principle means.  Can the Progressive Democrats leadership answer the people of Ireland: is it their intention to abolish the contributory old age pension? The big print says you do not pay PRSI, the unprinted speaks volumes.</P>
    <P>At the same time they want to reduce the self-employed PRSI from 5.5 per cent to 1 per cent.  The fact that it is <Col N="1245" /> actually 5 per cent seems to have escaped their notice but then why bother with facts when you are promising Utopia?</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points in the document, including a purported analysis of two capital projects based on different rates of taxation.  I have lectured on taxation and if a leaving certificate student gave me this as an analysis I would throw it back at them because it is so flawed.  The document also includes the concept of a State services agency which is worthy of attention because it is along the lines of the strategic management initiative where Departments would perform core functions and services would be delegated to agencies.  The cost of creating agencies &mdash; this would apply to every Department &mdash; is substantial because there is a board and an independent set up.  One only does this if one can see a more efficient delivery of service.  Yet if this document were to be implemented, 100 such agencies would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the Progressive Democrats are appealing to the middle income group who may feel that they did not do as well as expected in this budget.  The middle income group is benefiting not just from tax reductions but also from the reduction in PRSI, the abolition of third level fees and, most of all, from the low inflation and low interest regime.  The Minister for Finance's success &mdash; actual achievement and not just rhetoric &mdash; of keeping public expenditure under control means that interest rates will stay low and possibly reduce further.  This budget represents real improvements for social welfare recipients, for the unemployed and for low and middle income earners while improving essential and desirable social services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing is clear &mdash; this is a good budget. It is a prudent, cohesive, co-ordinated, imaginative and caring budget.  Above all, it is a budget that it tightly focused <Col N="1246" /> around the central national objective of creating more jobs.</P>
      <P>This is a prudent budget because it keeps us within the guidelines of the Maastricht Treaty.  Nobody could doubt that we are keeping our economic house firmly in order.  The budget also seeks to create long-term sustained benefits for our people rather than quick fixes or flashy give-aways.  It is cohesive and co-ordinated to ensure that each element will build on another.  As a result its overall impact adds up to more than the sum of its parts.  That is in stark contrast to previous budgets which were just a series of unconnected measures strung together.  The budget is imaginative in the way it leverages our resources to get the greatest results from them.  By homing in on key areas where we can make a real difference, it aims to create results that in many cases will be out of proportion to the money spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a caring budget because it sets the right priorities between the haves and the have-nots in our society.  It focuses its energy on moving us towards a situation in which everyone will have a job.  If we wanted proof that this is an excellent budget we have only to listen to the rhetoric of the Opposition since Tuesday afternoon.  The best they can manage is a rerun of the usual stuff &mdash; lame attempts to paint a picture of divisions among the Government parties and arguing that one or other element of the Government has lost out.  People are not fooled by this sort of rhetoric. Instinctively they recognise that this Government is working well, that its diversity is a strength, not a weakness. This is a Government that is united in the goals it has set itself and in its determination to achieve those goals within the lifetime of this Dáil.  It is a Government that this week produced a &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; budget &mdash; a winner for each of the parties in Government and, more important, for every person in the country. It is a winner for those in work, for those who wish to be in work, for the disadvantaged in our society and for those who have the good fortune to be better off.  People will not judge this <Col N="1247" /> budget on what anybody in this House says about it but on what it achieves. They look back on what we did last year and know it has worked.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget played a central role in creating one of the best years for the economy in a generation.  Forty-five thousand more people are at work, inflation is low and stable, short-term interest rates are at their lowest for 20 years, mortgage rates are at their lowest for 30 years, exports are growing fast and confidence is returning to the country at business and personal levels.  A decisive corner has been turned.</P>
    <P>People do not need to be told that we are the fastest growing economy in Europe.  They can see the evidence all around them.  We still have serious problems and we have a long way to go but, at last, we have begun to move and we are getting there.  When this budget comes to be judged, it will be on the basis of what people think it will deliver, and what it will deliver is a major step forward in stimulating enterprise and job creation.  That is what people want and it is what they will get.</P>
    <P>For years we have talked about the barriers to employment, the poverty traps that undermine the incentive to take up a job.  In this budget we are putting in place a raft of measures that are geared to diminishing those barriers. Working together these measures will shift the balance once and for all.  The barriers cannot all be removed overnight, but never before has there been such a concerted attack on them.  For years we have talked about the constantly increasing problem of people who have been unemployed over the long-term.  The Government has faced up to the hard truth that creating more jobs in the economy will not automatically redress the problem.  The problem can get worse even as the overall level of employment goes up.  The needs of people seeking work must get special attention.  There must be positive discrimination, targeted assistance and a full-scale urgent attack on the problem, not just genuflections to it.  The <Col N="1248" /> measures aimed at long-term unemployment in this budget are a real attempt to come to terms with the most unacceptable and tragic dimensions of our employment problem.  What we are proposing will not solve the problem in one go, but the scale of these measures can make a decisive difference over the next 12 months.  Instead of fiddling around with the issue, the Government has grasped the nettle firmly.</P>
    <P>Employment and enterprise are two sides of the one coin, and stimulating enterprise is at the very heart of job creation.  This budget recognises that.  It puts in place a co-ordinated set of measures that will create better conditions for business, especially the smaller businesses that are the backbone of our economy and the service businesses that provide most of the potential for job creation in the future.</P>
    <P>There are at least seven ways these measures will stimulate enterprise.  They will stimulate enterprise by cutting the cost of employment by reducing the impact of PRSI where it does most damage; by reducing corporation tax for small firms, increasing the return to their promoters and making it easier to reinvest in the future growth of the business; by streamlining the costly and time wasting burden of compliance with tax regulations, a burden that is especially heavy on smaller companies; by reducing the cost for family firms of passing the business from one generation to another which will help family businesses to grow stronger, not weaker, as time goes on; by stepping up our national effort on research and development through the speedy implementation of the recommendations in the recent STIAC report; by beginning a major new redevelopment in the Dublin docklands area, building on the success already achieved at the Custom House Docks and &mdash; a measure that specifically affects my Department &mdash; stimulating enterprise in the field of minerals development by providing new tax concessions relating to expenditure on the rehabilitation of mine sites.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> These are some of the elements that will work to create growth in the year ahead.  However, they represent only a tiny fraction of the overall work of this Government in putting in place the conditions in which business activity can thrive.  In my Department we are pursuing a strategy which is aimed at creating a competitive, customer driven infrastructure across the entire range of transport, energy and communications. If those sectors are competitive, the economy as a whole is helped to be competitive.  That competitiveness is a precondition of growth and growth is a precondition for creating more jobs.</P>
    <P>We have turned an important corner in the past year.  One aspect of the change is that we have moved decisively away from a period of jobless growth. For several years the economy was growing at a respectable rate, but this did not result in more people at work. Last year that changed.  Now we are experiencing growth that flows through into a sizable number of jobs.  We are also experiencing the beginning of what may well be a virtuous circle &mdash; growth creates jobs, those jobs create more spending, and that spending in turn creates more jobs, especially in the highly labour intensive services sector. This is an opportunity we must take hold of and turn to our permanent advantage.</P>
    <P>The tide is running with us.  We should not be content to be just carried along with it; we must use it to accelerate progress.  That is what this budget is about.  It seeks to deliver to the Irish people the greatest possible dividend from the favourable conditions that we are experiencing at present.  I am fully confident that in the year ahead these measures will create significant new wealth and new jobs which will benefit everyone living in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister, Deputy Lowry said this was a prudent, cohesive, co-ordinated, imaginative and caring budget I waited applause from the public gallery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister.  Budgets <Col N="1250" /> have always contained two or three outstanding different initiatives, but this is the most unexciting and boring budget &mdash; as boring as the Government itself. On Budget Day the small number of people in the public gallery to hear what was contained in the budget reflected that fact.  This is simply a budget of containment; it does not have any striking measures.  It is neither radical nor courageous and it has the hallmarks of an Administration which has simply decided to survive until the next election by playing it safe.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, playing it safe will not create jobs and will not realise the full potential of a vibrant and growing economy. Some of my colleagues referred to people like Sean Lemass and what he might think of this type of Government. As my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, said, Sean Lemass took chances, he made some mistakes but he introduced some exciting policies that have had long-term positive implications for this country.</P>
    <P>This budget has failed dismally in a number of specific areas, namely, the current borrowing requirement, the crucial issue of PRSI and tax and their relationship to employment creation, corporation tax and the small business sector.  The Minister for Finance has failed to eliminate the current borrowing requirement despite us now being in our sixth successive year of economic growth.  In simple language, despite growth last year of 7 per cent and growth of at least 5 per cent this year we continue to spend beyond our means on day to day expenditure.  When there is an inevitable downturn in the global and Irish economies, such foolish action will be seen for what it is &mdash; very poor housekeeping.</P>
    <P>The Minister set himself a target of £82 million as a deficit on the current side of the budget.  Having regard to the conservative figures he gave for growth and revenue for 1996, there is little doubt he will beat this figure and come in with a current budget surplus at the end of 1996, but that is merely a charade. In 1994, Deputy Bertie Ahern, now <Col N="1251" /> Leader of our party, came in with a current budget surplus even though he had a target of £264 million.  To continue to borrow for day to day spending when the economy is performing so well is imprudent and should be seen for what it is.</P>
    <P>On PRSI, tax and the infamous tax wedge, the changes introduced by the Minister do not go any way towards rectifying a very difficult situation.  What the Minister has done amounts to merely nibbling at the fringes.  There was some speculation that he might be radical in this area but the cut from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent or from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent will not encourage employers to hire additional staff.  The Minister has been told by me, my colleagues and many lobby groups that a radical overhaul of the tax and social welfare codes is required and I suggest he has dismally failed to do that.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom, our main competitors, we can see the difference. They pay comparatively lower social insurance rates than ourselves.  Comparative rates in the UK, even after this budget, are still up to 40 per cent lower than in Ireland.  The Minister has now exempted employee earnings of below £80 per week but the employer must still fork out huge amounts.  The changes may encourage people to take low paid jobs but will employers be encouraged to take people on?  As a result of these changes I believe they will not.</P>
    <P>In the United Kindgom the comparison speaks volumes.  The system is graduated.  Up to £57 the employer makes no contribution while on earnings between £57 and £100 he pays 3.6 per cent.  From £100 to £144.99 the rate is 5.6 per cent; from £145 to £200 the rate is 7.6 per cent and over £200 the rate is 10.2 per cent.  Those figures indicate clearly that the Minister has turned his back on Irish employers who have sought Government support for their efforts to deal with our main competitors in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> The move on corporation tax is welcome but it falls far short of what is required.  Companies, specifically small companies, have little incentive to maximise their profits.  By and large their owners shy away from building up their firms because of the scale of tax they must pay.  To move to a 30 per cent tax rate for small companies on the first £50,000 of taxable income is a paltry step in the right direction.  It has been reported that it will cost in the region of £1 million annually.  The Minister Deputy Quinn should have gone much further and accepted the budget submission by the Small Firms Association which had sought a rate of 27 per cent on the first £100,000 in profits.  It would not have cost much more and would have contributed to an enterprise society.  Fianna Fáil, in its policy document Pathway to Work, launched last week, supports a new 27 per cent rate for small businesses.</P>
    <P>I will compare the services sector where more than 80 per cent of all small companies operate with the sector in the United Kingdom where the flat rate of tax is 17.5 per cent as opposed to 21 per cent.  More importantly, a UK company earning profits of less than £300,000 will pay tax at a rate of 24 per cent and 33 per cent above that.</P>
    <P>By and large the Minister avoided attacking the old reliables although he hit cigarettes and petrol.  The petrol price increases are a move in the wrong direction.  Ireland is a peripheral nation. We have enough difficulties trying to cope with geographical disadvantages without the Minister compounding them by increasing the cost of transport. Increasing petrol prices increases transport costs for retail goods and so indirectly pushes up the cost of living.</P>
    <P>On the residential property tax, while the Minister has promised changes he has announced nothing.  There is little doubt in my mind that this tax fails each of the criterion for a good and fair tax. It is inequitable in that those in urban centres are treated harshly while those outside the main population centres <Col N="1253" /> remain largely outside the net.  It is inefficient in so far as it is impossible to administer and the small amounts being collected are not worth the time, effort and energy being expended by the Revenue Commissioners.  My advice to the Minister is to forget about this tax.</P>
    <P>On some specific aspects of the budget, as my party's spokesperson for labour affairs I must stress the difficulties of the long-term unemployed people who are out of work for more than one year.  Of the 133,000 people who are long-term unemployed, 92,000 have been out of work for more than two years and 68,000 have been out of work for more than three years.  Clearly Fianna Fáil is anxious the Government should come to the assistance of these people.  The issue should be attacked vigorously on two fronts.  The first is tax reform, but sadly nothing radical has happened in the budget on this front. There has been no change in the tax bands for the PAYE sector which I believe has implications for a forth-coming national wage agreement.  I am sure we will hear more about that in the months ahead.  Second, we believe there should be a targeted intervention approach for the long-term unemployed. We have seen some progress in this area but having listened to the public submissions from the parties we have ended up with a hotchpotch of ideas from three parties.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh made the point that the spectacle of three parties jostling for positions in the run-up to the budget would be comical were we not dealing with such a serious subject.  It is a sad day for democracy when a Government Minister &mdash; I am referring to the Minister of State at the Department of Enteprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; has to arrange a press conference with its attendant public relations support to seek £10 million from the Government for research in science and technology. The Minister of State was allocated £4 million in the budget.  Is it not terrible <Col N="1254" /> that a Minister has to conduct his business in public with the assistance of PR support?  I agree with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs who told Deputy Rabbitte that the place for a Minister to make his case is around the Cabinet table.  It is a sadder day when certain members of the Irish media tolerate this cynical posturing by the Democratic Left Minister of State by providing widespread media coverage of his political game play.  Can we blame the public for being so cynical?</P>

      <P>I remember the three administrations when Ray MacSharry, Deputies Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern prepared the budget.  Game plays did not take place then.  It is important that as a nation we do not have this play acting.  This is a delicate growing economy and it is important that the business community and those who wish to invest have confidence in the country.  If Ministers adopt this new approach, despite what we have heard about openness and other new ideas <Col N="1255" /> from the Government, it is a serious development.  I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment will refer to this point in his reply.  We have heard a great deal from this Government on honesty, integrity and accountability but the bubble burst long ago on this false claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred already to the questions arising from the divorce campaign and the involvement of QMP and I believe there are questions to be answered on the involvement of Mr. Finlay, the Tánaiste's adviser.  Mr. Finlay has not explained adequately why he was so centrally involved when it was a matter for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and his Department.  It is also interesting to note that Mr. Finlay went out of his way in his recent interview on RTE to protect the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs by saying that the Tánaiste had no involvement in this matter whatsoever and that he made all the necessary decisions.  In contrast, during the inquiry into the collapse of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, he went out of his way to inform us that Deputy Spring made all his own decisions and that he [Mr. Finlay] was merely an adviser in the background.  Any objective analyst would come to the conclusion that Mr. Finlay's role in the QMP affair was much more than that of an adviser in the background.  This episode raises serious questions concerning the workings of this Government, ministerial responsibility and the democratic process.  Nobody on this side of the House is querying this particular company &mdash; I have stated in public that QMP is a company of the highest quality which worked with the Department of the Taoiseach during my period as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs.  I have nothing but respect for those who provided very valuable and professional services to the Taoiseach's Department during the lifetime of the last Government.  However, I believe I am entitled to raise the manner in which the Government operated <Col N="1256" /> when dealing with this issue.  I can only surmise the reactions of Deputies Rabbitte and Kemmy if the roles were reversed and they were in Opposition.  It is important to make that point.  People have accused my party of such dealings but when we see hypocrisy and double standards it is our duty to expose them and I do so in good faith.</P>
    <P>The first month of 1996 has shown that the crime crisis will simply not go away.  Yesterday we discussed this issue under the shadow of the horrific deaths in Milltown, County Kildare, Oranmore, County Galway and County Kerry.  There is no doubt that the crime wave has spread throughout this country and is no longer an urban problem. Our older citizens are living in fear of what lies around the corner.  My party has urged the Minister for Justice to introduce legislation on the misuse of drugs, criminal and bail laws.  The Private Members' Bills put forward by Deputy John O'Donoghue, our Justice spokesperson, have met with a negative response.  He has also sought the provision of additional prison spaces.  I hope the Minister will respond quickly on the legislative front and act in a hands-on manner in motivating and uniting the Garda Síochána and giving them the required resources to do their job.  There would be tremendous public support for the Minister if she had a much more hands-on approach to the problem.  The current crime crisis demands a national response and I am convinced that the Garda Síochána alone have not sufficient manpower to cope with what is a national emergency. I appreciate there are regional meetings and plans in place.  I suggest the Minister for Justice in co-operation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and any other relevant Ministers initiate as a matter of urgency a national scheme of community policing and neighbourhood watch.  It is a serious proposal and I ask the Government to note it.</P>
    <P>The budget contains many good schemes, such as community employment schemes, which will be expanded. <Col N="1257" /> Additional people will be taken on to do all types of useful work, such as those who provide services as caretakers, etc., in many parts of the country.  Under the umbrella of the existing community employment and FÁS schemes, a new national scheme could be tailored to suit remote rural areas.  Local unemployed people could be given jobs, through a FÁS community employment scheme, which would involve caring for the elderly and those living alone.  They could check on those who are extremely fearful at present by calling daily, particularly in the evenings and at night.  This would be a useful element in trying to alleviate existing fears.</P>
    <P>In urban and suburban areas, a different type of scheme is necessary because the same sense of community in rural villages does not exist in those places.  A new scheme under the umbrella of community employment and FÁS schemes could be organised which would involve long-term unemployed people getting jobs as security men.  They could patrol estates at night in Dublin and other urban areas.  The personnel involved would have to undergo a careful selection process and work closely with the Garda through radio contact, etc.  The security needs are so serious at present that, sadly, people must be paid to carry out this type of work.</P>
    <P>The voluntary neighbourhood watch scheme is fine and working well in some areas.  However, a national response to the current crisis is required.  A proactive and effective plan must be put in place to meet the needs of citizens. People working on a scheme of this nature could be selected by the local community council or association and approved by the Garda.  They must command the trust of the residents in the locality.  This proposal is practical and the EU appears to agree.  In its White Paper on growth and competitiveness, the EU Commission stated care for the elderly is an important and growing area of employment within the EU.</P>
    <P>However, this will work only if it is implemented with the full support of the <Col N="1258" /> Minister for Justice, the Government and the Garda.  The people employed on a national scheme of community policing and neighbourhood watch would work in close co-operation and keep in constant contact with the local Garda.  If the Government put such a scheme in place, the fears and anxieties of thousands of people throughout the country would be eased.  It should not be viewed as a panic reaction to the current crisis. Unfortunately, crime will be with us for some time into the future and a measured and comprehensive community response is required.  The Government can lead such a response if it has the will to do so.  I hope such a will exists.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, earlier regarding the tax relief of £800 for elderly people who purchase an alarm system.  She said other ideas might be considered, for example, the involvement of a son or daughter who pays tax.  My advice to the Government is to scrap this scheme.  It is daft because many elderly people do not pay tax or even understand the tax system.  A simple grant should be provided and matters left at that.  Every budget contains a daft proposal and this is it in this budget.  I ask the Government to immediately recognise that point and change it to a grant system.  A number of people mentioned to me that a way to encourage elderly people to remove money they keep in their houses, for example, under mattresses, would be for credit unions to devise a scheme which would assist and encourage them to deposit their money.</P>
    <P>Close examination of the principal features of the budget throws up a number of anomalies, one of which relates to low wage earners.  A married couple, with no children and one earner of £8,000 a year makes a net gain of £246, but a married couple with two children and one earner of £8,000 a year makes a net gain of £114.  I ask the Minister to note this point.  I am concerned that a married couple with two children fare worse than a couple with no children.  I appreciate these matters are noted and <Col N="1259" /> perhaps the Minister will come back to me on this point.</P>
    <P>This side supports any new initiatives to get people out of the social welfare system and back to work, ideally with a permanent job.  The Government proposal is a recruitment subsidy of £80 a week to be paid to employers for taking on a new employee.  However, this is nothing new because FÁS ran a similar scheme for years.  The Government has reinvented the proposal.  I have serious concerns about the idea of a subsidy because it is open to abuse and will keep wages down.  It could lead to a low wage regime.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil proposals of a tax allowance for the long-term unemployed who move into employment and double tax deductions for employers are much more practical and realistic.  They would provide a much better chance of creating more real jobs, which is what we all ultimately desire.  A long-term unemployed person who took a job would receive a special tax allowance for the first three years of their employment, amounting to £3,000 plus £1,000 per child in the first year.  It would taper off over a three year period.</P>
    <P>This would provide the necessary incentive to move into employment by making the person's net new position better than if they were on unemployment benefit.  The employer would also gain by receiving a double tax deduction for the wages and PRSI of the individual. It is a focused approach, specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed.  I am convinced it would have a real impact in reducing the long-term unemployment figures.  I am also convinced that a special tax allowance would prove much more attractive to employees and employers than the £80 subsidy.</P>
    <P>My party's proposals on job creation are largely based on the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Forum.  We strongly support the establishment of a national local employment service and we are committed to the target of reducing long-term unemployment to 20,000 over six years. <Col N="1260" /> The Government has wasted six months since the publication of the NESF report on the long-term unemployed and had done little to progress the proposed local employment service.  Such a service, on a national basis, should provide one to one guidance to those looking for work in relation to CVs, job interviews, approaching employers, etc. The close involvement of local employers is essential in establishing what type of job opportunities exist in the locality.  This idea works well on the city's northside.</P>
    <P>I have given little credit to the Government but I agree with the proposal that people who have been employed for at least one year can retain their medical cards for three years after entering employment.  My party also put this proposal forward. There will be an increase of 1,000 places on the vocational training opportunities scheme, which is run by the Department of Education.  However, I remind the Government that it cut back this scheme; it is simply restoring places which had been taken away.</P>
    <P>The Government's game plan is clear in a budget which finally emerged after weeks of jostling.  The Government is keeping its head down, playing it safe, saying as little as possible and doing nothing.  The game plan will produce a few goodies closer to an election.  There will be real fun then in terms of jostling because the pitch will be crowded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>It is the most uninteresting budget in the history of the Dáil and this was evident from the mute reaction from the gallery.  The parties in this dull Government are watching each other.  They have been exposed and are not fooling anyone.  No initiatives were taken in the budget.  There is much mention of committees and task forces but action has been put on the long finger. In the meantime the economy and the unemployed lose out.  The sooner the Government ends this charade and <Col N="1261" /> turns off the lights the better for the people.  We have a delicate growing economy that requires a good, strong, united, decisive Government and that is sadly lacking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our game plan is safe if what I have heard Deputy Kitt say is the best shot that can be made at it.  Listening to him I am more convinced than ever that one year after Fianna Fáil commenced counselling for loss of power it is still in denial.  It is a condition that takes some time to get out of the system but I recommend that it continues with the therapy.  It is very important to do so.</P>
      <P>I agree this is a disappointing, dispiriting and disheartening budget for Fianna Fáil.  The hapless soldiers of destiny see what they consider to be their natural destiny, power, slip even further from their grasp.  The budget on Tuesday was a good day's work from this point of view.</P>
      <P>Take the example of the pro-employment measures in this budget: 5,000 extra places on the back to work allowance scheme; 5,000 new places created on the £80 per week subsidy scheme; 5,000 places on the work trials scheme; 1,000 places for over 35s who are long-term unemployed; 1,000 additional places on the VTOS scheme; retention of child dependant allowances for 13 weeks when an unemployed person takes up work; retention of medical card for three years after the unemployed person takes up work; improvements in family income supplement for low paid workers; easing the tax burden on the low paid; PRSI reductions for employees and employers; no tax to be paid if your income is below £75 a week for a single earner or £150 a week for a married person; and no PRSI payable on the first £80 of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither is the budget the crushingly selfish, vicious and cruel budget favoured by the Progressive Democrats and prescribed from her Middle Abbey Street platform by Mary Ellen Synon.  In <Col N="1262" /> this respect, it was an even better day's work.</P>
    <P>For the people of Ireland, and particularly for the unemployed, this is a heartening and hopeful budget.  It is another reforming budget, one that confirms the cohesion of this Government, the coherence of its policies and the concern of the Government parties to ensure that the fruits of growth are shared by all.</P>
    <P>One could not grace the Fianna Fáil response to date to the budget with the term &ldquo;coherent&rdquo;.  To do so would be an abuse of the English language.  Deputy McCreevy took us for a ramble through the woods to view the teddy bears picnic &mdash; the truth is Deputy McCreevy cannot see the wood for the trees.  Last year he told us that Democratic Left had no influence and would have no influence on this Government.  This year he tells us the Government is run by Democratic Left.  Both statements are nonsense and typical of Deputy McCreevy's bombast.</P>
    <P>The people know that Deputy McCreevy's performance as Minister for Social Welfare well qualifies him for the role of big bad wolf.  Despite returning the highest rate of public spending in ten years in coalition with the Progressive Democrat soulmates, Deputy McCreevy gained a reputation as the infamous author of the dirty dozen cuts that penalised those on social welfare.  I have some news for the gormless Deputy McCreevy &mdash; the day that his warnings about Democratic Left in Government would work is long gone. We are today too mature and sensible a society to swallow the diversions he engaged in as a fig leaf for his inability to give an economic critique of the budget.  The political anatomy of this Government, furthermore, is not as he suggests.  This is a Government in which there is real unity of purpose between all three political parties.</P>
    <P>This pathetic echoing of the cry from Middle Abbey Street rings utterly hollow. Is Fianna Fáil saying that it is opposed to the social welfare increases? <Col N="1263" /> Is it opposed to the measures introduced to tackle long-term unemployment, a legacy we inherited from its seven years in office?  Is it opposed to the measures to reward work and enterprise?</P>
    <P>For the Progressive Democrats, on the other hand, this much can be said: it is at least consistent.  Its commitment to cruelty, cuts and social chaos is constantly argued.  It argues for large-scale tax cuts to be paid for by wholesale spending cuts.</P>
    <P>This is a calculated play for the selfish streak in society.  It is a formula that would undermine the social welfare system, cut back on health spending and consign the least well off to being forever marginalised.  It is, I concede, a coherent policy on the part of the Progressive Democrats but it is the politics of a decade ago and, most assuredly, will be rejected by the electorate.</P>
    <P>Ministers individually and the Government collectively have repeatedly stressed that the overarching theme of this budget is tackling long-term unemployment.  In the midst of remarkable economic growth the overall level of unemployment remains unacceptably high and long-term unemployment is the intractable component.  It has increased rapidly in Ireland since 1980 and now affects around a tenth of the labour force and half of all those on the dole.  We have the most severe long-term unemployment problem in Europe, inherited from the previous Fianna Fáil administration.  Even the high rate of economic growth and record rate of employment creation is unlikely to have any significant impact on the hard core problem of long-term unemployment without special labour market interventions and policy measures.</P>
    <P>This is no empty assertion.  It is the conclusion of the task force on long-term unemployment.  The central thesis of the task force report is that the long-term unemployment problem will not be solved by our booming growth.</P>
    <P>It confined itself to one area of policy, <Col N="1264" /> what it calls employment options, those interventions such as community employment organised by the State and undertaken mainly by public sector agencies, voluntary bodies and local communities.</P>
    <P>The principal focus of employment options is work experience and training in the context of social provision of services and amenities.  By and large the jobs provided are not in the market-based, profit economy.  Employment options are a vital component in the armoury of anti-unemployment measures, but by definition they constitute only part of the attack on long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>We also need incentives to employment creation such as job and employ-ment-friendly tax and welfare systems, initiatives in the areas of education and training and positive discrimination in favour of the long-term unemployed through effective targeting of the big urban blackspots that lie at the heart of the phenomenon of long-term unemployment. Looked at in the round and from this standpoint, the budget last Tuesday represents a comprehensive and definitive package.</P>
    <P>The number of places available through employment options is to be increased and also better targeted at the long-term unemployed.  CE is to be targeted virtually exclusively at the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Particularly important is the allocation of 1,000 extra places within the CE system for over 35s who have been out of work for five years and the special measures introduced for 18 and 19 year olds who are jobless and usually early school leavers, a group seriously at risk of joining the long-term unemployed. Every year about 3,000 to 4,000 young people enter a life on the dole. That is an utterly unacceptable feature of modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Significant moves have been made in the tax-welfare systems to make them more employment friendly and reduce the effects of poverty traps and problems such as the tax wedge.  The Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare <Col N="1265" /> have developed an integrated package which ensures that the tax burden on the lower paid has been eased; there are PRSI reductions for employers and workers; child dependant allowances and the medical card will not suddenly be withdrawn on taking up employment; FIS is being further improved to help low paid workers and PAYE and PRSI thresholds have been raised.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced and changes made to the tax and welfare systems will have two effects.  They will make taking a job rather than remaining on the dole a rational choice for the unemployed, in other words, the budget continues the process of restoring the incentive to work.  Equally, many jobs will also be saved.  The structuring of the reductions in employers' PRSI will help many companies facing difficult competitive market conditions as a result of currency market movements, in other words, the tax and welfare package helps competitiveness.  For example, a company employing 12 people and with an average wage bill of £12,500 per employee, will have a saving of £5,000 on its PRSI bill.</P>
    <P>Overall, as my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment pointed out yesterday, two-thirds of all employees are now subject to the low PRSI rate of 8.5 per cent.  Only a couple of years ago all of these workers and the firms in which they were employed were subject to a PRSI rate in excess fo 12 per cent.  Who says we are not rewarding enterprise and work?  Those who do &mdash; whether from the Opposition benches or their media soapboxes &mdash; simply do not know what they are talking about or are engaged in a deliberate campaign of spreading misinformation.</P>
    <P>This budget will also have an impact in the area of job creation.  As part of the social welfare package 5,000 extra places will be provided under the back to work allowance.  Another 5,000 places will be created under the £80 a week jobs subsidy.  The jobs subsidy is particularly imaginative.  It was a central recommendation of the study, &ldquo;Sharing <Col N="1266" /> our Growth&rdquo;, prepared in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>Hiring people who are long-term unemployed is not an attractive proposition to many employers.  Such people are likely to have become demoralised, demotivated and deskilled.  There are, therefore, costs associated with hiring long-term unemployed people &mdash; training, morale building and reintegrating them into the world of work.  The jobs subsidy in some sense recognises this and provides employers with a level of subsidy, a contribution towards the extra costs incurred when taking on a long-term unemployed person.</P>
    <P>On the tax side, the reduction in corporation tax will benefit all companies, but mostly smaller firms.  This latter category of company has proved to be a major creator of employment in recent years.  Their enterprise is now being rewarded and the adjustment made in capital acquisitions tax business relief further facilitates the transfer of family businesses, a crucially important part of our economic landscape.</P>
    <P>Employees also will gain.  Personal allowances are being raised.  The standdard rate band is being widened.  The combined effects of the tax and PRSI changes for employers and employees are positive.  What this amounts to is a practical, socially acceptable and responsible policy of rewarding enterprise and work, not the kind of headline grabbing, cruel and chaotic policy glibly trotted out by the Progressive Democrats.  It is also a major advance on anything &mdash; which is to say nothing &mdash; being put forward by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>This budget goes some significant way towards introducing positive discrimination in favour of the long-term unemployed. At present only an estimated less than 10 per cent of the relevant job vacancies are captured and filled by people who are long-term unemployed. This is not a fair outcome of market forces. Of an estimated 120,000 job vacancies that arise every year in the market-place, less than 10 per cent go to the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> The jobs subsidy and the maintenance of social welfare benefits are positive discrimination measures, as is the retention of the medical card for three years. In addition, the 1,000 new places for the over 35s represent positive discrimination &mdash; this is a group of people who are over-represented in the live register. Also in the budget is the introduction of a job trials scheme.  Job trials have proved themselves in other countries.  The introduction of job trials was recommended in the report, &ldquo;Sharing our Growth&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Central to the adoption of the philosophy of positive discrimination is the development of the local employment service.  The LES is a major innovation. It was recommended by the National Economic and Social Forum.  In this regard the acceptance of the LES recommendation by IBEC and ICTU is important.  LES will build on the success achieved by the likes of the Ballymun employment centre and the northside area partnership in establishing positive links between the unemployed and private sector market based companies. The local employment service will have national direction, provided by the Department of Enterprise and Employment in co-operation with the developing agencies and the Department of Social Welfare.  It will be locally and community based and it will draw the private sector more firmly into the fight against long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is very important to understand the essence of the local employment service. It is effectively a jobs placement agency based in the community, participative of employers and community activists who will establish links with local private sector and other employers and provide them with employment ready persons from the live register.  Employers are not interested in getting 25 or 30 people for interview, none of whom is suitable for the job specification.  They want people who are employment ready and suited to the job for which a vacancy arises.  That system is working well in the northside project and there is no <Col N="1268" /> reason it cannot be imported into other black spots.  That is at the heart of the local employment service concept.</P>
    <P>Our war on long-term unemployment is based on four pillars &mdash; the expansion and more effective targeting employment options; new measures in the area of employment creation; rewarding enterprise and work and positive discrimination in favour of the long-term unemployed.  In real terms, as my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare pointed out in this House yesterday, the social welfare increases are among the best improvements in the last ten years. Many of the welfare payments are at the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, some are in excess of the recommended target minimum rate and virtually all of the rest of the payment rates are within at least five percentage points of the target rate.</P>
    <P>The objective of science, technology and innovation policy is to create an economy where industrial competitiveness is founded on the innovativeness and quality of its products, processes and services which, in turn, are provided by a technically highly skilled workforce.  Ireland's economic development, and indeed the survival and growth of its smallest firms, must be based on innovation-led competitiveness rather than short-term and volatile competitiveness based on costs.</P>
    <P>While innovation is, ultimately, a matter for the business enterprise sector, there are both short-term and long-term needs and a range of requirements, depending on the stage of development of the individual enterprise.  It is entirely legitimate, therefore, for the State to intervene in the process and to provide the necessary underpinning and support, financial or otherwise, to maintain the science and technology capability of the country and of the firm.</P>
    <P>This year, as a follow-through on the publication of the STIAC or Tierney report, the Government established a task force under the supervision of a Cabinet committee to examine the recommendations of that report.  The Cabinet committee which I chaired <Col N="1269" /> comprised the relevant Ministers, the Ministers for Finance, Education, Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  This work was concluded in November.  The task force and Cabinet committee largely endorsed the recommendations of the Tierney report mediated by the Travers committee representing senior civil servants from the main Departments concerned and representatives of industry. I sought additional funding in the budget to begin work on the implementation of the recommendations.  I intend formally to publish the full response to the Tierney report in the next four to six weeks after clearance by Government.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Government has provided £4 million in the budget towards implementing the main recommendations in 1996.  This is on top of money provided on account in the 1995 Estimates.  The Government has demonstrated through its speedy examination of the Tierney report, through its detailed consideration of science and technology at Cabinet level and, in a concrete way, through the provision of this extra funding that it regards science and technology as a cornerstone of economic and industrial development in this country.  No previous Government can make that claim and no Government since the office of science and technology was initially set up and Deputy Michael Smith was Minister with responsibility for this area has done anything for it.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that the extra money in this year's budget will allow us to address some immediate problems and to begin to tackle others.</P>

      <P>However, for a more lasting long-term solution which <Col N="1270" /> addresses the policy objectives I described we need better institutional arrangements within Government to ensure we spend our limited resources in a smarter, more focused and targeted way.  The 1996 Estimates are now complete, but the State does not know how much it will spend nationally on science and technology in any given year.  One of the recommendations of the Tierney report is that we address the spend right across Government Departments and the institutes concerned, not only my Department but high spending ones such as the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Marine, Education and so on.  The spend last year was estimated to be £750 million in the assessment prepared as is required under the Act by Forfás.  That report will be laid before the House in the very near future.</P>

      <P>It is evidence of a Government that is working well and is cohesive.  It is an imaginative budget that has struck a wise balance between the demands for fairness, justice and economic necessity.  It has firmly set about rewarding enterprise, creating an incentive for work, stimulating job creation and introducing positive discrimination in favour of the long-term unemployed.  At the same time it has confounded the prophets of doom by maintaining tight control over public spending and borrowing which will contribute to complying easily with the Maastricht requirements and, I believe, will eliminate the structural and current budget deficit.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Wallace, on introducing this Bill which is timely.  I also congratulate her on her policy document, Meeting the Challenge of Equality.  As a good deal of work was involved in preparing that document, I hope the Government will study it carefully and implement its recommendations.  If it does not, Deputy Wallace will implement them next year when I have no doubt she will be Minister.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with an important issue, the right of every citizen to vote with ease.  Polling stations are generally located in schools, community halls and, in some parts of the country, in people's homes.  In many cases old buildings and others which are relatively new are inaccessible to people with disabilities.  It is important that polling stations are located in buildings with facilities for people with disabilities or that the necessary facilities are put in place in buildings used for that purpose.  Local authorities should make it a priority to ensure that all buildings where voting takes place are made accessible for people with disabilities who wish to exercise their right to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that those with disabilities include a large number of people, not only those who use <Col N="1272" /> wheelchairs but many of the elderly people who may have suffered a stroke or have arthritis and are unable to climb steps.  The replacing of the steps with a ramp to the local post office in my town greatly improved access to it for the elderly, people pushing prams and those we normally regard as having a disability.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a special voters list during the debate last night.  Why should it be necessary for people to apply annually to have their names registered on that list?  I will deal later with the point made by my colleague, Deputy Wallace, about having a postal vote rather than the current special voting procedure.  Why do members of the Garda Síochána and the Army not have to apply annually to become a postal voter?  The names of people who are permanently incapacitated should be retained on the register until they decide to take their names off it.  It should not be necessary for those people to apply annually to have their names retained on the register.  I am aware that under the 1994 Act the requirement that applicants submit a medical certificate for applicants was removed.  I appreciate that it would be reasonable to require a person who is ill for, say, 12 months to apply to have his or her name on the register but that should not apply to those who are certified as permanently incapacitated.</P>
    <P>A list of polling stations should be drawn up and reviewed every three rather than ten years.  I agree with Deputy Mary Wallace about the desirability of allowing a postal vote rather than the present special voting arrangement. There is an inference that disabled people cannot be trusted in the same way as, say, the Army, Garda, university graduates and so on.  We should also remember that TDs and county councillors vote by post in Seanad elections. Therefore, I presume our exiles who will be entitled to vote will also be afforded a postal vote.  If my memory serves me correctly, the only occasions on which there were complaints about the system having been abused were <Col N="1273" /> when the postal vote was applied for after the election had been called, as was the case in 1986.  When a name is entered in the electoral register the system is unlikely to be open to that type of abuse.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for the Government not accepting this Private Members' Bill.  After all, when we were in Government whenever it was felt a Bill introduced by the Opposition had merit, it was accepted.  Only yesterday Deputy O'Donoghue wanted his Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995, accepted.  The electorate is crying out for that type of legislation and for the postal vote for people with disabilities.  If granted, the Government would be credited with its implementation and we would have no difficulty with its being amended in Committee, if necessary.</P>

      <P>I have just returned from monitoring the elections in Palestine with my Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Progressive Democrats colleagues. Like them, I was privileged to witness what is in effect the beginning of democracy in the Middle Eastern area, beset for so many years by violence and repression.  Indeed all European Union observers there felt they were witnessing a most important historic event. As in the case of South Africa in 1994, our enduring image will be of long queues of Palestinian people determined &mdash; and for the first time in their lives free to do so &mdash; to exercise their franchise and vote for candidates of their choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly, there are areas like east Jerusalem where that type of freedom did not apply as the Israeli authorities insisted that Arabs or Palestinians living in east Jerusalem were Israelis and, therefore, not entitled to vote.  Unfortunately, the Israeli authorities blanketed post offices <Col N="1274" /> at which Palestinians who were registered to vote could cast their vote, were extremely undemocratic in their monitoring and surveillance and used cine cameras to film and intimidate Arabs casting their votes.  Notwithstanding that apparent sense of fear on the part of the Israeli authorities about the developing democracy of the region, the vast bulk of Palestinians went peaceably, happily and enthusiastically to cast their vote for the first time.</P>
    <P>In most of the Gaza Strip, the occupied territories, where Palestinians were voting &mdash; given the numbers of Muslims living within the community &mdash; it was remarkable that so many people, particularly women, turned out joyously and determinedly to vote.</P>
    <P>We all have vivid memories of the long queues of thousands of South Africans waiting to vote.  With that in mind it is sad to reflect that, although our citizens have been enfranchised for the past 70 years, unfortunately it appears that familiarity with the democratic process breeds contempt in so far as we here do not witness those long queues and enthusiasm on the part of so many of our citizens, already on the electoral register, who choose to remain at home, abstain or spoil votes.  It is not unusual to experience turnouts as low as 50 per cent, particularly in the case of local elections.  It is a sad reflection on those who fought so hard for the freedom of our citizens to vote that so many of our citizens choose not to use that power.  While the vast majority of our electorate take their enfranchisement for granted, others are disenfranchised and excluded from full citizenship.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's motion to have this Bill examined by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs before being given a Second Reading.  It is the most appropriate forum for its consideration since that committee is already examining a broad range of other electoral issues.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Mary Wallace on her initiative in proposing this Bill, the provisions of which will enfranchise people with disabilities, enabling them <Col N="1275" /> to exercise one of their most fundamental rights in the same way as other citizens.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the existing provision for people with a disability, or those suffering long-term illness, to have their names entered on the special voters' list and other arrangements permitting voters who are mobile but who experience difficulty in gaining access to particular polling stations to cast their vote at another polling station, it is cumbersome and merely serves to reinforce the separateness of people with disabilities, which is wrong and should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Deputy Wallace's Bill refer specifically to polling stations and, if implemented, would have the positive effect of rendering our schools &mdash; the location of the vast majority of polling stations &mdash; wheelchair-accessible, which is not the case at present. For some time past the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has been addressing this issue.  In 1994 Democratic Left, among other things, made a submission to that commission, urging that all public buildings be rendered fully accessible to the disabled. While there is general agreement on the desirability of that objective, it appears to be far from being realised and we should target all our energies in that direction.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will take full account of Deputy Mary Wallace's proposals in their deliberations.  When considering the administrative details of our electoral system I hope the select committee will go beyond that remit and address the appalling state of our electoral register which, at each successive election, appears to exclude or disenfranchise a substantial number of citizens.  We must remember that the effectiveness of our democracy is dependent on the fullest possible participation by all those entitled to vote and, until such time as we ensure that all those entitled to vote <Col N="1276" /> can do so, in as convenient and unbureaucratic manner as possible, our democracy will remain less than satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Mary Wallace for bringing this Private Members' Bill before the House.  Every opportunity should be availed of to debate issues affecting the disabled.  Whereas a good deal has been done to promote a better lifestyle for people with disabilities a good deal remains to be done across a wide range of areas.  The purpose of the Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum, to aid the greater participation of people with disabilities in the electoral process, is one with which we agree.</P>
      <P>My Department has been dealing with the whole area of disability whether physical, sensory or intellectual and the health and social services for disabled people.  There has been substantial investment in improving and developing services.  This Government places a high priority on the development of health care services for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In the period 1990-95, substantial additional funding amounting to £44.58 million was made available to develop services for people with mental handicap and in the same period £10 million was provided for development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>In the area of mental handicap over 1,000 new residential and 2,100 new day care places have been provided.  The home support services initiated in 1992 have been expanded in subsequent years.  Assistance has also been given to agencies to meet identified needs in existing services due to the changing profile of the population with mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments in services for people with physical and sensory disabilities in that period have included a wide range of services such as home care, day care, respite care, community-based therapy, <Col N="1277" /> residential care, as well as increased funding to voluntary organisations.  Various significant steps both at national and European level have been initiated to upgrade and extend the provision of good quality training and viable employment opportunities, which I see as priority issues for all persons with disability.</P>
    <P>The national health strategy further underlines the Government's commitment to developing services for people with disabilities.  The strategy emphasises the principles of equity, quality of service and accountability in service provision.  It also recognises that the consumer of our health care services is entitled to the highest possible standards of care while emphasising the necessity for full co-ordination of activities between and within all health sectors.</P>
    <P>An important development in the coming year will be the publication of the report of the review group on physical and sensory disability.  This report should provide a framework for the co-ordinated development of services for people with physical disabilities in the years to come.  This is in line with the established policy of encouraging independent living in the community.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to improving the lot of people with disabilities is also evident in the establishment of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The commission, due to report early this year, is examining how people with disabilities can participate more fully in the economic, cultural and social life of the community. It is examining all sectors where there are barriers to full participation including education, health, income support, transport, housing, training and employment, the arts, culture, sports and leisure.  It is fitting that people who have a disability form a majority of the membership of the commission, while parents, advocates and service providers are also represented.</P>
    <P>The commission's report will be a landmark report for people with disabilities. The comprehensive nature of <Col N="1278" /> the report will provide a sound framework for policy development.  The increased resources to disability services, the work of the commission and the proposed equal status legislation show that the rights and welfare of people with disabilities are priority issues for this Government.</P>
    <P>It is important that Private Members' Bills or whatever debating formula is required, would be used to focus debate on disability.  I say this against the background of what the Government and the previous Government have done in these areas and also against a background of a growing awareness in the community of the rights of people with disability and the responsibility of the community to respond.  A point I often make in respect of mental handicap is that legislation can do so much and funding can achieve so much.  At the end of the day, while Irish people are generous in terms of their financial contribution to these areas, it is fundamental to progress towards the optimum level of support for people with disabilities that people open their hearts to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is all too easy to put money in a bucket to ease our consciences. The whole area of disability requires an ongoing every day commitment. There are some important initiatives under way in the area of employment for people with disabilities.  We need to ensure that people with disabilities who want to play their full part in the economy are not the victims of the recession; in other words that people with disabilities get their fair share.</P>
    <P>In the light of developments the Bill before the House is wise and prudent. It is important, in the interests of the people we all seek to serve, that we allow the process to exhaust itself.  The Minister for the Environment said last night his objective is to bring forward the best possible package of measures in the electoral area to facilitate and assist people with disabilities.  The debate to take place at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on 13 and <Col N="1279" /> 14 March should be awaited because the matters referred to that committee arise from the debate in both the Dáil and Seanad on the Electoral Act, 1992.  The select committee is broadly based and during its discussions it may identify other areas which require attention.  The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is due to report in April.  This commission is also broadly based and representative of people with disabilities.  To achieve the optimum objective, comprehensive legislation which addresses the difficulties encountered by disabled people when casting their vote, we should await the findings of the commission and the select committee.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I ask the House to support the Minister's amendment which states that: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading until the proposals it contains have been examined and reported on by the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.&rdquo;  This is the most prudent and best way of dealing with the problems of disabled people whom Deputy Wallace and her party seek to serve.  If we wait for the findings of the commission and the select committee the legislation put forward at that stage will have cross party support and will be enacted quickly.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute and congratulate Deputy Wallace on bringing the Bill before the House.  The main reason I became involved in politics was to try to create an equal society.  In my constituency of Dublin North West economic deprivation is very much a reality.  As a politician I have come in contact with people from various backgrounds who have different expectations.  Apart from the exceptionally lucky few who may have a supportive family, many disabled people also suffer economic deprivation. During the ten to 15 years I have been actively involved in politics much progress has been made in dealing with the problems of disabled people but <Col N="1280" /> work still remains to be done.  This Bill is important in that it has ensured a three hour debate on the reality of life for many disabled people.</P>
      <P>During the Christmas recess I heard a radio interview with a young woman who contracted polio when she was in her early teens.  Her aunt who was similarly afflicted lived with her in the family home.  This young woman was determined that her life would be totally different from that of her aunt who was, effectively, housebound.  She also noticed that when she returned from hospital people spoke to her in a different way as if her mind had also been affected and she was somehow a lesser person.  Much work needs to be done in changing people's attitude to disability. In this context I welcome the exciting, determined and aggressive campaign carried out by disabled groups in recent months in an effort to ensure accessibility to all buildings and public transport. In the past most disabled people were overlooked and did not participate in society.</P>
      <P>When I was a Minister in 1981 I had the pleasure of visiting the Rehab centre in Clontarf where I met disabled children and their parents.  These children had done remarkably fine artistic work and, while they had very inspired teachers, in many cases it was the mothers who saw the talent behind the disability and encouraged them to express themselves fully artistically. Much has been achieved in this area but a great deal of work still has to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a separate register for disabled people was a major step forward.  However, when it was first established it reflected a throw-back to old attitudes in that disabled people had to obtain a certificate from a doctor certifying that they were mentally fit to vote.  I am glad that insulting requirement was removed.  As the young woman with polio said, many people presume that people who are physically disabled are also disabled in other ways. It should be remembered that people with a physical disability fully develop <Col N="1281" /> their mental and other skills provided they are given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to put on a statutory basis much of the procedure which has gladly been put in place by way of administrative regulation or recommendation. In recent years presiding officers have had to ensure that polling stations are accessible and provide ramps, a special voting area and other assistance.  This is an administrative arrangement and putting it on a statutory basis will make it an essential requirement.  This issue is being debated by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  We are also awaiting the commission's report which will include the views of disabled people and others.  It would be foolish to enact legislation without taking their views into account.  Nevertheless.  Deputy Wallace is to be commended on bringing this legislation forward.  She should be happy &mdash; I do not think this will be her response &mdash; that the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs will offer a very real opportunity for the introduction of more comprehensive legislation.  The capacity of committees to sponsor legislation is a new power we have not adequately used.</P>
    <P>I am encouraging the Select Committee on Social Affairs to produce legislation covering an area of particular relevance to it.  When the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs has studied all the issues a much more comprehensive Bill can be formulated. The Minister has taken a reasonable approach to the legislation before us.  He stated that as well as reviewing issues relating to the disabled, there is a major ongoing review of the electoral Acts.  Having the matter dealt with in committee will ensure that the substantial issues raised here are dealt with adequately and responded to by the introduction of more comprehensive legislation in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a brief contribution on this important Bill.  Deputy Wallace should be commended on her initiative in drafting the legislation which is crucial for people with physical disabilities.</P>
      <P>The widespread support for the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1995, demonstrates beyond doubt the positive measures contained in the legislation. They would have practically no cost implications and, if implemented, would mean a great deal to the large number of people who face many obstacles in their everyday lives.  Society's lack of consideration for people with disabilities was brought home to us when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, nominated Brian Crowley to the Seanad although at that time the House did not have the necessary facilities to enable him get to his office or use the corridors. That nomination was an inspired choice and, as Senator, he was an active and popular Member of the Upper House. As a member of the European Parliament we are all proud of his exemplary work in his Munster constituency, Brussels and Strasbourg.</P>
      <P>I have been requested by various voluntary organisations in my area who work with the disabled and the handicapped to request GAA clubs and other sporting organisations to cater for the disabled when upgrading their facilities. I am pleased that all those requests were met with a positive response, which would probably not have happened in the past.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wallace recently produced a very valuable document entitled <i>Meeting the Challenge of Equality.</i> Those who work with the disabled appreciate Deputy Wallace's work and welcome the sound and attainable objectives outlined in her document.  Many of our unsung heroes are involved in voluntary and statutory organisations who work constantly and diligently on behalf of people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> The Oireachtas is obliged to work towards the provision of equality of access and for the disabled and the Government should have the good grace to accept a measure such as this Bill.  It is unacceptable that it has declined to give it a Second Reading.  If the Government was genuinely concerned about the wording of particular sections, the Minister could have put forward the changes he believed necessary on Committee Stage.  It is wrong that any citizen should be denied the right to cast their vote at election or referendum time.  It flies in the face of democracy, especially when one considers that the remedies are readily available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace outlined in a practical way how polling could be made much more accessible to the disabled.  It makes sense to use accessible buildings when they are available.  The decision to use particular buildings as polling stations is frequently made for historical reasons.  An obligation on local authorities to provide facilities for wheelchair users would also heighten awareness in the community of the need to remove more of the physical obstacles that confront the disabled on a daily basis.  As the number of requests would be minimal, people should have the option to vote at alternative polling stations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace also referred to the special voters' list and requested that postal voting be extended to people with disabilities.  It would not create administrative or bureaucratic difficulties and it would be eminently sensible and cost effective to ensure that the disabled can avail of the postal voting system that has existed in the State for some years.  It would also bring our legislation and regulations into line with our counterparts in the European Union.  I commend Deputy Wallace on her initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for sharing time with me and commend Deputy Wallace on introducing the Bill. <Col N="1284" /> I am disappointed that the Government does not propose to accept the legislation. It is nonsensical for the Minister to say that the matter will be dealt with in the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  He told us he referred proposals to that committee last April and that it will consider them on 13 and 14 March.  If it takes 11 months to do that, how long will it take before we get action from the Government to facilitate the disabled at voting time?  I want a commitment from the Government that if it does not accept this Bill it will at least ensure the disabled can vote at polling stations that are accessible to wheelchairs at the next general election. The alternative of saying they can vote at another polling station is not always practical for those who are not disabled, not to mention those who are disabled. Down through the years Ministers have suggested that smaller polling stations should be closed, in other words, that polling stations should have a minimum of at least 1,000 people on the register. That is unfair and would discriminate against people in rural Ireland.  It would cause a great deal of hardship for people in places such as Connemara and would be particularly inconvenient for the disabled.</P>
      <P>The security and Defence Forces avail of the postal vote and in legislation introduced last year that was extended to fishermen, transport workers and those absent from home because of work.  However, the physically disabled were not mentioned and now is the time to address the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wallace stressed the importance of maintaining the secrecy of the ballot, even in cases where the voter must be accompanied and the question of access to counting centres is also important.  As a politician I enjoy elections but I do not enjoy counts. However, those who are anxious to go to see counts, including wheelchair users, should be able to do so.  Deputy Smith was correct in his comments about access to this building and all public buildings.  We did not have that access until Mr. Brian Crowley was <Col N="1285" /> nominated to the other House by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  We could do much more in this House. Facilities, should a physically disabled person be elected to the Dáil, are not adequate and we may have to wait until a physically disabled person is elected before that takes place.  I hope it will happen soon.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Wallace referred to the question of local authorities publishing a polling scheme every five years rather than the ten year wait as at present.  As we know, for every election names are omitted from the register of electors, and people are not permitted to cast their vote at the local station but must travel to other polling stations and so on.  This would be a very useful section in any Bill if the Department and the Minister accepted it, because we must make polling stations accessible to all our electorate.  People should not have to drive long distances to vote.  The disabled in particular should have access to all polling stations rather than being given the alternative of using another polling station which may not be practical or suitable.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and hope that, if the Minister will not accept, it, he will at least tell us that before the next general election &mdash; whenever it occurs &mdash; the physically disabled will have the same rights as everybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In calling Deputy Fox I wish to avail of the opportunity to formally welcome her to the House, albeit belatedly.  I wish her very well in her career in Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Ms Fox Ms Fox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject because the lack of wheelchair accessibility is a major problem in almost every aspect of life and is not confined to polling stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheelchair users are constantly denied access to ordinary places of business, such as shops, cinemas, hotels and even post offices, places we all take for granted.  All too often a wheelchair user <Col N="1286" /> has to be physically lifted up and down a step or two, a task which requires help and can be degrading or embarrassing for him or her but, more seriously, takes away his or her independence.  The dishing of footpaths is a simple process and needs to be addressed.  Footpaths need to be dished to accommodate wheelchairs.  I commend Bray UDC for dishing some of the footpaths on the route into Bray, a move which I hope will be followed by every local authority.</P>
    <P>We need a little more understanding by society in regard to wheelchair accessibility.  When we take a step up or down into a shop it does not cost us a thought, it is a simple act for us but it can be a cut-off point for a wheelchair user and may in some cases deter him or her from engaging in ordinary public activities.  Wheelchair accessibility is left to the owners of businesses and, while we have improved somewhat over the years, we are still lagging far behind many other countries.  There is plenty of room for improvement.  Owners of business premises open to the general public should be encouraged to make their premises wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>Exercising the right to vote is something which is warmly encouraged by every member and it is yet another act we all take for granted.  Deputy Wallace's proposals have much merit and I urge the Government to accept them.  I listened with interest to Deputy Byrne's contribution and I agree with him that it is a shame that many people do not exercise their right to vote.  Deputy Wallace's proposals seek to make provision for those who are willing to vote but for some reason are prevented.  All polling stations should be wheelchair accessible. This should go without saying but unfortunately that is not the case.  People who are permanently incapacitated should not be required to register every year for a postal vote.</P>
    <P>I again urge the Government to adopt Deputy Wallace's proposals and allow wheelchair users to cast their vote on equal terms with other citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> I hope Members will consider some of the problems I mentioned so that by the time of the next general election we will all truly deserve the support of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill which my party and I support.  I commend Deputy Wallace, as most other speakers have done, for taking the time and having the patience to draft it.  In what it seeks to do it is a very simple Bill, but therein lies its strength.  It is a very detailed, considered, thoughtful Bill and Deputy Wallace has earned the esteem of every Member and many organistions interested in its progress through the House.  She has earned their praise and commendation for making this a very important issue in her list of political priorities.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a response to appeals by organisations who deal directly on a day-to-day basis with people with disabilities. Many of them are voluntary and put thought into improving the lot of those with disabilities.  It is as a result of their lobbying that through the years a number of significant improvements have been made in both the public and private sectors.  Nonetheless, a great deal remains to be done.  To say the least of it, it would be stubborn and insensitive of Members not to listen to their please for equality in regard to one of the most basic constitutional rights, the right to vote.  That is the key issue being raised.</P>
      <P>People with a disability suffer enough disadvantage already.  We should not seek to put further disadvantage in their way.  Rather we should avail of every opportunity to help remove obstacles, to help establish some level of equality so that people with a disability will have equality with others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wherever possible, polling stations should be as accessible to people with a disability as they are to others.  The right to vote was a long and hard fight.  I notice all Deputies present are women; 100 years ago none of us would have had the right to vote.  It was only <Col N="1288" /> because a number of strong women with vision fought hard for it that this right was &mdash; grudgingly, in many cases &mdash; given to us.  The right to vote is one that every citizen should hold sacrosanct. Women, in particular, because of the nature and duration of the struggle to win the vote for us, should be sensitive to making the right to vote available to the widest possible number of citizens. We should be very careful to ensure that we remove any obstacle to voting by any of our citizens.  That is what is at the heart of this Bill.  There is a high and growing degree of voter apathy in all western democracies.  It is a deep malaise which deserves greater attention than can be given to it in the context of this Bill.  A worrying feature of western democracies, including the United States, is that fewer people vote in successive elections.  That is a message for us and it is a worrying development for people who treasure and support constitutional democracies.  We should take seriously the fact that a number of people here do not bother to vote.  We should find out why and what can be done to win back confidence in the system which is being slowly eroded. However, that is a deeper and wider issue to be addressed at another time or in a different forum.</P>
    <P>People who want to vote should be facilitated but that is not the case in respect of people with disabilities.  Far too many people with disabilities are precluded from voting in successive elections because of the physical nature and location of polling stations.  Where possible and in accordance with this Bill, we should ask local authorities to identify polling stations where there are difficulties.  We are all aware of such polling stations; there are a number in my constituency to which it is difficult for old people who have full use of their limbs, not to mention those in wheelchairs or people with other disabilities, to gain access.  Indeed, there are polling stations in my constituency of Cork North-Central to which those with no disability have difficulty getting access. Such polling stations are unsuitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> Local authorities should be required to find more suitable locations accessible not only to people with disabilities, but to the general public to avoid putting obstacles in the way of those who want to vote.  In the context of the needs and rights of people with disabilities, we need to urgently examine polling stations throughout the country with a view to removing obstacles.  Many people with disabilities are intensely interested in politics; some have more time to watch television programmes and to read political commentary.  Many have political points to make yet they are precluded from so doing.  They are denied the one weapon which is important to them, to be able to vote in a manner that will make a difference to their futures.</P>
    <P>There are strong arguments for dealing with this issue head on.  I read the Bill and the Minister's response.  I could not find any justification for not accepting this legislation or for the Government's decision to vote it down. This Bill seeks simple, practical and attainable measures.  There is no need for further deliberation on this issue by a committee of the House.  It would only be a delaying tactic &mdash; the Hamlet factor: &ldquo;sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought&rdquo;&mdash; the paralysis of analysis and over analysis.  A further delay will be visited on those who will benefit from this Bill in respect of rights they and the organisations which represent them demand and which have been clearly outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We will face a general election in the next 15 to 18 months.  If this Bill is dealt with by a committee in the manner in which the Minister suggested, there will not be any changes before the next general election.  It would take time for local authorities to inspect existing polling stations to see which ones are defective and to identify alternative and more suitable replacements to meet the requirements of the Bill.  That cannot be done on the Saturday night before the next election.  It will take time to implement the provisions of this Bill.  I see no reason it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> If the Minister and his Department believe the Bill is deficient they can table amendments and explain them and they will have my support and that of my party.  I am sure they will also have the support of the framer of this Bill whose intention is not only to generate debate on the issue, but to get action and a solution to the problems outlined.  It is disappointing that the Government has chosen this course of action.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fox's analysis of the other matters which need attention to make life more bearable for people with disabilities and to narrow the gap between them and those who do not have disabilities.  However, they are matters for other Departments and a different day.  Even at this late stage, I appeal to the Minister not to vote down the Bill, to make it Government policy and to enact its provisions as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not only have a general election in the next 18 months, but that we will also have a referendum to change bail laws, which is important, and to provide a vote for emigrants.  A number of polling events should be held in the next 12 to 18 months and I appeal to the Government to ensure better provision is made in terms of accessibility to polling stations and to extend the polling system to those who are too disabled to come to a polling station.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can clarify it with the Minister of State who is present.  This is an important item.  We all have handicapped constituents whom we want to facilitate.  Some of them insist on not using the postal system. They want to be part of the voting procedure and go to the polling stations. It is local authorities that set down the polling station regulations and identify <Col N="1292" /> polling stations, and it is a matter for local authorities, not necessarily for legislation, to ensure that all polling stations are readily accessible to everybody, including disabled voters.  There are some commendable suggestions in the Bill.  It is appropriate to deal with the matter in a structured and positive way and that is exactly what the Minister proposes to do.  The Minister of State will clarify the Government's position on this Bill.  I understand that a committee is prepared to accept it and debate it and, if necessary, amend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Wallace for raising this issue.  Like the Minister, Deputy Howlin, I am in full agreement with the specific objectives.  Notwithstanding the genuine objectives of Deputy Wallace, I consider that the best course of action would be to refer the proposals in the Bill to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  The Minister stated clearly what he was suggesting because of the circumstances of the select committee's approach and the importance of the report coming from the commission.  I will refer to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not like the tone of some of the contributions made by Opposition Deputies last night.  They gave the impression that the Government is not concerned about the issue.  That is clearly not true.  It is important that the Opposition should not trivialise this issue simply to score points.  Fianna Fáil has been hasty on this occasion.  It is odd that they published their policy document on disability a few weeks before the Commission for the Status of People with Disabilities is due to finalise its report.  The Government is correct to await the commission's report before deciding on measures in this area.  It would be discourteous to the commission if we did not wait the few last weeks.  I do not understand why the Opposition cannot also wait those few weeks, especially as it was a Government that included Fianna Fáil that set up the commission, which has taken <Col N="1293" /> time, doing its work in a painstaking fashion, to ensure that people with disabilities are consulted and included in the process.  There is a very strong case for waiting for the publication of the report which is expected this April.</P>
    <P>The policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> states that when the commission has reported the Government will introduce a disabilities Bill setting out the rights of people with a disability together with means of redress for those who are denied them.  The Government also has undertaken, in line with the recommendations of the commission, to put in place mechanisms for full and equal participation by every citizen with a disability in every aspect of our economic and social life, including the right to exercise the franchise.  Opposition Deputies stressed on a number of occasions last night that the effects of the Bill if implemented would not be great.  I agree, as some of his proposals are aspirational, including phrases such as, &ldquo;local authorities shall endeavour&rdquo; and &ldquo;returning officers shall, where possible&rdquo;.  As Deputy Ó Cuív said last night, it may not be possible in many rural areas to find buildings without imposing a long journey on all voters, and I cannot accept that we should pass legislation unless its provisions can be implemented.</P>
    <P>Other proposals to reduce time periods could be unrealistic, having regard to all the other tasks to be carried out by the returning officers and their staffs in very limited periods.  Reports from returning officers suggest that the existing time periods for carrying out some tasks are difficult enough to achieve. Deputy Wallace referred last night to section 3 of the Bill concerning the making of a polling scheme once every five years.  On this point, section 28 of the Electoral Act, 1992, allows the local authorities to make a polling scheme as often as they like.  The only stipulation in the section is that a scheme be made once every ten years.  The making of a scheme is a reserved function.  As such there is an opportunity for elected members of the local authority to <Col N="1294" /> express their views to the local electorate on the proposed scheme.  Information can be made available during the discussion by elected members on a proposed scheme.  Also as polling schemes have to be confirmed by the Minister, the needs of people with disabilities can be included in the Minister's consideration of the proposed polling scheme.  As the Minister said in his statement last night, returning officers are advised at each election that they should, as far as possible, select buildings for use as polling stations which are accessible to people with disabilities.  In the event that entry to the polling station involves steps, ramps should be provided.  We are all in agreement on that.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy O'Keeffe made the point that applicants for the special voters list had to submit annual medical certificates.  I assure the Deputy that is no longer the case.  Opposition Deputies stressed that giving unrestricted postal voting to people with disabilities would not be abused especially because of the comparatively small numbers involved. Deputy O'Hanlon suggested today that disabled people were not trusted by the Government.  It is not a question of trust.  Of course we trust disabled people.  What we are talking about is the possibility of abuse.  I would again ask Deputy Wallace to consider supporting the Minister's amendment having regard to the commitment he made last night to work with her and other Members of the House in devising and legislating for the best possible package of measures in the electoral area to facilitate and assist people with disabilities.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Wallace for sharing some of her time with me.  I compliment her on <Col N="1295" /> bringing forward this Bill because it is important to continue to highlight the problems faced by handicapped people. I am the parent of a handicapped child and I am very much aware of those problems.  There is a great deal of sympathy generally for handicapped people but sympathy will not do anything to ease their plight.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that the Government will not accept this Bill and it is difficult to believe that Government Deputies will go through the lobbies and vote against a measure providing access to polling stations for people with disabilities. Over the past number of years Deputies on all sides of the House have called for better access for disabled persons and they now have an opportunity to vote for a worthwhile Bill which seeks to help the plight of those people.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with voting rights and access to voting for the disabled.  As politicians we are all aware that when handicapped people arrive at a polling station to vote, they often have to be carried up or down four or five flights of stairs.  We have a sufficient number of buildings in our towns &mdash; perhaps not in rural areas &mdash; with proper access for disabled people which would allow them to vote without being dependent on members of various political parties to carry them up or down flights of stairs.  Returning officers should be more sensitive in the way they select buildings for use as polling stations.  We must get the message across to local authorities and to returning officers that, in future elections, they should, as far as possible, choose buildings which are easily accessible for handicapped people.</P>
      <P>I know Minister Howlin is reasonably sympathetic to the plight of handicapped people.  He is a former Minister for Health and for that reason it is difficult to believe he is not willing to accept this Bill, even if it meant making any changes he felt were necessary to improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> I thank Deputy Wallace for bringing forward the Bill which attempts to make the Department of the Environment, local authorities and returning officers more aware of the thinking of Deputies and handicapped people.  It also highlights the plight of disabled persons. Sympathy is not enough; we need concreate action and this Bill is another step on the road to improving basic facilities for handicapped people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil introduced this Bill because it recognised that people with disabilities face many obstacles to free and fair access to the exercise of their franchise.  It arose from a series of meetings I held with people with disabilities and received widespread support when it was published last year.  In addition, a number of organisations representing people with disabilities have written to members of the Government asking them to support the Bill.  Among the organisations which support this Bill are the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Centre for Independent Living, Cheshire Homes and the Spinal Injuries Action Association. They recognise that the Bill is a reasonable response to an important issue.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister for the Environment, in his contribution yesterday evening, failed to address the sense of marginalisation and exclusion from the electoral process felt by people with disabilities.  I know the Minister is personally concerned about matters affecting people with disabilities but his refusal to support the Bill and the feeble alternatives he has suggested are both ill-advised and ill-informed.  Unfortunately, they fall into line with the ongoing problems regarding the important issues of disability that arise, which the Government is failing to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The context within which the Minister framed his comments is the ongoing process of consolidating and updating electoral law.  He pointed to the general improvements contained in a number of measures.  He does not seem to realise, <Col N="1297" /> however, that much of this process stands as an indictment of, rather than a credit to, the various consolidation measures.  These measures, with the sole exception of the Electoral Act, 1992, have consistently failed to address any access issue.  In effect, they have consolidated exclusion.</P>
    <P>On the Bill's provisions for requiring the use of accessible buildings for polling stations, the Minister listed a range of small scale administrative actions which have been taken.  These consist of general, non-statutory guidelines.  In reviewing them, the Minister said that these guidelines have gone a long way in promoting accessibility.  That is simply nonsense.  As he revealed in reply to a parliamentary question tabled last year, his Department does not keep any information on the accessibility of stations.  If he wishes to know the scale of the problem I am willing to request some of those people disenfranchised because of inaccessible polling stations during the divorce referendum to make contact with his Department.</P>
    <P>The system proposed in the Bill to promote accessibility through reforming the process for making polling schemes can only be achieved by statutory action.  It is not unreasonable to expect the law to explicitly protect the right of citizens to vote within their own community. Such issues should not be based merely on ministerial regulation or on administrative whim, especially where they have self-evidently failed to vindicate those rights.</P>
    <P>A further point to note is the judgment of the Supreme Court which stressed that it is the responsibility of the Oireachtas to enact legislation facilitating the citizen's right to vote.  In addressing the Bill's proposals to abolish the special voter system and extend full postal voting, the Minister again failed to appreciate and tackle the full nature of the problem.  He stated he is not aware of any significant demand to replace the current system.  It is clear the <Col N="1298" /> reason the Minister is not aware of the demand is that neither he nor officials from his Department discussed the issue with the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The special voter system is intrusive and intimidating and has led to a significant fall-off in the numbers of people registering under the system.  As Deputy O'Dea stated last night in the context of acquaintances of his, many people with disabilities simply do not vote rather than submit to the special voter system. Figures supplied to me by the Department of the Environment suggest that between 1,000 and 4,000 people may have chosen not to vote and become, in effect, disenfranchised because of the system.  It is not good enough to let this situation continue even one day longer, let alone into the next election and beyond.</P>
    <P>In justifying the continuance of the special voter system the Minister reproduced the ancient and discredited statements relating to earlier operation of the postal voting system in local elections, despite the fact that I asked him not to.  In Seanad elections, 50,000 voters can be trusted with an unsupervised postal vote but people with disabilities cannot.  Why is it that people with disabilities in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain can be trusted with an unsupervised postal vote while people with disabilities in Ireland cannot?  How can anybody committed to full participatory democracy countenance a system which results in people choosing not to vote rather than submit to these requirements?  This discredited system has failed and will continue to fail.  It should be replaced immediately.</P>
    <P>The points I have made so far relate to such specific comments on the substance of the Bill as the Minister made in his contribution last night.  His core theme was that this whole area should be referred to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and we <Col N="1299" /> should trust in the Government's commitment to tackle disability issues.  The Minister first referred a range of electoral procedures to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs last April.  It has so far failed to consider that matter and may do so for two days in two months time.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister said he would like to wait for the report of the Commission for the Status of People with Disabilities before considering the measures.  It is simply incredible that the Minister would expect us to agree to this type of delaying action.  As the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs will continue to be overworked why should we believe it will be in a position to consider the issues raised in the Bill?  Even if it were to deal with them in March, the massive delays in producing Government legislation would inevitably mean that the Bill would not be enacted during the lifetime of this Dáil.  Fianna Fáil is not willing to agree to delays which would mean that the current discredited and disenfranchising system would operate during future elections and referenda.</P>
    <P>On a broader point, the Minister's approach is representative of the Government's approach to disability. The Government has made wide-ranging promises on disability but the overwhelming majority have not been met and a large number of legislative, financial and administrative proposals have been side-tracked.  Where is the review group report on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and where are the funds to implement it? That was a promise.  Where is the timetable for the implementation of proposals from the special education review committee and the funding to do so? Where is the White Paper on the voluntary sector?  Where are the Bills on charitable fund-raising, employment equality and equal status?  All these <Col N="1300" /> measures, among others, have been significantly delayed in spite of recurring promises of their introduction.</P>
    <P>Where is the appropriation in this year's budget, to commence, as promised, the implementation of the report of the Commission for the Status of People with Disabilities?  The consistent pattern of Government delay and inaction is such that we cannot accept its assurances on measures contained in this Bill.  The Minister has not accepted that the special voters' system should be replaced, instead he has reasserted a policy that denies people with disability the same polling facilities allowed to the 50,000 people who vote in Seanad elections. If the Government wishes to address the issue, it should support this Bill and table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is not a complex Bill, as Deputy Quill said in her address, it is straightforward and addresses a straightforward issue.  There is no reason for the Government to come in and vote against access to polling stations by people with disabilities.  The Bill has received widespread support from those who are disenfranchised under the present system and I am grateful to everyone who has come in to support it. I thank Deputy Quill of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Mildred Fox and others for their support.  I thank the Government Deputies who complimented us on the Bill although in a few minutes they will vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as training programmes are concerned, it is not necessary to be signing on the live register in order to participate on these programmes, although priority is given to those on the live register.  A broad range of training programmes is directed specifically at categories not on the live register such as early school leavers, persons wishing to return to work after a prolonged absence, persons in employment being assisted through FÁS training programmes, and so on.</P>
      <P>The principal labour market opportunity available through my Department is community employment.  That programme is geared primarily towards those long-term unemployed who are in receipt of unemployment compensation payments.  However, it may also be availed of by certain categories not on the live register such as persons in receipt of lone parent's allowance or other special categories such as those registered with the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
      <P>I am not clear as to why the Deputy is advocating the setting up of a parallel register in respect of persons who are not entitled to sign on the live register. As the Deputy will be aware, such persons are welcome to register with FÁS for training and employment opportunities. FÁS will then provide them with detailed advice on its own programmes for which they may qualify and will also put forward the names of those who are suitably qualified to prospective employers using the FÁS employment placement service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that giving priority to persons on the live register ensures that those most likely to be in need of the various programmes are given priority attention.  I do not envisage that it will be possible, because of budgetary constraints, fundamentally to alter this arrangement in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I do not think that the creation of a new register along the lines suggested by the Deputy would be warranted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the debate about whether the labour force survey <Col N="1305" /> or the unemployment register is the correct one.  The Government is weighted heavily in favour of the labour force survey as the numbers are less.  We believe the live register reflects a truer picture of the unemployed than does the labour force survey.</P>
    <P>Many people, mostly women, wish to enter the labour market but are aware that there are no opportunities for them and that their cases will not be fully considered. The Minister said that he did not understand why I advocated setting up a parallel register.  My suggestion was contained in the INOU proposals. Everyone who wished to be considered for employment would be on the register.</P>

It does not offer a service to those seeking work.  FÁS delivers services to those interested in training and employment opportunities.  Lone parents are eligible for CE.  There are many services people can avail of whether or not they are on the live register.</P>

Many women are not entitled to claim social welfare but wish to be considered for jobs.  The number of openings available to them through FÁS is limited.

      <P>At the EU Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels on 20-21 December last the UK withdrew its reservations to the State aid involved in the Irish Steel restructuring plan, thus enabling the Council to unanimously approve the State aid package under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty.  To overcome the UK objections, production caps on finished steel and billets together with limits on the sale of finished steel products in the EU market, including Norway and Switzerland, were also agreed.  The State aid package agreed by the EU for Irish Steel will involve an Exchequer contribution of £17.808 million in cash and the wiping out of an old Government loan of £17 million.  The Exchequer's cash contribution of £17.808 million will cover balance sheet deficits, £2.831 million, remedial environmental works £2.36 million, pension fund deficit, £0.628 million, training grants £0.200 million, compensation for interest charges on <Col N="1307" /> existing debts, £4.617 million and compensation for the restrictions on production and sales imposed on the Irish Steel/ISPAT project to overcome UK objections, £7.172 million.</P>
      <P>In addition to that figure of £17,808 million there is potentially a further Exchequer cash contribution of £2.445 million in respect of possible residual costs and financial claims arising from the past.  This matter has to be discussed with Irish Steel/ISPAT over the next few weeks.  This brings the total Exchequer liability to be covered in the contract with ISPAT to £20.253 million. Details about the restrictions on production and sales, agreed to overcome UK objections, are being circulated in tabular form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale and purchase agreement which I signed with ISPAT International on 6 September last will now have to be revised in the light of the EU <Col N="1308" /> developments and discussions on this matter between the State negotiators and ISPAT representatives are taking place and will continue for some more weeks.  Legislation will also be necessary before the takeover of Irish Steel by ISPAT International can take effect.  I propose to circulate a short Bill very soon and I look forward to the co-operation of all parties in the House in passing the legislation quickly.  Also it will be necessary for the European Commission to take a decision on the basis of the Council's conclusions that the aid be permitted, exceptionally.</P>
    <P>In regard to redundancies the whole purpose of our efforts is to save jobs and have no redundancies.  The contract provides that in the event of the company failing to meet the job guarantees a penalty clause will operate.  However, the purpose of the Government's and my efforts has been to save the jobs at Irish Steel.  This has been done.</P>

      <P>Essentially what is required is that roughly 10 per cent of the total production in the plant be sold on non-EU markets.  There is provision for significant expansion from present levels of production, increasing to 361,000 tonnes of finished steel and 90,000 tonnes of unfinished steel.  That represents an expansion in existing production in the order of about 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>The question related to the original deal before the UK Government became obstreperous.  In the original deal a certain output per annum was envisaged, but to placate the British a diminished tonnage per year was allowed.  I would like to know the tonnage involved.</P>

      <P>The EU document envisaged that in year three there would be 350,000 tonnes of finished steel and 100,000 tonnes of unfinished steel.  The agreement provides for 350,000 tonnes of finished steel, the same as originally <Col N="1309" /> envisaged, and 70,000 tonnes of unfinished steel, 30,000 tonnes less than originally envisaged.  The other restriction is that 10 per cent of sales must be to non-EU markets.</P>

      <P>When we started to debate this issue in late summer-early autumn last year, before the rearguard action by the British Government, the forecasts for retention of employment by ISPAT International were based on the proposals of the EU Commission. Will the diminished amount of tonnage per year have an effect on the proposed retention of employment considering that it was based on the earlier submission?</P>

      <P>Apple Computer Incorporated recently announced its intention to lay off 1,300 of their 14,000 employees as part of a rationalisation <Col N="1311" /> programme.  Most of the job losses will be in sales, marketing and administration. This rationalisation programme has not, to date, affected Apple's facility in Cork.  I have been in touch with the chief executive of IDA Ireland and at my request it is maintaining close contact with both the Irish and US management concerning any restructuring developments.  The Apple facility in Cork has progressively strengthened its competitiveness and with the help of IDA Ireland has added additional functions in the areas of software, quality assurance and research and development to its operations. These will undoubtedly be positive factors in any assessment of the future role of Apple's facility in Cork.</P>
      <P>The board of directors of Apple Computer Inc. and its shareholders met in the United States last Tuesday 23 January 1996.  I understand there were no implications arising for Apple in Cork.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to meet Apple's US management at this stage, but I will continue to keep this under review in the context of my continuing contacts with IDA Ireland in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a good idea to meet Apple management in the US.  Will the Minister reconsider that suggestion?  I am glad the redundancies do not affect Apple in Cork, a very fine firm which has a strong committed workforce.  Rather than come back here in six months moaning about adverse plans that affect Cork, the Minister should go to the US now on a positive, pre-emptive mission to put to management a strong case for Ireland to hold on to its share of Apple.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 15, 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>A relaunch of Irish Press titles is a matter for the promoters of such a venture and I have no direct role in their actions.  However, I am anxious to see a revised <i>Irish Press</i> or other new titles on the market in order to assist in achieving diversity and plurality in the newspaper industry.  My main legislative responsibility is, of course, to ensure that competition law is complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> I have not seen any plans for a relaunch of the <i>Sunday Press.</i> Any such relaunch must comply with competition law.  To make a judgment, it would be necessary to see what is proposed.  In this connection, I have not received a comprehensive or satisfactory reply from Independent Newspapers in relation to its future plan <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Press.  I have made it very clear to the Press and Independent that competition legislation will be upheld by the State.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the views of the IBEC Competition Council.  It did not address or rebut the conclusion of the Authority in regard to section 4, anti-competitive agreements.  The Authority considered that the acquisition by Independent Newspapers plc of a 24.9 per cent shareholding in Irish Press and the provision by Independent of loans totalling £2 million to the Irish Press represented an anti-competitive agreement contrary to section 4 of the Competition Act.</P>
    <P>In addition, the views of the IBEC Council seem deficient in a number of areas including: much of what it says concerns its general policy concerns and not the issue of dominance by Independent in Ireland as concluded by the Authority; it questions whether the media should be subject, like all other sectors, to our competition law, while elsewhere in its document it says it fully supports the application of competition rules to all sectors of Irish business and that this is essential for Ireland's long-term competitive position. There is an inherent contradiction in this; our Competition Act, 1991, is based, by analogy, on the EU Treaty and the principles that underpin it are EU based.  The Authority has relied heavily on EU &mdash; Commission and European Court of Justice &mdash; decisions and principles in its work.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned to find prevailing in the council's document a sentiment that contends that if there is a lack of competition, market forces will solve the problem in time.  This takes no account of the burden on consumers and the economy generally of the lack of competition, whether it be prices or <Col N="1314" /> lack of choice.  I am further aware that grave misgivings were expressed by Deputies on all sides of the house in the debate on the Competition (Amendment) Bill concerning alleged abusive conduct by dominant firms in oppressing and abusing their positions in the market, particularly in regard to smaller more vulnerable firms.  The council notes that other newspaper interests disagree with its analysis.</P>
    <P>I am on record as accepting the findings of the Competition Authority which concluded that the agreement involving the acquisition by Independent Newspapers of a 24.9 per cent shareholding in Irish Press and its provision of loans to Irish Press is anti-competitive and an abuse of a dominant position.  A continuation of these or similar arrangements into the future would be unlawful.  The State will take the necessary action to ensure compliance with the Competition Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was useful in drawing a response from the Minister as to his opinion of the Competition Authority's report on Independent Newspapers.  As he was not satisfied with the responses he received from Independent Newspapers, will he indicate how many times he wrote to it, the number of replies he received and in what way they were not fully comprehensive?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to Independent Newspapers plans to relaunch the <i>Irish Press.</i> I wrote to it twice and received two replies. They were deficient in that it is not clear what its involvement might be in a relaunch of the <i>Irish Press.</i> I cannot interpret precisely what it intends from its replies.  It would be necessary to establish what it proposes to form a judgment on whether its proposals would comply with competition law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am available to meet them.  However, I pointed out to them that they have an obligation to respect competition law and it is my duty to ensure that law is enforced.  It is not for me to work out what possible relaunch of the <i>Irish Press</i> may emerge, that is an issue for those involved.  My task is to ensure that competition law is complied with.  I have made it clear to all parties concerned that the requirements of competition law must be respected in any relaunch proposal.  It is up to them to work on whatever relaunch proposal they consider appropriate, but they must do so against that background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

Otherwise people will raise further matters after the plans are implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent paper &mdash; Competition and Regulatory Reform in Public Utility Industries: Issues and Prospects presented to the Statistical Society of Ireland by a member of the Competition Authority and the legal adviser to the Authority in their personal capacities.  Regulation of the energy and telecommunications sectors are matters within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>In relation to my own responsibilities, I should say the Competition Act, 1991, applies to all sectors of industry including these sectors mentioned in the question and, therefore, all firms operating therein need to comply with the terms of the Act.  The Deputy will be aware of the new provisions regarding enforcement of competition policy contained in the Competition (Amendment) Bill which completed Committee Stage last week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  These sectors, which since their inception have given an exceptionally high standard of service to our people, are concerned about the unavoidable competition in this area with which they must cope.  Will the Minister indicate when an independent regulator will be appointed to ensure <Col N="1317" /> that the interests of existing service providers and new entrants to the electricity, gas and telecommunication services loop are not only safeguarded but that service providers are treated equally?  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications said one would be appointed within the year. What safeguards will be put in place to protect the interests of existing service providers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions would be more properly directed to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  He has proposals to establish independent regulation of this sector.  I understand he is preparing legislation which will come before the House in due course and that an interim regulation system will be put in place.  It will deal with a range of issues to ensure fair competition in the market.  The Deputy would have to table a question to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to get the information she requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister has responsibility for the area of competition governed by EU and national law, what guarantees can he give existing service providers that new entrants to the market, while being treated fairly, will not be allowed to cherry-pick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter does not fall strictly within my remit.  It is covered under EU directives.  I understand funding will be allowed for so-called universal service obligations from competitors within the sector, but care will be taken to ensure that new entrants are not excessively burdened and universal service obligations will be distributed in a fair and transparent manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that most of what he is saying is academic, that his Government have concluded a deal with the ESB unions whereby all foreseeable requirements <Col N="1318" /> for new generating capacity will be put in place under ESB ownership for the sole purpose of preventing competition in energy generation?  Is he aware there is a significant danger of a complaint being made to the Competition Directorate of the European Union in relation to this specific issue, the Irish Government, behind the scenes, having decided to emasculate competition in the electricity market?  Would it not have been more frank to have told the House that a deal has been done behind the scenes, whereby competition in generating electricity here has been postponed for at least five years because the ESB has been given the go-ahead to build two new generating stations and, in any event, the State will be providing a third, peat-fired one in the midlands?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  I will reiterate what I said to Deputy Lynch. The ESB and all other State companies are amenable to Irish competition law which stipulates that it is illegal to abuse a dominant position or to engage in anti-competitive agreements so that any such breaches would be in contravention of competition law.  Under the legislation I hope to put through the House, enforcement powers under competition law will be extended to the Competition Authority to ensure its more prompt response on issues of anti-competitive behaviour.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to <Col N="1319" /> my reply to Question No. 36 in this House on 21 November 1995 &mdash; columns 924 to 925, volume 458, No. 5 &mdash; which adverted, <i>inter alia,</i> to the question now raised by the Deputy.  I would further refer the Deputy to my foreword to the Companies Report for July 1993 to December 1994, presented to the Oireachtas last month wherein I indicated that no useful purpose would be served by changing the legal status of the office.  This is the policy position on legal status that continues to obtain. However, I will continue to promote greater autonomy, including a more commercial and service orientated structure, in the Companies Office and in other agencies of the Department.</P>
      <P>I visited the office before Christmas to meet the staff and see for myself the day-to-day operations of the office.

Significantly, the office has had its own dedicated financial allocation since January 1994.  This permits management to allocate financial resources to the priorities it considers most appropriate.  There have been a variety of plans finalised in recent times.  In the critical area of information technology, there will be a substantial further investment in line with a new IT plan over the next few years. The Companies Office management have recently received a &ldquo;business process re-engineering&rdquo; report which, in association with the new IT plan, will be implemented to streamline procedures and working methods.</P>
      <P>As befits a customer orientated organisation, staff of the office regularly attend seminars and conferences and make presentations in areas that impact on the operations of the office.  To cite just a few: the office has had stands at &ldquo;Business Arena&rdquo; exhibitions and earlier this month had a stand, to meet its customers, at the &ldquo;Self-Employed 96&rdquo; exhibition in Tallaght when some 16,000 persons filed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have agreed to establish <Col N="1320" /><i>&ldquo;CROlink&rdquo;,</i> a new vehicle for structured liaison between customers and the Companies Office and I have recently issued invitations to nine bodies to propose nominees for membership.</P>
    <P>During 1996 it is intended to relocate the Companies Office from its current inappropriate accommodation to more customer friendly premises in the Dublin city area.  I am confident that these measures, which form an integral element of plans for the future of the office, will serve to considerably improve customer service and the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the office over the next few years.  Again I wish to affirm that the office has worked very effectively with its available resources and pay tribute to all the staff involved.</P>

      <P>I would not like it inferred from my question or the Minister's reply that I am in any way critical of the staff in that office who are doing a trojan job of work in appalling circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the relocation of the office which he said would render it more customer friendly. Where exactly will it be relocated?  In this context, would he agree it is important that there be genuine autonomy involving remuneration for the management of the Companies Registration Office who should be given every possible incentive to be as commercial as possible and allowed determine its wage structure and incentive packages?</P>
      <P>Would he agree that the real issue is the need to establish criteria by which the performance of that office can be judged in terms of &ldquo;turn around&rdquo; time in respect of matters which have to be registered, the up-to-date quality of material available and the extent to which the office prosecutes companies in default or which have been struck off the register?  If there were to be performance criteria, would the Minister agree that things would be a lot better, when the public could judge whether the quality of service had improved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be accepted that, traditionally, the Companies Office has suffered from inadequate resources; even the authorised staff complement &mdash; which I understand is of the order of 99 &mdash; never surpassed 80. The accommodation &mdash; which I visited since Deputy McDowell's last question &mdash; is completely inadequate, grossly over-cramped, staff endeavouring to cope with impossible demands in very unsuitable, cramped conditions, all of which must be taken into account.  In fairness to their performance &mdash; on which I note Deputy McDowell is not reflecting in any way &mdash; of course I agree with the Deputy's suggestion that the office be given greater incentive to be commercial, efficient and effective in its responses.</P>
      <P>Indeed the present attitude of my Department to offices like the Companies Office, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Register of Friendly Societies and the Competition Authority, is to afford them optimum autonomy to arrange commercial and efficient responses to their users.  However, the question of extending that to permitting their managers to set their own salary guidelines, as suggested by Deputy McDowell, is not possible within the structure of public service pay.  Indeed, it is a phenomenon one observes in terms of the application of the recommendations of the Gleeson report to chief executives, whose remuneration falls within its remit, that in some cases it is being side-stepped by contract arrangements and the like, not a permanent arrangement that would work indefinitely into the future.  That is my personal view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Companies Office is now well managed and that the problem relates to its inadequate resources which this Government is tackling.  On the last occasion I answered questions on this matter, I referred to the development of an information technology plan and the allocation of resources for its implementation. On the matter of performance criteria, to which Deputy McDowell <Col N="1322" /> referred, the announcement I made in reply to this question in respect of the establishment of the <i>&ldquo;CROlink&rdquo;</i> will do precisely that.  It will set the performance criteria.  I do not wish to go into it in greater detail until the persons to whose organisations I have written to ask them to make nominations have replied.  They are the users of the service being provided by the Companies Office.  I have no doubt the establishment of a users' council, if you want to call it that, will address the questions Deputy McDowell raised in terms of the performance of the office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister forgot to mention the new location of the Companies Registration Office.  I have the impression that I will not get an answer to that question.  This is a &ldquo;goodie&rdquo; that has to be announced under the auspices of the spin doctors rather than in the Dáil.  This is good news to which Members are not entitled until the spin doctors have the press release ready.  I will repeat the question and again challenge the Minister to tell us where in Dublin there are more customer friendly premises to which this office will remove itself.  I invite the Minister to pay this House the elementary respect of telling us first rather than calling a highly expensive press conference where he can posture as being the friend of industry to achieve the same result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, as I understand it, there is no good reason the Companies Registration Office should not be self-financing in that the cost of registration, making inquiries, putting in returns and so on should be capable of being covered by the charges made.  Is the office self-financing and, if so, why are there so many vacancies in its nominal establishment? If it is not self-financing why will the Minister not make it self-financing? If he does so, will he agree that, in those circumstances, it should be contracted to an agency rather than carried on <Col N="1323" /> within the public service?  There is no good reason it should not be.  If Bord Telecom can run the telephone service I suggest there is no reason a similar body cannot run the Companies Registration Office on a self-financing basis.</P>

The office is substantially self-financing as it stands and is becoming more so.  I envisage if it had the resources, space and facilities to deal with the demands on it in 1996, it would become more self-financing than at present.  In fairness, any assessment of the modern Companies Registration Office would conclude that it is doing a very effective job and as the resource demands are increasingly met, over the <Col N="1324" /> next couple of years, it will do an excellent job about which there can be no complaint and no necessity to alter its legal status.</P>

On the other hand, if they know about it why can I not know about it?  Is there a huge secret about it, or is it that the landlord of this premises does not yet know the Minister has his eye on it or is not in negotiation? It is an extraordinary way to deal with Parliament that the Minister will not reveal basic information to the House.

    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> The Government has accepted the changes recommended for community employment and has agreed to the introduction of a work experience programme and a pilot whole time jobs option as recommended by the task force.  I elaborated the details of how I propose to implement these recommendations in my speech on the budget yesterday, and I shall circulate details of the new approach to Deputies shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition I will be introducing a job subsidy scheme and special measures for 18 and 19 year olds, the details of which I also mentioned to the House yesterday.</P>

Is that the extent of the scheme &mdash; £2,000 for 5,000 people who are now on the live register &mdash; the total amount for which £1 million &mdash; at most &mdash; is provided?  Will the Minister indicate what steps he proposes to take to ensure that as and from 1 July there is a 5,000 uptake and that we do not have the usual farce by September or October that plans are well advanced to do something on one front or another? Will the Minister also deal with the question of young unemployed people and, in particular, indicate if he is happy with the suggestion that young unemployed people should spend six months on the dole before they are obliged to register and get involved with the training proposals, as suggested by the Minister for Social Welfare?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this scheme is to provide opportunities for people who have very little chance of getting a placement.  The reality is that those who have been unemployed for three years have a less than 20 per cent chance of obtaining employment during the year.  We are determined to give greater preference to persons who are long-term unemployed.  This scheme is deliberately designed to give an extra chance to the long-term unemployed to access the employment growth we are now enjoying.</P>
      <P>As regards the measure for the 18 and 19 year olds, I welcome the proposal to register after six months.  We want to provide a targeted programme for those in danger of drifting into long-term unemployment.  Many young people might join the live register simply in transition, between one job and another.  We want to bring in a programme which is designed to head off the danger of entry to long-term unemployment. Many of those are people with low or no qualifications.  It is appropriate to select the six-month period for the introduction of these programmes. This approach has been used successfully in other countries and has been endorsed by the National Economic and Social Forum in its approach to targeting long-term unemployed young people.  This approach will reap considerable benefits in the future.</P>

It will have to gain the confidence of employers and will be administered by the local employment service which will build up contacts with employers, particularly in long-term unemployment blackspots. The funding is based on an orderly expansion of the scheme and it is expected that there will be 1,500-2,000 on it by the end of the year.  The Government is clearly committed to the scheme which it believes will be successful as it is built up over time to the target of 5,000.</P>

      <P>This is a very dubious measure given that the budget referred to a figure of 5,000 people but, as the Minister clearly admitted, the necessary funding has not been provided to achieve this target.  Does the Minister agree that it would have been better to <Col N="1328" /> deal with this problem in a more targeted way by giving tax incentives to employers and employees?  Does he think the subsidy of £80 per week could be exploited and give rise to widespread low paid employment?</P>

Employers must fill bona fide vacancies and we will ensure, through FÁS, that they do not make present employees redundant so as to create vacancies and avail of the subsidy.  This requirement will be built into the scheme.  This scheme is one of several new approaches being adopted by the Government.</P>

This is radically different from the position some years ago when all employees were on a rate of 12.2 per cent.  This measure is showing results.  We are also reforming employees' PRSI &mdash; I think the Progressive Democrats supported this proposal in the past &mdash; so that the first £80 is not taxed.  This is a sensible and progressive reform of the tax code which will ease the tax wedge.  The Government is determined to make unemployment a priority and this theme runs right through the budget strategy.</P>

If that is the case and 1,500 people avail of the scheme during the last three months of the year then the Minister will have gone through £1.5 million, which is 50 per cent more than the amount provided.  This shows conclusively that the 5,000 people referred to in the budget were never seriously envisaged to be the recipients of a subsidy of this order.  The reality is that approximately 1,000 people will be covered by the scheme for three months on average.  Does the Minister agree that the measure announced in the budget is a far cry from what he now intends to deliver?  He is dealing with hundreds of people over a very short period of time in the latter portion of the year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that schemes of this nature build up slowly and we will fund the take-up of it.  By the end of the year there will be 1,500-2,000 people on the scheme and we will continue to build it up during 1997.  The scheme will prove successful in time and it will take 5,000 people off the live register each year.  It will give preference to the long-term unemployed in the filling of vacancies which continue to occur in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards his aside on PRSI, the Deputy misses the point.  The PRSI reforms have meant that two thirds of <Col N="1331" /> the workforce are now on the 8.5 per cent rate of PRSI.  If the Deputy does not regard this as a radical change and continues to focus solely on the decrease from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent he will mislead the public on the intent and achievements of Government strategy.</P>

      <P>This proposal fills a gap in that young people in particular find it difficult to access employment opportunities because they do not have any work experience.  Employers prefer to recruit people with experience.  The purpose of the scheme, recommended by the task force, is to allow employers to try out prospective employees for a trial period of about five weeks.  Similar schemes have been introduced in other countries with great success.  Some have succeeded in obtaining a longer term placement with the employer concerned. Similar results can be achieved here.  This is a new approach to introducing people to the workforce and should prove worthwhile in the long-term.</P>

      <P>The truth is now emerging about the 5,000 jobs scam. The Minister has finally admitted that he is hoping to build the figure up to 1,500 over time and that in any given year &mdash; I was listening carefully &mdash; 5,000 people will avail of the scheme.  It appears that the envisaged lifetime of the subsidy is in the region of three to four months.  This is how the figure of £1 million can be explained.  Will the Minister agree that the figure of £1 million cannot subsidise 1,500 people for more than three months and that what he is saying, therefore, does not add up? Will he further agree that far fewer than 5,000 people, probably of the order of 1,200, will be on the scheme at any given time on average?</P>

      <P>Yes.  Our target each year will be to take 5,000 people off the long-term unemployment list by this scheme alone.  Other measures will also be introduced.  For example, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, proposes to expand the back to work allowance scheme by making an additional 5,000 places available this year.  That scheme, which has proved beneficial, is also targeted at the long-term unemployed under which they are offered assistance in setting up a business of their own.</P>

      <P>I agree, but the Minister spoke eloquently about matters and I want some clarification.  Was research carried out to ascertain how many employers are willing to take on these 5,000 people this year?  The public perception is that 5,000 long-term unemployed people will have jobs by the end of the year as a result of the £80 per week subsidy.  I welcome the Government's efforts in this regard, especially as my constituency has been badly affected by unemployment.

      <P>It will take time to target specific employers.  The local employment service and FÁS will be given the task of compiling a list of employers who are willing to participate in the scheme.  It would be naive to suggest this will happen overnight and I did not suggest that.  We stated that we would gradually build up the number to 5,000.  The scheme will offer real employment opportunities to those who currently have very little chance of becoming employed.</P>
      <P>In regard to additionality, when a vacancy occurs, through retirement or otherwise, it can be filled under the scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Farah operation with plants located in Kiltimagh, Ballyhaunis and Galway is owned by Farah Incorporated which is located in El Paso, Texas.</P>
      <P>Farah's corporate management has, for some time, been carrying out a restructuring of its worldwide operations and this has now resulted in the present position whereby the company has sought around 100 voluntary redundancies. I understand that the workforce has rejected the redundancy package offered by the company and, while no overall agreement has been reached, there is an indication the workforce believes that short-time working may be a better alternative.</P>
      <P>Over recent months IDA Ireland has been working intensively with Farah and other potential investors in its efforts to secure the future of the three Irish plants.  IDA and Forbairt continue to vigorously pursue this objective and a number of different scenarios is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the clothing industry generally, I recognise that this area is one of the most vulnerable sectors facing increasing competition on worldwide markets.  Labour intensive sectors like clothing need to become more competitive and this Government has made a major commitment to facilitate this process by the changes in PRSI and income tax announced in the budget.  These changes are part of the overall process of tax reform aimed at increasing both the incentive to work and take-home pay by reducing the tax wedge.  Arising from my contacts with the industry I am confident that these improvements will <Col N="1339" /> continue to be of great help to the sector in tackling the competitiveness issue. The change programme referred to above should also be of considerable assistance to the sector.</P>
    <P>My Department is continually looking at ways in which the clothing sector can be assisted in the repositioning and readjustment process which is necessary to adapt to the rapidly changing market-place. My Department, the State agencies and the industry representative associations continue to work in a co-ordinated and constructive manner in an effort to address the issues facing the industry.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on all the options are at a particularly sensitive stage and I am anxious to ensure that these can proceed in a constructive and positive manner. I can assure the Deputy that IDA (Ireland) and Forbairt will continue to work closely with all interested parties in their efforts to minimise redundancies and to ensure a positive outcome from these discussions.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify the position in relation to the Task Force on Industry Adjustment.  This group which comprises representatives from my Department, the industrial development agencies, the Labour Relations Commission and the social partners &mdash; IBEC and ICTU &mdash; provides the overall policy direction.</P>
    <P>Under the measure a change programme for SMEs was introduced.  As the Deputy is aware the measure which I launched on 18 December 1995, is designed to provide financial support and advice towards helping traditional manufacturing sectors adapt to the increasing levels of competition.  Arising from the objective to help SMEs in traditional sectors like clothing, this particular programme is being administered by both Forbairt and Shannon Development. Assistance may be available under the programme to any revised structures which may emerge from the current negotiations in relation to Farah.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the comments of the Irish Clothing Manufacturing Federation on the budget?  It is obvious from his comments this afternoon that he is insulated, but these comments were made by a reputable organisation and reported in a reputable newspaper.  It claims the budget will mean a paltry increase to that sector.  Having taken PRSI and so on into account, it will mean £2,500 in one year to an employer, employing 50 people, in a clothing manufacturing business.  They are the vaunted proposals for which the Minister has clapped himself on the back about 40 times.  Is he aware of those comments and, if so, does he cast cold water on them or agree with them?</P>

      <P>Employers in the clothing industry will benefit significantly from the PRSI reforms as well as from the general reforms in the budget. They will benefit in particular from the change programme.  Under that programme companies who endeavour to improve their process of production can receive support for management development, training initiatives and partnership arrangements.  That is merely part of a range of measures being devised for the clothing industry. Forbairt is currently working on new training initiatives, a number of which will be specifically designed for the clothing sector.  These include the pilot innovation training schemes and the RETEX initiative.  Several initiatives are designed specifically to assist this sector to reposition itself.  There is no doubt that in order to thrive in the much more vigorous global competition, this sector will have to reposition its products and these measures are designed to assist them to do that.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that RETEX and many other measures which the Minister paraded today, have been here for years. RETEX did not materialise today when the Minister announced it; neither did other training measures when Deputy <Col N="1341" /> Quinn announced them.  When Deputy Brennan and I were in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the special training measures were introduced in response to a very real need, so the Minister is recycling old measures here.  What I am referring to is the industry's response to the Minister's arrangements for them in the budget.  It is necessary to clarify an earlier comment from the Minister.  How many people does he propose to put on the £80 per week subsidy for 1996?</P>

      <P>RETEX is not new.  I am talking about the change programme to which the Deputy referred in her question.  RETEX is still available to the sector; we are assisting this sector with a range of measures.  I would be the first to acknowledge schemes that were put in place by previous Governments where they are worthwhile and beneficial, but I was asked to describe the role of the change programme which has been announced.</P>
      <P>That very valuable programme will be built on the company development approach, it will involve a brief diagnostic type study of the needs of the company and will then allow the company to either improve its production process under the scheme, strengthen its management, develop new training initiatives, raise new funding for the business or enter into partnership arrangements; there will be a range of options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will also allow companies to avail of other programmes under Forbairt, for example, where they can draw down useful support for their company.  It is a new approach and one that will be very <Col N="1342" /> worth while in its implementation.  It responds to a genuine feeling that the last industrial programme overlooked the need of some of the traditional sectors found to be in difficulty.  There was too much emphasis on job creation, new companies coming in.  We needed to look also at the needs of traditional sectors.</P>

      <P>The objective of science, technology and innovation policy is to create an economy where industrial competitiveness is founded on the innovativeness and quality of its products, processes and services which in turn are provided by a high technically skilled workforce.  Ireland's economic development and indeed the survival and growth of its smallest companies must be based on innovation-led competitiveness rather than short-term and volatile competitiveness based on costs. There is also a need to create an environment which is conducive to innovation and risk taking and indeed to generally promote innovation awareness and an appreciation of science and technology in relation to innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important point here, which was brought out most forcibly by the Tierney report, is that in trying to create an innovation based economy a number of elements must be brought together in an integrated way to form a national system of innovation.  Innovation is not a simple or predictable process but it must be understood in terms of the links and interactions involving people, firms, <Col N="1404" /> markets, technology, skills, capital and, above all, knowledge.</P>
    <P>Looking more closely at the main elements of the national system of innovation, the State sector, third level and industry are the principal providers and users of the knowledge.  I have set out the reasons why the State must be involved in supporting the science and technology base of this country.  The State is required to make available a portfolio of activities to meet both the short and long-term needs of the economy, ranging from the funding of basic and strategic research to the provision of technical information requirements of firms.  The third level sector is required to produce graduates and post graduates trained to the highest international standards.  The enterprise sector is required to invest more of its own resources in intangible areas such as research and development and to put innovation at the core of development strategy.</P>
    <P>A positive adoptive attitude to science, technology and innovation is the single most important force for shaping long-term competitive success in Irish industry, yet most of our indigenous companies are only dimly aware of the true importance of science and technology. This lack of awareness is not confined to indigenous firms.  It extends to this House, to the media and to the public.  On a regular basis I have sought to introduce into public debate major issues relating to science, technology and innovation policy, the implications of the information society and the structure and direction of industrial development, but I regret that the public debate that one might have expected did not ensue.</P>
    <P>The legacy of the Tierney report will be its lasting contribution to an understanding of the value of investment in science and technology for a small country such as Ireland.  For my part, and following on from the Tierney report, I have asked Forfás to prepare a three year awareness campaign aimed essentially at policy makers and decision makers in the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> As the Tierney report pointed out, there is an onus too on the many organisations connected with the Irish science and technology world to play their part in the science and technology promotion effort.  Academic research is increasingly recognised as an important component of the national system of innovation in all countries.  This reflects three key aspects of the activity: its role in generating new knowledge, in providing access to sources of knowledge generated in other countries, its role in educating and training the next generation of graduates, post graduate researchers and technologists for work in academia, industry and the public sector and the increasing relevance of academic research for industrial development itself.</P>
    <P>One of the key aims must be to build bridges between science and the economy over which original, innovative and creative ideas flow from the scientific community into the economy at large; bridges across which industry, society and the economy can access the wealth of knowledge that resides in the third level sector; and bridges to a middle ground where creative ideas can be put to entrepreneurs who see a commercial value or application for such ideas, who have the ability to marshal the necessary resources and the capacity to undertake the risks involved to create a viable commercial entity which creates or meets a need.</P>
    <P>Within the national system of innovation, the Tierney report demonstrated the role of the third level sector, particularly in the areas of basic and strategic research, and sought to promote such interaction between the colleges and industry at a variety of levels.  Every country must build the capacity to create, absorb and apply new technologies, whether developed locally or elsewhere.  It is impossible to generate enough knowledge locally to meet industry's needs.  We need to be able to exploit all available national and international sources so that the economy is not at a competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> It is clear from the Tierney report on STI that where there will never be enough public money to fund the endless range of investigative research possibilities, there is an added onus on us to make the best possible use of what we have.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that we must devote adequate resources to the research activities of the third level sector to ensure that we turn out highly skilled graduates and postgraduates who provide the essential underpinning for continued innovation in the enterprise sector.</P>
    <P>As a first step in this direction I recently announced an initiative to provide a number of post doctoral research fellowships.  Where excellent projects exceed the ability to fund them by a factor of 8:1 then we are immediately into the business of prioritising and selectivity and other criteria, such as relevance to social, economic and other circumstances of our national profile, must enter the equation.  The question is how to sensitively strike the right balance. In practical terms, that means promoting greater third level industry collaboration and co-operation and generally maximising the synergy inherent in our research support schemes.</P>
    <P>It costs money and effort to create knowledge and we only begin to see a return on that when we start to use the knowledge.  That is what the recently launched National Research Support Fund Board, known as the measure four board, is all about.  This measure brings science and technology or basic and applied research together.  This is appropriate as the old distinctions between the two are, in any event, becoming blurred.</P>
    <P>We will continue, therefore, to make efforts to develop a S &amp; T strategic and align it as closely as possible with overall industrial policy involving a closer focus on the needs of the firm. However, it is also essential that this necessary process of targeting should not weaken the genuine spirit of innovation and the more outward looking perspective that has been adopted by <Col N="1407" /> progressive researchers in third level colleges.  Above all, we must endeavour to encourage and keep our best people.</P>
    <P>The Tierney report estimated that 80 per cent of Irish industry has little or no technological capability.  There is an urgent need, therefore, to look at existing programmes to see how best to enforce the STIAC recommendations aimed at increasing the technological capability and innovation performance, particularly in smaller indigenous enterprises.  The national technology audit programme has already proved useful to industry.  The process involves an analysis of a company's operations to identify opportunities where technology can lead to profitability followed by enhancement and a programme of implementation.</P>
    <P>Another programme aimed at helping companies to make better use of technology is the Tech Start programme which operates by building up technology skills within the firm.  Many companies recognise the need for innovation &mdash; whether a product or process &mdash; but where will they find help?  Tech Start aims to fill that need.  It was established in 1989 and helps companies to locate and employ suitable technical graduate skills.</P>

      <P>This budget is guaranteed to stimulate growth and activity in the one area of economic endeavour which has flourished under the stewardship of this Government; it is a budget which guarantees an increase in crime.  The Minister for Finance has cynically slammed the door on all those who looked to this Government for protection. It is a burglar's budget with a message which is clear and worth remembering &mdash; if a person is old, alone and afraid, this Government has abandoned them; if a person is young and vulnerable, this Government has no protection to offer; and if a person is worried about crime, this Government has ignored them.  Short of directly <Col N="1408" /> grant aiding crime, the Minister for Finance has made every move possible to promote its growth.</P>
      <P>At a time when terror is sweeping the nation, the only answer offered by the Minister for Finance is a publicity inspired tax break for the elderly who install alarms.  People who look for proper policing and an effective prison service have been told that if they are old enough and spend enough of their money, the Government will give them some back.  It is a concept dreamed up by a desk bound public relations consultant who knows as little about real life as the Minister for Finance cares. This budget encourages crime; it is the fiscal equivalent of a <i>nolle prosequi.</i></P>
      <P>The budget should be recognised for what it is &mdash; the public abandonment of any pretence by the Government to the implementation of a criminal justice policy.  During the past year the Minister for Justice has shown the consistency of direction of a weathervane.  Why are we surprised by the revolving prison door policy when it is being implemented by a revolving Minister? At a time when leadership and direction are needed in the fight against crime, the Taoiseach has entrusted responsibility to a Minister who has engineered more policy pirouettes in a year in office than most ballerinas execute in a lifetime.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, as the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> noted this morning, stumbles from one crisis to another giving the distinct sense of trying to make up answers as she goes along.  Yet again this week the Minister implemented her motto &mdash; invisibility is the best form of transparency &mdash; when she declined an invitation to speak on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and account to the people for the shambles she has made of her area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it that when favourable publicity is to be found, the Minister for Justice can abandon her desk with relish and be seen in innumerable photo-calls with her nose poised over the latest cache of illicit drugs?  Yet when questions need to be answered, the Minister <Col N="1409" /> who promised openness, transparency and accountability delivers absence, obfuscation and evasion.  It is a poor reflection on the Department of Justice when its Minister relies on the right to silence as the cornerstone of her duty to be publicly accountable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice's cavalcade of publicly funded media consultants have taken the opening words of the legal caution &ldquo;you are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so&rdquo; and turned them into a press policy for her Department.  How much will taxpayers pay this year to have the Minister for Justice advised when to run and when to hide?  In one short year, she has turned indecision into an art form and institutionalised indifference.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Tánaiste swapped his vision of a rotating Taoiseach for a revolving Minister for Justice who would point in whichever direction the wind blew.  From her bungling of the Brink's-Allied fiasco to her Cabinet contortions over Castlerea she has come to personify everything which is incompetent in this Administration and her contribution to this budget confirms that view.</P>
    <P>It is sad that in the concerted campaign of guerrilla warfare that substituted for Cabinet discussions in the lead-up to the budget, the Department of Justice was yet again outmanoeuvred. During 1995 we saw that the voice of the Minister for Justice was so valued at Cabinet that her colleagues could make cuts in her Department's budget in her absence.  Mindful of this, she brought her battle to the press and publicly warned her colleagues that if they did not start to take crime seriously, they had no hope of retaining office.  Today she has received her answer and she knows that her voice carries as little weight outside Cabinet as inside.  In the game of fiscal roulette which passes for financial policy under this Government, the Minister for Justice has yet again lost her chips and has been sent from the table.</P>
    <P>The budget represents another humiliation for the victims of crime. <Col N="1410" /> Government protestations regarding its effectiveness in the fight against crime are as illusory as the rainbow which it projects itself to be.  The fight against crime should be a priority for any Administration.  However, this Government has accorded it the status of a confused afterthought.  The Minister for Finance need take no comfort from the fact that his party does not hold the Justice portfolio.  He will be remembered as the man who garrotted the Department of Justice in the middle of a crime wave.</P>
    <P>Crime now threatens our traditional way of life in rural as well as urban areas.  No cottage is too remote, no amount too small, no person too old to escape the attentions of marauding criminals.  The protection of citizens is a fundamental obligation in any society.  I remind the rainbow coalition that in a hierarchy of obligation it is a superior obligation, a duty that takes priority over other duties.  This Government is failing in that duty.  This budget has guaranteed that this failure will continue into the future, and the price failure will not be paid by this Government. It will be paid in suffering, hurt and deprivation by those least able to afford it &mdash; the old, the poor and the vulnerable.</P>
    <P>This budget was a golden opportunity for the Government to launch a crusade against crime, to say to the people that the mistakes of the past were being put behind them and that a new, coherent policy would be pursued, a twofold policy of crime detection and punishment coupled with crime prevention, a policy which would result in the elimination of unacceptable backlogs in the criminal courts and make provision for the incarceration of those found guilty of serious offences.  However, this budget only promises us more crime from the criminals and more indifference from the Government.</P>
    <P>The reason is the Government is more concerned with appearance and presentation than with policy and its implementation.  In short, it is a cosmetic Government.  The scale of the money being squandered on armies of <Col N="1411" /> managers, handlers, advisers and consultants for the members of this Government indicate its true priorities &mdash; a desire to look good whatever the cost.  Illusion has replaced reality in the mind of this Government.  The illusion of success is more important to it than the reality of terror-stricken pensioners afraid to sleep at night for fear of the consequences of the Government's indifference.</P>
    <P>In delivering the Budget Statement the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, showed all the sincerity of a hostage speaking at gun point.  When the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, demanded a political ransom from the Government, it decided to pay, and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, was sent out to read the terms of surrender. The Minister, Deputy De Rossa, is the real Taoiseach.  When he says &ldquo;jump&rdquo; the Cabinet asks &ldquo;how high?&rdquo;.  His indifference to crime has brought us to where we are.</P>
    <P>No domestic cause in modern Ireland deserves greater support and encouragement than the fight against crime. No Government will ever have a better opportunity to confront crime and plan the future of its criminal justice strategy than this Government had this week.  It has failed to grasp the fundamental principle that a coherent criminal justice strategy is a necessity, not a luxury.  It is not something which can be viewed as optional or superfluous.  It is one of the foundations upon which a healthy society rests.  This budget continues to permit that foundation to be eroded by lawlessness.  The Government has not brought this about by mere inadvertence. It is a deliberate policy of calculated indifference arising out of an inability to formulate a coherent policy. The same muddled indifference can be seen throughout the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance arrived in this House with a Budget Statement that was put together with scissors and paste.  Separate political interests drafted and crafted their individual paragraphs and policies without regard <Col N="1412" /> to any coherent overall strategy other than, of course, retention of office.  That is the sole unifying theme in a budget which has all the hallmarks of being put together with political chewing gum and string.</P>
    <P>There is a price to be paid for a budget drafted with a view to political survival rather than economic well being.  It is a price this country will have to pay in the coming years and as they put their hands deeper into their pockets many voters will ask what Fine Gael stand for.  From the perspective of Cabinet discipline, the snooty aloofness adopted by Fine Gael Ministers during the Spring-Rabbitte street fight was commendable, but it is no substitute for an economic policy.  Where in this tax-and-spend budget is the Fine Gael input to be found?  Where is the prudence of financial management much loved by Fine Gael in their contributions to debates in this House?  The necessity of political survival has led the Minister for Finance to warmly embrace the drunken sailor school of economics, and Fine Gael has paid for the rum.  The sooner the Fine Gael Ministers realise there is more to being in Government than sitting at a Cabinet table passing time before lunch, the better.</P>
    <P>Bringing the public finances to the state of fiscal health the Minister Deputy Quinn inherited from the Leader of my party last year took political imagination and prudent management. It did not happen overnight nor without effort on the part of taxpayers. All that has now been squandered.  Fine Gael's talk of tax reform is a hollow joke.  Any Government which cannot institute substantial tax reforms when the economy is growing at its present rate will never do so.  This week the Minister for Finance showed himself to be an economic disciple of the Duchess of York.  He has embarked on a programme of reckless spending in the hope that Budgie the Helicopter will arrive to provide the necessary airlift to fiscal safety in the future.  Such fairy tale finance as we were treated to by the Minister makes pleasant listening and <Col N="1413" /> reading but it has no basis in reality.  It is devoid of purpose of policy and its aim is political, not economic or social.</P>
    <P>This is Deputy Quinn's last budget. No one in this House is in any doubt but that the shadow-boxing of the Ministers Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Rabbitte were but a warm-up for the knock-out blow they have long intended to deliver this time next year.  Not even the most hallucinogenic of political forecasters can envisage Deputy De Rossa fighting the next election as part of a Government. The political ransom extracted on the floor of this House by Deputy De Rossa may buy some time, but it will not save this Government from its inevitable political fate &mdash; electoral oblivion.</P>
    <P>The Government which flagged itself as the most left wing Administration in the history of the State gave miserable increases in social welfare in two successive budgets.  The elderly, who got an increase the equivalent of the price of a lollipop in their living alone allowances last year, were told they would have to be wealthy enough to pay tax before they could be assisted in the purchase of a burglar alarm this year.  There is no true red-blooded socialist who would not say the safety and protection of the lives of the poor is as important as the safety and protection of the property and lives of those who are more fortunate.</P>
    <P>That is only the half of it.  Labour and Democratic Left beat their red socialist breasts in Opposition, but show their true hypocritical hearts in Government. In this budget, they used the twin-track approach to ensure there would be no real tax reform this year either.  Fine Gael will not derail them, but they had better know, and know now, that they are on a collision course with the electorate who have not been fooled.  Everybody knows now there is no crock of gold at the end of the rainbow, that it was an illusion after all.</P>
    <P>In December 1994 all the Taoiseach wanted for Christmas, to coin a phrase based on a children's song, was his two left feet.  He has had them for over a year now and all he has managed to do <Col N="1414" /> is to score own goal after own goal.  It is pitiful for his dwindling army of followers that he has destroyed the spirit and heart of his party.  What is much worse is that he is destroying the spirit and heart of Nationalist Ireland also.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday the Taoiseach likened his Justice Minister to Kevin O'Higgins. It was my fellow townsman, Daniel O'Connell, who said of Peel originally, but it was repeated by Kevin O'Higgins who said of Lord Balfour &ldquo;he sat there with a smile like moonlight on a tombstone&rdquo;. That, in short, is the face of the rainbow coalition Government as it slides towards its inevitable and fateful meeting with the people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>In Education, 1996 is the year of the total abolition of undergraduate tuition fees.  It is also the year of expansion and consolidation of the early start programme for pre-school children in disadvantaged areas.  It is the year when financial allocations to schools for their running costs have been increased by six times the rate of inflation at primary level and more than three times the rate of inflation at second level.</P>
      <P>Nineteen ninety six is the year when grants for school running costs have again been especially targeted at schools designated as being disadvantaged.  It is the year when student maintenance grants have risen by double the rate of inflation and it is the year when a new, targeted and expanded vocational training opportunities scheme offers hope of a better future to the long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the budget debate.  The total gross provision for the four Education Votes for 1996 is almost £2.2 billion &mdash; an increase of over £100 million on the 1995 Estimates allocation.  The 1996 Estimates demonstrate convincingly the Government's major commitment to quality in education and to continuing the task of eliminating disadvantage in our education system.  These are the first annual Estimates since the publication of the White Paper on Education <Col N="1415" /> and they mark an important phase in its implementation.</P>
    <P>The 1996 provision for education reflects our view that the development of the education and skills of people is as important a source of wealth as the accumulation of more traditional forms of capital.  National and international bodies have identified the central role of education and training as one of the critical sources of economic and social well-being in modern society.</P>
    <P>The World Competitiveness Report surveyed 48 countries.  It tested their education systems and how they respond to the need of a competitive economy.  Ireland's education system ranks second, after Singapore, among these 48 countries.  This is truly testimony to the wisdom of investment in education, but we cannot and we will not be complacent.  The OECD calculate that in 1992, about 70 per cent of unemployed people in Ireland had left school before completion of senior cycle.  That is why targeted investment, to retain young people in school and provide second chances for adult learners, is essential for Ireland's future.</P>
    <P>The increased provision for primary education in the 1996 Estimates demonstrates that the provision of adequate resources for primary education continues to be a priority for this Government. All subsequent education and training is built upon the foundation of primary education.</P>
    <P>This year the capitation rate in primary schools rises by £5 to £45 per pupil, while in schools designated as disadvantaged it rises by £10 to £75 per pupil.  In the three years since I came into office the ordinary primary capitation rate has risen by 61 per cent while the targeted capitation rate in schools designed as disadvantaged has risen by two thirds.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Estimates include a provision of £150,000 for a substance abuse programme at primary school level. This programme will be implemented in co-operation with the Departments of Justice and Health as well as the Garda <Col N="1416" /> Síochána, teachers, parents and other interests.  It forms and important part of the Government's strategy to combat the menace that drug abuse poses to our young people.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Estimates provide almost £860 million gross for the second level Vote.  This is approximately £30 million greater than the 1995 provisions.  The Government is committed to achieving a 90 per cent completion rate at senior cycle by the year 2000, but simply having students stay longer in school is not enough.  We must reform our curricula. We must introduce new types of leaving certificate.  Only by doing this can we provide courses which will meet the needs of all our young people.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Estimates provide for a rise of £12 in the capitation rate given to second level pupils in the free scheme, and a £27 rise in the capitation rate in second level schools designated disadvantaged. That more than adequately recognises the necessity for adequate funding for the variety of new programmes already in our schools meeting the needs of an increasing number of pupils staying on to complete the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>The total budget provision for first and second level education in 1996 is almost £1.6 billion.  Over £1.2 billion of this provision, or 75 per cent, is for the salaries of teachers.  It is imperative that such a huge investment be used efficiently and effectively.  All programmes at first and second level should be subject to continuous review and evaluation because the quality of the education system is a vital factor in getting value for investment.  The Inspectorate of my Department which currently has the main responsibility at national level for quality assurance is concerned about this.</P>
    <P>I have begun a consultative process with teachers, parents and school managements to introduce a new model of school inspection in both first and second level schools.  This approach will ensure that each school is inspected and reported upon as a unit.  The inspection will focus on the development of staff, <Col N="1417" /> the quality of school buildings and the provision for meeting individual student needs.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned with the manner in which all our resources, human, physical and financial, are being used.  I will shortly issue invitations to the partners in education to work with me on the introduction of whole school inspection.</P>
    <P>On the provision for third level education the 1996 Estimates provide for gross expenditure on the third level Vote of over £520 million.  This is an increase of over £58 million on the 1995 allocation.  This level of funding will permit continued expansion of student numbers in third level education.  It enables me to increase the level of student maintenance grants by 5 per cent, that is by twice the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year when many young people are filling up their CAOCAS forms, there is a hype surrounding the minority of high points courses.  I want to ensure young people take on board the many courses which have much more modest points requirements.</P>
    <P>There are more places than ever available at third level, almost 17,000 extra places since I came into office. There is more investment than ever in facilities at third level and third level is seen to be accessible to all in a way which it never was before because of the abolition of full time undergraduate tuition fees.</P>
    <P>I have a vision of education as it continues from the early start pre-school to the third level college.  We must support our students in education and encourage them to fully benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Before the abolition of full time undergraduate fees, 37,000 of the 88,000 people in third level education paid fees.  Families whose income was in excess of £60,000 a year had enough tax saving on covenants to pay student fees. Children of some university employees enjoyed free tuition in various colleges and there was public disquiet that many families of modest means had to struggle to pay third level fees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> Now all that has changed.  The system is fair to all.  It will, I hope, reverse the trend which was shown over the past 12 years where, in contrast to every other socio-economic group, the children of families of modest means, the children of nurses, guards, teachers, and public servants, actually saw their participation rates at third level fall while participation rates from every other group rose.</P>
    <P>The abolition of under graduate tuition fees is an achievement which demonstrates that higher education is for all without barriers of income, social status or family background.  The abolition of fees has improved access to higher education, something that Deputy Michael Martin promised on the national airwaves in July 1994.</P>
    <P>Not all young people will reach third level or even the leaving certificate. That is why I am pleased to announce an additional 450 Youthreach places this year to prevent young people being trapped in a cycle of disadvantage and am glad the increased Youthreach provision dovetails with the 500 youth employment option places established by the Government for 18 to 19 year olds.</P>
    <P>The vocational training opportunity scheme is aimed at older people who are unemployed.  During the last year I was criticised for not proceeding with the proposed expansion of this scheme and for not making a further 1,000 places available in 1995.  I was told that course after course had to be cancelled because of the failure to expand the number of places.</P>
    <P>When I investigated I found some disquieting facts.  Many vocational education committees did not fill their quota of VTOS places and the drop out rate from VTOS was disturbingly high. When I investigated individual courses which had to be cancelled, I found there was the capacity to run these courses despite assertions to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Why are the 1,000 places now being restored?  They are restored because they will not be simply more of the same <Col N="1419" /> type of programme.  They will be targeted in areas where they are needed most and will operate with specific support structures for adult learners and with special arrangements which will be informed by the recent consultancy study on VTOS which I will publish shortly.</P>
    <P>Many of those who called so loudly for more VTOS places in 1995 seemed to emphasise quantity with little regard for quality.  I will ensure that the 1,000 extra places for which the 1996 Estimates provide are quality places; our unemployed people deserve no less.</P>
    <P>This budget shows the Government's commitment to education.  The education Estimates show targeted prudent and productive investment in our people.  The emphasis on quality in the education system which is evident throughout the White Paper <i>Charting Our Education Future</i> will ensure that this investment will yield rich rewards for individuals and for society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget could be described as being complacent.  Complacency denotes a smug satisfaction in holding office, but the ability of the so called talents of the left allied to Fine Gael, to come up with innovative ideas to target those most in need or to provide an impetus in the productive sector has been conspicious by its absence.  We should reflect on how sad it is that a Government that came in at the top of the economic cycle when we had unprecedented levels of growth and the most healthy public finances for 15 years is unable to get over the ideological problems that beset it.  There is a failure to see politics as an ability to improve this country.  Politicians see the opportunity, as members of this Government, to pursue their own base sectional interests and shore up that part of the constituency that they declare is more theirs than anybody elses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt to give the impression they have a social conscience while failing to understand how the economy operates gives rise to the most damning <Col N="1420" /> reproach one can articulate during this budget debate.  Unfortunately members in Government do not know how the economy operates.  Some are late converts to the concept of a social market economy and it has only been in the latest part of their political development that they have moved from a revolutionary view to a democratically based approach to the resolution of problems in society.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, having come into office in 1987 when the crisis of confidence had enveloped our society, were faced with the perception that we were incapable of dealing responsibly with our problems and managing our way out of them.  In common parlance, it was felt we did not deserve our independence because we were throwing away the opportunities presented to us.  That crisis of confidence, that limited horizon of opportunity was swept aside by a determined Government in a minority position.  We were anxious to do the right thing by the economy and sort out the mess in the public finances inherited from the 1982-87 debacle.</P>
    <P>We have come so far in overturning that problem and in coming to grips with the ability to produce a budget where Government expenditure bears some relationship to the revenue collected by Government.  A fundamental in the proper management of our economy is being cast aside by this Government at the very height of the economic cycle.  We have unprecedented levels of Structural Funds coming into our economy, representing in the region of 5 per cent of GNP annually.  This presents a great opportunity to us, yet we see the Government throwing it away.  We say to those in the productive sector that we require even greater effort and will provide even greater incentives to drive the economic growth that will create jobs and make the productive sector stronger so that we can provide for the high level of public services which our people anticipate from a responsible or socially caring Government.</P>
    <P>The problem with the ideological <Col N="1421" /> base of this Government and the problem in terms of those who are influencing policy is that they do not understand the basic economic facts.  One cannot provide for the foreseeable future the high level of public services we would all like to see if we hinder the productive sector.</P>
    <P>The complacency I am talking about is that Government members unused to being in Government see an opportunity to spend to hold their constituencies together politically for the next elections.  They are not really concerned about people who must take a risk to build a revenue base for a Government in a position to provide services from revenue.  Whatever about one's criticisms of targets, policies or political persuasion of the previous Administrations, they restored credibility to the public finances.  For the first time in many years we had Governments that not only met the fiscal targets they set themselves but improved on them.  I have observed that change in the political culture whereby a Government or Minister for Finance can outline programmes and policies and come what may will stick to them.  We did that under severe criticism from the then Opposition.  The problem is that the current Government set targets which were even more lenient than those of its predecessor. However, within one year of coming into office and in the most benign economic circumstances possible for any Government given all the opportunities created in the previous decade in terms of getting the economy into proper shape, the Government broke its own targets.  It exceeded spending targets and this aspect is fundamental to maintain confidence and ensure continued growth in the economy if we are to tackle the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>It is too often forgotten that since the 1930s more people are now at work; the level is higher than ever before.  The policies pursued in the past were successful and there was a need, once the top of the cycle had been reached, not to get involved in a further extravagant <Col N="1422" /> expenditure binge.  If all other circumstances are equal, expenditure in terms of maintaining public services during a recession is a proper economic option. It is prudent action when the proper management of any economy is examined seriously.  However, it is crazy to get involved in an expenditure binge at the top of an economic cycle.</P>
    <P>The £12 billion expenditure barrier was exceeded in the Book of Estimates presented before Christmas and this dictated the type of budget introduced this week.  It decided the amount of room for manoeuvre available for the forgotten majority, the people at work.  Many of them are on low and middle incomes and are caught not just in poverty traps but also in marginal tax rate traps. Those people who worked for the economic growth in the previous decade were entitled to expect relief from a responsible Government, they were entitled to expect more in their pay packets and that the Government would continue to control expenditure.</P>
    <P>However, this did not happen because of the sectoralism which is rife in the Cabinet and which came to the fore in the Ministers budget speech. Every sector had to be considered because some people felt that certain constituencies were more theirs than anybody elses, those who feel that their political street cred can only be maintained if we tinker with a few schemes here and there.  They forgot about the productive base of the economy which determines the ability of any Minister to spend 1p in their Department.  This aspect was completely forgotten.  The lost tribe of modern Irish political life is the million or so taxpayers who make it possible to deal with the high dependency ratio in the economy, to look after the old, sick and infirm by providing pensions and to provide proper educational structure for the young so they can compete in the jobs market in the future.  This is the biggest criticism that can be levelled at the budget.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the so called dominant member of the Government, a party of self styled free enterprise, has nothing <Col N="1423" /> to say to employers who are trying to create wealth and jobs in the economy. When Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, as eminent a businessman as he is a politician, referred to the corporation tax reduction of 38 per cent to 30 per cent as a fillip for small business, I wondered at what stage politics overtakes business acumen.  Everyone is aware that the limit of £50,000 on profits is minimal and the increase available to small business people is a £4,000 rebate on existing tax liability.  What will this do to generate wealth in the economy? We should remember that only one-third of small business is incorporated in companies; two-thirds do not have companies. Should they not be considered as people making a contribution to whom incentives should be given to provide more jobs?</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting my matter which relates to the impending nurses' strike and the problems it is likely to create. I also thank Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, for coming to the House to respond.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister of State of the huge level of anxiety among the public as a result of the rampant crime wave. However, anxiety is also rising among the old, the sick and their families at the prospect of a nurses' strike and the disruption it will cause to an essential public service, the nursing service.  This matter has not yet received media attention. It is the Minister for Health's responsibility to ensure the continuity of health services.  I appeal to him to act now before matters deteriorate, to take whatever steps are open to him and his Department to ensure talks recommence and are brought to a successful conclusion and to ensure the threatened strike is averted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> Nurses must not be put in a position where they have no option but to strike. Their list of demands is reasonable and must be given a hearing.  There has been no review of pay and conditions in the nursing profession since 1980.  We should consider the nature and scale of changes in medical and hospital technology and nursing practice in the intervening 15 years.  None of these factors, including the increasing range of demands on nurses, have been taken into account.  The required improvements in pay and conditions are long overdue.</P>
    <P>Nurses are among the most dedicated professionals in the public and private sectors.  Their dedication and professionalism cannot be taken for granted any longer.  Within the health services, nurses have heavy responsibilities, long working hours and difficult working conditions.  These facts are not reflected in the off-hand attitude adopted by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, in his few comments to date in response to their protests.  I regret the Minister is not in the House to address this important issue.  I trust his absence is not a measure of a lack of attention to the fundamental importance of this matter.</P>
    <P>In the budget the House voted in excess of £2 billion to the Minister for the running of the health services in the next year.  Taxpayers who pay this money, would, given the opportunity, vote for a decent deal for nurses.  They would not wish nurses to be treated shabbily.  Under the offer currently on the table, I understand an increase of 1 per cent would be offered to a certain category of nurses.  If that is not treating nurses shabbily, I do not know what is shabby treatment.  I am not aware of workers in any sector who would consider 1 per cent anything less or more than an insult.  They have been treated shabbily.  Those of us who vote £2 billion to the Department of Health would not wish to see our money spent in a manner that overlooks the legitimate needs and demands of nurses.</P>
    <P>Other factors must be taken into <Col N="1425" /> account and cannot be ignored by the Minister.  There is a high level of anxiety among patients, prospective patients, their families and those who need to avail of the health services.  The Minister must take whatever steps are open to him to recommence negotiations and ensure that the pay, conditions and career structure of nurses reflect the professionalism and qualifications of members of the nursing profession.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for giving me this opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister for Health, who is unavoidably absent, to the issue she has raised on the proposed industrial action by nursing unions.</P>
      <P>Health service management has been engaged in entensive discussions with the nursing unions on the application of a special pay increase, as provided for in the agreement on pay in the public service incorporated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The nursing unions have currently suspended their participation in these discussions. Any widespread industrial action by nurses would have major implications for the delivery of health services.  While I am concerned about the potential impact of the threatened nurses strike, I am firmly of the view that there is still scope in the negotiation process which should be further explored.</P>
      <P>It is in that context that the Minister for Health has been urging the unions, for some time, to return to negotiations. I am pleased to inform the House that following intervention by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the union and management sides have agreed to engage in exploratory talks early next week.  Given the sensitivity of these discussions, any further comment at this time would not be appropriate or constructive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  I am <Col N="1426" /> concerned about the driving test centre in Mallow where 600 people await driving tests and there is a waiting period of 17 weeks.  No driving test inspectors were available in Mallow for 14 weeks last year.  That is not good enough.  I understand that does not apply elsewhere. In other areas people walk in off the street and take a driving test.  Cork should not be treated any differently.</P>
      <P>There is no point in young people applying for a job if they do not hold a full driving licence.  If they are not fully qualified drivers they are penalised by insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. B. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no basis for the Deputy's assertion that people living in Border counties are treated any differently, in terms of availability of driving test appointments to the rest of the country. It has always been and continues to be the policy of my Department that the same standard of facilities should be available throughout the country in relation to driving tests and that waiting periods for tests should be maintained, so far as is possible, at the same level. Inevitably, for operational reasons, differences in waiting times will occur between centres from time to time but over the longer term these differences balance out.  These operational reasons have to do, principally, with the fact that demand for tests vary from place to place and, as a consequence, many centres would not support the presence of a driver tester on a full-time basis. For this reason, in such centres, some build up of test applications is necessary to ensure efficient and cost effective use of driver testers' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The longest waiting period for a test in Mallow is currently about 17 weeks compared to 15 weeks nationally and 18 weeks in the Border counties as a whole.  Many applicants, however, are tested more quickly.  In particular any applicant who indicates a need for an early test for reasons such as employment or travel abroad is facilitated.  In fact, records show that over the six <Col N="1427" /> month period between July and December 1995 all those applicants in Mallow who indicated a need for an early test were tested within six weeks of applying.  From these figures two things are clear.  One, the Mallow area is treated no differently to other areas and, two, those who need early tests do not have to wait an inordinate length of time to get them.</P>
    <P>Having said that, however, it is the Minister's intention to reduce waiting periods generally.  The time available for tests reduces sharply during the winter months since testing is not considered to be feasible after dark.  With the onset of brighter days from the end of February onwards, greater testing output will bring about a reduction in the waiting time.  In order to accelerate and consolidate this reduction the Minister arranged for the recruitment and training of seven additional driver testers late last year bringing the total strength up to a current 72 testers. These additional testers are now operational and will make a significant contribution over the coming months.  The Minister is, at present, considering what additional initiatives may be possible to secure a sustained improvement.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's intention to ensure that an efficient testing service will continue to be available to the public and that waiting periods for driving tests will be maintained at an acceptable level.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this matter.  At a time when science and technology are supposed to be high on the national agenda I was appalled to hear that a centre that has won international awards in this field is to close.  The Regional Telecommunications and Information Technology Centre in Letterkenny was set up in 1988 under the aegis of the County Donegal vocational education committee. On 29 December 1995, Donegal <Col N="1428" /> Vocational Education Committee decided to terminate its association with the centre forthwith and the staff were given one month's notice.</P>
      <P>This is an internationally recognised centre of excellence with a reputation for developing multi-media applications, one of which, Heritage: A Visitor's Guide to Ireland, was on display at EXPO 92.  It won international awards for these applications and represented the EU Commission on a number of occasions at major exhibitions.  One of its multi-media applications was on display at the Washington International Conference.</P>
      <P>The centre also engages in consultancy, software development and training for companies in the north-west region.  It is the catalyst in the north-west for promoting information technology and telecommunications and was a key player in setting up three cross-Border institutions, namely Ernact EEIG, ECOM, EEIG and Northwest Consortium.  The centre has not received any financial support or counterpart funding from the Exchequer since it was set up.  Donegal Vocational Education Committee gave it free accommodation.</P>
      <P>The centre has been very successful in the call for proposals under the Fourth Framework EU Research and Development Programme. It won 14 contracts to the value of £950,000 over the next three years.  It is partly matching the EU Commission in these projects out of its own resources but this is not adequate.  In order to fulfil the contracts it has acquired the centre would require approximately £100,000 per year in matching funds.  That would underpin the 15 jobs available.  The centres in Limerick and Cork have been funded annually by the Exchequer.  I make an urgent plea to the Minister to do everything possible to ensure this extremely valuable facility is not lost to Donegal and to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank <Col N="1429" /> Deputy McDaid for raising the matter of the information technology centre in Letterkenny.  The concept of the Regional Telecommunications and Information Technology Centre, or the IT Centre as it is known, was developed within the Letterkenny regional technical college's department of science and technical services between 1986 and 1988.  In 1988 County Donegal Vocational Education Committee established the centre as a stand-alone self-funding project, directly reporting to the board of management of Letterkenny regional technical college.  The centre subsequently operated under the aegis of a steering committee comprised of representatives of County Donegal Vocational Education Committee, Telecom Éireann, Forbairt, Letterkenny governing body, IDA, Department of Education as well as the chief executive officer of County Donegal Vocational Education Committee and the director of Letterkenny regional technical college. The steering committee is a subcommittee of County Donegal Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>The function of the centre was to promote information technology and advanced telecommunications services within the private and public sectors of the region.  Its main sources of revenue are generated from public and private sector contracts, research and developments contracts and its catalytic role in the economic development of the area through research, development and consultancy.  Many of the projects have been EU aided.</P>
      <P>Staffing at the centre comprises the director, who is on secondment from his post as head of science and technical services in Letterkenny regional technical college and 14 staff members who are employed by County Donegal Vocational Education Committee on a contract basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a significant deficit projected in the accounts of the centre at the end of December 1995.  In this context County Donegal Vocational Education Committee convened a special meeting of the committee on 29 <Col N="1430" /> December 1995 at which all aspects of the centre's operations were reviewed, in particular the financial viability of the programmes proposed for the years 1996 to 1998.  It was the committee's view that the centre was not viable in the absence of counterpart funding, notwithstanding such EU approval as is currently available to it.  The Vocational Education Committee, therefore, decided to discontinue the operation of the centre.</P>
    <P>The employment contracts of the centre's staff expired on 31 December 1995.  The vocational education committee has notified the staff members that their contracts will not be renewed but they will be retained on continuing salary until 31 January 1996.</P>
    <P>On the basis of a submission from the vocational education committee and an analysis of their projections and, having regard to the potential financial penalties which might be incurred by the noncompletion of projects, my Department has approved the continuation and completion of two projects, LINGUA and SYNDAMMA, by March 1996 and mid-July 1996, respectively, and the continued secondment of the director from the regional technical college until 31 January 1996.  There is no commitment to funding from my Department for this center beyond the completion dates of these projects.  It is understood that County Donegal Vocational Education Committee is considering a number of options in relation to the future of the IT Centre.</P>

      <P>It gives me no pleasure to come this evening to raise this matter which was the basis of widespread coverage in a recent edition of the <i>Evening Herald</i> under the headline &ldquo;Thug gets four years &mdash; and walks free&rdquo;.  A large section of the community in Blanchardstown in my constituency is, to say the least, bewildered at what has happened.  An underage offender <Col N="1431" /> who was found guilty of in excess of 40 crimes was sentenced to four years by a judge who stated:</P>
      <P>...when I find somebody before me again purely because the executive failed in providing places for these people.</P>
      <P>I perform my function.  I sentence when guilty.  I'm afraid the executive has not performed its function by not providing places.</P>
      <P>The report stated: &ldquo;The Department also admitted that in a recent six-month period there had been `approximately 100 instances of juveniles being turned away.&rdquo;  It went on to state:</P>
      <P>An angry garda officer said today: &ldquo;The whole thing is pointless.  He [the person concerned] knows the system cannot cope.  Nowhere is safe from him &mdash; cars, houses, post offices... anywhere.  He is stealing to order and at this stage has a ready market.  But he could be dangerous.  He would do anything to get away if cornered.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>His freedom has outraged the Blanchardstown community who fear it could lead to a tragedy.  Local people have been his victims and furious residents say they are sick and tired of him terrorising them and destroying property.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He is making life sheer hell for families.  He is bringing undesirables into the estate and is basically doing everything and anything to cause trouble&rdquo; said one concerned resident.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take up with his colleague, the Minister for Education &mdash; who waxed eloquently here about half an hour ago &mdash; the question of education places and opportunities.  Does anybody expect the gardaí on the beat to risk life and limb to detain those who are guilty of these crimes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem has not arisen overnight. Consecutive Governments have failed to provide sufficient detention places &mdash; that is the basis of a wider <Col N="1432" /> debate on prison space.  The question of juvenile crime has been raised time and again.  Instead of engaging in selective constituency spending, the Minister for Education should meet her responsibilities and address this matter.  The greatest concern for the electorate at present is crime.</P>
    <P>The people of the greater Blanchardstown area experienced the tragedy of a recent horrific murder.  The administration of jail sentencing which allows offenders to walk free is nonsensical. That urban community is experiencing many growing pains with its large number of young people and it could do without the nonsense of the present jail sentencing system.</P>
    <P>The concluding paragraph of the article headed &ldquo;HERO WITH KIDS&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most worrying aspect of the whole affair is that he is becoming a hero for some of the children.  He is always encouraging them to do stuff like break windows and throw eggs at houses&rdquo;.  A local garda said: &ldquo;As soon as we catch him, we will bring him back before the courts.  And the same thing will probably happen all over again.</P>
    <P>The situation is deplorable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to score political points, but on the wider issue of justice my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, has been more than practical and constructive and has refrained from criticising the various Ministers concerned on a political level.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, have a real crisis on their hands.  They do not appear to be in control of their briefs or addressing the basic issues.  The position is deplorable.</P>
    <P>How can gardaí be expected to continue to perform their duties of giving evidence in court about offenders found guilty of wrongdoing, such as breaking into people's homes and stealing cars, when offenders are allowed back into the local community?</P>
    <P>In this case the Garda has highlighted <Col N="1433" /> that less than 24 hours later the offender was spotted in a stolen car in the Clonee area where he tried to ram a Garda car. Since then he was sighted in the Strawberry Beds area in a stolen car.  I sincerely hope something positive and pragmatic will be done to address this nonsensical position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I defend the actions and performance of my colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach.  I find it ironic that there is now a new found urgency among the ranks of Fianna Fáil to tackle the crime problem.  That party was in office for seven years and all the matters that need to be addressed now could have been addressed during that time.  The victims about whom they are crying could have been protected if adequate measures had been put in place during those seven years.  The pleadings of members of that party during the past few weeks on a very serious issue affecting victims were hypocritical.</P>
      <P>I understand that the youth in question was referred by the courts to Trinity House school in Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin.  Trinity House is a reformatory school which provides 28 long stay places and a further two short-term remand places for children in the 14 to 16 age group.  The boy in question is 15 years old.  He appeared in court on the 12 January 1996 charged with robbery and damage to property.  He was sentence to four years detention in Trinity House reformatory school.</P>
      <P>I understand that a member of the garda contacted Trinity House from the court on the day of the hearing to inquire whether a long stay place would be available for the boy in question.  The garda was informed that the school was full at the time and would not be in a position to accommodate the boy.  I understand that, nonetheless, later that day a garda arrived at Trinity House with the boy.  The garda was again informed that no bed was available and that the boy could not be admitted.</P>

    <P>My Department has confirmed that <Col N="1434" /> Trinity House school was indeed full for long stay and remand purposes on the day in question.  I understand that the possibility of accommodating the boy in the adjacent Oberstown boys reformatory school was not raised during the course of these inquiries.  Oberstown boys reformatory school provides a total of 20 long stay beds and a further ten short-term remand places.  I can confirm that Oberstown boys reformatory school, which is sited adjacent to Trinity House, had two remand places available on the day in question and could have accommodated the boy had it been so requested.</P>
    <P>The difficulty surrounding this case was only brought to my Department's attention on 22 January 1996.  Had my Department been alerted when the problem originally arose, arrangements could have been made to accommodate the boy in Oberstown boys reformatory school, pending the availability of a long stay place in Trinity House.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy and the House that I fully share the widespread and growing concern that the community be protected and that adequate accommodation be made available to meet the needs of the courts.  This is particularly so where serious or persistent breaches of the law are involved.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid a repetition of the particular circumstances surrounding the case raised by the Deputy, I can confirm that the directors of the reformatory schools have been instructed to check on accommodation availability in all relevant facilities before responding to requests for accommodation from the courts.  The directors in question are already in discussion with the Garda authorities on the most efficient means of ensuring maximum flexibility and usage of available facilities.</P>
    <P>On the general question of accommodation provision, I should point out that it is extremely difficult to forecast, with any degree of precision, the number of custodial places required to accommodate juvenile offenders.  Demand for such accommodation can vary from day to day, depending on decisions taken by <Col N="1435" /> the courts.  Experience with the operation of the present industrial school facilities would suggest that the 130 places currently available are adequate to meet present and likely demand for the under 14 population.  However, in the case of the reformatory schools, which deal with the 14 to 16 year olds, there is undoubtedly growing pressure for increased accommodation.  This is particularly pronounced in the case of young male offenders.  There is also occasional pressure for accommodation in the case of young female offenders.</P>
    <P>Measures to address these problems are already being pursued in line with the announcement made by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, last year.  The measures in question include the development of an additional 28-30 reformatory school places for young male offenders in the 14 to 16 year age group, and the development of an additional eight places for young female offenders.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the nature of these facilities is such that very detailed planning is required in <Col N="1436" /> order to ensure that they operate in an efficient and effective manner.  The process of planning these new facilities is currently under way in my Department and is being pursued as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that the Government recently approved the draft scheme of a new children Bill.  A key objective of this Bill is to update and streamline the dated legislation which currently governs the whole area of juvenile crime and the role of the courts and our young offender centres in dealing with this area.  The preparation of this legislation is being pursued as a matter of priority and it is hoped that the legislation will be published within the next few months.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have outlined will achieve a significant improvement on current arrangements for the accommodation of young offenders and ensure, as far as possible, that problems of the type raised by the Deputy can be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 January 1996.</P>

      <P>I am currently considering the report of the Department of Enterprise and Employment/ Irish Insurance Federation joint working group on the growth and development of the insurance industry.  The objective of the exercise was to undertake an appraisal of the insurance indus-try's strategic position, as a key sector of the economy, in the context of the challenges and opportunities created by the advent of the European Single Market and the general international movement towards greater liberalisation of trade in services.  A number of the working group's recommendations are directed at the industry itself.  Other recommendations replicate proposals made by the industry to Government in a budgetary context and the remaining recommendations deal with my Department's involvement with the industry in developing a more efficient and effective regulatory regime.  The implementation of the latter recommendations will make a constructive input to my Department's current review of the Insurance Acts and the preparation of new regulations on disclosure aimed at <Col N="1343" /> achieving greater transparency, from the customers' perspective, in the marketing of insurance products.</P>

      <P>At the time that the new agencies were brought into operation in January 1994, Forfás delegated specific functions to Forbairt and IDA Ireland under the 1993 Industrial Development Act, to enable them to undertake the responsibilities assigned to them in that Act.  It retained a number of operational/executive functions (including the property function) on a temporary holding basis to allow consideration of how best they could be allocated between the executive agencies (Forbairt and IDA Ireland).</P>
      <P>In 1995 Forfás completed a fundamental review of the operation and management of the property function and portfolio for industrial development purposes which was initiated in 1994 in consultation with Jones Lang Wootton and Indecon Economic Consultants. The review was undertaken as part of the responsibilities of Forfás for policy evaluation and advice and agency co-ordination.</P>
      <P>The report makes specific recommendations on:</P>
      <P>&mdash; The likely demand for industrial property for industrial promotion and development purposes.</P>
      <P>&mdash; The relative balance that should be sought between private and public sector (including the development agencies, local authorities and community groups) provision in meeting market demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; The means by which greater private sector provision of property for <Col N="1344" /> industrial promotion and development purposes can be encouraged.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The means by which the most effective management of the existing property portfolio held by Forfás (and other agencies) can be achieved in terms of financial, personnel and organisations resources.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The evaluation of the financial and economic returns of the resources allocated to the property development and management functions.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The appropriate accounting approach and methodologies in respect of the property function within the industrial development agencies.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The approach that should be adopted with respect to sales, retention, refurbishment, rents and leasing of the existing property portfolio including the scope for securitisation.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The most appropriate organisational location for the management and development of the State's property portfolio for industiral promotion purposes.</P>
    <P>While it is not my intention to publish the entire report because of the commercially confidential nature of some of the contents, I have asked Forfás to publish its main conclusions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of low cost funds to business generally and to small business in particular.  This Government has pursued a range of broad economic policies which permit a regime of low interest rates from which all businesses benefit considerably.  Sound financial <Col N="1345" /> management of the economy will continue to be an important element in securing low interest rates and continued access to low cost funds to all businesses.</P>
      <P>In addition to gains from generally low interest rates, small businesses have benefited greatly from the small business expansion loan scheme introduced in 1994 and which made £100 million available at a subsidised interest rate of 6.75 per cent over 10 years.  I followed this initiative with the access to finance scheme which I launched at the end of August last year as part of the Operational Programme for Small Business. Under this scheme, the minimum loan size available was reduced from £40,000 to £20,000 in response to requests by the small business sector for greater flexibility and certain types of small business that were ineligible under the small business expansion loan scheme have been included.  The maximum loan available is £500,000.</P>
      <P>The access to finance scheme is a novel partnership between the banking sector, the Government and the European Union whereby each partner contributes to the cost of providing low-cost funds to small business.  Low-cost funds are available to the manufacturing, food, services and tourism sectors and the scheme is administered through almost 1,000 branches of participating banks throughout the country.  In recognition of the importance of the tourism industry to small business, at least 25 per cent of funds must be made available to this sector.</P>
      <P>The access to finance scheme provides £208 million in long-term loan finance at a subsidised rate of 6.5 per cent over seven years to firms with less than 50 employees or with an annual turnover of less than £3 million.  The scheme has proved extremely popular with small businesses and I am confident the scheme will make a significant contribution to employment growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked officials of my Department to keep the existing measures under review and to assess future options, having regard to the needs of <Col N="1346" /> small business and the need to ensure that any measures undertaken have a successful outcome in terms of maintenance and creation of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on information supplied by the 35 county enterprise boards for 1994 and 1995 (the latter remains provisional at this stage), some 4,478 full-time and 945 part-time jobs have been created by CEB-grant assisted projects at a cost of £18,476,716 (includes the cost of feasibility studies), of which 2,702 full-time and 682 part-time jobs were created in 1995.  Taking <Col N="1347" /> two part-time jobs as the equivalent of one full-time job, this gives an average grant cost per job of £3,732.  I should emphasise, however, that these provisional figures are in no way comparable with the cost per job sustained ratios which are based on jobs created by national agencies such as Forbairt and IDA Ireland and subsequently tracked over a seven year cycle.</P>
      <P>Details of the jobs created in CEB-assisted enterprises from the commencement of the County Enterprise initiative to 31 December 1995 are set out in the following table which I intend to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County enterprise boards have been operating since the end of 1993 through the provision of financial support and advice to small businesses, including assistance to the self-employed in setting up their own businesses.  While the main benefits of the programme so far have been the volume and the diverse sectoral spread of financial incentives in the form of employment, capital and feasibility grant support, the range of activities undertaken by county <Col N="1348" /> enterprise boards was significantly extended beyond direct grant-giving last year to include the provision of advice, information and counselling and management development training.</P>
    <P>My Department will carry out a review of the implementation of county enterprise plans in the course of 1996. The review will be undertaken at two levels: assessing the progress achieved at the overall level of the local enterprise programme; and at that of each particular county enterprise board. The review will examine the success of the boards in achieving the aggregate quantitative and qualitative targets set out in the programme, and in the enterprise plans prepared for each area.</P>
    <P>This review will also contribute to the mid-term review to be carried out under the Community Support Framework.  I believe that the current OECD Country Review of Local Development in Ireland should also serve as a valuable guide to possible improvements to facilitate greater effectiveness, accountability and subsidiarity in the operation of the various local development strategies.</P>

      <Quest>the Government Departments and State agencies who met in the follow-up to the Washington Conference.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18300/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 22 together.  I presume that Deputy Leonard is referring to the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland which was held in Washington DC in May 1995, and that Deputy O'Keeffe is referring to United States-Ireland Business Partnership Initiative which was announced at the conference.</P>
      <P>The new initiative is designed to utilise the resources and networks of both Forbairt and the American Small Business Administration (SBA) in order to arrange face to face meetings between Irish manufacturing and internationally traded services companies and potential US business partners, with the objective of promoting and facilitating strategic alliances and business partnerships leading to growth and increased employment.  These may be in the form of technology transfer, licensing agreements, sub-contract manufacturing, distribution agreements, joint marketing arrangements or some other form of mutually beneficial business partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details on the operation of the initiative were finalised directly between the two agencies in June 1995.  I subsequently led a mission of 26 Irish companies to Boston in November 1995. The Irish companies were introduced to pre-selected American companies, and there has since been an ongoing follow-up programme to develop and progress the contacts made.  Second phase discussions are expected to take place in a very substantial number of cases, and Forbairt is proactively working with the Irish companies to develop their contacts, formulate partnership proposals and conduct negotiations as appropriate. Such negotiations often take a significant amount of time from initial contact to implementation of business agreements, and it is too early yet to forecast what level of success will be achieved.  However, the new initiative has the full support of both the Irish and American Governments, and I am confident that the initiative will result in successful partnership arrangements for <Col N="1351" /> both Irish and American companies who participate in it.</P>
    <P>The Forbairt/International Fund for Ireland North American Partnership Programme is specifically designed to promote strategic business partnerships between American companies and high technology companies in the Border counties.  As a result of progress made following the Washington Conference, I was able to announce the first three successes under this Programme at the Boston Trade Mission in November 1995, and a number of other negotiations are taking place between potential partners.</P>
    <P>Also after the Washington Conference, Forbairt was involved with my Department, the Department of Tourism and Trade, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, An Bord Tráchtála, Bord Bia and Bord Fáilte, in assisting the US Embassy to arrange a programme for the Business Match-maker Mission of 16 US companies which visited Northern Ireland and the Border region in October 1995.  This mission was led by Assistant Secretary at the US Department of Commerce, Mr. Chuck Meissner, and a number of negotiations on new business partnership agreements are now taking place as a result.  A further trade and investment conference in the US is planned for later this year.</P>
    <P>Another new initiative to emerge from the Washington Conference is the American Management and Business Internship Training Programme (AMBIT).  This programme, which is sponsored by the US Department of Commerce in collaboration with the International Fund for Ireland, and is administered by Forbairt in the Border counties, and by the Training and Development Agency in Northern Ireland, is designed to offer hands-on training in US host firms for managers and technical experts with the objective of providing such key personnel access to new technology, product development opportunities and best management practices, as well as encouraging <Col N="1352" /> the formation of inter-company strategic alliances.</P>
    <P>By way of further follow-up to the Washington Conference, my Department's office of science and technology and the Industrial Research and Technology Unit in Northern Ireland have obtained the support of the International Fund for Ireland for a new Research and Development Programme to be known as &ldquo;Radius&rdquo;.  This programme will specifically support joint product development projects between companies from either side of the Border and companies in the United States. My Department is also working with the US Department of Commerce to develop greater co-operation in science and technology activities of potential economic benefit on both sides of the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>All of these new initiatives are of course additional to the sophisticated and comprehensive range of industrial supports available from Forbairt to industry throughout the country on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>While the major potential for new industrial development to emerge from the Washington Conference is in the area of linkage, partnership and joint venture type agreements, IDA Ireland has been following up on all potential leads and opportunities for new inward US investment projects.  Details of new inward investment projects to the border region were given in my reply in the House on 21 November 1995.</P>

      <P>I would like to <Col N="1353" /> inform the Deputy that the International Fund for Ireland recently established a programme, known as &ldquo;Research and Development between Ireland and the US&rdquo; or &ldquo;RADIUS&rdquo;.  I wish to express my support and to commend the International Fund for Ireland for this initiative.</P>
      <P>RADIUS is a technology-based market driven programme which will support product and process development joint ventures between companies in the Border counties and the USA and between companies in Northern Ireland and the USA.  The programme will be administered here by Forbairt and I understand that full guidelines for the scheme will be available in Forbairt's regional offices this week.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's reference to the international technology transfer fund refers to a proposed private venture capital fund mooted by Mr. John Cullinane, president of the Cullinane Group of Boston, during a visit by a number of American business people and venture capital promoters to Ireland late last year.  Mr. Cullinane proposed raising some 30 million US dollars from private investors which would be targeted at high growth, technology based companies in Ireland, North and South.</P>
      <P>I understand that a fund raising operation has begun.  This is, as I stated, a private fund and it is, therefore, not one in which I have a direct function.</P>

      <P>Forbairt already operates an enterprise development programme to assist experienced business managers, professionals and academics to develop high potential <Col N="1354" /> start up business projects.  A target market for identifying potential enterprise development clients is the Irish emigrant communities abroad.  Forbairt is currently putting a programme together for 1996 to contact potential entrepreneurs who are currently working abroad with a view to attracting them back to Ireland to establish businesses. A generous support package is available under the enterprise development programme. This is supplemented with access to Forbairt's &ldquo;Business Angels Database&rdquo; with a view to facilitating potential entrepreneurs find experienced business partners willing to invest equity in their proposed business.</P>
      <P>The International Network for Ireland (INI) was set up by the Bolton Trust in 1989 to channel information on industry and business opportunities in Ireland to graduates overseas.  It is funded mainly by FÁS and sponsored by IDA Ireland, Forbairt and Aer Rianta.  The INI uses a higher skills pool (HSP) database and publishes a quarterly magazine, &ldquo;Inform&rdquo;, which aims to link up graduates with job and business opportunities in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Small Business Task Force made 121 recommendations in its report which was published in March 1994.  To date, 19 of these recommendations have been fully implemented and a further 19 have been partially implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the remaining 83 recommendations is being pursued <Col N="1355" /> by the small business and services division of my Department which has systematically assessed all the recommendations. While it is not possible, at this stage, to forecast the number of recommendations likely to be implemented in 1996, I should mention that changes announced in the budget this week, particularly the reduction in the rate of corporation tax, represent further progress in implementing the recommendations of the task force.  In addition, in 1996 my Department will be developing a programme on administrative simplification which will be of particular relevance to a large number of the recommendations. My Department will also be giving special attention to proposals for legislation to resolve the problem of late payment of business debts, which is an area highlighted by the task force as being of significant importance.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Government's document, A Government of Renewal, that this Government is committed to the development of small business.  In general terms, I am pleased with the progress that has been made towards creating a better business environment in Ireland for small business to grow and flourish.  Much more needs to be done and I will be pressing ahead with a view to substantial further progress in 1996.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to my reply to Deputy O'Rourke on this subject on the 29 November 1995, as reported in the Dáil and Seanad Debates, volume 459 No. 1, columns 178-180.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in that reply the intellectual <Col N="1356" /> property unit of my Department is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of Irish copyright law.  The review is taking account of:</P>
    <P>I.  Our international obligations under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, producers and Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations;</P>
    <P>II.  EU legislation on, <i>inter alia</i>, rental and lending, cable and satellite broadcasting and duration of copyright together with proposals for EU legislation on resale rights and private tape levies;</P>
    <P>III.  Technological developments;</P>
    <P>IV.  The legitimate interests of both suppliers and users of copyright materials and;</P>
    <P>V.  The need to ensure that copyright law does not impede legitimate creative activity.</P>
    <P>The Department has received a substantial number of comprehensive written submissions from interested parties on many of these subjects and has afforded each party the opportunity to make an oral submission in support of that material.  The IPU has recently completed this phase of the review process and has commenced drafting heads of a consolidating piece of legislation in this extremely difficult and technical area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that copyright involves private property rights and that any piece of legislation that expands the rights of one group will lead to additional demands from and on others.  Accordingly, there is a need to ensure that the Bill, when complete, strikes a balance between the interests of rights of owners on the one hand and users on the other, whilst ensuring continued creativity in all spheres of economical life.</P>
    <P>I do intend to bring forward this piece of legislation as soon as possible but the <Col N="1357" /> Deputy will appreciate that given the difficulties and technical issues involved, the importance of the legal rights provided for and the nature of our international obligations, we must proceed cautiously.  The Deputy can be assured that there will be no delay in processing the legislation and that I will make every effort to expedite it.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>the five main sources of venture capital available in this country; if he will give an estimate of the total amount of venture capital moneys provided each year by our ten leading financial institutions.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1587/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two main channels of venture capital investment in Ireland, private sector investment and public sector investment. Within the private sector, investment can be broken down into two main sources:</P>
      <P>(i)  Direct investment by venture capital companies themselves. The main venture capital providers in this respect would include Allied Combined Trust (ACT), the Smurfit Job Creation Enterprise Fund, Development Capital Corporation (DCC) and Delta Partners.  Additionally, there is increasing evidence that UK venture capital companies are becoming interested as prospective investors in the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Beside these main providers there are a number of smaller organisations providing equity and quasi equity funding to the higher risk seed capital segment of the venture capital market. Typical of these organisations would be First Step, the Bolton Trust and the Business Innovation Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> (ii)  Venture capital investment by the pension fund industry.  A report on pension fund investment in venture capital was commissioned in 1993 and recommended that some pension fund moneys should be made available for investment in venture type businesses.  The report found that it would not be unreasonable for pension funds to invest £10 million per annum in the venture capital sector.  This recommendation has been implemented and the bulk of this pension fund investment in venture capital has been channelled through intermediary companies specialising in venture capital investment.</P>
    <P>Within the public sector, venture capital investment, and similar types of financial assistance to early stage companies, take a number of forms of which two of the most prominent are: (i)  Investment by the State-owned Industrial Credit Corporation-ICC is a long established and significant member of the Irish venture capital market; (ii)  The Business Expansion Scheme &mdash; although not classified as venture capital the Business Expansion Scheme has, since its inception in 1984 and to the end of the 1994/1995 tax year, resulted in £348 million in risk capital being invested in unquoted Irish businesses.</P>
    <P>Although also not classified as venture capital, Forbairt, as part of its indigenous industry development mandate, makes equity investments in Irish businesses, usually through preference shareholdings.  In 1994 this amounted to £11.8 million invested in 84 businesses. In effect this Forbairt investment has a similar impact to venture capital.  That is, providing development funds of growth oriented SME's.</P>
    <P>In addition, the nation-wide network of county enterprise boards are effectively providing seed capital to small start ups and early stage companies. Since their inception in 1993 and to the end of 1995 county enterprise boards have approved grants totalling £36.8 <Col N="1359" /> million to 4,339 approved business projects.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention two other measures that should become major sources of venture capital in the future. In 1995 Forbairt established a data base of individuals with capital resources who wish to invest equity capital in small private companies.  Known inter-nationally as &ldquo;Business Angels&rdquo;, the individuals on the Forbairt database have indicated the availability of approximately £10 million for investment in early stage businesses.  Secondly, I announced the establishment of an early stage equity investment fund of £60 million over the period of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development for investment in growth orientated firms which will be made available through approved seed/ venture funds with 50 per cent of the funding being provided from the European Regional Development Fund and the balance coming from private sector participants.  It is anticipated that this measure will become operational during 1996.</P>
    <P>Regarding an estimate of the total amount of venture capital moneys provided each year by Ireland's ten leading financial institutions, I do not think it appropriate or feasible to make such an estimate for a number of reasons.  Some of Ireland's leading financial institutions, for instance building societies, are not involved in venture capital. Other leading financial institutions, such as the pension funds, make venture capital investments indirectly through intermediary companies in recognition of the specialised nature of and risks associated with venture capital investment. Furthermore the main banking institutions in Ireland also tend not to become directly involved in venture capital investment as they do not regard venture capital investment, which is a specialist, high risk function, as part of their core business.  Accordingly, as outlined above it is not possible to provide the estimate sought by the Deputy.  I would assure the Deputy however, and <Col N="1360" /> I and my Department take every opportunity to impress on the financial community the need for, and the desirability of, increasing the level of venture captial available to our developing businesses.</P>
    <P>An estimate of the total amount of venture capital invested each year in Ireland is available through the yearly handbooks of the European Venture Capital Association to which the Irish Venture Capital Association is affiliated. This publication indicates the following level of venture capital investment in Ireland for 1992, 1993 and 1994; 1992, £16.6 million; 1993, £17.6 million; 1994, £19.7 million.</P>

      <P>The Government has not abandoned the implementation of the decisions taken in May 1993 by the previous Government on the Culliton and Moriarty reports.  On the contrary, there have been significant advances in the implementation process during the past year, under the present Government, particularly in relation to taxation, energy, telecommunications, finance for industry and the promotion of indigenous enterprise.  It is my intention, in line with the commitment given in &ldquo;Employment through Enterprise&rdquo;, to publish as soon as possible this year a full review of what has been achieved in the period since May 1993.

    <P>I share the generally held view that <Col N="1361" /> the Culliton report was an outstanding contribution to public policy on enterprise in Ireland.  It was a catalyst for change across a wide range of policy areas, as well as institutional arrangements, affecting enterprise.  These changes are, I believe, beginning to work through to enterprise performance and to employment.  At the same time, the Culliton report was not, of course, the last word on enterprise policy; there can be no last word in such a dynamic area.  The new work on enterprise strategy, to which I have referred, will be seeking to build on the insights of the Culliton report and on the achievements and experience of its implementation to date.</P>

It is held in the RDS over a number of days, and I understand that it has been very successful in that venue.

      <P>Over 100 IDA-assisted overseas companies, representing a wide variety of business sectors, already have bases in the Border counties.  These companies, between them, employ approximately 12,100 people directly servicing European and other markets.  Many of these companies have substantially expanded on their original investments over the years.</P>
      <P>It is however, fair to say that Donegal, Sligo and Louth have benefited significantly from overseas investment while Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim have not been as successful.</P>
      <P>Overseas investors predominantly want to locate in areas with good infrastructure and support services, which enables them to compete successfully in international markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must inform the Deputy that there is no common European basis of assessment of under 25 age drivers for insurance purposes and there are no EU proposals pending in this regard.  While the underwriting criteria used by insurers throughout Europe such as type and make of motor vehicle, driver's age, experience, use of motor vehicle, geographical area and driving record are similar, other relevant factors, such as demographic profile, accident and claims frequency and cost of claims under different compensation regimes are not common throughout Europe but differ between member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently there are 27 insurers, excluding Lloyds, established in Ireland providing motor vehicle insurance cover and with the emergence of direct line <Col N="1365" /> insurers, I am satisfied that there is a healthy and growing level of competition in this market.</P>
    <P>Motor insurers' assessment of risk is based on claims frequency experience. The degree of risk tends to decrease with age and maturity and the level of premiums charged to young drivers reflect the insurers' claims experience of such drivers as a higher risk category. Moreover, the number of companies offering this type of insurance will reflect the high risk nature of this class of business.</P>
    <P>The House will already be aware that I have commissioned an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland and of the key factors contributing to the cost of insurance in Ireland.  The consultants have been asked to evaluate the impact of liability insurance premiums on the cost competitiveness of the trade business sector in Ireland.  In addition, the evaluation of the economic impact of private motor insurance costs with particular regard to the cost of motor insurance for young drivers is being examined as a separate aspect of the consultancy study.  Preliminary indications suggest that the under 25 age group, as a category of driver, are not significantly disadvantaged in terms of opportunities for employment under the current motor insurance regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome prohibits the abuse of a dominant position within the EU common market or a substantial part of it. By analogy, section 5 the Competition Act, 1991 prohibits the abuse of a dominant position in trade in any goods or <Col N="1366" /> services in the State or in a substantial part of the State.</P>
      <P>Any firm which has a dominant position in a particular market does not of itself constitute anti-competitive activity.  However, bearing in mind rulings by the European Court of Justice, in general, a firm in a dominant position is required and has &ldquo;a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair undistorted competition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have no evidence at present to suggest that an abuse has taken place in this area in the State.  However, the matter will be kept under review in the context of the new powers of investigation and enforcement being given to the Competition Authority under the terms of the Competition (Amendment) Bill which concluded its Committee Stage last week.  I expect the Bill to be enacted at an early date.</P>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy appears to be primarily an EU transfrontier issue which would be for the European Commission to deal with under EU competition rules.  I understand that the Commission have received informal complaints from certain UK based cable operators concerning the manner in which BSkyB supply programming and related services at wholesale level.  I understand further that the UK Office of Fair Trading is conducting a review of BSkyB's position in the pay TV market and that the office is separately examining the terms of various agreements to televise sports.</P>
      <P>The European Commission are currently monitoring such developments in the matter and have not, at this stage, opened a formal investigation. However, if the Deputy has information that may be of interest to the Commission my Department would be glad to assist him in this respect.</P>

      <P>According to the 1991 Census of Population, which is the source of the most recent official information available at national level, the ten DED/Wards with the highest rates of unemployment were as follows: Arigna, Inishbofin, Mountjoy A, Aran, Priorswood C, North Dock C, John's A, Blanchardstown-Mulhuddart, Caher-murphy, Priorswood B.  The actual numbers of people in the labour force in the <Col N="1368" /> above wards vary from 11 in Arigna to 1,243 in Priorswood C.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office also publishes a monthly area analysis of the number of persons on the live register classified by sex, age group (Under 25 and over 25) and local office of registration. The areas served by such local offices do not correspond to specific geographic boundaries and registrants at a given local office do not necessarily come from a particular region or area which can be precisely delineated.  Furthermore, this data only gives numbers of claimants and cannot be used to obtain an unemployment rate for a particular area as there is no available upto-date information on the number of persons in the labour force in equivalent individual areas.</P>
      <P>My Department monitors closely both the census information and the numbers of registrants signing at local offices.</P>
      <P>FÁS, as part of its planning process for the provision of training for the unemployed and the establishment of targets for the numbers of community employment places in individual regions, pays close attention to local levels of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The new local employment service, in the areas where it is operating, is developing mechanisms for feedback on changes in the position of unemployed people who are placed through the LES system.</P>

      <P>It has not proved possible to design a tool which is capable of computing irregular economic activity with any level of certainty as all available techniques for estimating the magnitude of the irregular economy suffer from significant limitations. I have no figure, therefore, for the estimated loss as requested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Countering tax evasion in the irregular economy is a major focus of every tax administration in the developed world including Ireland.  While, as in all other countries, there is a recognition that unrecorded activity is unlikely to be eradicated, the Revenue Commissioners advise me that the general rate of tax <Col N="1370" /> compliance is responding positively to counter-evasion programmes.</P>
    <P>Since it is difficult to measure the size of the irregular economy it is equally difficult to measure the impact of programmes aimed at curbing it.  The growth in the numbers engaged on audit work in Revenue, the increase in audits conducted and the additional yield from these audits indicates the growing ability of the programme to penetrate the irregular economy.  Revenue have also targeted particular sectors for detailed examination.  The Special Enquiry Branch of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin and similar units in provincial districts continue to identify cases who fail voluntarily to register for tax.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners assure me that their programmes to counter the irregular economy are yielding progressively more satisfactory results. Measures taken in the Finance Act, 1995, in relation to supply of information by landlords and others and the wider use of RSI numbers will assist in this task.</P>

      <P>As I outlined in my reply of 23 November 1996 proposals for the provision of a 50 metre swimming pool are under consideration in my Department. A project of this scale requires very careful and detailed consideration before any decision can be made in the matter in view of the overall capital and operating costs involved.  Because of its implications for Exchequer funding, I am not in a position to say at this stage when a decision about the project can be made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The matter to which the Deputy refers is not solely for consideration by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A request was received from the Pilgrim House Community in June 1993 outlining a project about which they were in discussion with the United <Col N="1384" /> Nations High Commission for Refugees, and seeking our Department's approval in principle to provide care in Ireland for a small group of Somali orphans and in the event of a parent subsequently presenting themselves that contact with the children would be facilitated.</P>
    <P>The community were informed that their proposal had implications for a number of Government Departments, in particular the Departments of Health and Foreign Affairs.  Although my Department has responsibility for immigration controls generally, any proposal regarding the admission of a group of people in to the State in these circumstances &mdash; and especially a group of persons in need of constant medical attention &mdash; would need consideration by these other Departments.</P>
    <P>The Pilgrim House Community was informed by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in January 1994 that the proposal was outside the scope of the Department's responsibilities for refugees as determined by Government decisions.  My predecessor informed the community in February 1994 of her consequent inability to accede to their request.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any new information in the hands of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Health or my own Department which would warrant a reversal of that decision.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may already be aware that a closed circuit television (CCTV) monitoring system was launched in the Temple Bar area of Dublin City on 26 October 1995.  This pilot scheme is the first of its kind in this country and was introduced in the Temple Bar area with the co-operation of local interests.  It is intended that a full review of all aspects <Col N="1391" /> of the system including technical aspects will be carried out shortly to evaluate its effectiveness during its initial period of operation.  This review will determine future policy in relation to the use of CCTV by the Garda Síochána and proposals for further systems in other areas will be examined in detail in the light of the overall policy established following the review.</P>
      <P>While I am committed to the introduction of CCTV as an aid to policing I am anxious to ensure that the experience gained from the installation and operation of the Temple Bar scheme is used to maximum advantage when extended to other areas.  As the review of this pilot scheme has not yet taken place I am not in a position at present to comment conclusively on its likely value in reducing crime in this jurisdiction. However, early indications from the Garda authorities are that the use of CCTV has had a beneficial effect on crime prevention and detection in the area in which it has been located and that there have been a number of arrests to date following incidents recorded by the cameras in the Temple Bar area.</P>

      <P>Use of private sector funding and `build and lease-back' arrangements for the provision of prison accommodation are options which have been suggested to my Department, but no specific proposals have been fully investigated.  This system of `build and lease-back' has been used mostly for decentralisation projects of Government Departments. There would be implications for prison buildings (security etc.) which would have to be taken into account if such a system was being actively considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately it is a matter of assessing which option represents best value for the State in the longer term.  In this regard, I propose to consult my colleague the Minister for Finance with a view to ensuring that the financing method chosen in any particular case <Col N="1393" /> would be that which produced optimum benefit to the State.</P>

      <P>Following intensive negotiations I had with the UK Minister for Industry and Energy, Mr. Timothy Eggar and with the President of the UK Board of Trade, Mr. Ian Lang, during the months of November and December 1995, following representations by the Taoiseach to the British Prime Minister on a number of occasions over recent months both directly and over the telephone and following representations by other members of the Government to their UK counterparts, the UK Government withdrew its reservations to the State aid involved in the Irish Steel Restructuring Plan thus enabling the EU Council of Industry Ministers to unanimously approve the State aid package on 20 December 1995 under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty.  To overcome the UK objections, production caps on finished steel and billets together with limits on the sale of finished steel products in the EU market (including Norway and Switzerland) had to be agreed by me in consultation with Irish Steel/ISPAT in order to secure the unanimous approval of all EU member states which was required under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>A report on Sunday trading was commissioned by the Department from the Irish Productivity Centre (IPC) and was published in June 1995.  The report concluded that the extension of Sunday trading throughout the retail trades would be accompanied by an increase in part-time staff employment and that in the opinion of the IPC, the number of new jobs so created would be small.  It would not appear, therefore, that Sunday opening would have a damaging effect on employment.</P>
      <P>The issue of Sunday working will be addressed in the context of the Working Time Bill which is at present in preparation by the Minister for Labour Affairs.  The proposed Bill will implement the provisions of Council Directive 93/104/EC covering certain aspects of the Organisation of Working Time.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to introduce legislation to limit Sunday trading.</P>

      <P>Recent years have seen the development of a range of locally-based bodies and initiatives concerned with economic and community development, and with the promotion of community and enterprise-based employment.  These include, within the aegis of my Department, the county enterprise boards, and the new Local Employment Service which is currently being phased in, beginning with the 12 established partnership areas and two other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of locally-based <Col N="1395" /> groups reflects the determination of communities to address the problems of achieving economic and community development and the growth of employment at local level, and the commitment of successive Governments to support their endeavours.  The Government sees a major role for such local effort in achieving economic and community regeneration, and will make every effort to ensure that the contribution of bodies active at local level, along with the State development agencies, constitutes a powerful integrated response to the problems besetting our economy and society at the present time.</P>
    <P>The evaluation of the role of local development initiatives must be directed, in my view, to the effectiveness of the use made of public funds in support of employment creation.  The performance of these bodies in terms of their outcome and effects will be closely monitored to ensure that they realise the objectives set for them.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 164 on 5 December 1995 as reported in Volume 459, No. 3, columns 449-450).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's legislation programme, published regularly, includes a Credit Union Bill among those being actively worked on and to be published as soon as the necessary consultative, drafting and other procedures allow. <Col N="1396" /> Proposals for the updating and consolidation of the body of legislation (1893 to 1978) dealing with credit unions are still with the Parliamentary Draftsman. In the course of the development of these proposals by my Department and the Registrar of Friendly Societies, there has been extensive consultation with interested parties, including the Irish credit union movement itself. Unfortunately, these various processes took much longer than originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>As indicated in reply to previous questions, it would not be in order to formally anticipate the content of the proposals that might eventually emanate from the drafting process.  Apropos the Deputy's reference to the financial environment for credit unions and other institutions, I take it that he is aware of the particular ethos of the credit union movement which differentiates it from banks and building societies. It was never proposed to breach that ethos.</P>
    <P>I wish to again confirm my intention to introduce the Bill as soon as possible after the drafting processes are complete and I have had an opportunity to put the Draft Bill before my Cabinet colleagues.  I have previously signified that interested parties will then have another opportunity to review my proposals before they are considered by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The whole purpose of the Government's employment policy is to promote enterprise, reward those in work and encourage those seeking work.  This week's budget contained a considerable number of new measures to advance these objectives. These measures include reductions in <Col N="1397" /> corporation tax and PRSI on businesses, reductions in the burden of income tax and PRSI particularly for those on low incomes and new employment measures for the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>These measures are additional to the ongoing work of the industrial development agencies, county enterprise boards and the small business and services division of my Department.  I am satisfied with the progress being made in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Small Business particularly in relation to access to low cost funds.</P>
      <P>The increase of some 45,000 in employment last year is a clear indication that the Government's employment policy is working.  The new measures announced this week in the budget will contribute to maintaining that favourable employment trend.</P>

      <P>The position is that under EU Regulations herdowners have only up to 15 May of the relevant year to amend or correct errors on their area aid application forms.</P>
      <P>If, however, the Deputy is referring to the recent acceptance by the EU of a proposal submitted by me to overcome the problem of herdowners failing to submit their 1995 area aid applications or submitting them late, I have to say that applying such a concession is not possible for 1994 and in any event a problem on a similar scale did not apply in 1994.  The basis of the recent concession was that when my Department issued pre-printed area aid application forms in 1995, containing details submitted on the 1994 area aid application, a number of herdowners with forage area misunderstood that they had to sign the form and return it to my Department when their forage area was not going to change for 1995.  The European Commission accepted that the Department's efforts to streamline procedures for the farmers may have contributed to this confusion and therefore agreed to our proposal that forage applicants who did not submit an area aid application in 1995 or submitted it late could have their 1994 area aid application accepted as their 1995 application provided the forage area declared in 1995 is exactly the same as 1994.</P>
      <P>My Department did not issue pre-printed area aids forms to farmers in 1994 and consequently no grounds exist for a similar concession in 1995.</P>
