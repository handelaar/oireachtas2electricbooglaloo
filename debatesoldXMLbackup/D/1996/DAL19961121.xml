      <P>It is proposed to take No. 12, statements on the report of the independent inquiry in the Department of Justice (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil on its rising on Wednesday, 27 November 1996, shall adjourn until Tuesday, 3 December 1996.</P>

      <P>There is but one matter to put before the House, that is in respect of the proposal for next week's sitting of the Dáil.  Is it satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the publication of the report of the commission on people with disabilities will the Minister state what legislative measures the Government has to deal with this report?  The other day the Minister spoke at length about the plight of people with disabilities and the need to do something.  That would be fine if he had been in the job for only two weeks but he has been in that position for practically four years.  It is hollow to talk about the need to do something.  Perhaps the Minister will say exactly what he is doing and what he might do in the short-term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition who, at one stage, was party to the negotiations would have placed on record in the House the achievement by the same Minister for the implementation and completion of the divorce legislation which has taken this society such a long time to come to terms with.  That has been one of his responsibilities which he has successfully carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That was yesterday's business.  It is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>During the time in which he so successfully conducted that major task, this commission was sitting.  It has now completed its report which has over 400 recommendations.  It is <Col N="1562" /> proper and right that everybody has a chance to look at those recommendations and the Government, in due course, will consider what priorities it wished to advance in terms of legislation if that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister committing the Government to bringing forward legislation for people with disabilities arising out of the report? The fact that the report was being prepared did not mean nothing could have been done on this matter for practically four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the commitment of the Minister for Finance on Thursday last that all questions in relation to the inquiry in the Department of Justice would be answered fully in this House, will he say how I can get the Taoiseach to answer questions in relation to the two officeholders, for whom he is responsible and accountable in the Dáil, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions?  As the Minister will be aware, the questions have been ruled out of order not because of the debate but because, as I have been told, the Taoiseach has no responsibility in these matters to the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply inquiring how I can get the Taoiseach, who is not here, to answer questions in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General.  This is a very reasonable request.  We have been seeking answers to questions for two weeks, that is all we ask.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, on the basis that the Taoiseach said last week, and again this week, that he would answer any of these questions comprehensively, will there be a Taoiseach's Question Time next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am in your hands as is the whole House because the rules we have drawn up have to be administered fairly by you.  However, within that constraint, I will repeat what I said last week, that we have made extensive time for a period of questions to follow <Col N="1563" /> the debate later today.  Any question that is in order &mdash; the ruling of questions in order is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle's office not, as both the Deputies opposite know, a matter for the Deputies in question -will be answered by the Taoiseach in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be a Taoiseach's Question Time next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy possibly knows the Taoiseach will not be here next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, I read it in the newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that a Deputy who has extensive ministerial experience, including that of a presidency &mdash; with the forthcoming European Summit a matter of three weeks away &mdash; is not aware that the Taoiseach will not be here next week.  However, on the realisation that he is not aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  The Taoiseach did not do me the courtesy of saying whether he would be here.  I am not making an issue of this.  I asked the question because the morning newspapers tell me the Taoiseach will not be here next week. There is no point in tabling questions, which I did, if he will not be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Question Time will be normal next week but the Taoiseach will not be here next Tuesday or Wednesday and the House should be so advised.  If Deputies want to have questions specifically answered by the Taoiseach, as distinct from a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, they should be aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister gave an assurance last week that all questions would be fully answered.  The Minister may not be aware that the Taoiseach transferred all the questions I tabled to him and other questions have been ruled out of order.  Since the Taoiseach will not be here next week, will the Minister for Finance confirm that I am correct in assuming the Minister for Justice will answer questions this evening in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how often I have to say this and in what way because I have great admiration for Deputy Harney's parliamentary skills.  She is well able to pose questions and ensure she gets answers.  I said in the House this time last week that the Minister for Justice, at the end of the series of statements, would have time to answer any questions posed by any Member ruled to be in order by the Ceann Comhairle.  As both Deputies opposite know, it is the function of the Ceann Comhairle's office to decide what <Col N="1564" /> questions are in order and we have no control over that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Finance, but a short while ago we handed a letter to the Minister for Justice containing seven questions. The reason we handed it to her was to ensure that she received it.  It contains important questions to which we have been seeking answers for two weeks.  We have also endeavoured to ask questions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications now for two weeks.  Martyn Turner portrayed it correctly this morning.  The Minister should look at that cartoon because it says it all &mdash; we have here Minister &ldquo;L&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I assume the legitimate questions we have put to the Minister for Justice will be responded to this evening when she answers questions.  If we are not to get such responses then the Government is making a complete joke of this whole issue in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell suggested, or perhaps attempted to infer, that the absence of either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs could be construed by some commentators and others as an unwillingness on the part of either of them to answer such questions.</P>

I quite understand the Taoiseach commuting between capitals but can he afford me the courtesy of informing me, that is the point I am making.  If there are to be other days between now and 15 December on which he will be absent, perhaps he would inform us; that is all we are asking.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister for Finance has indicated to the House that questions will not be evaded, can he assure us that, following the debate this afternoon, this entire affair in respect of the improper composition of the Special Criminal Court will be referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to allow it investigate the matter thus enabling all questions and documentation to be examined?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important point was made in relation to another systems failure at the time the Taoiseach was responsible for the Attorney General's office.  The Labour Party, in particular, <Col N="1566" /> were very anxious to ensure that was seen to be the case in the House at the time.  Will the Minister for Finance say why the Government as a whole refused to accept an amendment?  Given that the Taoiseach will not be here next week and we are endeavouring to deal with the Department of Justice difficulties as best we can, why will the Taoiseach not make himself available for questions in relation to the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions this evening? This would ensure that questions relating to the Department of Justice will be answered by the Minister for Justice and those in relation to the systems failures, in so far as they pertain to the responsibilities of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, I have endeavoured to make the point as reasonably as I can.  As a reasonable person, will the Minister for Finance agree in the interests of openness, transparency and accountability and of getting our business done, that since he will not be available next week, the Taoiseach should make himself available this afternoon to answer these legitimate questions which everybody inside and outside this House wants answered?  Does he agree the Taoiseach should be here this afternoon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons I have already outlined, the Taoiseach will have left the country by the time questions are being posed and answered this afternoon.  Any question tabled to the Taoiseach, which is in order and deemed to be relevant to his responsibilities, will be answered by the Taoiseach at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

    <P>When the Government published its programme, A Government of Renewal, it made a commitment that noted public office holders such as the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda Commissioner and others who could not be brought before the House to answer questions would be available to come before Dáil committees.  The Minister for Justice has no responsibility in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney <Col N="1569" /> General, and, therefore, cannot answer questions on their activities or actions, while the Taoiseach has refused to answer questions even though he has responsibility.  It is possible for the Minister for Finance to put it to the Government that the only way we can get answers from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General, central figures in this issue, is by bringing them before a committee of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is participating in this debate under protest because the Government parties have engaged in sharp parliamentary tactics to avoid answering legitimate Opposition questions to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice on her role and that of the Attorney General in this affair.  Despite the commitments given by the Taoiseach in the House last week and the week before to the effect that he and the Minister would answer all questions, it is regrettable that they have essentially run away from answering questions tabled by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>What does language mean in this Parliament? Does accountability mean anything in terms of commitments given to reform the Dáil, to change procedures and to facilitate the process of answerability?  I ask this question because on 16 November 1994 the Taoiseach stated:</P>
      <P>We need a new Government that will reform the institutions of this State to make every Member of this House who holds office truly accountable.  We need reform to ensure that when the answers to questions asked in the House are not adequate the Ceann Comhairle can demand that a further answer be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government has not reformed the institutions of the State, changed the rules governing Question Time or given the Ceann Comhairle extra power to force Ministers to <Col N="1571" /> answer questions.  As a Front Bench member of Fianna Fáil I have considerable experience in tabling parliamentary questions and the entire process is designed to avoid answering questions. I can give numerous examples where I received no answers to fairly routine questions.  In one case the Minister for Education refused to disclose correspondence between her and Westmeath Vocational Education Committee.  On another occasion I was informed that answers can only be given on a confidential basis and may not be published.</P>
    <P>During last week's confidence debate, the Tánaiste made a very bitter contribution.  He spoke in a hypocritical way about the need to introduce a freedom of information Bill.  I make the charge that the Tánaiste must rank as one of the great political hypocrites of our era.  He does not believe a word he utters and bandies words about.  He referred to the urgent need for a freedom of information Bill, yet, in this case, our request that all correspondence sent to the Minister by the Attorney General should be disclosed has been refused by the Government which has taken a conscious, deliberate decision not to publish the Attorney General's letter to the Minister for Justice in connection with delisting Judge Lynch.  It is appalling political hypocrisy that the Tánaiste spoke about the urgency of freedom of information when he did not really believe what he said.  We do not have access to the basic and necessary information to which we are entitled to make proper and informed judgments on this case.  For this reason we sought the establishment of a select inquiry by a committee of the House which would inquire comprehensively into this sordid affair and have access to all documentation in the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice and the Taoiseach's office.  The committee would be able to interview everyone connected with the sordid episode involving the delisting of Justice Lynch.</P>
    <P>Why is the Government afraid to publish the necessary correspondence?  Why is it afraid to publish the Attorney General's letter to the Minister for Justice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is not afraid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why will it not publish the letter? The Minister should not refer to any nonsense about court cases because I do not believe her.  In the past, previous Governments made correspondence available to this House and to a select committee of inquiry.  If the Government believes in transparency and public accountability, why will it not agree to the establishment of a select committee of inquiry? Why will it not agree to make documentation and correspondence available to such a committee? We have not received adequate answers to these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> We also witnessed the sharpest of political tactics on the part of the Government in the manner in which it scheduled this debate. Undertakings were given to Fianna Fáil's Chief Whip that replies would be provided to questions to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice which were tabled for answer yesterday.  The Whip was informed that those questions would not be ruled out of order or undermined by the scheduling of the debate on the inquiry report. However, that commitment was not honoured. Despite the fact that Fianna Fáil's Chief Whip reported in good faith to the party's Leader and Front Bench that questions could be tabled, the Government engaged in sharp practice and questions to the Taoiseach relating to this affair did not fall for answer.  In addition, specific and precise questions to the Minister for Justice were not admissible yesterday.  That says much about political accountability and the Government's obvious desire to run away from it.</P>
    <P>I respectfully request that the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste put a stop to the hypocrisy of announcing and placing commitments into the Programme for Government about freedom of information and the need for this democracy to have greater access to such information.  The Government does not believe in honouring those commitments.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the Tánaiste's contribution on Wednesday last.  On Thursday, during Question Time, I asked the Minister for Education if she would make available and publish correspondence between herself and Westmeath Vocational Education Committee about a project in Montbard in France.  At the end of her reply she informed me that it is highly unusual to disclose departmental files to the House and publish the said correspondence.  She did this despite the fact that, under the 1930 Act, a vocational education committee is a public institution and any correspondence to the chief executive of such a committee is <i>de facto</i> a public letter and, in so far as vocational education committees are democratically elected bodies, chief executive officers are obliged to provide correspondence to their members.  However, the Minister refused to make that correspondence available to the House.  This occurred on the morning after the Tánaiste had spoken in eloquent terms about the need for a freedom of information Bill.  That is nothing but hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>The Government can argue that it is working on the Bill, checking the various drafts, etc., but there is no reason it cannot act in the spirit of a freedom of information Bill.  There is also no reason the Government cannot increase the momentum by opening the files and allowing people access to the most routine correspondence, particularly parliamentarians who require such access to make informed contributions to debates in this House.  The Government does not mean a word it says.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the public are becoming <Col N="1573" /> fed up with the hypocrisy of the Tánaiste and his party.  Last week, they witnessed a most hypocritical performance in terms of the issues and principles of public and political accountability to this House.  It must be stated that political accountability does not exist.</P>
    <P>We are asking that the Taoiseach answer question in the House about the role of the Attorney General, which is a legitimate and reasonable request; we are seeking the establishment of a select committee of inquiry to comprehensively investigate this affair, which would have access to all necessary documentation; we are seeking the urgent publication of the letter that the Attorney General sent to the Minister for Justice on 1 November and, above all, we seek political accountability.  People must take responsibility. From the findings of the Cromien inquiry, it is clear no one is taking responsibility for the sordid nature of this debacle.  It seems that civil servants must take the fall for political failure and negligence on the part of the Minister, the Attorney General and others in the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the major political issue involving calls for the resignation of the Minister, the findings of this report are very clear and definite: the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is completely and absolutely exonerated from any blame.  That has been established without any room for qualifications or challenge, no matter how hard the Opposition parties may try.  That is the real reason those parties walked out of the Chamber yesterday.  I am glad one party has seen fit to return.  That is also the reason for the orchestrated and phoney protest about questions not being answered.  Regardless of the questions the Opposition parties intend to table or the way they interpret the report and juggle its contents, they will find nothing which will enable them to revive their now flagging, if not completely fizzled out, attack on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of some sort of ammunition, they opted yesterday for a tactical withdrawal.  I am glad Fianna Fáil returned to take part in this debate, which has moved on.  We are presented with an opportunity and imperative for a root and branch reorganisation of the Department of Justice.  Practically every line of the report cries out for action in that respect.  This matter is no longer concerned with the delisting of Judge Lynch; it involves the urgent reform of the Department of Justice.  The report leaves no doubt about the extent of the work to be done. It states that nothing short of a comprehensive transformation of the Department of Justice is necessary.  Even though the inquiry was about a specific area and worked against a strict deadline, what the two men involved unearthed caused them to call for a comprehensive transformation of the Department.  I am pleased that Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy warned against allowing the report to gather dust.  They obviously know something about politicians because, as we all <Col N="1574" /> know, many reports end up gathering dust.  They are wise men in more ways than one.</P>
    <P>The report confirms what we have suspected for some time, that the Department of Justice is pervaded by a culture of secrecy and has failed to adjust to changing times and practices.  As head of the Government Information Service in the 1970s, I made modest endeavours to improve dealings with the media and to get away from the secrecy culture.  When a high ranking official from St. Stephen's Green entered my office in Government Buildings he spotted a hairline crack in the paint and for the following three quarters of an hour I got a lecture on how a prisoner in Portlaoise prison could conceal enough explosives to blow out the walls of the prison behind a hairline crack of that nature.  That was the end of my endeavours to get openness and to improve attitudes to public relations in the Department.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Causes of the Failures&rdquo; the report states, &ldquo;In the present organisational context [of the Department], the likelihood of human error is high; accidents are bound to happen&rdquo;.  It goes on to state that it is a tribute to the staff of the Department that there are so few errors.  What could be more damning in such a sensitive Department?  The structure is such that accidents are bound to happen and the report expresses surprise that more accidents of this nature have not happened.</P>
    <P>The mega-inefficiencies we are dealing with in the Judge Lynch delisting saga were not built up in the two years this Minister has been in charge or by the current staff in the Department.  They were built up over many decades under successive Ministers and Governments and, to a large extent, are the products of the culture of secrecy fostered by some very senior people in the Department in the past.  On the political side, it is interesting to note that in earlier years the Department was regarded for some time as a soft landing area for Ministers who were becoming less active.  I believe it was during that period the Department went into its own orbit.  That, of course, is no longer the case and the current Minister and her predecessors over a number of years will verify that it is no longer a soft landing place for a Minister.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the report was produced in a tight deadline, it makes some courageous statements.  It states, &ldquo;In view of all that has been said in this Report and in the wider public arena over many years about the Department of Justice, this should be a defining moment for the Department&rdquo;.  That is straight talking and puts it up to the Government and Members of the Oireachtas.  In criticising the Department, we must accept that it has faced enormously increased pressures in recent years, some of which were outlined by the Minister yesterday. Its workload in dealing with crime and lawlessness, European Union matters, prison overcrowding and the Northern Ireland peace process has increased significantly.  We must also <Col N="1575" /> admit that certain areas of the Department has been grossly understaffed.  The Association of Higher Civil Servants stated that it could not guarantee an adequate service to the Minister under the present structures and staffing levels, an amazing statement from a trade union organisation.</P>
    <P>When she became aware that a problem existed about the Judge Lynch delisting, the Minister, Deputy Owen, acted decisively, openly and speedily.  She set up the inquiry and I am sure Members from all sides accept its objectivity.  The report states that what happened was &ldquo;quite inexcusable&rdquo;.  That puts it mildly &mdash; in the political arena, it could be called the understatement of the year.  The Minister made a statement and promised action.  The report outlines the critical success factors for reforming the Department and we are told how we can help. I am confident that in the 12 months before the next general election the Minister for Justice will implement as many of those reforms as possible. We should heed the report's warning that, &ldquo;If this report were to be published and then left, after a flurry of activity, to gather dust it would not be the first time such a fate befell a report such as this one&rdquo;.  The present and succeeding Governments will need to keep this issue high on their agenda and ensure adequate financial provision and political support for the reforms advocated.  The Minister has already acted.  I look forward to her continued action in the coming year.  I believe she will have the full support of the Houses of the Oireachtas and I hope she will have the full support of the Executive in transforming the Department, so that much good will follow from the sad saga of the Judge Lynch delisting case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In setting up this inquiry the Government no doubt hoped it would assist it in its efforts at political whitewash.  It did not get that type of report, which is a tribute to the integrity of those who compiled it.  It is an indictment of the Minister that two distinguished public servants should have to go into her Department to find out what went drastically wrong, something she is incapable of establishing.</P>
      <P>The inquiry represents an abdication of the Minister's constitutional responsibility for her Department.  Management consultants are to be employed to reorganise the Department. Unfortunately, the Minister is forever running to catch up with the latest crisis.  Every package of measures she announces is on foot of a new disaster.  The Minister is not in charge, she is pushed from pillar to post by the pressures of one fiasco after another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The identification of serious deficiencies in the Department of Justice does not exonerate the Minister from political accountability from an episode the court describes as &ldquo;quite inexcusable&rdquo;.  It is understandable that for reasons of equity and natural justice the authors <Col N="1576" /> of the report stated that they &ldquo;would not consider it desirable to attempt to allocate blame between individuals&rdquo;.  I am not surprised they are unwilling to single out individual civil servants for blame.  That is not their task when the Minister, the Attorney General or the Government in general are not prepared to shoulder any part of the blame.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I compliment the authors of the report on refusing to scapegoat civil servants, who were doing their job but not given ministerial leadership.  The House should thank the two distinguished public servants, Mr. Seán Cromien, who is well known to Members for his long service to the public and to many of the agencies on which he worked so actively, and Dr. Edmond Molloy for conducting the inquiry expeditiously and efficiently.  They worked extremely hard and gave their time, though it was limited, to this case.  Their report is a comprehensive and damning indictment of the way the Minister and her Department conduct their business.  One has only to look at the headings &mdash;&ldquo;No System in Place&rdquo;, &ldquo;Failure of the Department of Justice to adapt to major external forces and trends&rdquo;, &ldquo;Inappropriate Institutional Framework&rdquo;, &ldquo;Inappropriate Organisation Structure for the Courts Division and Department of Justice&rdquo;, &ldquo;Very Weak Management Processes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Work Overload&rdquo;, &ldquo;Staff inexperience and Poor Job Handover from Previous Incumbents&rdquo;, &ldquo;Other shortcomings in personnel Policy and Practice&rdquo;, &ldquo;Inadequacy of Information Technology, Support&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Human Error&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no valid distinction to be drawn between the Minister and the Department.  The Minister is head of her Department.  Section 2 (i) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, states that each of the Ministers, heads of the respective Departments of State mentioned in section 1 of this Act, shall be a corporation sole under his style or name aforesaid.</P>
    <P>The Government may intend to reform this Act but they have not yet done so.  The Act is not relevant to this case which is not about a minor misdemeanour by a junior official of which the Minister could reasonably be expected to know nothing.  I am totally opposed to any reform that would diminish the Minister's responsibility for the fiasco in this case, which involves a Government decision and correspondence that ought properly to have had the Minister's personal attention.  It is clear from the report that the problems go far beyond this particular débacle.  The authors believe that there may be other disasters waiting to happen elsewhere in the Department.  This does not inspire confidence. The report is particularly critical of management in the Department, but that cannot be divorced from the Minister who is appointed for the purpose of managing a Department.  The report indicates that the Department operates virtually on auto pilot and there is little evidence of ministerial engagement or guidance.  There was <Col N="1577" /> no one watching the control panel for the warning signals that were flashing.  The Minister has not succeeded in putting a personal stamp of authority on her Department.  The picture presented in the report is of a ramshackle Department, with no evidence of the Minister taking action to improve efficiency and accountability.</P>
    <P>There are over 31,000 civil servants in this State.  The number has risen by over 1,000 since this Government took office in December 1994. There is an ample number of public servants if they are properly deployed, managed and instructed to carry out and implement Government policies and instructions, but to work the system requires clear direction from the political head of the Department and senior civil servants.  The report shows above all the complete failure of the Minister to manage her Department competently.  It is no surprise that the débâcle happened under this accident prone Minister. Resources may also have been overstretched under other Governments, but under good Ministers, like the three previous incumbents, Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn, Burke and Collins, the essential jobs were done quickly and efficiently and civil servants were motivated to perform.  Nobody had to ask in their day whether there was someone in charge.  They inspired public confidence; the present Minister does not.</P>
    <P>The inquiry does not answer many key questions relating to ministerial responsibility. The Minister sought and obtained a decision from the Government on 1 August.  The decision should have taken effect from 7 October, not 1 August, as originally intended, but there was a mix-up.  The Minister did not ask the critical questions which would have prevented her from asking for a decision to become operative on the wrong date.  As a result invalid court sittings took place for two months longer than should have been necessary.  There is no evidence in the report that the Minister was personally involved in any follow up after the Government meeting. It is not clear that she briefed any official on return from Government, or gave any instructions for a follow through on the decision. This is a basic part of a Minister's job.</P>
    <P>This débâcle has gone on for more than two weeks and I want answers.  It was always part of the routine job of a Minister that decisions relevant to him or her following a Government meeting would be checked by a competent senior official or that the Minister left the meeting and had a meeting with civil servants and the Secretary of the Department and then the matter was followed through.  That was the practice we followed.</P>
    <P>She must have believed that would happen automatically, an unwise assumption as experienced Ministers know.  There is no precedent for this decision but I am still surprised in the circumstances that the Minister did not instruct her officials to draft a letter for her thanking the judge for his ten years' service on <Col N="1578" /> the Special Criminal Court.  The absence of such a letter shows a lamentable lack of the human touch and gratitude by the State towards those who take on a difficult and sensitive task.</P>
    <P>On 6 November, three months later, Judge Lynch was finally given a photocopy of <i>Iris Oifigúil.</i>  What appalling rudeness and discourtesy on the part of the Minister towards the Judiciary that she could not reply in person to the judge's letters.  If the Minister had gone through the decision with officials on her return to her Department and asked for a letter of notification and thanks to be drawn up for her signature to Judge Lynch, the débâcle would most likely not have occurred.  I want to know why the Minister failed to do that.  A copy of the decision went for information to the programme manager. Programme managers, if they serve any useful purpose, which is open to question, are there to monitor that the Minister's wishes and decisions are executed.  The programme manager did nothing in this instance, casting further doubt on the value of that system.</P>
    <P>The matter was important enough for the Attorney General to write personally to the Minister on 2 October but it is unclear whether he realised that the continued sitting of Judge Lynch ran the danger of invalidating the detention of 16 or 17 subversive prisoners.  If the Attorney General did not realise the full implications at the time of writing the letter, it was a serious lapse on his part; if he did, he should have done more than write a letter.  He should have spoken to the Minister either in person or by telephone by way of follow up. Although the Attorney General has effectively delegated his former powers in regard to criminal prosecutions to the Director of Public Prosecutions, as the primary law officer of the State he retains an overseeing role.  Anything that would undermine a whole series of prosecutions of subversive crimes is surely the direct business and concern of the Attorney General.  I do not accept that in writing to the Minister he was doing her a special favour outside of his responsibilities.  The letter was issued by him in direct performance of his core duties, and there should have been a proper follow up.  In the last paragraph of the Attorney General's letter he said that if Judge Lynch's delisting had been officially notified both to him and the President of the Circuit Court he would be free to write to Judge Kenny confirming that Judge Lynch was no longer a member of the Special Criminal Court. It is clear that the Attorney General is involved, informally at least, in correspondence with judges about the composition of courts.  That corrects the point that has been made a number of times in the last week.  He admits that in his letter.  The Taoiseach has refused to answer questions put down to him on the role of the Attorney General, despite his responsibility for that office.</P>
    <P>Nobody in Fianna Fáil misunderstands the importance of the EU Presidency.  We have been internationally acclaimed as experts on the <Col N="1579" /> Presidency.  Recently in this House Chancellor Kohl made remarks to that effect for which the party is grateful.  The party understands that the Taoiseach has duties, but he should tell us when he is not available so that Members are not running around trying to get parliamentary questions in on time according to the rather strict guidelines of this House.  It is not within our control to change and it fits in with the administrative system.  Not alone did he not tell us but a Whip heard about it late last night and informed me early this morning.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, as brazen as anything, said in the House yesterday that any questions not answered because they were disallowed by the Chair's office, with which we do not have any argument, would be taken next week and he would be glad to answer them.  He said that 24 hours ago, knowing full well that he had no intention of being here next week and that those questions would be ruled out of order next week. No Minister of State will take questions relating to the Attorney General next week.  Let us be sensible about that.  Those questions will be ruled out of order by one device or another.  All the Taoiseach had to say was that we should table them for the following week.  I may be wrong, perhaps those urgent meetings of international importance were arranged only late last night, but I very much doubt that.  Why did the Taoiseach say in a calm tone that he would definitely answer those questions next week when he knew he would be 1,000 miles from here?  That was discourteous to the Opposition.  Perhaps he would at least do us the courtesy of telling us when he will be here between now and 15 December.  I understand he will be missing for quite a few days and I have no difficulty with that, but he should not play blind man's buff with the Opposition.</P>

      <P>He does not want to answer those questions because he does not have convincing answers.  Maybe that is why he arranged a few meetings to get away from here. Far from this being a Government of openness, transparency and accountability we have a closed, impenetrable and unaccountable one operating behind a frosted pane of glass.  That is clear for the world to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warn the Taoiseach and his colleagues that if they are still tempted to come looking for heads, which some of them are useful at requesting and make an occupation of it, they cannot skirt around those of the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General.  Until either or both are willing to carry their share of the blame, then and only then, to use the words of the report, is the Government entitled &ldquo;to examine the degree of culpability attaching to individuals&rdquo; in a wider sense, also having regard to the track record of individuals.  It is precisely because of the track <Col N="1580" /> record that last week we called for these matters to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>A statement in the report states:</P>
    <P>Official G explained to us that an enormous volume of letters was received in the private office of the Minister every day.  When a letter such as the one from the Attorney General came in, requesting the Minister to ascertain certain information from the Department, he felt that the appropriate way to deal with it was to obtain the information from the section concerned before showing the letter to the Minister.  Otherwise, she could legitimately ask him what the position was and he would not be aware of it.</P>
    <P>I do not regard that explanation as in any way acceptable.  I am well aware that every Minister's office gets a large volume of correspondence, but that is no excuse for the Minister failing to be shown important letters at once.  As the report states, &ldquo;Our reading of the wording of this letter, which after all came from the Attorney General and referred to a Government decision, would lead us to infer that urgent action was required upon it&rdquo;.  The real dereliction of duty is on the part of the Minister for not insisting from the outset that she be shown important letters immediately, at the same time as copies should be sent up to the Department.</P>
    <P>From what the two eminent men who prepared this report have written it is clear that they strongly believe that the normal procedures in Government Departments, of which both of them are well aware, were not followed.  These matters should have been passed to the Minister.  They have used diplomatic language.  Anyone reading the words of the report could only come to the conclusion that the authors are saying the procedure in the Department was that the Minister was not in the practice of looking at important letters.  Otherwise it means, as in this case, that weeks might pass before she would see an important letter and her seeing it would be entirely dependent on the speed of response from the section concerned.  No one seemed to regard a personal letter from the Attorney General to the Minister as of any particular urgency.  Any Minister worth his or her salt would or should have inquired about the position on receipt of the letter and his or her private secretary would have undertaken to quickly find the answer to that. The fact that the Minister saw the letter would have provided some important in-built safeguard but it is her responsibility, not her private secretary's, that she apparently never insisted on seeing important letters from colleagues immediately.  It shows up her deplorable lack of a hands-on approach to the management of her Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said in the House last week that minutes are taken of Government decisions.  The minutes of the Cabinet meeting at which this decision was made would have been read on the first Cabinet meeting held in September when the <Col N="1581" /> Government met after the summer recess.  The procedure at Cabinet meetings is that the Secretary of the Government carefully reads the minutes of the previous Cabinet meeting.  The normal practice in any Government of which I was a member is that Ministers listen at least to the minutes that refer to their Departments and are conscious of what is said about any decisions in that regard so that they can pick up on anything that may be wrong in the minutes.  They may wish to comment on a decision or it might jog their minds to do something if they had not done it.  Those minutes would have been read a month after the decision was made and nothing had happened.  The minutes did not jog anybody's mind.  The Minister might express her view on that.</P>
    <P>The same problem arose with the letter of 10 October from Judge Dominic Lynch, which the Minister did not see until nearly four weeks later. A Minister for Justice should see immediately as a matter of course letters addressed to her by senior judges, gardaí, law officers of the State and Government colleagues so that he or she knows at once what is happening without having to wait for the Department to bring a matter eventually to his or her attention.  It is puzzling that a letter from the Attorney General of 1 November, with post being carried by hand between Departments &mdash; at least it used to be when I was last in a Government Department &mdash; should not have reached the Minister until four days later.  I am told by a colleague in the House that it takes exactly five minutes to walk from one office to the other.  If one were to go through the Green, one might reach the other office quicker.  In this case it took four days.  It took another day and a half to realise that urgent action was required to regularise the detention of 16 prisoners in Portlaoise, with the Minister being pulled out from a performance of &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo;.  Those detained were released outside an inner gate of the prison and inside two outer gates and rearrested in the same place.  As the form of release and other matters are subject to legal challenge, I cannot comment further on them at this time.  The final fallout has yet to be determined.  Surely it is enough that the security of the State was put at risk and that public confidence in the most crucial Department of State has been shaken to its foundations.</P>
    <P>There is clear procedure in this House for getting to the bottom of political controversies. We opted to be part of this debate.  We do not think much of it, but we are elected to this House to express our points of view, to put forward what we believe is constructive opposition, to give the democratic system some credence, to inform the public about what we believe is wrong and to ask questions.  In this case, we want to ask questions relating to how an important judge in the Special Criminal Court could be wrongly in a seat of office dealing with subversive cases, possibly allowing the release of those prisoners, and in respect of which letters were being passed from <Col N="1582" /> the Attorney General, judges, secretaries, programme managers, assistant secretaries, heads of sections and nobody knew anything about the matter.</P>
    <P>We are a good Opposition, but all those at whom we want to target questions are not before us.  The Minister for Justice is present and has given a fair amount of time to this debate.  We cannot ask questions of the Taoiseach who is not here and we do not have access to the Attorney General.  We cannot get access to any of the letters relating to officials described in the report by various letters of the alphabet.  Having had officials A, B and C on my mind for some time it is nice to proceed further with the alphabet.  If this inquiry goes much further we may have to use the Greek alphabet.</P>

In the past those who are now in Government sought inquiries and received the co-operation of Fianna Fáil when in Government.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe was active in an inquiry following Deputy Jim Mitchell's claim that the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, had the telephones in Leinster House bugged.</P>

      <P>An inquiry was started on 2 July 1982 which ran out of steam as soon as the campaign began for the by-election in Galway East in which Deputy Noel Treacy was successful.</P>
      <P>On this serious issue we are asking for the matters involved to be teased out fully in an inquiry conducted by a committee of this House. Even if it is not possible to get quasi-judicial decisions from such a committee governed by a partisan parliamentary majority, it may discover the facts.  That was the success of the Dáil committee investigating the events of November 1994.  Members from my party appeared before that committee, although we did not particularly like it.  However, we prepared ourselves over the preceding Christmas and we answered the questions put to us truthfully and honourably.  We had already left Government and taken our medicine.</P>
      <P>In this case members of the Government arrogantly defend their positions.  They are answerable to nobody.  They will not appear before a committee of this House.  It is a shame.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern made a couple of points with which I agree.  He said that Fianna Fáil is a good Opposition.  I agree that it is learning to be a good Opposition.  However, it needs a little more practice and it should remain in Opposition for a long time to come.  That may be its best contribution to the democratic system.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the question of political accountability.  If one identifies the issues raised in the debate a name will emerge for the person who should bear political responsibility for this administrative fiasco.  I intend to name that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a series of procedural wrangles as to how this debate should be arranged and how questions should be taken.  It has been unedifying and the public will see Fianna Fáil in its true light &mdash; engaging in political play acting.  It is a clear <Col N="1584" /> indication of Fianna Fáil's agenda.  Last week Fianna Fáil and its current allies, the Progressive Democrats, were defeated on the motion of confidence in the Government.  They made little or no impact with their various political attacks. Further desperate attempts are now being made to pin political responsibility on somebody in the Government, no matter who that may be.  Their immediate target was the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, but when they made no progress they tried to broaden the issue and involve the Taoiseach.  Now there is a focus on the Attorney General.  These are the desperate attempts of an Opposition trying to make political capital out of a bad series of administrative errors in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Not a glove was laid on the Minister for Justice in the attempt to hold her politically responsible for administrative errors.  Many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies have had experience in Government. They know well that if Ministers were responsible for all the administrative errors which occurred in Departments there would be no Ministers left. There have been appalling administrative problems in years past yet we did not have automatic calls for resignations arising from them.</P>
    <P>In current values, over £1 billion has been spent in an attempt to eradicate bovine TB.  The efforts go back over almost 50 years and have not fully succeeded.  The difficulties experienced in implementing those attempts should not mean that successive Ministers should have resigned because they were not immediately able to solve the problem.  Renewed efforts were made by different Ministers and we now have the ERAD scheme which, hopefully, will enable further progress to be made.  It is hypocritical of the Opposition to attempt to pin responsibility on the Minister, Deputy Owen &mdash; who just happens to be the present incumbent &mdash; for administrative failures in her Department.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made to involve the Taoiseach but that petered out early on and the Opposition could not lay a glove on him.  A new attempt is being made to attack him via an attack on the Attorney General.  Fianna Fáil is trying to provide retrospective justification for its own misdemeanours, which led to the fall of the last Government.  It is seeking to draw a comparison between the administrative errors in the Department of Justice and what occurred a couple of years ago.  That strategy or agenda, which calls for the establishment of a committee of inquiry, has been a total failure and was blown apart by the Tánaiste last week.</P>
    <P>There was a total loss of trust between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party following publication of the beef tribunal report and the appointment of a President of the High Court by little more than half the Government after a walk-out of Labour Party Ministers.  That was the extent of the crisis between the parties in Government.</P>
    <P>There was also the controversy surrounding the statements in the Dáil by the then Taoiseach, <Col N="1585" /> Deputy Albert Reynolds, in relation to the Duggan and Smyth cases, which were dealt with in the High Court in London in recent weeks.  I do not intend to go over the details other than to recall that that was the atmosphere surrounding the events which led to the fall of the last Government.  The situation is now totally different and no comparison can be drawn.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has almost 50 years' experience of working in coalition Governments.  Fianna Fáil is good in Opposition which is good for democracy. Its record to date &mdash; I am not sure whether this can be put down to the famous Kanturk philosophy that coalitions are temporary little arrangements &mdash; clearly suggests it is not good as a member of a coalition Government and has much to learn.  It is best that it be given much more time in Opposition to learn this.</P>
    <P>Efforts have been made to direct fire at the Attorney General and to involve the Taoiseach who is accountable to the Dáil for the Attorney General.  Article 30 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;There shall be an Attorney General who shall be the adviser of the Government on matters of law and legal opinion and who shall exercise and perform all such powers, functions and duties as are conferred or imposed on him by this Constitution or by law&rdquo;.  The basic function of the Attorney General, therefore, is to act as law adviser to the Government with which he has a lawyer-client relationship.  The report of the Constitution Review Group &mdash; the Whitaker report &mdash; which comprised eminent experts of all political views and persuasions and none, states: &ldquo;That should entail no accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  It further states: &ldquo;The Taoiseach should decide how much or how little he or she reveals of the advice as in any other lawyer-client relationship&rdquo;.  There should be no pressure to reveal confidential advice given by a lawyer to a client, in this instance, by the Attorney General to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General has another function.  Section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, mentions &ldquo;the assertion and protection of public rights&rdquo;.  This is taken to mean he is guardian of the public interest.  It is mentioned in the report to which I referred that this function takes up, at most, about 5 per cent of his time in the average year and the review group came to the conclusion that a separate office should not be established to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of a possible conflict of interest between the function of the Attorney General to act as law adviser to the Government, on the one hand, and guardian of the public interest, on the other, the report states: &ldquo;The Review Group considers that discretion as to whether a conflict arises should be left with the <Col N="1586" /> Attorney General who will have to act in the full glare of publicity and under the closest of scrutiny by the courts and under the legal system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the Attorney General will go to court as guardian of the public interest on some great constitutional issue, as happened in the X case, not what the Opposition has in mind. Its efforts to drag his name into the debate are pathetic and inappropriate and must be rejected. He is a man of outstanding legal ability which he applies in a correct and punctilious fashion.  There is no evidence to suggest he has been in breach of his role and duties.</P>
    <P>The Cromien-Molloy report outlines a catalogue of administrative errors.  It is clear that, because of the systems in place in the Department of Justice, this was an accident waiting to happen.  Attempts are being made under the Strategic Management Initiative to identify and come to terms with the difficulties and to take a strategic approach in dealing with them.  This did not happen in the past and new systems are to be put in place.  Work has been ongoing for a year or two and is virtually complete.  The report, which will not be rushed, will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The report of the inquiry puts under the microscope a specific series of incidents which are but the tip of the iceberg.  It is recognised by the Department and the Minister that the system needs to be updated and improved.  As far as the details of the report are concerned, immediate steps have been taken.  Every Department should take account of its findings from which there are lessons to be learned throughout the public service.</P>
    <P>At a minimum, the principles of natural justice should apply to the officials involved who, it is clear, were operating under great pressure.  I believe that will be so.  It must be recognised that 50 staff were moved to work on the Presidency of the EU and that a huge extra workload had to be undertaken.  The report indicates that some civil servants were negligent and this must be confronted and dealt with in a manner which takes the principles of natural justice into account.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the report identifies a system which has been in place for many years. When I hear hypocritical attacks by the current Opposition, I must remind Fianna Fáil that for seven of the last nine years the Minister for Justice was from that party and none of those Ministers did anything about the problems in that Department. These problems did not arise today or yesterday, they go back a number of years.  The current proposals for the prison service are based on a report produced by Dr. Whitaker ten years ago, but it is only now that action is being taken.  Dr. Whitaker must have felt like Rip Van Winkle when he saw the decision had finally been made by the present Government and Minister.  This highlights the fact that nothing was done about that proposal by previous Fianna Fáil Ministers. That may be because some of them did not take <Col N="1587" /> much interest in the Department.  One of those Ministers, Deputy Burke, was only a &ldquo;half Minister&rdquo; as he was Minister for Communications as well as Minister for Justice.  He may not have been able to devote much time to this Department.  I will return to this point.</P>
    <P>The wild allegations against an eminent senior counsel were touched on in the report.  I accept Deputy McCreevy's apology to the House but it indicates the careless, slipshod way in which Fianna Fáil has mounted its political attacks. Politicians are used to attacks &mdash; political attacks are meat and drink to us &mdash; but it was entirely unfair to attack an eminent lawyer outside this House who is not part of the political process.  I was appalled by the interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; featuring Deputy McCreevy and Mr. Barry White SC, because even at that stage the Deputy neither made an apology, expressed regret nor showed embarrassment at involving Mr. White in this incident without a scintilla of evidence.  Such evidence leads me to doubt my earlier agreement with Deputy Ahern that Fianna Fáil is a good Opposition.  I am glad the record has been put right and such an event should not happen again.</P>
    <P>The question of how decisions of Government, legislation and Statutory Instruments should be communicated is relevant to this matter.  On this point, one matter in the report has not received great publicity to date but should be highlighted. If one goes back through the centuries, one finds that decisions on legislation and on the actions of the Executive do not have much effect unless they are communicated.  The Magna Carta was published in 1215 and signed by King John but that was not the end of the matter because the document had to be promulgated and made known throughout the kingdom.  Forty copies were therefore made, signed and sent to the various shires of England.  Thus began the promulgation of legislation, charters and Government decisions.  The modern method of doing this is through <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

      <P>I am coming to a sensitive area and the Deputy may know that I am about to indicate who bears ultimate responsibility for the failure to convey the decision to the person concerned.  It is not so much that it was not promulgated &mdash; the decision was mentioned in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a few days after it was made &mdash; but that it did not reach Judge Lynch.  The reason it did not reach him brings us back to the person who, in constitutional theory and political science, bears ultimate responsibility for this.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1588" />
      <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> had been circulated to every member of the Judiciary until 1990, when I was Opposition spokesman on Justice and the &ldquo;half Minister&rdquo; for Justice was Deputy Burke, who was unable to devote his full time to that Department because he had another portfolio.  As a penny-pinching, cost cutting measure, the Minister issued an edict that the circulation of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> to members of the Judiciary should be withdrawn. The Judiciary met because some judges protested and objected to this decision.  As a consequence, individual judges who made a big issue of this continued to receive copies.  However, as a general principle, Deputy Burke when Minister for Justice stopped the distribution of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> to members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>This is touched on in the report, although not in great detail.  If that decision had not been taken, Judge Lynch would have received his copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in the normal way and would have seen the decision of the Government.  That did not happen because the procedure was stopped. If one examines this matter and looks for political responsibility, this was the ultimate mistake made in 1990.  Fortunately, the present Minister immediately restored this facility to the Judiciary. This event could not happen again because all judges will now be aware, as they were before 1990, of decisions promulgated through <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm cúpla focal a rá faoi gach ar thárla le roinnt seachtain anuas agus, go spesialta, faoin mo taithí mar Aire Dlí agus Cirt ar feadh dhá bhliain.  I was missed last week and I was flattered that it should have been mentioned on the national airwaves.  Along with some Deputies opposite, I was abroad at a health conference which had been arranged for some time.  Today I break a self-imposed silence of two years to talk about my experience of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>As we all know, this Department is vitally important to our sense of citizenship and freedom.  It is a big, complex Department.  It has secrets but when one deals with organised crime, subversion and contract killing one must have secret methods and approaches.  Such secrecy does not make for good PR, so for many years some prominent and powerful members of this Government have hated the Department of Justice and have wanted to emasculate, diminish and demean it.  The current Minister, Deputy Owen, must seem like the answer to all their prayers because she has served them the Department on a platter.  Which of them would now like to do the slicing?  In so doing she follows a pattern she set from the beginning.  The Minister, Deputy Owen, does not just pass the buck, she passes the blame too.  Good mangers say that for every problem there is a solution, but the Minister has a new version of that: for every problem there is a scapegoat &mdash; eany meany miny moe catch the civil servant by the toe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the Minister's thinking, civil servants are <Col N="1589" /> not members of her team, professionals who are proud of what they do and committed to high performance, they are like heat logs.  Any time she needs a good blaze to distract from her incompetence she sets fire to a few of them, with a great blaze and sparks, but in the end only ashes.  The Minister's personal survival as Minister for Justice is worth any number of civil servants and their careers.  Is it justice to demonise people who cannot defend themselves or their performance?  Is it justice to portray a whole Department of people as stupid, lazy, secretive and generally useless?  No, it is not.  I was in that Department for two years and I know the Department and the people in it.  During my time there, inevitably, given the areas covered by the portfolio, there was one crisis after another, but the crises were managed by public servants who were efficient and effective.  It is amazing that a Department full of excellent people can, in less than two years, undergo such change.</P>
    <P>As I drove into work this morning I passed the Department of Justice in St. Stephen's Green and I looked over the door to see something of which I am very proud, the name of the Department, An Roinn Dlí agus Cirt &mdash; the Department of Justice.  That name was not over the door when I became Minister, but I decided in 1994 that it should be displayed proudly.  The building is most unappealing architecturally and most depressing, probably the most depressing of all Government buildings in which to work.  It has, however, two saving graces &mdash; the professionalism of its staff and its proximity to St. Stephen's Green with its beautiful pathways.</P>
    <P>I remembered this morning all the survivors of the Department of Justice, many of whom are still Members of this House, such as Deputies Ray Burke, Gerry Collins, Jim Mitchell, Michael Noonan, Alan Dukes and myself, and about half a dozen other Members who acted as Minister for Justice in the absence of the Minister who must attend to business abroad from time to time.</P>
    <P>In 1993 I was appointed to the Department of Justice.  To my knowledge, in living memory Deputy Owen is the only Member of this House who asked to be Minister for Justice.  Usually people are given the job, which is the most difficult of all in Government.  The first greeting I received on arriving in the Department was from the private secretary and I asked him what the Department was like.  He said that at the end of the day I was responsible for 10,000 gardaí, 2,000 prison officers and 800 civil servants.</P>
    <P>On the work method adopted at the time, as everybody who has been Minister or even a Deputy in a constituency office is aware, that is devised by the political head.  I examined each of the divisions of the Department and found out what work was under way and what was in the pipeline.  I reordered priorities within each division.</P>
    <P>The Minister's office is located on the fourth floor in what is referred to as the ministerial suite, consisting of the Minister's office, the private <Col N="1590" /> office, that is the office out of which the private secretary operates, the programme manager's office, the personal assistants' office and the constituency office, with a couple of yards between each office.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister I discovered that a new office had been created for a programme manager.  That person was supposed to smooth the operation of Government, iron out difficulties between Ministers and Departments and oversee implementation of Government policy.  That was the job description then and I would like to know if and when it changed.  At that time programme managers held their own mini-Cabinet meetings at least once and sometimes twice or three times a week, at which they oversaw Government decisions.  The chairman of the programme managers, the programme manager for the Taoiseach, having trawled through all Government decisions, came to the meeting with an agenda and demanded to know from each other programme manager the position on the implementation of Government decisions.  That person was aware on coming to the meeting of certain decisions that had not been implemented.</P>
    <P>As regards the office procedures in place in the Department of Justice when I was in office, there was a rule that any communication from a Government colleague, including the Attorney General and the Chief Whip, a judge or the governor of a prison would immediately be brought to the Minister's attention.  Any correspondence that came to the office marked private, personal or confidential was brought to the attention of the personal assistant to the Minister, who opened that mail and came directly to me with it.  I then made the decision, as Minister, on how it should be handled.  I raise this issue because in the report of the inquiry there is specific reference to the fact that the letter from Judge Lynch, marked personal, had gone to the personal assistant to the Minister.  I find it extraordinary, therefore, that that person did not, as would have happened in my time in office, immediately bring the matter to the Minister for decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is wrong in saying that the only way a person, including a judge, may hear about Government decisions is by way of <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  When I was in office I was involved in the preparation, presentation and execution at Cabinet meetings of every memorandum for Government and finally in the implementation of decisions.  A pink slip, signed by the Government secretariat, was photocopied for every Member of the Cabinet and sent to the Minister's office in the Department after each Cabinet meeting. After each meeting I either returned to the Department or went to my office in the Dáil and communicated with the secretary of the Department or the appropriate official and always with the programme manager.  There was then a full and detailed discussion of all the areas involving the memorandum for Government.  We decided the events that had to take place in order <Col N="1591" /> to implement those decisions and followed through on that.  That was done, inevitably, even before the pink slip from the Government secretariat arrived in the Department.  The programme manager was crucial to this practice because he had to report back and would be pursued relentlessly by the chairman and other programme managers in the event that a Government decision was not acted upon.</P>
    <P>The Minister at all times must be not only competent but seen to be in control, in charge and on top of the job.  Since she may receive phone calls at all hours of the day or night, whether in regard to a prison riot, a murder, an arms find, a drugs haul, an arrest or a suicide attempt, she must be on 24 hour call.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Justice I was told that the culture of the Department was secretive and closed and that the civil servants were all old, grey men who were opposed to change and new ideas.  However, I found the Department open, willing to change and to work all hours to implement the Minister's desires and wishes.  One of my earliest experiences was on prioritised, sensitive legislation, which every Member of this House, the public and every civil servant in the Department of Justice found extremely difficult to deal with from a personal point of view &mdash; everybody is aware of the legislation to which I am referring.  Despite the personal difficulties with that legislation, the civil servants in the law division of the Department of Justice worked tirelessly and relentlessly pursued the parliamentary draftsman to bring it to fruition.  I left a letter on the desk for my successor stating what I thought of the Department and its officials and she is free to publish that letter if she wishes.</P>
    <P>The nature of the Department is that it has many secrets, and civil servants and Ministers for Justice go to their graves with many of those secrets.  I regret the private secretary in the Department was the only one targeted by being named publicly in the media.  That private secretary, on a day when I was answering parliamentary questions in this House based on information I had received not two hours earlier from the Garda Commissioner's office in the Phoenix Park, saw a headline in an evening newspaper which fully contradicted the information I was about to impart to Deputy Gay Mitchell, photocopied the article and the headline, ran from his office upstairs to the door of this Chamber and handed the article, with his note informing me that it contradicted the information I was about to impart, to a staff member of the House who gave it to me.  Because of his quick thinking and efficiency I was prevented from inadvertently misleading the House on a serious matter.  Is that the action of somebody who is incompetent?</P>
    <P>How could things have changed so fundamentally in two years, and why?  Every Minister lays down the ground rules clearly. Different Ministers operate differently but civil <Col N="1592" /> servants obey their political masters' instructions to the letter.  Civil servants are not mind readers, however; they need clear, precise instructions.</P>
    <P>I have not made any comment on the performance of the Minister for Justice in the past two years.  In fact, anything I said about her in relation to prisons, etc. was in an effort to be helpful.  The warning bells rang after the prisons fiasco.  I thought the Minister for Finance had pulled a fast one at Government when the Minister, Deputy Owen, was away.  I was shocked subsequently to learn in this House that the Government agenda, sent to the Minister and opened by her, stated clearly the prison scrappage as one of its items.  That agenda was consigned to the briefcase and the Minister went off merrily to eastern Europe without telling anyone in the Department.</P>
    <P>The first the Department knew of the decision was when the Government pink slip decision arrived.  What did the Minister think would happen?  Did she think in innocence the proposal would be postponed in her absence or that one of her colleagues at the Cabinet table would stand up for her Department when his or her own Department was being slashed also?</P>
    <P>What should the Minister have done?  She should have cancelled the trip abroad and immediately alerted the secretary and the assistant secretary in the prisons section.  They should have prepared her battle lines for the next morning's Government meeting.  At that stage her actions could have been put down to inexperience but it should have been a lesson that was learned.</P>
    <P>I want to know about the Minister's relationship with the Attorney General.  Do these two members of the Government talk to each other?  Do they discuss issues of common interest?  Do they ever communicate by telephone?  Why would an Attorney General of the calibre of Dermot Gleeson, on being told by Judge Harvey Kenny that a Government decision had not been complied with resulting in persons being held in unlawful custody in our prisons, write to the Minister for Justice?  Why did he not pick up the telephone and ring her?  If he did not want to talk to the Minister on the telephone, why did he not ring her and say he wanted to talk to her about an urgent matter?  Why would he not have asked to see her?</P>
    <P>The Attorney General would have clearly understood the absolute urgency of getting the message to the Minister.  One wonders if he made any effort to contact her.  Did he mark his letter to the Minister &ldquo;For the Immediate and Personal Attention of the Minister&rdquo;?  Was the letter marked &ldquo;Private and Confidential&rdquo;?  If not, why not?  This was not an ordinary matter.  The security of the State and the constitutional rights to personal liberty of persons were at stake.</P>
    <P>One month went by.  How many times did the Minister and the Attorney General meet during that month?  At all Government meetings?  At a number of the Northern Ireland talks?  Did they <Col N="1593" /> meet socially?  I find it unbelievable that during that time this experienced, eminent lawyer, the Attorney General, did not at any stage mention the Judge Lynch matter to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is very close to the Taoiseach.  Why did he not mention this serious matter to him?  The Attorney General knew for a full month that certain citizens were being deprived of their liberty contrary to article 40.4 of the Constitution, and we are being asked to believe that all he did was write two letters.  It beggars belief.  That is why the Attorney General must answer for himself and that can only be done before a committee of this House.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the events of the past two days.  I would love to have been a fly on the wall in the Cabinet room last Tuesday evening.  One can picture the scenario inside.  The report is distributed.  It is read but the result is unsatisfactory because no person has been found guilty.  One can picture the scenario outside the Cabinet room.  A Dáil and a country convulsed, and Government backbenchers muttering in the corridors.</P>
    <P>I must be forgiven for thinking aloud at this time but I wonder if a head-hunting expedition was organised.  Was a head sought and, if so, whose head?  Knowing the head-hunters involved, I would have thought a relatively junior head would not have been enough.  I have my suspicions in that regard but unfortunately I was not a fly on the wall and I do not know.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was a manager in private enterprise she would not get away with the disgraceful badmouthing of her own team.  Her board of directors would quickly cut through the blame laying and buck passing and tell her it is bad management when a chief executive officer does not know what is going on in the plant.  They would say that performance is what matters and a consistently incompetent performance is not and cannot be justified by reference to the alleged failure of subordinates.</P>
    <P>This Government does not carry out any performance appraisal.  It simply circles the wagons around its failures, throws out a few human sacrifices &mdash; civil servants are in great supply &mdash; and sets out to bore the nation into moving away from the current disaster.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nora Owen is Minister for Justice. Deputies will remember a Department that existed once upon a time and did a good job under the enormous pressures of active subversion until a Minister came along whose approach was pleasingly simple.  She did not achieve control of the complexities of the Department.  She presided over a series of mismanaged messes.  She could find time for every photo opportunity but no time to get to grips with what happens in the Department. When her own title came under threat, she was quite happy to collude in the destruction of a whole Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister is still Minister and that is all that matters to her.  For what is she Minister?  For <Col N="1594" /> Justice?  Tell that to the civil servants and listen for the bitter laugh.  She is Minister in the Department of Justice.  What Department? Deputy Owen is now Minister of what is left of a once great Department.  She presides over the bits that her Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left colleagues have allowed her to hang on to.  She will go down in the history of the public service as the Minister who sacrificed her Department in the interests of her title.</P>

      <P>There are many people in Irish politics who struggle courageously and with a great deal of effort to be conspicuous by their presence, something to which I am sure many of our colleagues here aspire.</P>
      <P>I compliment the authors of this relatively brief report.  It is easy to read and was produced within a week.  That is quite an achievement.  The Minister acted decisively and effectively to address the problems which occurred in her Department.</P>
      <P>The controversy over this matter has gone on for the past fortnight and the Opposition has done its best to get as much mileage out of it as possible.  That is the nature of Irish politics and it is unfortunate that we indulge in that type of politics as we approach the year 2000.  These are the days of the Internet, the global economy and global markets but we are back in the 1920s or 1930s fighting about who said what and when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not pretend the Opposition has the monopoly in this regard.  It has not.  We all have engaged in this type of politics in the past but perhaps we can now being to think in terms of moving on from the politics of blame, accusation, counter accusation, allegation, etc.  That is not useful when one thinks in terms of what needs to be done here and how we should set about organising ourselves in that regard.  We have a comprehensive, if succinct, analysis of what went wrong.  There has been a series of management failures in the Department of Justice.  Before I deal with those, let me say that I agree with some of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's sentiments regarding people she knew in the Department of Justice.  My knowledge of people in the Department of Justice is limited.  However, its Secretary appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, and he is quite at variance with the image portrayed of the Department.  He seems a forward-looking, civilised, ordinary <Col N="1595" /> person and was open, in so far as he can be open, given the restrictions of his position.  He is quite different from the caricature of the Department of Justice which has been painted over the years. He seemed exceptionally open-minded in the context of criticisms and responded frankly to questions.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems in the Department of Justice arose from the huge workload civil servants have to bear.  Not only do they have an enormous workload, but some of them have a diverse range of responsibilities.  It is noteworthy that one of the senior civil servants involved in this business was snowed under preparing answers to 14 Dáil questions.  Perhaps there is a case to be made for reviewing the procedure for dealing with Dáil questions.  I wonder whether there should be open-ended access to answers to Dáil questions many of which, I suspect, are not written by Deputies themselves but by &ldquo;question factories&rdquo; which generate and invent questions. One wonders whether it is desirable that so many questions are put down and whether the whole process is cost effective.  That is not to say that questions should not be allowed, but it would be well worth discussing whether the present system would benefit from modification.</P>
    <P>Some of the difficulties arose from the lack of a managerial ethos in the Department of Justice. Much of the Civil Service is defensive in terms of how it is managed.  I understand that, because it is important that mistakes are not made.  That, in turn, arises from the nature of the political culture that exists of blame and accusation.  We should try to move on and understand that progress inevitably means taking risks and that, looking at the broad picture, a certain level of failure is unavoidable.  The management ethos described in the report seems irreconcilable with the modern world where the Internet is the new system of communication, where mobile phones are two a penny and where the laptop computer is a basic tool of business.  I wonder how many mobile phones are available to civil servants and the extent to which they are allowed to use them. I asked this question of the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  To be frank, I cannot remember exactly what answer he gave, but my recollection is that the total number of mobile phones in the Department was of the order of ten or 20.  That is ridiculous in the modern world given that these people are, to a large extent, responsible for managing a total budget of about £15 billion.  That is one aspect that badly needs to be addressed.  To the extent that this report has encouraged and facilitated that, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to review management practices in the Departments on an ongoing basis. There is not nearly enough of that type of proactive management.  There is a need for a system of quality control and management development, and much more effort and energy should be expended in that area.  However, it will <Col N="1596" /> be difficult to do that while the political culture remains as it is.  The present political culture is hostile to that type of thinking, and it facilitates the <i>status quo,</i> the attitude that, above all else, one should never make a mistake.  That, in turn, slows things down.  It is important to change that attitude, which, to a fair extent, is conditioned by positions adopted by people in this House and in the broader political world.  It is time we moved away from the fountain pen and the copy book and towards the Internet and the laptop and modern communication and management processes.  Not nearly enough action is being taken on that in the Civil Service.  That may be one of the more important lessons of this report. Associated with that is an acceptance that mistakes are bound to be made if we are to make progress.  The question of what types of mistakes are acceptable is a wider question.  As long as we continue to blame and accuse, which seems to be the bread and butter of Irish politics, we will have difficulty in making progress.  As we approach the dying days of this century&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The life expectancy of this Government is a year at the most.  That is hardly a major discovery.  As to this débâcle, I really think the public are bored out of their minds by it.  At one level it is just as well that the Deputies across the Chamber keep droning on about it. The more they do that the more they draw attention to their own inadequacies and to their position on the political spectrum, and the more they do this the more they describe themselves as old and tired and really belonging to another age. It is time they got with it.  However, that is not the primary concern of people like myself.  Our primary concern is that we learn from this report, that we develop a culture of modern management in the Civil Service and that we move on.  As to what happened, most of the blame is centred around the 1924 Act which is hopelessly out of date, the idea that any Minister could be responsible for every detail in a Department is ridiculous and quite out of character with the modern world and with modern management procedures.  It is time we moved on and became more modern.</P>

      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputy Martin Cullen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Upton.  He made quite some mileage himself in accusing the Opposition of trying to score political points and seems to have forgotten that the role and obligation of an Opposition is to point out where Governments are going wrong.  Without such legitimate criticism we would have not a democracy but Government rule with no criticism or right to criticise.  That is not how our Constitution works.  Nor is it the way people <Col N="1597" /> outside this House would like us to behave as Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I quite understand that Deputy Upton, members of his party and members of this Government find what is happening at the moment embarrassing.  He has said he would like to be able to move on from this situation because of that embarrassment.  To learn from the situation and to talk about the important issues of responsibility and accountability we must face up to the problem, look at what has gone wrong and see how we can put things right to improve the position for the coming months and years.  We have heard from the Government side of the need for change and further management structures to be put in place in the Department of Justice and in the Civil Service generally.  I do not think any of us on this side doubt that certain changes need to be made from time to time to bring any system up to date.  That is a legitimate argument.  The nub of this argument is not the changes that are needed now but to deal with what has actually happened under the present system.  Whatever changes we would like to see in future is a matter for the future.  What we must do now is deal with the present and what has gone wrong and who should be responsible and accountable.</P>
    <P>The report does not answer the many fundamental questions regarding the problems that confront us immediately.  That is why there is a great deal of frustration not only in the House but among the public.  To quell that frustration something needs to be done about finding the answers to these problems.  As my party has already suggested the one possible way of dealing with this matter is to bring the whole issue to a committee so that people can be called on to attend that committee.  Perhaps then we would have an opportunity to find the answers this report was unable to find.</P>
    <P>When the Government was in Opposition it bayed loudly about the need for accountability, responsibility and the whole area of culpability. These three issues were discussed at length two years ago on a similar issue.  The Labour Party was suddenly ready to do a U-turn on what it thought was a principle two years ago and with breathtaking hypocrisy is taking the exact opposite stance on this issue.  On that occasion it was prepared to bring down a Government.  As far as I can see the parties in Government are prepared to stick like glue, an apt phrase used by the Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy O'Rourke.  At this stage it must be using super glue because it must be difficult and embarrassing when it looks back over two years and finds that what it advocated then is not relevant now because it is in Government, not in Opposition. It would be amusing if it was not so serious that the Labour Party was prepared to bring down a Government two years ago on a similar issue.  If it was to pull out of Government it would have nowhere to jump.  Instead it is prepared to hang in there and forget any matter of principle just to <Col N="1598" /> stay in power.  That cynicism has registered strongly with the public.</P>
    <P>We have heard from the Tánaiste that the Government is likely to last until next October. That remains to be seen.  At the end of the Government's term of office the people will be able to judge; in a democracy it is the people alone who make these decisions.  It is arrogant for anyone in Government to believe that when in Government they are in a position of power and that that power can be used to promote their personal political ambitions.</P>
    <P>On the issues of responsibility and accountability we keep coming back to the fact that because the Minister for Justice attended some of the debate that her actions &mdash; her inactions &mdash; over the past few months and years in Government are excused.  Such excuses are not enough.  Anyone who takes up a job must look at its responsibilities and do it to the best of his or her ability.  The Minister will be aware that the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 sets out the Minister's responsibility and her position in this regard.  It is not just a question of it being a tradition or leaving it to the individual Minister as to whether he or she has the courage or the integrity to resign on such an issue, when the law is transgressed the Minister should comply with the law and have the courage to resign.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service is being used as the scapegoat on this occasion.  That is not acceptable.  We accept errors were made but it is also clear that errors were made by the Minister and by the Attorney General on this issue.  It is for them, as the constitutional officeholders, to take the rap as it were, to take their duties seriously enough to know that when a mistake is made the buck stops with the Minister.  Therefore, the Minister is not just in a position to take the praise but must also stand over any mistakes at the end of the day if they come within her remit as part of her Department.  Perhaps at a later date it would be more opportune to discuss how we can update the rules and regulations pertaining to running the different Departments.  I agree with Deputy Upton who said we should now concentrate on the Internet and the laptop rather than the fountain pen and the copybook but that is clouding the issue.  Those issues can be examined at another time but now we have to examine the immediate issue which is that the Minister for Justice is not able to run her Department and so must take the honourable course and resign.  The Attorney General who is the protector of the public interest should also consider his position.</P>

      <P>It should come as no surprise to any of us in the House or anyone observing this debate the level of frustration being experienced by the Opposition side in trying to get information from the Government at any level. Some 12 months ago an eminent journalist writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> described the Government as one of the most closed she had ever come across.  It was an interesting article <Col N="1599" /> given that the whole <i>raison d'être</i> of the Government and its reason for being in Government was how open, transparent and accountable it would be, not only to the House but to the people.  Time moved on quickly and memories shortened and anything that could be deemed accountable, open or honest were not words the Government stood over.  In the past number of weeks we have witnessed a catalogue of errors in the Department of Justice which primarily emanate from the Minister.  All this has not occurred because some official did not do X, Y and Z.  It is beyond belief that for more than 12 months the Minister was aware of an issue concerning Judge Lynch, going back to 1995. Having been in a position to take a decision to release him from the Special Criminal Court, she brought the matter to Cabinet, where it was approved, and simply forgot about it, which is quite extraordinary by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
      <P>The reality is that is no political responsibility is being taken for anything that occurs within this Government's remit.  The Minister for Justice should not have put the House through what she did in recent weeks, in particular the last two. Realising the gravity of her position, the lack of personal responsibility she displayed on this issue, she should have done the honourable thing and resigned.</P>
      <P>What is even more interesting is the position of the Labour Party which I have observed in this House and at local level over a long period.  There is no doubt that the Labour Party is absolutely consistent in that what it says and does are two utterly different things.  The gulf between speaking out of one corner of their mouths and their actions is enormous.  Throughout my political career, the Labour Party has displayed absolute consistency in being inconsistent.</P>
      <P>Many of my colleagues have quoted comments of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on how they would ride into town and clean up Government, rendering it accountable, accessible and transparent to all and sundry.  That has not happened because the overriding principle of the Labour Party is selfpreservation. Anything that might occur involving accountability, openness or responsibility to this House or the electorate is secondary to the preservation of its function in Government.</P>
      <P>Another consistency is that over the years whenever the Labour Party and Fine Gael have been in Government together &mdash; this time with the adjunct of Democratic Left &mdash; the country has been unable to afford their tenure in office.  Each time on leaving office their legacy has been consistent, the ruination of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would not be engaging in this debate today but for the strong economy this Government inherited, the very strong platform on which they have been able to stand which has masked a whole range of issues that have arisen within its <Col N="1600" /> term of office.  They have had that substantial crutch on which to lean that has overridden all other issues.  The number of scandals and crises that have affected practically all Government Departments has been sad and regrettable, masked by its will to hold on to power at all costs.</P>
    <P>I hope the general election will be held sooner rather than later.  We can already begin to see that the economic peak is beginning to decline.  I have no confidence in the ability of this Government to sustain the legacy they inherited after seven or eight years hard work by my party in Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs hailed the committee system as forming the bedrock of this Government's approach to business.  They said that system would be strengthened, afforded all the necessary facilities and would have the requisite powers to call people before it.  If there was any doubt about openness, transparency and accountability, or a perceived lack thereof because of procedural difficulties within this House, they promised that the committee system would be able to ensure that any minute detail pertaining to any issue could be teased out between the individuals involved.</P>
    <P>This was an outstanding case to have a committee investigate the circumstances surrounding the issue being debated today, particularly because of the Taoiseach's failure to take responsibility for the offices of the Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions.  We have failed to get the Taoiseach to answer very specific questions on what occurred between the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice, or the role of the former, since he would have been party to the decision originally taken at Cabinet concerning the removal of Mr. Justice Lynch from the Special Criminal Court.  It is beyond belief that the senior law officer of the land could have ignored such an important decision taken within Cabinet until it was brought to his attention some months later.</P>
    <P>The committee system should have been availed of to question the Attorney General directly on his role in this whole affair.  Not alone did that not happen but we cannot get the Taoiseach to come into the House, the same man who some two years ago stood on these benches insisting on the fullest accountability to this House and the electorate on matters that had occurred in the preceding months.  Yet the man who led this Government into office on a platform of accountability, promising he would run a Government so transparent it could be seen through a pane of glass, has not fulfilled that promise.  How hollow those promises now sound which were supposed to be the bedrock on which this Government was formed.</P>
    <P>This should not surprise us since one of the mainstays of Government, the Labour Party, would be consistent in that respect.  It likes to select the grandiose phrase, the large sound bite, to create the right impression, but when pressure <Col N="1601" /> is exerted the heads disappear behind the benches hoping that the tide will wash over them and their position will be preserved.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, in respect of other happenings preceding those leading to the downfall of the former Government two years ago, made some fine statements in this House on his accounting in another forum for statements he had made, when again he found a way of evading the issue.  We have now an absolute replica of all of those occurrences in the actions of the Labour Party, the most unaccountable political party that has no interest in looking after the electorate, in driving serious policy matters.  Its only interest is its maintenance in office.</P>
    <P>Although it is rumoured that a general election will not be called for at least 12 months, I contend we are a lot closer.  Every time one speaks to a member of the public, one finds them rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of an opportunity to pay back the Labour Party for all of its false promises and unaccountable actions since assuming office some four years ago.  Of course, members of the Democratic Left Party hide altogether in the life rafts whenever challenged with being accountable to this House.  Their actions have been disgraceful.  They have demeaned the very office of Government and failed to be accountable or act responsibly.</P>
    <P>This is a Government in shambles that does not want to listen, observe or respect parliamentary democracy.  It is a Government that will do anything to avoid answering hard questions, for the one reason only, to maintain itself in office. That overrides all other considerations.  All three parties have been consistent in that respect and to hell with parliamentary democracy.</P>

      <P>We live in a democracy and should be proud to do so.  Many people in other countries do not enjoy the same privilege and it is very important for Ministers to uphold democracy.  The Minister for Justice has done this.  Once she became aware of the difficulties she made a statement to the Dáil and set up an inquiry.  She has now brought the report before the Dáil to be debated.  This is democracy at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times Members have become selective about democracy.  However, one cannot <Col N="1602" /> pick and choose and the democratic process must prevail.  I was flabbergasted yesterday when the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, described a democratic vote as a charade and left the Chamber.  Does democracy only work for Fianna Fáil when it is in power?  Deputy Ahern should be careful about abusing the democratic process in this House.  The film &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; deals with an earlier walk-out which had grave consequences and we should not resort to the same tactics.  Deputy Ahern seems to support a type of <i>a la carte</i> democracy -when it suits him he supports it and when it does not suit him he ignores it.</P>
    <P>The other Opposition party has a selfexplanatory name.  The title &ldquo;Progressive Democrats&rdquo; suggests that its members are both progressive and democrats.  The very eloquent Leader of that party regularly refers to the importance for parties in the North to get together and talk.  She should have led by example yesterday and ensured her party stayed in the Chamber to contribute to the debate.  Their decision to leave the Chamber is hardly a sign they are prepared to accept democracy.  I am amazed that one of the members of that party which can claim a direct connection to the foundation of democracy in this State stood by and let this happen.  Given their decision not to accept a majority decision of the House and to leave the Chamber in protest &mdash; it is a good way of getting publicity &mdash; they deserve the new title &ldquo;Regressive Non-Democrats&rdquo;&mdash; they have gone backwards and have failed to accept democracy.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue attacked the one person who cannot defend himself, the very able Attorney General who did his job.  As I said previously, there is no point keeping a dog if one intends to do the barking oneself.  He gave legal advice to the Government and expected those in charge of the Department of Justice to deal with the problem.  It is, therefore, absurd to hear him being attacked.  Deputy O'Donoghue is like a forlorn Kerry footballer who did not make the team.  He loves scoring goals into an empty net but if the Attorney General had an opportunity to reply he might silence him fairly quickly.  The Deputy is behaving like a school yard bully in attacking a person who cannot defend himself.</P>
    <P>The Opposition's reaction to this issue can be summed up by a statement made yesterday by Deputy Michael Smith &mdash;&ldquo;We will do everything in our power to make sure they do not stay in power&rdquo;.  The month of November upsets Fianna Fáil as it is the anniversary of the downfall of the previous Government.  Members of that party have still not got used to the idea that they are no longer in Government.  For example, yesterday Deputy Dermot Ahern referred to the Opposition when referring to the Government.  I accept this was a slip of the tongue but it still shows the thinking among Fianna Fáil Deputies. It is time they realised they were not in power and there is nothing to be gained from raising this kind of nonsense on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> Fianna Fáil wanted information and asked for the judge's letters to be published.  However, when they were published they made no comment as there was nothing in them which they could use to blame the Minister.  They then asked for the letters from the Attorney General to be published.  One of them was published but the other cannot be published because of impending court cases.  Regardless of what the Government does the Opposition wants more.  Even though the report sets out clearly what happened the Opposition wants the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to investigate the matter.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have described the report as a &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo;.  This is insulting to the two men who did an excellent job within such a short period in finding out what happened in the Department.  The use of the word &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo; belittles the great work done by these men.  The Minister made every effort to find out what happened and, despite their experience, these two excellent men did not get to the root of the problem.  However, they dealt with the real problem, and state in the report:</P>
    <P>The next matter to which we turned was an examination of what happened to the Government decision when it arrived in the Department of Justice.  It was received in the Office of the Private Secretary to the Minister, Official G, from the Cabinet Secretariat on 2 August.  Official G was on annual leave but the decision was photocopied and, in accordance with normal procedures, was circulated as follows:</P>
    <P>Secretary (Official A): marked &ldquo;for information&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Programme Manager (Official M): marked &ldquo;for information&ldquo;</P>
    <P>Assistant Secretary (Official B)</P>
    <P>Principal (Official C)</P>
    <P>Assistant Principal (Official F).</P>
    <P>Five people saw a copy of the Government decision.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said that when she worked in the Department it was like a garden of roses where everything was perfect. According to the report, this was the normal procedure, yet the message was not delivered.</P>
    <P>Members now inquire why the Attorney General did not do something about it.  He must be a mighty man if he can deal with various legal problems while chasing down officials in the Department to inform them that they should have dealt with this matter.  It is an absurd situation and it is grossly unfair to the Attorney General that this type of thing is permitted to happen.</P>
    <P>I do not defend gross inefficiency or a situation where three out of five people, two of whom claimed that the documentation was marked &ldquo;for information only&rdquo;, could fail miserably to deliver a message.  I hope the Minister will not defend <Col N="1604" /> such behaviour.  I am becoming tired hearing the Opposition stating that the Minister will scapegoat civil servants and hang them out to dry. Is it not time people suffered some consequences if they fail to do their jobs?  I am not seeking their heads on a plate, but if there is no reaction it will be totally unfair to the thousands of civil servants who do an excellent job.  If it seems that slipshod methods and gross inefficiency are acceptable, why should they continue to give the kind of service they provide?  I have no hang-ups about scapegoating civil servants because I do not accept that phrase.  People who are unable to do a job that is a fundamental part of any Administration should be asked to do one of which they are capable.  We would set a bad example if we were to state that no harm was done in this case.</P>
    <P>The issue of seeking the Minister's resignation has been an ongoing theme in this House in recent days.  It is backed up by one well paid journalist writing for the <i>Sunday Independent</i> whose article in last Sunday's newspaper carried a headline that four of the ten Labour representatives in Government want the Minister for Justice to resign.  Six want her to stay but the headline was that four want her to resign.  I would be extremely satisfied if, in the run up to an election, I had 60 per cent backing for my performance.  The Minister for Justice is also extremely satisfied that 60 per cent of the Labour representatives want her to stay.  If a poll carried out on the sale of Sunday newspapers revealed that the <i>Sunday Independent</i> had a 60 per cent readership, the headline would not be that four out of ten readers do not read that publication; it would be that six out of ten people read it and that is as it should be.  It shows a certain bias in the attitude of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> to print a headline to the effect that four of the ten Labour representatives in Government want the Minister for Justice to resign.  However, I suppose fair play is not always prevalent when certain issues are discussed.</P>
    <P>Calls for the Minister's resignation ring hollow in view of the fact outlined by the Taoiseach and others, that there were three major slip ups in the Department of Justice in the appointment of judges in the past.  However, there were no resignations in those instances.  Now, when five people down the line in the Department failed to deliver the goods, there are daily cries for the resignation of the Minister, which is absurd.  If this type of logic were applied in all cases, Ministers would have to take the rap, when things went wrong, for any civil servants who failed to do their jobs.  This would be bad for democracy.</P>
    <P>The 1924 Act is out of touch with reality because there are huge numbers of staff under the care of Ministers.  Mistakes could be made through carelessness or made deliberately, which would be worse, and Ministers could be asked to resign each day because officials down the line made mistakes.  The Act was suited to the period in which it was framed, when staff numbers were <Col N="1605" /> smaller, business was less involved and it was easier to keep in touch with events.  However, at present, it is not possible for any Minister to exercise complete control.</P>
    <P>I hope common sense will be used to update the 1924 Act and if a Minister makes a mistake, politically or otherwise, and it is quite clear he or she did so, then he or she should resign.  This should hold for any Minister, from any party, in any Government.  The buck stops with the Minister once he or she is directly responsible for what happened.  However, I do not accept that a mistake made by a civil servant down the line should cause a Minister's resignation.</P>

      <P>A misrepresentation has come consistently from the Government benches to the effect that there was no involvement of the Minister for Justice in respect of the correspondence relating to the delisting of Judge Lynch, which has caused the composition of the Special Criminal Court to be brought into question and why some of the most serious crimes with which people have been charged are the subject of conditional orders of habeas corpus. Deputies on the Government side of the House are misrepresenting a report they are praising. They should not praise the authors of this report and misrepresent its contents.</P>
      <P>In the time available I will deal with the four matters of correspondence which prove beyond doubt that the Minister was involved and that her inability to take action based on correspondence addressed to her, for which she is responsible, means she must resign, as was stated in today's newspaper editorials.  What was stated about 30 year old baking factories in <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial does a great injustice to such factories because they operate far better than anything I have witnessed under the stewardship of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne seems to suggest these events happened &ldquo;down the line&rdquo;.  According to the report, Judge Lynch submitted a letter to the Minister on 2 July which she did not see because, since she entered office, she has not laid down ground rules about correspondence she receives from other Ministers or members of the judiciary who come under her Department's remit.  The letter was sent to the courts division on 4 July where the principal officer was on leave.  The assistant principal asked the acting higher executive officer to establish the procedure for implementing this request from Judge Lynch, which the acting HEO did.  The AP then asked the HEO to draw up a letter of acknowledgement and prepare a memorandum for Government to arrange for the delisting of Judge Lynch and the retirement of Judge Buchanan.  That was to be <Col N="1606" /> done by 7 October, the day on which proceedings of the Special Criminal Court resumed following the holidays.</P>
    <P>The acting HEO prepared that documentation and delivered it to the assistant principal on 12 July who then went on annual leave from 17 July to 13 August.  The report states the Minister saw the letter of acknowledgement regarding Judge Lynch's request to be delisted on 14 July.  Rather than signing the acknowledgement &mdash; the letter from Judge Lynch was addressed to her &mdash; she asked for previous papers and sent it back down the line.  Deputy Browne's suggestion that the Minister had no involvement with the first letter is incorrect because the report states otherwise. She did not send out the letter of acknowledgement and Judge Lynch was given no indication that his request had been received, despite the fact that the Minister had been asked to sign it.  Nothing happened because the Minister sent the matter back down the line.</P>
    <P>Two weeks later she said she wanted to put the delisting of Judge Lynch on the Government agenda.  The principal officer had returned from annual leave and the assistant principal went on annual leave on 17 July.  A memo was prepared by the assistant principal in the District Court's office and on 1 August we got a decision.  That was not got by an assistant principal or principal officer because they do not have the power to get such decisions.  It was got by the Minister for Justice and, therefore, it was her responsibility to ensure the decision was carried through.  She owed that to her colleagues at the Cabinet table. If the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications gets agreement at Cabinet to rearrange the semi-State sector or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry gets agreement to change the headage scheme &mdash; which may happen in a few months' time &mdash; it is his responsibility to carry through that decision and everyone at the Cabinet table expects him to do that.  That is the way the system works.  The Minister knew about this matter since 14 July when Judge Lynch's request was acknowledged. She knew of the request to delist, asked for the memo to be prepared, brought it before Government and got a decision.  Those are the conclusions of the report.  She is politically responsible for not ensuring the decision was carried through.</P>
    <P>Two months after the Minister got that decision on 1 August the Attorney General wrote to her.  His letter of 2 October was sent to the private secretary, an experienced official in whom everybody has confidence.  He said he did not show her the letter because she might ask him about the position on the matter.  Basically, what he said was that the Minister wanted to have the problem dealt with before she even knew one existed and, based on the new <i>modus operandi</i> in the Department since she took office, the letter from the Attorney General, her Cabinet colleague, was sent down the line.  The Minister is trying to defend herself on the basis that she is <Col N="1607" /> not accountable if she does not see correspondence while at the same time she has introduced a system which does not allow her see correspondence.  She has introduced a system to ensure she is not accountable; she does not want to know about such matters.  There is no indication in the report that since she took office she has given a direction that she should receive correspondence from her colleagues.</P>
    <P>On 14 July the Minister saw the acknowledgement to the letter of 1 July which, obviously, told her of the existence of such a letter.  She did not see the letter from the Attorney General dated 2 October.  The private secretary did not show it to her because he knew what her reaction would be.  The letter of 10 October marked &ldquo;personal&rdquo; from Judge Lynch is very interesting.  It was discovered on the files in the courts division, but nobody knows how it got there.  It was sent to the Minister's constituency office and opened by her personal assistant.  She said she did not show it to the Minister because it was not on court headed paper.  That letter was also dealt with down the line.  Nobody in the Department of Justice, in the Minister's private office or in the courts division acknowledged receiving that letter.  The only established fact is that the letter was sent to the Minister's constituency office.  Nobody knows how it got onto the file.  It is strange how a letter could go from her office to a file and she knows nothing about it.  Her personal assistant sent it to the private secretary's office but nobody there, or in the courts division, knows anything about it.  That does not add up.  The Minister is trying to continue the myth that she did not see correspondence on the Judge Lynch case, but that has been proved untrue in the report.</P>
    <P>The Minister admits that she saw the reminder letter from the Attorney General dated 1 November, but is not prepared to publish it.  Why is she not prepared to publish it?  We want to know the severity of the tone in which the Attorney General told the Minister that he wrote to her on 2 October but did not hear from her in return.  The suggestion from the Government benches that this matter was dealt with down the line and not seen by the Minister is untrue and the report proves it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always need for reform in an organisation.  In the case of the Civil Service, reform has often taken the form of cutting expenditure by reducing staff numbers.  This is politically popular and there are no short-term adverse effects on the system.  It is only in the long-term, as we are now witnessing, that the shortcomings of such a policy are felt.  The obsession with keeping numbers in the Civil Service down and being seen to control expenditure is being exposed for its inherent weakness and short-sightedness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the findings of the Minister's inquiry that there is an immediate need for changes in <Col N="1608" /> organisation and work practices in the Department of Justice.  That is common case, but we did not need an inquiry to tell us that.  In my short time as Minister of State in that Department some years ago, I saw things that raised my eyebrows.  It did not come as a great shock to me that the Department of Justice was examined by two eminent people.  The report contains much food for thought.  It was relatively well put together but the time allocated for its publication was not sufficient.  I also accept that additional resources are needed to strengthen the organisation of the Department of Justice and recognise that the present management structure is seriously overloaded.  That is another message in the report.</P>
    <P>I am sure a broad ranging review of the organisation and management in all Government Departments is already under way.  It would be the inescapable conclusion of any such review that a task is impossible to achieve in the absence of proper resources.  That is the gist of the findings and recommendations of the inquiry the Minister for Justice was forced to set up in an effort to save her skin.  She is determined to brazen out the public filleting and dissection of her Department and is not prepared to take political responsibility for mismanaging her brief. That was the kernel of Deputy Browne's input to the debate.  He blamed everybody but the Minister.  I understand that under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, final responsibility lies with the Minister and that any problems that arise in a Department should be dealt with by the relevant Minister.  The administration is wheeled out into the public domain to take the blame for the Minister's responsibilities.  We might even be prepared privately to understand that the Minister was ignorant of the pressures on her staff, if we did not know better.  The Minister was apprised of this by her officials, their staff associations, the Garda and the prison service. Numerous studies of the Garda Siochána, courts and prison services were brought to her attention and she did nothing about them.</P>
    <P>The nation has been treated to a bumper dose of political hypocrisy since this scandal broke.  In the first instance, the Minister of Justice was exposed as being an absentee manager of her Department.  When she finally came to appreciate the gravity of the situation, what did she do?  She set up an inquiry to exonerate herself and point the finger at the system, at the personnel, at someone else &mdash; at anyone else.</P>
    <P>Did she point the finger at some of her Cabinet colleagues?  They denied her and her Department the resources necessary to do their job properly. I listened in amazement to the Minister for Finance as he laid the blame for this incident at the feet of civil servants in the Department of Justice and called for heads to roll.  Where have we heard this before?  It is the height of political hypocrisy for the Minister for Finance to blame the officials of the Department of Justice for errors caused in the main by lack of resources, <Col N="1609" /> when it is his Department which is directly and principally responsible for withholding these resources in the first instance.  What about the Minister's Cabinet colleagues in the Departments of Health, Social Welfare and Education?  How much of the money needed by the Department of Justice did they snatch away, only to have to give it back indirectly as the sorry year wore on?</P>
    <P>When the Cabinet discussed the departmental Estimates for the current year the Minister for Justice was unable to make a convincing case in support of her Department's budgetary requirements.  Other more vociferous and persuasive Cabinet members managed to siphon off for their Departments funds which were needed by the Department of Justice.  Either that or it was decided by Cabinet that the Department of Justice could do without the money.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice would like to share her recollections of the Cabinet's deliberations on her Department's Estimate.  I suppose that she would prefer not to.  It must have been an unhappy Minister for Justice who bore the bad budgetary news to her officials in the Department.  Little was she to know that fate was soon to conspire to expose the folly of her Cabinet colleagues' political cynicism.  The plot soon thickened.</P>
    <P>The initial embarrassment arose when the prison construction programme was stopped. Lack of money was the reason.  That soon changed and we witnessed the first of many climbdowns by the Minister.  The public outcry which followed the exposure of this insane decision drove the Minister back to Cabinet and the heat of the political fire melted the hearts of her Cabinet colleagues on her plight.  She got more money and the prison programme was reinstated.  The money which did not exist was miraculously located and the Minister claimed a victory.</P>
    <P>The next serious blow to the Cabinet's plans for a 1997 budget giveaway arose in the aftermath of the murder of Veronica Guerin.  This murder, which took place in broad daylight and in the middle of one of the busiest roads in the country, was shocking and obscene.  It followed a series of so-called gangland contract killings involving known members of the criminal community and highlighted increasing and apparent willingness on the part of the criminal community to kill with impunity in the belief that they were immune from detection as a consequence of the restrictions on the Garda and the courts systems by lack of resources.  The spotlight once more landed on the Minister for Justice and she trudged wearily back to Cabinet and got more money.  The Minister again claimed credit for her positive steps towards tackling crime.</P>
    <P>We saw more judges, more resources for the Garda and unlimited overtime for the investigation of serious crime.  By now, the public at large were alert to a major crime wave involving drugs, armed robbery and murder.  The crime barons were laughing openly at the forces of law and order and the foundations of the <Col N="1610" /> justice system were being challenged by the criminals.  The prisons were bursting at the seams, the courts were unable to deal either speedily or effectively with the criminal cases which were multiplying daily and the Minister was happy to deal with the problems only as the public exposure of their gravity and their extent demanded.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that the Minister's Cabinet colleagues were heartily sick and tired of the regular money transfusions that the justice system required in order to keep the Minister afloat.  All their best laid plans for a bonanza budget in 1997 were being scuppered by the Minister for Justice and her pesky Department and there appeared to be no end to the problems.  Perhaps they ought to have thought of that when they contrived to starve the Department of Justice of resources in the first instance.  Had the Cabinet allocated proper funding for the Department some of the problems we are now witnessing might not have arisen.</P>
    <P>The Minister failed to apprehend the crisis in her Department.  She cannot deny that she was aware of the crisis which existed in at least two areas, the courts and the prisons.  The report of inquiry said as much in citing the information already available to the Minister in the Denham Commission report on the reorganisation of the courts and the prisons strategy document.  The Minister was prepared to plough along and contemplate no action which involved the allocation of additional resources to her Department unless she had no other option.  It can be appreciated that this Government of openness, accountability and transparency is unlikely to verify the version of events which I have outlined.  We know the extent of this Government's reluctance to be accountable for the individual and collective actions of its members.  The pane of glass through which the Taoiseach invited us all to regard the behaviour of his Government is caked with dirt and grime of its own making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It has become the standard practice for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to try and make the arrangements for Dáil debate the central matter of controversy when they find that there is no real political mileage to be gained from pursuing the substance of the issue on which they have demanded the debate in the first place.  This is why we have been treated over the past two days to the burlesque performance of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats as Deputy Harney stepped out and Deputy Bertie Ahern stepped in again in a parliamentary Lanigan's Ball.  Judged on their <Col N="1611" /> in/out performance here, will we see Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats posters at the next election bearing only a slight variation of the old Sinn Féin poster seen in the &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; film &mdash;&ldquo;put us in to get us out&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The Government has been more than generous in allocating Dáil time for debate and questions on the circumstances arising from the delisting of Judge Lynch from the Special Criminal Court panel.  When the matter first came to Government's attention, the Minister for Justice immediately came into the House, gave the facts available to her and answered all the questions she could.  When the Opposition parties sought to pursue the matter further through a motion of no confidence, the Government confronted it by providing a two day debate on the issues involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister made it clear from the beginning that once the inquiry had completed its work, time would be provided for a debate and that she would come into the Dáil to answer Opposition questions.  The report on the inquiry was received by the Minister on Monday night, brought to Government on Tuesday evening and published later that night.  The Government made arrangements for a debate ranging over two days culminating in an hour's questions to the Minister.  When this did not prove satisfactory the Opposition was offered another hour for questions and a further days sitting on Friday, but these offers were declined.  The complaints about the organisation of this debate are totally unreal and utterly without foundation.</P>
      <P>The Cromien and Molloy report is a seminal commentary on the need for public service reform.  The single most regrettable feature of this debate is that, without exception, Opposition contributions have failed to acknowledge the significance of this document in the context of public service reform.</P>
      <P>In the first page of the report the summary states:</P>
      <P>The Inquiry addressed the sequence of events which led to the failure to communicate the Government's decision to Judge Lynch.</P>
      <P>The inquiry team continues:</P>
      <P>The results of our efforts to follow the &ldquo;paper trail&rdquo; came to an unsatisfactory dead-end at crucial points, with key individuals unable to recollect important details, or failing to recognise the seriousness of vital correspondences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt by the members of the inquiry to follow the sequence of events from the very beginning does not reflect well on a key Department of the State.  Three copies of the Government decision were forwarded to three named officers.  One was on holiday, another was new to the job and was &ldquo;unaware of what procedure, if any, the Courts Division needed to follow in relation to the decision&rdquo; and the third <Col N="1612" /> officer to whom the decision was communicated was a temporary draftee into the division to carry out a specific function and also had additional duties to attend to elsewhere in the Department.</P>
    <P>The inquiry team could not discover who the junior officer was who had been given the job of processing the decision.  They conclude that any instructions given were not followed up and observe &ldquo;in this unsatisfactory way the trail, in relation to the Government Decision ran into the sand.  No action was taken on it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The inquiry team further takes the view &ldquo;that the human error in this case cannot be explained away entirely as being due to the organisational, management and systems weaknesses.&rdquo;  It concludes that &ldquo;the same urgency demonstrated recently with new initiatives in the Justice domain needs to be applied to reforming the Department of Justice itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Allowing for the imperfections of human memory, holiday disruption and so on, the reality is that Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy, in carrying out their duties and investigation, were met with blank stares, blank memories and silence. However, they proceeded with their investigations and their conclusions' in less than 22 pages, are a seminal commentary on the need for public service reform.</P>
    <P>Their story is one of a Department which had virtually no management ethos, in which management processes were &ldquo;very weak&rdquo;, in which inexperienced staff were simply thrown into the deep end and left to sink or swim, in which organisational structures were inappropriate, its computer system is creaking with overload, it does not even have a librarian, its workload has grown enormously and its EU Presidency duties stretched the system almost to breaking point.  That is the conclusion reached by two people, described by Deputy Andrews as eminent, after less than two weeks examining the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Bertie Ahern thought the report was rushed, inadequate and unfinished and today he thought it was a very good one, but regretted that the inquiry could not be carried out by the Minister.  It is not difficult to imagine what Deputy Ahern would have said if the Minister compiled the report.  In any event, he misses the point.  The nub of the report is on page 15, if Deputies opposite wish to look it up.  Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy conclude there that, &ldquo;any fair apportioning of blame would have to advert to not just present incumbents in all key positions but also to missed opportunities and failure to initiate change in the past.&rdquo;  Nothing could be clearer than that finding.  I have heard Members, particularly Deputy Cowen, explicitly explain that the systems and procedures in the Department of Justice under the Minister are somehow different from those that were in place under previous Ministers.  That is not true and Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy found in this report that these systems have applied in the past. Those responsible for missed opportunities, for <Col N="1613" /> the failure to initiate change in the past now rightly sit on the Opposition benches and long may they remain there.</P>
    <P>From what we know of the workings of the Department of Justice as a result of the Cromien-Molloy inquiry into the failure to delist Judge Dominic Lynch, this was a disaster waiting to happen.  The procedures &mdash; or more accurately the lack of them &mdash; for delisting a judge of the Special Criminal Court were exactly the same as those under every Minister for Justice dating back to when Deputy O'Malley held that position in the early 1970s.  Opposition Deputies have asked why the Minister for Justice did not ensure that proper procedures were in place for delisting a judge of the Special Criminal Court.  One might as well ask why Deputy O'Malley did not ensure proper procedures were put in place when he established the Special Criminal Court in the first place.</P>
    <P>Generally, the Civil Service has served the State conscientiously and well.  However, there is no escaping the picture painted in the report. Even allowing for the undisputed huge increase in the workload of the Department of Justice arising from Northern Ireland matters the picture the Cromien-Molloy report paints in regard to this matter is one of mismanagement, failure of authority, evasion of responsibility, paper shuffling and buck passing.  The major systems failures identified by the report are almost certainly not confined to the Department of Justice, but because of the particularly important and sensitive work undertaken by that Department in regard to security and crime matters, the consequences of a systems failure could be particularly serious.  The package of measures agreed by the Government and announced by the Minister for Justice in the House yesterday, providing for immediate, medium and long-term action will, in so far as is humanly possible, ensure that such a systems failure is unlikely to happen again.</P>
    <P>I will comment on the performance &mdash; and I use that word advisedly &mdash; of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn posing as shop steward for staff in the Department of Justice.  I hope the staff in that Department are as impressed as I am.  I know the Deputy is supposed to have a certain flair for fiction, although I cannot personally testify to that because the Cumann members bought up all the copies of her book, but her romanticising of the Civil Service is disingenuous and opportunistic.</P>

The issue is not the calibre of the <Col N="1614" /> people in the Civil Service, it is the matter of public service reform, an issue to which every Government has paid lip service and on which none has acted since the Devlin report was published in 1969.  The report by Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy will have made a major contribution to the quality of public administration here, if it succeeds in bringing that issue of public service reform back to the forefront of the political agenda.</P>

He also said the mystery letter was seen by the Minister.  That is an untruth.  It was not.  Deputy Andrews said his view of public service reform is that he wants more numbers in the Civil Service.  I wonder what Deputy McCreevy will say when he hears that. Deputy Martin is so anxious to impress that he has only one speed.  His head must have a button like one on a video recorder that is permanently in fast forward.  No credence is given to the report or to the fact that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn conveniently ignores that one of the authors of it, Mr. Cromien, was the father of the Civil Service. Mr. Cromien would not dump on the Civil Service and nobody on these benches would dump on the Civil Service.  The issue is public service reform.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil's approach to this problem is an opportunistic attack on a Minister who, although she has been a little unlucky, has brought great commitment to her job.  Fianna Fáil's billboard advertisement says it will give crime a hard time.  It is a catchy slogan.  However, it might be suggested to Fianna Fáil that it gave crime an easy time in the eight years it was in Government.  During that period the crime problem worsened while Fianna Fáil governed in blissful ignorance of the extent of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not claim the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is the best Minister of all time.  However, she is as good a Minister as there can be until draconian measures are introduced to ensure law and order, the political element is taken out of the equation and the Garda Síochána is allowed more control.</P>
      <P>This affair has brought to light the inefficiency of the Department of Justice.  Similar inefficiencies may exist in other Departments. The Minister of State said the Civil Service, like every other organisation, has good, bad and indifferent elements.  Civil servants have made a large contribution to the State.  Nevertheless, they have privileges enjoyed by no other section of the community, in particular sheltered employment. Civil servants cannot lose their jobs.  Each of us puts his job on the line every few years and we can lose them.  However, civil servants have unbelievable privileges &mdash; sheltered employment and no accountability.</P>
      <P>The Government believes everything in the political domain should be open and transparent. A light should be shone on the individuals responsible for the appalling gaffe in this affair. The public service is in need of an overhaul. People may enter the service straight from school with no experience of the business world.  It would be to everybody's benefit if for a period of, say, two years they had to deal with business problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest farce is the career break whereby people with jobs for life may take a three year break from their job.  It should not be allowed. Those who want to take a career break do not <Col N="1616" /> have their minds on their jobs.  It must be difficult for them to take up their jobs when they return. I would question their commitment to their jobs in the first place.  The career break system is a weakness in the Civil Service.  It does not and could not work in the private sector because key personnel could not be allowed to leave their jobs for such a period.  Career breaks are not conducive to good business and the system should be examined as part of the badly needed reform of the public sector.</P>
    <P>Some good may come of this affair because it highlights the ineptitude of the public service. The report compiled by Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy is hard for anybody in public life to accept.  It must concern the Opposition as much as it concerns the Government.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy McGahon's reference to the career breaks system, I have found that those who take career breaks return to their jobs refreshed and often with added training or experience.  That has been my experience, particularly dealing with teachers.</P>
      <P>I thank Mr. Seán Cromien and Dr. Edmond Molloy for the comprehensive report they have compiled.  The report's summary states: &ldquo;The results of our efforts to follow the 'paper trail' came to an unsatisfactory dead-end at crucial points....&rdquo;  This is an important element and those points are expanded upon later in the report.  In the debate last week the Taoiseach and members of the Government made much play of Fianna Fáil being fixated on the events of 1994 and it was our only line of attack.  I reject that. We drew comparisons and pointed out the double standards between the events of that year and the current events.  I do not intend to dwell on that period.  I was not a Cabinet member at that time, although I was a Minister of State.  We felt betrayed and hurt by what happened.  I was not in the inner circle, so to speak, and many of the events did not involve me.</P>
      <P>As I said on many occasions, I deeply regret that the efforts of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds were truncated in such a cavalier fashion.  People on all sides trusted him, he had the good of Ireland at heart, he provided leadership, he brought about through sheer political will and self-motivation a dramatic change in the peace process, carried it through to meaningful talks and mapped out the path to peace.  However, he was sacrificed and no one knows what might have happened if he had been allowed to continue in office.  Apart from the fact that double standards are being applied, that is what I regret most about the events of 1994, not losing office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report throws up many questions which <Col N="1617" /> must be answered.  We need to see a copy of the second letter furnished to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, by the Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson.  We need the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice to answer the relevant questions to which Mr. Cromien and his colleague could not get answers despite their efforts.  We want a special judicial committee established to which the Attorney General and others can give answers.  It is clearly understood that the Attorney General, for whom the Taoiseach is politically responsible, cannot come to the House but there is a clear statement in the Programme for Government that people in high places should submit themselves to a committee of the House for questioning.  If there is nothing to hide, why will the Attorney General not appear before a committee of the House and why will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice not clarify all the unexplained matters?</P>
    <P>I have never had the honour to be Minister for Justice but before going into the manufacturing business my father was a civil servant in Revenue, based in Dublin Castle among other places.  He was moved on secondment by Sean Lemass to Athlone where he started General Textiles.  He always told us when growing up that the integrity of civil servants and the commitment and dedication of political people was a potent and powerful mix within Departments.  I have found this to be the case in every Department in which I have served &mdash; the Department of Education, the old Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Health for a limited period of ten weeks.  I have found that civil servants who have a strong sense of public duty respond quickly to political leadership and commitment.  The two must merge and fuse and each must know the parameters of each other's bailiwick.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is subject to the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  While no Minister can see every letter that crosses his or her desk &mdash; that would be a draft proposition &mdash; it should be clearly defined which letters should be brought to his or her attention.  The Minister for Justice is culpable for not putting such a regime in place within the Department of Justice.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn informed us this afternoon that she put a system in place to avoid errors.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the role played by the Attorney General.  When I spoke about this matter last week I suggested that a committee should be established before which the Attorney General could appear.  The Taoiseach indicated that, in contacting the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General was acting outside his role.  I do not agree.  Although he was aware of the seriousness of the matter, he failed to follow up this exchange of letters by making contact either by telephone or sending a fax.  He had many opportunities to speak to the Minister for Justice at Cabinet meetings or at the Northern talks.  Yet, <Col N="1618" /> he failed to act.  We are also led to believe that the Minister for Justice did not know and did not act.</P>
    <P>As I said last week, I will strongly resist attempts to &ldquo;dump on&rdquo; civil servants within the Department of Justice who are operating to standards which have not been set by the Minister for Justice.  I regret that the knives are being sharpened for hapless people.</P>
    <P>On the question of double standards, I wish to refer briefly to a matter which has exercised me for the past two days, the interview procedures adopted by an RTE subcommittee to select a new director general to replace Mr. Joe Barry who is to retire next April.  This is, arguably, the most important and influential post outside the political arena.  Yet, the interview board includes an ex-Taoiseach, Dr. Garret Fitzgerald.  This is highly unethical and amounts to a breach of public standards.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the board and others may say they have faith in the interview procedures and that a person is entitled to their politics but I do not agree that Dr. Garret Fitzgerald, who held the highest political office in the land and is steeped in politics, should be a member of the interview board.  This is the man who laid a trap for a presidential candidate in 1990 and masterminded the attack by the then Opposition spokesperson on Defence, Deputy McDaid.  It is disquieting and alarming that RTE has seen fit to include him on the selection board.</P>
    <P>Imagine the rí-rá and rúille-búille there would have been if Mr. Haughey, Deputy Reynolds or Mr. Lynch had been put on such a sub-committee &mdash; invective and rhetoric would have been heaped on Fianna Fáil.  Each person is entitled to his or her politics and to express openly his or her position, but not to the point of being a member of a sub-committee which will choose the next director general of RTE.  There is another political person on this board, a former MEP for Democratic Left, but I am assured that he is the SIPTU representative on the RTE board and on the sub-committee, therefore he is operating under another brief.</P>

      <P>It is only a short time since a new Government swept into office with the intention of changing the whole structure of society.  The outgoing Government was castigated <Col N="1619" /> for its loss of credibility.  However, the new Government was not long in office before it fell at every hurdle it tried to clear.  The first fall concerned the Minister, Deputy Lowry.  Since then, event followed event until we were hit with this crisis, yet the Government continues to brazen it out.  This is not about accountability, transparency or a pane of glass, it concerns downright bad and shameful management.  If the Minister for Justice had acted in business the way she acted in her office she would have been instantly dismissed, no employer would have kept her on the staff.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the way the most important court in the land has been treated.  The Minister did not even have the courtesy to phone Mr. Justice Lynch to thank him for his efforts and for patiently enduring such a difficult job.  That court deals with subversives who are a threat to our Constitution and our State.  When we were in Government, we heard much from the opposite side of the House about the threat to our country from those people.  Now, because of the <i>habeas corpus</i> rule in our courts, prisoners may be released because of the appalling mess which has arisen.</P>
      <P>We are told that the Department of Justice is overworked and overloaded but that is nonsense. A new Government Department was set up under the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  He has done a reasonably good job because establishing a new Department is a difficult task.  His Department has taken over many areas for which the Department of Justice was responsible, so its workload has been reduced.  The main areas which the Department of Justice now covers are the Garda Síochána and the courts and neither of those areas has been handled well.</P>
      <P>The area of petitions has become a disgrace. Deputies, legal people and others in public life write to the Department of Justice on behalf of clients and constituents who cannot pay fines for reasons of hardship.  No decision has been taken by the Minister.  The Opposition spokesman on Justice raised this matter in the House on numerous occasions and the last reply we received was from the Taoiseach, who said it could be handled without legislation.  Why is there a delay in dealing with petitioning?  It is causing frustration across the land.  The gardaí are up in arms, because they receive letters from people who petition cases and a decision is delayed.  We also receive such letters from the Minister, as do other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice, because of the way it is now handled, is becoming a lame duck.  The Minister for Justice is the weakest Minister in the Cabinet.  She is a member of the Collins family, who have been so influential in Irish life.  Her late granduncle, General Michael Collins, was a man of credibility, honesty and integrity who served this nation well.  He was on the opposite side of the House from members of my family but we all <Col N="1620" /> greatly admired him.  We also enjoyed the recent film.  If the Minister wants to protect the credibility of her family and its influence on Irish life, the honourable thing to do would be to leave her office voluntarily, because she has failed to run her Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie and Deputy Ring should be aware that members of Fine Gael are infuriated with its Deputies &mdash; they wonder where the party is going in this Government under the current leadership.  The terrible twins, Democratic Left and Labour, are like snakes in the grass.  When the Taoiseach is cutting the lawn, I hope he watches the snakes coming from under the hedge.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy O'Keeffe is leaving the House.  His remarks about the Minister for Justice were disgraceful.  The national Fine Gael organisation is proud &mdash; just as I, as a backbench Deputy, am proud &mdash; of the Minister's successes in the Department of Justice. The problem for Deputy O'Keeffe and other members of Fianna Fáil is that this debate has run out of steam.  There is nothing to discuss.  A serious mistake was made by officials in the Department but that is not the responsibility of the Minister.  She cannot be expected to open every letter and to act as postman.  The Department of Justice has the interests of the State at heart and over the years has had many successes.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke mentioned that Dr. Garret FitzGerald sits on the board of RTE.  Many Fine Gael supporters raised with me the position of Mr. Seán Duignan, who interviews the Minister, Deputy Owen and other Ministers on television. He is also a political person &mdash; he was with Deputy Reynolds when he was Taoiseach.  No one from Fine Gael criticised Mr. Duignan when he returned to political programmes on RTE, because he has a job to do.  It is wrong that the former Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald should be criticised for being on the RTE board.</P>

      <P>Today we should be fighting on behalf of our constituents or dealing with legislation.  At my clinic in Newport last week, I met people living on social welfare who had been fined up to £1,000 for small fishing offences.  We should be dealing with such issues today rather than talking about an issue which is past.  The people are fed up with it.  Fine Gael is proud of the job the Minister is doing.

      <P>Given that the Minister brought the memorandum to Government on 1 August 1996 and the Attorney General was present on that date, will the Minister advise the House why she did not ensure the Government decision was implemented?  In this context will she say why there was no conversation whatsoever between her and the Attorney General between 1 August 1996, when that fateful decision was made, and 1 November 1996 when the Attorney General sent the letter to her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On why I did not ensure that the decision of 1 August was implemented, I have already explained to the House that the procedure, which is clarified in the report, is that when a Government decision comes to my office it is copied and circulated to the Secretary of the Department and my programme manager for information.  It is then sent to the relevant section &mdash; in this case, the courts section &mdash; for implementation.  As I understand it, that procedure was in place before I came to the office, and it is a procedure that has worked for the other 80 or so Government decisions relevant to my Department this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On whether I speak to the Attorney General, <Col N="1622" /> yes I do, but I did not speak to him about this matter.  Deputies will be aware from the report and from statements I made in the House that I did not see the Attorney General's letter of 2 October, received in my Department on 3 October, but I did see his letter dated 1 November and received by me on 5 November, after which I took action.</P>

      <P>Given that we are talking about the composition of the Special Criminal Court, will the Minister accept that it is extraordinary to tell the House that there was no conversation whatsoever with the Attorney General regarding this matter between 1 August 1996 and 1 November 1996?  I would like the Minister to clear up a grave difficulty I have with this issue.  Will she say how the letter sent by Judge Dominic Lynch on 10 October 1996 arrived in her constituency office and miraculously appeared on the file in the courts division of the Department of Justice without anybody knowing how it got there?  Will the Minister advise on the course of events which led to that letter ending up in the courts division of her Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may consider it extraordinary that I did not have a conversation with the Attorney General on this matter, but that is so.  The Attorney General confirms that he did not have such a conversation with me and I ask the Deputy to accept my <i>bona fides</i> and the truth of what I am saying.  I hope the Deputy is not saying that he believes I am lying because that is not the case.</P>
      <P>On how the undated letter, which we now know was sent on the afternoon of 10 October, arrived in my constituency office in the Department of Justice and was not brought to my attention, the letter which was marked &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; went to my personal assistant who is responsible for opening such letters.  Those letters involve many issues relating to constituency or departmental matters which are not personal and they are sent to the relevant office for attention. In this instance the personal assistant recollects that she got the letter but she has no recollection of exactly when she got it.  It was a personal letter with the judge's home address on the top and I read that letter into the record of the House.  The personal assistant does not recall whom she gave the letter to.  I am sorry I do not know, nor was the inquiry able to find out, how it got from the private office to the file in the courts division.  I cannot get the answer to that question because nobody recalls putting the letter on the file.</P>

Did anybody in the Director of Public Prosecution's office attempt to alert the Department or the Attorney General's office to the problem prior to 6 November?  Was the Attorney General's office made aware of the <Col N="1623" /> problem during October?  I have given the Minister notice of these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell handed me those questions this morning and I will deal with them now.  On whether the Department was contacted by the registrar of the Special Criminal Court at any time prior to 6 November 1996 inquiring whether Judge Dominic Lynch was a member of the court, the answer is yes.  On 12 November I informed the House that on Tuesday evening, 5 November the registrar of the Special Criminal Court contacted a person in my Department, known as official J in the report.  I understand that the registrar asked whether Judge Lynch had retired from the Bench.  On who told the registrar of the Special Criminal Court about this, I understand that the registrar was alerted as a result of a conversation he had on the evening of 5 November &mdash; the evening he rang the Department &mdash; with a solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
      <P>On whether anybody in the DPP's office alerted the Attorney General of the matter, I believe not.  Since speaking last Thursday I have been able to confirm that a phone call was received some time after 4.30 p.m.  On Wednesday, 6 November by an official in my Department from an official in the DPP's officethat is referred to in the report.  Deputy O'Donnell gave me the name of a person in her letter this morning and I can confirm that it was that named person who rang official C in the courts section of my Department some time around 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 November.</P>

      <P>The Chair must be allowed to determine that matter.  The question in the name of the Deputy was allowed because I regarded it solely as a statistical question and that matters appertaining to policy should not therefore arise.

The question I posed to the Minister is statistical but the Chair has ruled that my supplementary questions expand too much on the original question.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Staff in the Prison Service have for decades been allowed the privilege at local level of exchanging shifts with colleagues, where authorised by the Governor, for reasons of domestic or personal commitments.  The practice of exchanging duty is a common informal feature of many employments.  It is not an unreasonable arrangement, given the demands of a prison officer's job and the need to balance family and work commitments.</P>
      <P>The only change to work practices in our prisons in this area in recent years took place in Limerick prison.  A Governor's Order was issued in 1993 with the objective of providing a framework for the operation of exchanging duties in that prison.  In mid-1994, it was established that a small number of officers, less than half a dozen, were able to manipulate the system in a manner in which the facility was not intended to operate, i.e. they were using the exchange for reasons for which it was not intended.  The specific circumstances of this abuse of the facility were not covered by the Governor's Order of 1993. While there has been no extra cost incurred by the prison service arising from such abuse, abuse of the spirit of the intended arrangement for exchanges of duty could not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a circular outlining standard procedures in relation to exchanges of duties for the prison service as a whole, the Governor felt he had no basis for withdrawing the privilege from the officers concerned and he recommended that such a circular be issued by the Department. This proved difficult from an industrial relations point of view.  A general circular was issued to all Governors in November 1994, but had to be withdrawn in the face of opposition from the Prison Officers' Association.  Indeed, industrial action was threatened.  In 1995 negotiations continued.  The POA felt it could not co-operate with certain proposed limits which the Department wished to include in a general circular.  In May 1996 a draft general circular was communicated to Governors to enable the issue to be considered further by them.  Discussions with Governors and the POA are continuing on the question of the issue of a general circular.</P>
      <P>Once I became aware of the matter in September 1996 at about the same time as Deputy O'Donnell's first letter of 6 September, I directed that this matter be dealt with without further delay.  A revised Governor's Order was issued last September in Limerick prison following detailed consultations with the local branch of the Prison Officers' Association who insisted on having time to consult their members. I am now assured the matter has been fully resolved and there cannot be a recurrence of the identified abuse.  I have asked the Governor to further review these individual cases to see if there are any grounds for taking disciplinary action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the situation to which Deputy O'Donnell refers arose in Limerick prison, my Department, as a precaution to prevent abuse in <Col N="1628" /> other prisons is drafting an appropriate circular to all Governors on the process of exchanging duties.  Consultations with staff interests regarding the content of this circular, continue to prove difficult because of perceived adverse effects on the general body of staff who avail of exchanges for legitimate purposes and in a manner in which the privilege was intended to operate.  The successful operation of the process of exchange of duties requires an appropriate level of local flexibility to allow the Governor the scope to deal with specific requests.  Equally, there must be consistency in the manner in which duties are exchanged.  The privilege of exchanging duties is long established in the Prison Service, as it is in other similar services, and any proposed changes in arrangements inevitably become an industrial relations matter.  I am determined, however, that a positive facility for staff will not and cannot be manipulated by a handful of people so that they can run businesses or engage in other employment during normal rostered times.  The POA has indicated it does not wish to see the exchange of duty facility being used as an alternative to job-sharing or career breaks.</P>
    <P>I am assured the specific problem in Limerick prison has been resolved satisfactorily with the agreement of the POA and with no adverse effect on officers who have availed of the facility for legitimate purposes within the spirit in which it is provided and intended to be used.  I made this quite clear to Deputy O'Donnell in my letter to her on 8 October 1996.  I have been informed the necessary administrative action has been taken to deal appropriately with those who were found to be in contravention of the spirit of this facility and, as I said earlier, if the Governor recommends disciplinary action, I can assure the House I will act on that recommendation.</P>
    <P>I have also made it clear to the Governor that I expect this facility to be fully monitored and will require regular reports on the numbers utilising this facility.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.  Will she confirm that the abuse of the privilege of exchanging shifts with colleagues involved prison officers being paid for work they did not do, that in some cases prison officers did not set foot inside of the jail for a long time but continued to be paid allowances for working unsocial hours, to get their full annual leave allocation, Saturday and Sunday allowances, night duty allowances, etc.?  Will the Minister confirm this practice had been going on for a long time?  For how long was anybody in the Department aware of this improper work practice?  Why was it allowed to continue, given there was knowledge of this matter since 1993 when a revised Governor's Order was issued to try to regularise the situation?  Was the Governor of Limerick prison aware of the abuses?  If so, why was it not until September of this year that improper practices were halted?</P>

      <P>For many years staff in the prison service have been allowed to exchange shifts with other staff.  People who were abusing this facility were paying somebody else to do their roster including, I assume, all the relevant allowances, and continuing to be paid as prison officers.  At least one or two people did not appear at their jobs for long periods.  That came to my attention in September of this year.  The staff in my Department knew, since mid-1994, that this facility was being abused, that officers were swapping shifts, were not doing other duties in exchange but paying somebody else to do their work while they did something else outside.  As soon as I became aware this was happening I ordered that it should not continue.  Through 1994 and 1995 negotiations have been going on to try to tighten up on abuses, but no action was taken to stop it until September this year.</P>

Did the Minister receive that letter, since I received no acknowledgement of it and had to send a reminder?  Why did nobody in the Department of Justice take action to stop this improper work practice, given that they knew about it?  How far up the hierarchy in the Department did this knowledge go?  Why was it not brought to the Minister's attention?  Does the Minister feel that senior officials in the prison section of her Department should have brought this abuse to her attention?  How can she justify the fact that no action was taken until an Opposition Deputy brought the matter to her attention?</P>

      <P>The privilege of exchanging rosters has been available to staff in the prison service for many years.  In October 1993 an order was issued with the objective of providing a framework for the operation of the facility, because the original circular did not envisage the ways in which the facility could be abused.  From mid-1994 onwards the Department tried to tighten up the regulation of the facility to prevent abuses, and the Prison Officers' Association, the Governors and the Department were in constant contact.  The POA did not want the facility removed, and did not want a general circular to the effect that only so many rosters could be exchanged.  There have been ongoing negotiations with the Prison Officers' Association.  I was out of the country when the Deputy's letter arrived, but I got it when I came back.  I suspect the source of my information was the same as the Deputy's.  The officials in my Department did everything they could to prevent abuses of this privilege.  It did not prove possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became aware of the abuses of this facility in Limerick I said I wanted it stopped immediately.  Those people were then informed they could no longer continue with that practice. The number of people involved seems to be between two and five.  I have to be careful <Col N="1630" /> because the disciplinary code is being implemented.  Clearly they were getting somebody else to do their work while running some kind of business or other activities outside the prison.  Subsequent to being told they could not continue to do that at least one, if not two, went on sick leave but one has returned.  I do not want to identify the particular officers.  Deputy O'Donnell, whose source of information was from the prison, probably knows who these people are.  This is a matter on which the Department was trying to tighten up.  It was also the responsibility of the governor to ensure it was not manipulated or abused.  It did not cost the State anything.  It should not have happened and it is not happening now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that, despite the fact that her Department, the governor of the prison concerned and the Prison Officers' Association were aware of this abuse over a period of years in particular cases, she was made aware of it only when I told her on 6 September 1996?  Will she agree that as Minister she should have been told this was going on because it is a matter over which she has political responsibility?  That there was no cost to the State is beside the point.  The point is that an abuse of work practices took place over a three year period which was not stopped and the Minister was not informed until she was made aware of it by my letter of 6 September.  Does the Minister feel she should have been informed?</P>

      <P>The circular that issued allowed people to swap their rosters.  In the spirit of that circular people swapped rosters.  When it became known in mid-1994 that people were swapping their rosters and doing so in a way that had not been envisaged in that circular the matter was taken up and tackled by the Department.  I do not know whether the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, was told about it in mid-1994.  That is a valid question.  All I know is that I became aware of the abuse.  I was aware that a system existed whereby people could swap the rosters but not that people had found this ingenious way of doing it.  I became aware of it at the same time as the arrival of the Deputy's letter and I thank her for raising the matter with me. The governor was contacted immediately and at the end of September a new order issued to the governor concerning this abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prison Officers' Association griped, held meetings, threatened votes and so on.  It did not want the facility to be knocked because of its abuse by three, four or five officers.  It was fighting to ensure the facility continued to exist for its members.  However I insisted that it be changed and that those who had abused it be alerted that they could no longer use the facility. The facility is still available for use by officers for the reasons for which it was set up in 1993.  An example of one of the reasons is the following: a prison officer told me that when his daughter was <Col N="1631" /> killed that facility allowed his colleagues to work his roster for him for a month so that he could remain at home with his family.  This is a facility which is available to the fire service, the Garda Síochána and private industry.  The truth is that officials in my Department were working on it all that time to tighten up on the abuses which have now stopped.</P>

      <P>The strength of the force on 31 October 1996, was 10,784 &mdash; not including 588 trainee gardaí in phases 1, 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>The anticipated number of retirements, resignations etc. over the next 12 months will be in the region of 400.  The policy of An Garda Síochána is to grant voluntary retirement to any qualified member requesting it.  Under the terms of Article 4 of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1925, members are entitled to retire on reaching 50 years of age provided they have completed 30 years of &ldquo;approved service&rdquo;, or 25 years of &ldquo;approved service&rdquo; in the case of those who applied for the 25 year pension arrangement.</P>
      <P>One of the main elements of the anti-crime measures which I announced in July of this year was the recruitment of a further 400 gardaí to the force over the period July 1996 to October 1997. This is in addition to the 350 gardaí already being recruited this year and another 350 planned for in 1997.  The anti-crime package also provided for the recruitment of an additional 200 civilians to the force, which will facilitate the release of an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties.  The current Garda recruitment competition covers the period 1994 to 1997.</P>

Will the Minister accept there is need for a greater recruitment drive than that proposed because of the considerable number of retirements in the pipeline?  How many gardaí are involved in administrative and clerical work? How many female gardaí are in the force?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers are as I have stated. At any time of any year Garda numbers are fluctuating.  I could probably choose dates to <Col N="1632" /> show that the numbers are far higher now than in a particular month when the Deputy's party was in Government and, equally, I could show they were lower.  The manner in which the Garda's work is being done is altering all the time.  Since 1992 there are 700 civilians working in the Garda Síochána and I have approval to hire another 200 civilians.  Every one civilian hired to do work done by a garda is almost the equivalent of getting an extra member into the force.  The automated finger printing service, which heretofore took 500 man-hours to identify finger prints, now takes ten minutes.  This has the effect of releasing gardaí for other duties.</P>
      <P>It is not just a case of adding extra bodies to the force, I am also taking steps to ensure that existing gardaí are more operationally effective.  I do not have the number of female gardaí in the force, but it is low in ratio terms.  In relation to whether I should speed up recruitment, the Government programme to hire an extra 400 gardaí commenced in July when we recruited an extra 75, in October an extra 75 and in January next we will recruit 75 more, in addition to the 87 who have been recruited.  We are expediting the recruitment programme.  The extra tranche of 400 have already started their training.</P>
      <P>The decisions made some years ago concerning pension conditions and also to allow gardaí to stay until reaching the age of 60 had an unusual effect in regard to retirements.  I will explain how that occurred.  In 1990 there were 160 retirements, in 1991, 183, in 1992, 133, in 1993, 369, in 1994, 472 and 1995, 446.  Retirements are now levelling out because of the effects of the extension of the age between 1989 and 1992, when people remained in service for the extra three years, all retiring together in 1995, resulting in a quirk in the system.  However, the House will see that over three years the average was approximately 160, beginning to level out and this year the number of retirements is fewer than recruitments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When one witnesses the success of the juvenile liaison programme, bearing in mind the numbers involved, will the Minister consider redeployment or recruitment geared especially for that purpose, particularly since in Donegal there are in excess of 44,000 under 18 years, with only three gardaí to deal with that area and in Limerick some 33,000 plus under 18 years catered for by one sergeant and one garda since juvenile liaison officers have told me that in the region of 90 per cent of those with whom they deal do not reoffend?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a note of what Deputy Keaveney said about the strength of the Garda force in Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo.  The deployment of the Garda Síochána is a matter for the Commissioner.  I do not telephone him and say I want X number of gardaí allocated to Donegal or Leitrim; it is for the Commissioner to deploy the force at his disposal in whatever manner he deems suitable.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that last year I regionalised senior management of the Garda Síochána by appointing assistant commissioners to deal with the different regions.  It was precisely on account of the type of question raised that deployment within a division, or a number of divisions, or redeployment, will be most beneficial when the relevant assistant commissioner will be in charge of a wider area than chief superintendents heretofore and can ascertain where best to deploy members of the force.</P>
      <P>The juvenile liaison officers are members of the Garda Síochána, there is no separate recruitment in their case, or any way in which I can advertise for a group of new juvenile liaison officers.  I agree it is an excellent service as approximately 80 per cent of those handled under it do not reoffend.  While I do not have the exact figure, in 1995 something in excess of 14,000 young people were brought to the attention of the juvenile liaison office.  I will pass the Deputy's comments to the assistant commissioner in that area to ascertain whether he can re-examine the deployment of the force available in addition to examining the programme itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The deployment of the Garda Síochána is the responsibility of the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>In the context of community policing in urban areas, the first community garda was appointed in the Loughlinstown-Ballybrack area of south County Dublin in November 1987 and there has been a gradual expansion of the scheme since then.  There are at present 220 gardaí and 26 sergeants attached to neighbourhood policing units.  The number of neighbourhood gardaí employed in each division is at the discretion of local management within the Garda Síochána and, of course, they must always be allowed the flexibility to make the best use of resources available to deal with priority demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 2,187 neighbourhood <Col N="1635" /> watch schemes which operate in urban areas, and these schemes encompass 354,500 households.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities consider that the community policing scheme in urban areas has proved to be a very successful way of putting gardaí in closer touch with the community they serve and of providing a more visible Garda presence locally.  Besides operating in the Dublin Metropolitan area the scheme has been further expanded to include other major centres such as Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Sligo, Dundalk and Mullingar.  The scheme of rural community policing was introduced in June, 1982 on a pilot basis in the districts of Thomastown, County Kilkenny and Claremorris, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>In 1989, following a review of the scheme by Garda management and officials of my Department, it was recommended that the initiative be extended and, in September, 1991 the scheme was extended to a further 12 districts.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner, following a further review in June, 1994, submitted a report to my Department outlining proposals for a further extension of the scheme.  These proposals are still the subject of discussions between my Department and the Garda authorities.  While I expect these discussions to be concluded in the near future it is, of course, vital that all aspects of such proposals are carefully examined and reviewed in the context of current demands being placed on the Garda Síochána.  I am particularly anxious to ensure that there will be sufficient consultation with local interest groups before any decision is made to extend the scheme.</P>

      <P>While thanking the Minister for her detailed reply will she agree that there is an alarming gulf between some communities and the Garda?  Does she agree that the development and resourcing of the community policing initiative would be a compelling way in which we might bring together members of the Garda Síochána and communities?  This is of crucial importance and would help to dispel the level of distrust which has, sadly and unfortunately, developed between the Garda and communities in certain areas they are intended to serve?  Will the Minister take cognisance of the points made and ensure that the Garda Commissioner is made fully aware of the feelings of this House on this very important matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I agree with the importance of ensuring a gulf does not develop between the Garda and communities.  In addition to community police, many gardaí are trained on how to deal with the youth in their areas.  This work is part and parcel of the work not only of community police but of gardaí in general.  This contact is achieved through structured and formal visits to schools under the schools programme and informal contacts through sporting organisations such as the GAA and soccer, tennis <Col N="1636" /> and badminton clubs, in which many gardaí are actively involved.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 gardaí have been trained in the Garda school programme which operates in approximately 2,800 schools and has recently been extended to cover gaelscoileanna.  The aim of the programme is to help children, with the support of their teachers, to develop behaviour which will keep them safe from accidents and crime.  The Garda Commissioner maintains this is a very important part of the work of the Garda Síochána and creates a positive image of the force among younger children who might be given a different impression of it by their older siblings. The programme is vital in helping to divert young people away from crime.  This is not easy work &mdash; it requires much time, energy and commitment &mdash; and the gardaí involved are doing an excellent job.  The availability of resources at local level should ensure that community police carry out the job for which they are trained.</P>

Members of the Garda working in the drugs area also visit schools and address public meetings and parents' groups. The programme operates in 2,800 primary and second level schools and has been extended recently to cover gaelscoileanna.  It is vital that the Minister for Education's programme on the dangers of drugs is extended to cover primary schools.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister encourage the setting up of a more formal local inter-agency structure, representative of the local community, the Garda and other relevant agencies, in areas with serious crime and drugs problems?

    <P>The group chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, recommended the setting up of 11 drug strategy teams, ten of which will be located in Dublin.

There will also be regional drug strategy teams, regional committees, which will be representative of the same groupings, for example the Garda and health boards.  The smaller local strategy teams will cover an area of 1,000 houses or less so that they can get to grips with drug treatment, crime and drug education.</P>

      <P>Regulation 4 of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Regulations, 1984, requires that prior to the commencement of work by any offender under a community service order on behalf of a body, the Probation and Welfare Service must be satisfied that the body is adequately insured against liability in respect of injury, loss or damage caused to or by the offender concerned in performing the work.  As the regulation stands, my Department is precluded from covering these insurance costs.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some organisations have had difficulty in obtaining insurance, and my Department has sought the advice of the Chief State Solicitor on this matter.  I will consider the matter again when I have received the Chief State Solicitor's advice.</P>

      <P>There is a lack of prison spaces, mainly because of the Government's failure to address the problem.  Many people who wish to avail of the scheme cannot do so and it would be prudent to include as many offenders as possible on it as this would help to free up the number of places available for real criminals.  Many owners of premises who take on these people cannot afford the extra insurance costs.  The Minister said she is precluded from doing anything about this because of the regulations.  It would be prudent to change the regulations so that the Department would meet any associated insurance costs.  Does the Minister intend changing the regulations?</P>

      <P>My Department and the probation and welfare service have received letters from local authorities and interested parties anxious to use people on the community service scheme. They have outlined the difficulties involved in doing this and I have raised the matter with the Chief State Solicitor.  I cannot give the Deputy a commitment that my Department will pay any associated insurance costs until I receive the Chief State Solicitor's advice.</P>
      <P>I agree that the scheme is a valuable one.  Last year 1,602 community service orders were made. One of the benefits of the scheme is that an offender on a community order costs £36 per week while it costs approximately £856 per week to keep an offender in custody.  Needless to say, I am as anxious as everyone else to see the system used.  There are conditions attached to the use of the system in the courts, for example, the offender must agree to it and the candidates must be suitable.  Last year the probation and welfare service held a seminar for members of the Judiciary on the benefits of the community service order scheme in an effort to encourage them to use it as often as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the cost of keeping an offender in jail and the cost of an offender on a community service order proves my argument.  The Minister said that 1,602 community service orders were served last year.  How many other offenders were deemed suitable for these orders and how many bodies were not in a position to take them on because of the insurance problems involved?  Apart from the 1,602, how many others would have qualified if places were available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy's question.  When the order is handed down, there must be a connection between it and the work to be carried out.  If there is no connection, I assume those involved must return to court and state that an order does not exist.  I do not have information as to how many potential orders might have been made had judges been satisfied there were places available.  I do not believe that forms part of the argument when a judge is making the decision because he or she must consider the conditions relating to a particular offence.  If it is decided that a community service order can be granted, I do not believe judges must be satisfied because it is the responsibility of the Probation and Welfare Service to find the community service to fulfil the necessary time requirements.  If it is possible to obtain that information, I will communicate it to Deputy Kenneally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this series of questions and answers not underline a more fundamental question with regard to whether we should be in the business of affording civil liability rights to people covered by community service orders on the same basis as ordinary employees or members of the public?  Have we not reached a foolish <Col N="1639" /> stage where, if two people on community service are shifting a plank and one of them drops it on the other's foot, the State, the organisers of the community service or the insurers are obliged to pick up the tab?  Since each person in respect of whom a community service order is made must agree to it as an alternative to a custodial sentence, surely we should consider this matter in a more radical way.  Should we not state that those who agree to be governed by the terms of a community service order themselves adopt the risk of injury on such a scheme unless there is gross negligence on someone else's part?  These people should not be compensated for injuries caused by the negligence of other community service order workers.</P>
      <P>We must face up to the issue of civil liability.  I am aware that this raises deeper questions but we have reached the stage where compensation madness has encouraged prisoners to sue the Department of Justice because they slipped and fell in jails.  Community service orders cannot now operate because those covered by them may sue the people who organised the alternative to their being put in prison.  This matter must be approached on a more fundamental basis than allowing insurance premia to cause problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mr. Owen Mr. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any responsibility for or information about the broader issues of civil liability, insurance, etc.  Very often those involved in arranging alternatives to custodial sentences are voluntary or charitable organisations or local community groups who want to repair a river bank or an old well.  They put themselves forward as being prepared to employ someone who is willing to do community service.  It would be wrong if insurance were not provided and such organisations or groups were obliged to pay for any injuries caused.</P>
      <P>The regulations state it is the responsibility of the voluntary organisation or the local authority who employ people on community service to provide insurance cover.  I was a councillor and I am aware of the difficulties involved for voluntary groups in obtaining public liability insurance cover, which has nothing to do with whether they employ offenders.  I have taken this matter up with the Chief State Solicitor's Office and I am awaiting its advice before I begin my consideration of the regulations.  As they stand, however, those regulations preclude my Department from picking up the tab or covering people's insurance costs.  The broader question raised by Deputy McDowell can probably be discussed on another occasion.</P>

      <P>On 19 June last in my answer to a question on this issue I clearly set out my thinking on this matter.  At that time I informed the House that it was my intention to consider the issue of the appointment of an independent inspector of prisons in the overall context of the review of the question of establishing a prisons board.  This is still my intention.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Government has decided to establish an independent board or agency to run the prison service on a day to day basis.  The Deputy will also be aware that a group of experts will examine the detailed issues involved in establishing this new structure.  I am asking the group to address the issue of an independent inspectorate of prisons.  Should an appointment of inspector of prisons be recommended I would expect his or her role to be spelt out.</P>
      <P>The expert group will be chaired by Mr. Dan McAuley, chairman of Gypsum Industries plc, and former chairman of the Labour Relations Commission.  The group will consist of, in addition to the chairman, two representatives from the Department of Justice, two from the Department of Finance, an official from the Attorney General's office and two other members from outside the Civil Service whose names I will announce later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  I put it to her that the appointment of an inspector of prisons is a desirable objective.  The inspector of mental hospitals, for example, has played a crucial role in keeping the state and operation of those hospitals to the fore.  It is necessary that the issue of prison accommodation is kept to the fore.  The best way to achieve this is to appoint an individual with powers of enforcement.  The inspector of prisons could make recommendations which would have considerable influence on the Minister of the day in order to ensure a more efficient, effective and modern prison system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour the establishment of an inspectorate for the prison system.  The programme for Government states that we will examine the establishment of an independent prisons agency.  I see the two as part of the same issue and it would have been foolish to appoint an inspector of prisons when I was also drawing up the memorandum to establish the prisons agency.  The two will work in tandem, which is the practical way to approach this matter.  I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue that the position of inspector of prisons is vital, alongside a new independent prisons agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prison service has been groaning because of the pressure placed on it in the past.  I inherited a groaning system and I hope that, before I leave office and someone assumes it following next year's general election, there will be an improved model to hand over to an inspector and an independent prison agency.  I believe the current <Col N="1641" /> building programme will help us to come to grips to the more serious problems in the prison system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If an inspector of prisons is appointed, I hope that he or she will be independent and that the notion of a visiting committee will not be abolished because it is important that the community receives some assurance regarding lay person involvement in setting standards in prisons.  These reforms will have no effect if simple procedures such as producing the annual report are not updated.  The fact that the 1993 report was published only recently is terribly demoralising.  If this House is supposed to be responsible to the community for the prison service and the conditions obtaining therein, how can it discharge that duty if Members must rely on a report about conditions in prisons which is three years out of date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the inspector, male or female, will be independent.  In asking the expert group to consider the idea of a prisons agency, I gave no instruction to abolish the visiting committee system.  However, I am sure the group will give the matter further consideration.  I hope it does not advise that the visiting committee system should be abolished.  Those committees act as a conduit for prisoners seeking advice and assistance.  I do not intend to abolish that system nor do I envisage the expert group making such a proposal in its examination of the concept of a prison agency.  Visiting committees are central to prisoners' rights, they do not assist the management of prisons.</P>
      <P>The annual visiting committee reports contain all statistics relevant to prisons.  On taking up office I discovered those reports were long out of date.  I said I wanted the 1993 report published immediately and the 1994 and 1995 reports published as fast as possible, even if that meant publishing other statistics for those years at a later stage.  Those reports are not published until all the relevant statistics have been compiled, and that can take a long time.  An up-to-date technology system is only coming on stream in the criminal justice system.  The speed with which statistics are gathered and compiled is far too slow at present.  I hope to be in a position to publish the 1994 and 1995 reports in a few months and we will publish the remainder of the material at a later date.  I agree with the Deputy that if information is three or four years out of date it is not relevant.</P>

The question of whether the inspector should publish annual reports and so on will be considered by the expert group.  When it publishes its report at the end of January, I will be able to answer the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the available information is as follows.  The statistics relating to murder are in respect of persons aged one year or more.</P>
      <P>From 1 January to 9 May 1995, 12 males and one female were murdered.  From 1 January to 9 May 1996, 12 males and nine females were murdered.  Information for the period 1 January to 9 May 1994 if not readily available.</P>

      <P>The figure for 1993 is somewhat lower than that contained in the annual Garda crime reports. The reason is that some cases classed originally as &ldquo;murder&rdquo; are subsequently classified under a different heading, e.g. manslaughter, on the basis of more complete information or as a result of court decisions in the meantime.  Similarly, it can be reasonably expected, in the light of previous experience, that a number of the 1994 and 1995 cases classed as murder will be subsequently reclassified under a different heading as those cases come to be examined by the law officers and dealt with by the courts.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister disturbed by the trend in recent years whereby an increasing number of females are being murdered?  Has she plans to combat murder generally?  Has she plans to reinstate the murder squad or a specialised squad, regardless of the name, to deal with the large number of murders?

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the increase in the number of women being murdered.  I can only speculate on whether the <Col N="1643" /> increase is indicative of a long-term change in society.  There is not an overall pattern to the murder of women.  Some are murdered by family members and others are caught unawares by other murderers.</P>
      <P>The increase in violence against women is disturbing.  In 1995 there was a 43 per cent increase in the number of sexual offences reported to the Garda.  It is not clear whether that figure represents a 43 per cent increase in the number of cases or whether it includes past cases which are now being reported because women are more able to cope.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the question of a murder squad on a number of occasions.  The murder squad was abolished, but many other specialist units have been set up.  A former Garda Commissioner felt it was necessary to introduce more appropriate structures to deal with a wider range of crimes and the current commissioner holds a similar view.  People deployed in the special crime unit and the domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit are trained in a multi-disciplinary manner to deal with murder investigations.  The murder squad was confined to dealing with murders.  The sexual assault unit is staffed by gardaí trained to deal with domestic violence which, by and large, affects women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the figures she has quoted are indicative of a society which is becoming more violent each year and that the time has come for an in-depth study into serious crime by an expert group?  Does she agree such an in-depth study should publish in a White Paper methods to address the underlying causes of the violence we have experienced in recent years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the number of murders indicates that people are resorting to violence to get what they want from others, or as an act of reprisal.  There is no doubt that we are witnessing an increase in violence on our television and in our day-to-day lives such as in the way people drive their vehicles.  Road rage was never talked about and now people are convicted because of it.  That is an indication of increased violence and the way some people will seek redress for a wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide remit would have to be given to a body set up to examine the increase in violence.  I can confirm to the Deputy that I am putting the finishing touches to a crime council and hope to establish it soon.  It is an opportunity to bring together the multi-disciplined forces in society so that they can look in a non-threatening way at all aspects of crime and then make policy recommendations.  Crime councils exist in other countries and we are looking at the experience of Denmark in particular.  However, when a move is made on one front, another element of society will say it cannot be done because it will affect them.  For example, when a move is made to <Col N="1644" /> establish a drug treatment centre in a district to tackle crimes carried out by people on drugs, another group in the society feels vulnerable. Unless this issue is examined in detail we will not get at the underlying causes.  I hope the crime council will be part of that study, but it will not be the complete picture as the views of sociologists and others may be required.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is not solely a question of murders in respect of women?  Disappearances, which may give rise to the inference that a murder has happened, also disturb the public and many people are worried that so many disappearances of women are not resolved.  There was a 45 per cent increase in sexual assaults on women in 1995. There are disappearances, an increasing murder rate and also the point has been reached where women are seen as easy targets for casual muggings and assaults virtually every day on our streets.  In almost every neighbourhood women are picked out for brutal robberies.  Does the Minister agree that a great deal has to happen with regard to sentencing and that the Judiciary has to get the message across to people that the more defenceless the victim, the longer the sentence?</P>

I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for the Judiciary to understand the changes in society in regard to increased violence against women.  That is something about which judges are aware.

What action will she be taking on violence against women?  An interdepartmental committee is meeting on this issue, another important initiative.  When will we hear from it?

A group from the then Council for the Status of Women approached me for funding to carry out this study and I agreed.  It was a frightening summary of the issues that women are confronting daily and the statistics on domestic violence and violence in general against women are terrifying.  I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that we need to take the issues raised in that report seriously.  Recommendations in it involve a number of Departments.  The Government showed its concern by setting up a group under the Chairmanship of Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, to ensure the issue was looked at in a wider context.  I understand that group is due to report in a matter of a month or two.  I hope at that stage action will be taken.  In the meantime, I am looking at some of the other recommendations such as separate counsel for rape victims and I have asked for advice on that issue.</P>

      <P>I have not had bilateral discussions with the Department of the Environment about the issue of cycle lanes etc.  The Garda Síochána's responsibility is to implement regulations under the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles Regulations 1963) &mdash; pedal cycles.  Those who contravene these regulations are liable on summary conviction in the case of the first offence to a fine not exceeding £150; in the case of a second, third or subsequent offence in any period of 12 months to a fine not exceeding £350 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment of three months or both.  I am not aware of anyone serving a prison sentence for not having lights on a bicycle.  I can imagine the outcry if people were sentenced to a term in a prison for such an offence.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,089 prosecutions were handled in 1995.  It is not as if the regulations are not being implemented.  Undoubtedly cyclists could do more.  Under the regulations cyclists must be equipped with, and show duly lit during lighting up time, a front and rear lamp and must also display a rear reflector.  We all know that does not happen, but we also know the gardaí examine and prosecute people or confiscate bicycles, for not having lights, in the course of their work. There would probably be an outcry if I told the gardaí they were not to do anything else for the next six months except prosecute cyclists who did not adhere to the regulations.</P>

      <P>In his letter of 2 October 1996 the Attorney General wrote to the Minister that in a recent conversation with Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny, who was reviewing the availability of judges for different work, Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny had indicated to the Attorney General that the impression among the Judiciary was that Judge Lynch was still on the Special Criminal Court.  Will the Minister enlighten the House as to when, prior to 2 October 1996 she had a conversation with the Attorney General about the delisting of Judge Dominic Lynch?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have any conversation with the Attorney General.  I have already made that clear.  I do not know what date the conversation between Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny and the Attorney General took place.  The Attorney General wrote that letter on 2 October and raised some queries about whether the notification had been sent.  The Deputy has a copy of the letter.  The Attorney General was clarifying that Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny did not know about the decision.  It would not have been appropriate to the role of Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny that he be informed about that decision. He was brought up to do a particular job in the Circuit Court.  I do not know when that conversation took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 2 October, my understanding is that the Attorney General did not have any knowledge about whether the decision had been <Col N="1648" /> implemented.  It was not his business to inquire about it.  He had a conversation with Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny and wrote that letter as a result of it so that he could inform Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the impression that Judge Lynch was &ldquo;still&rdquo; on the Special Criminal Court would indicate to any reasonable person a continuum of correspondence or of a conversation in that he referred to something that was continuing.  In that context, perhaps the Minister will advise the House whether she considers it would have been, at the very least, expedient of the Attorney General to move to act the moment he had that conversation with Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny, the date of which the Minister is entirely unsure.  In that context will the Minister also explain to the House why in a matter of such grave seriousness as this she did not ask the Attorney General subsequent to October, or even in the past week, when exactly he had a conversation with Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny regarding the improper composition of that most important court dealing with the most serious and sensitive of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Special Criminal Court was closed until 8 October.  The Attorney General wrote a letter stating he had a conversation and that the impression was still abroad that Judge Lynch was on the Special Criminal Court.  He said in the first paragraph that he thought a decision was made at the end of July but, as the Deputy is now aware, it was made on 1 August.  As far as I know from this letter, and I know for certain from the Attorney General, he was not aware that Judge Dominic Lynch had not been informed about his delisting from the Special Criminal Court.  The purpose of the letter was to seek to do no more than ask if that decision had been notified to Judge Dominic Lynch so that he could get back to his colleague, Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny, with whom he had that conversation, to tell him that Judge Dominic Lynch had been told and that he was available for the Circuit Court list.</P>

      <P>In respect of the answer the Minister gave to my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, before Question Time, is it the case that a member of the Chief State Solicitor's office, which is under the control of the Attorney General, notified the registrar of the Special Criminal Court of his suspicion that Judge Lynch was not properly sitting on that court and as a consequence the registrar contacted the Department?  Has the Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government, satisfied herself as to who in the Chief State Solicitor's office, which is under the control of the Attorney General's office, and in the Attorney General's office was aware prior to that conversation with the registrar of the Special Criminal Court, that Judge Lynch <Col N="1649" /> was functioning in that court after he had been delisted?</P>
      <P>The report presented to the House and the Government describes a situation which could be charitably called an administrative shambles.  It has been going on for years and its details must have been apparent to everybody in the Department of Justice.  How, without total hypocrisy, can the Secretary of the Department, whose job it is to ensure that the Department is run efficiently, bring disciplinary proceedings against those who failed to operate procedures in the shambles which it was the secretary's responsibility to ensure did not exist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Attorney General's office that nobody in the office knew that Judge Lynch had not been delisted.  By 5 November when the registrar rang my Department I had already received, earlier that day, the letter from the Attorney General which I had indicated to an official in my office. The next day the issue was being untangled.  The call on the evening of 5 November was subsequent to my call to the Department. Everything that happened after that was concerned with getting the prisoners involved released and rearrested.</P>
      <P>The registrar was told on Tuesday, 5 November that there was a question about Judge Lynch.  He rang my Department and an official took the call. The next day in the course of conversations it was clarified for him that Judge Lynch had not been properly informed about his delisting.  At that stage the system was being put in train.  All that went on during 6 November, leading up my being informed of the Attorney General's advice that the people involved would have to be released, is all part of the court case that will be coming up. At that stage the information was available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The report indicates there was human error and that those who made the errors should be confronted with them.  A disciplinary procedure is in place.  Nobody has actually been disciplined because the procedures are set out in regulations.  The complaint against the person must be prepared, after which the person has 14 days to reply and there are various other procedures which follow with which I am sure Deputies are familiar.  The Secretary of the Department is responsible and is taking responsibility for those procedures.</P>

      <P>With regard to the letter of 2 October 1996, if we accept that the Minister did not have a conversation with the Attorney General concerning this matter prior to 2 October 1996, will the Minister at least accept that the phraseology used in the second paragraph of the letter would indicate a continuum, at the very least, in the Attorney General's mind, of something that had been learned prior to the conversation with Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief State Solicitor's office is inextricably linked with the Attorney General's office.  Will the Minister tell us who told the solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office that Judge Dominic <Col N="1651" /> Lynch had been delisted from the Special Criminal Court by a Government decision of 1 August 1996?  We are entitled to that information.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, will the Minister tell us how exactly the letters from the Attorney General and the Judge Lynch were sent to her?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter of 2 October from the Attorney General indicates that there was an impression abroad that Judge Lynch was still on the Special Criminal Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It refers to the decision of 1 August and the Attorney General indicates that Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny had not heard about it &mdash; he is one of the people who make up the &ldquo;still abroad&rdquo; impression.  The Attorney General is doing no more than asking me if Judge Lynch had been notified.  The court had not sat in the meantime.  The Attorney General gives no indication or impression that he knows it for a fact.  He is asking if we can get rid of the impression that is still abroad by making sure the judge had been notified of his delisting.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Chief State Solicitor's office, I do not wish to name individuals.  On the evening of 5 November a solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office told the registrar that he thought Judge Lynch had retired, or words to that effect. The registrar rang my office with a query.  My Department was already aware there was a problem because I had already asked the question on the afternoon of 5 November.</P>
      <P>As to how the letters came to the Department, I can only assume they came by the postal service or by hand delivery.  The copy of the Attorney General's letter is date stamped 3 October.  It does not have the word &ldquo;personal&rdquo; on it so I assume the envelope did not have it either.  It arrived in the office, it was stamped and processed, as recorded in the report.  It was seen by my private secretary, by somebody in the personnel department and in the courts section. Action should have been taken there and the report makes it clear it was inexcusable that it did not solicit action when received on the file.</P>
      <P>With regard to the letter from Judge Lynch, I did not know it was sent on 10 October until informed by the judge.  I can only assume it came in by ordinary post.</P>

      <P>The acting assistant secretary in the courts division examined this issue on the Wednesday to find out what had gone wrong and whether people had been notified of the decision etc.  The Secretary of the Department was in Belfast with me on that day.  The acting assistant secretary in the courts division informed the assistant secretary in charge of personnel that a problem had arisen.  That person then rang the DPP's office for advice.  There was constant contact between the DPP's office and the Attorney General's office to see what action would have to be taken.  As the Deputy knows, this culminated in the decision later that evening to release the prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said there are gaps in my speech and in the report.  On my return from a Cabinet meeting my normal practice is to distribute Cabinet papers to my private secretary.  Files on matters which have been deferred are put in the safe until the following meeting.  Completed files are given to my private office.  Decisions are acted upon once conveyed by the Government secretariat.  This was the practice before I became Minister.  I now intend to change it.  The normal practice is that my private secretary attaches a <Col N="1654" /> note indicating the relevant people to be informed.  In this instance, they would have included the Secretary of the Department and my programme manager who would have received it for their information.</P>
    <P>As a general rule, I do not go through Government decisions with my programme manager.  About 80 decisions have been taken this year, all of which have been communicated in the same way by the Government secretariat. As those Deputies with Cabinet experience know, decisions are communicated once they have been properly recorded by the Cabinet secretary.</P>

      <P>I do not recollect having a conversation with my programme manager.  My normal practice is to give Cabinet papers to my private secretary who was on holiday on 1 and 2 August.  The Cabinet meeting was held on the afternoon of Thursday, 1 August.  The decision was communicated by the Cabinet secretary, probably on the Friday, and circulated without delay to the relevant section.  That was the procedure before I and my predecessor, I understand, became Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into a dispute with a former Minister who has only recently left that office.  I have checked and have been told that the procedure for receiving Cabinet decisions and circulating them is the same procedure that existed when the previous Minister was there, and perhaps other Ministers before that.  It worked in 79 of the 80 Government decisions.  It should have worked here.  It went to the relevant section, the people in that section knew it was a decision they had to implement but it was not implemented.  That is what the report has found.</P>

      <P>Somebody somewhere told a solicitor in the office of the Chief State Solicitor that there was a serious problem in the Special Criminal Court.  Again I ask the Minister to say who told that solicitor of the existence of the problem, whether that solicitor was interviewed by the inquiry and, if not, why not.  The Minister for Justice must answer these questions because <Col N="1655" /> they are material to this public investigation of a most serious matter.</P>

      <P>The inquiry was told to inquire into all relevant matters.  Its members interviewed the registrar, who said they had rung the Department for their own reasons.  Clearly they felt it was not necessary to put that into the report.  The details of all of Wednesday, when it was suddenly realised that there was a problem with this case, are, I believe, germane to the court cases, because all the people taking cases claim the State knew about this since 1 August.  All that material &mdash; if there is any material of interest from 6 November onwards &mdash; will obviously be part of a court case.  I do not know who told the solicitor in the office of the Chief State Solicitor and how soon before he was told.  My understanding is that he told the registrar in the late afternoon or early evening of Tuesday 5 November.  That is all I know about it.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that one of the Attorney General's functions is to ensure the enforcement of statutes?  Considering that the sitting of an invalidly constituted Special Criminal Court is in breach of the Offences Against the State Act, should the Attorney General not have taken swift and urgent action as soon as he became aware of that matter, some time on or before 2 October?  Did the Attorney General inform the Taoiseach of the existence of an invalidly constituted Special Criminal Court and its possible legal consequences and, if so, when?  Assuming he knew on 2 October or some date before that &mdash; his correspondence shows he knew the urgency, the importance and the dangers of this &mdash; when after 2 October did he inform the Taoiseach of that matter?</P>

      <P>I can only repeat that the letter written by the Attorney General on 2 October was not a letter telling me or my Department that Judge Lynch was sitting on the bench illegally.

      <P>His letter was no more than to ask whether that information had been transmitted. It was not a letter saying something, therefore there was no reason or need for him to ring.  He asked whether certain steps had been taken to inform a judge of his delisting.  Through the Secretary of my Department I informed the Taoiseach, who was in Cork when I first became aware, at about 10.15 on Wednesday evening, of the need to release these prisoners.  We immediately arranged that, as soon as the Taoiseach was available, he would be told about this.  I spoke to him at about 12.30 a.m. on Thursday morning.  The Taoiseach has already made this clear in the House in answer to other questions.  I explained the background to him and I was in touch with him constantly until about 3.30 a.m., at which stage I went to bed.</P>

      <P>I remind the Minister that her own report, the Cromien Molloy report, stated that this letter was of a nature which should have been recognised by everyone who dealt with it as being urgent and that must apply to the sender of the letter as much as the recipients.  I take it she is aware that the Attorney General is in charge of the office of the Chief State Solicitor.  Does she consider it satisfactory that an inquiry has taken place in this matter and no attempt has been made to interview a member of the staff of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, under the control of the Attorney General, as to how that person came to be of the view that the Special Criminal Court was improperly constituted?  Will the Minister explain how any satisfactory inquiry could proceed without addressing that fundamental question? One does not have to be Einstein to work out that it is vitally important to deciding who knew what, and when, and where responsibility lies in this matter.</P>

      <P>I do not know why the inquiry did not do as asked, I can only estimate.  The inquiry was trying to ascertain why, from 1 August, nothing had happened.  By the night of 5-6 November something was happening.  The inquiry went into great detail to try to find out why there were huge failures along the way, with many opportunities for staff in the courts section to deal with this matter and delist the judge.  It spells out where and why it thinks things went wrong.  That <Col N="1657" /> was the nature of what I wanted to find out so I could make sure this never happens again.  By 5-6 November the matter was known and the inquiry did its examination until then.  The members of the inquiry interviewed the registrar, who informed them he had rung the Department on 5 November.  I cannot say with certainty whether he informed them of the call he received from the office of the Chief State Solicitor but I think he probably did.  They clearly decided that was something they did not need to check.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is inquiring about the registrar informing my staff, arising from the question Deputy O'Donnell handed me this morning.  He received a call on Tuesday, 5 November.  I do not know whether other topics were discussed in that conversation.  He was made aware that there was a query about Judge Lynch. That is all I can assume because, having got that information, he then rang the Department of Justice.  I am making an assumption because for someone to tell him something he had to know it.</P>

The next day the registrar, in the course of various conversations &mdash; obviously phones were ringing all the following day &mdash; was informed that Judge Lynch had been delisted. That was on Wednesday.  The whole matter was being handled at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter as it unfolded was of such a serious nature that I informed the Taoiseach that I would ask for a full, open inquiry into the matter.  There were no procedures prior to that which anybody could take.  No resignations were sought from any of the staff in my Department before the inquiry and I cannot say whether any will be sought as a result of the inquiry.  As I made clear yesterday, the report states a number of times that there was human error and that where failures occurred the people involved should be confronted.  That is being done and those concerned will face the full <Col N="1658" /> rigours of the code of discipline.  I am not certain whether disciplinary action will be taken.

Will she advise the House why she did not ensure that that solicitor, who is clearly pivotal to the truth in this matter, was not interviewed in the Cromien inquiry, by her or by the Attorney General and was left to play a secondary role?  Will she confirm that she will publish the letter from the Attorney General of 1 November 1996?  It is clear that document is not privileged because we know the essence of the advice in it.  Can the Minister put up any credible reason that solicitor was excluded from all investigation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not indicate, direct or tell the inspectors who they could or could not interview. I did not carry out the interviews or compile the report.  I did not enter into the matter other than to make myself available to the two eminent people who carried out the inquiry.  They came to see me and indicated how they would do their work &mdash; that is essentially the conversation I had with them.  In their wisdom they interviewed 14 people, including the Attorney General, the registrar of the Special Criminal Court and myself.  It was up to them to assess the information they received from the officials.  They made the inquiries and outlined in the report where mistakes were made and why the decision was not enforced.</P>
      <P>The letter of 1 November &mdash; the Taoiseach already stated this &mdash; contains legal advice and since senior counsel retained by the State to deal with the <i>habeas corpus</i> applications has advised that privilege be claimed in respect of the letter, I am not in a position to make it public.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of anybody demanding or seeking resignations.  From the very beginning of this affair I felt a great deal of anger and regret about it.  Strong words were spoken in my Department in regard to how something like this could have happened.  Robust exchanges took place at Cabinet when we discussed the report on the day it became available.  It is inexcusable that these kinds of mistakes with such serious consequences could have been made.  The report stated, however, that people had to be confronted with any discipline that might arise from human error and their own failures, and that is precisely what I am doing. Although I am not saying anyone will be asked to resign there is no question of anybody being threatened or asked to resign before the codes of discipline are implemented in a fair and proper manner.  This has been an extremely difficult time for the staff in my Department, many of whom would have known almost immediately when the matter was brought to their attention that mistakes had been made and they would face examination by independent inspectors.  They would have had to suffer and deal with a great deal of pressure and stress in the past week, as I have; I am sure the Opposition spokespersons involved in this debate have been under enormous pressure also.</P>

      <P>Why would the Attorney General's letter of 1 November 1996, have contained advice if the Attorney General did not know that there was a serious problem in the Special Criminal Court, when one considers that he only had to pick up the telephone to find out if the position were otherwise?  I put it to the Minister that this indicates the Attorney General knew definitively on 1 November 1996, if not earlier, that there was a serious problem in the Special Criminal Court.  Since that is the position, and the Minister must accept it, does the Minister not feel let down by the Attorney General in that he did not play a more pro-active role after she had ignored his original inquiry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree it is essential to give those with physical disabilities every assistance so that they can fulfil their full <Col N="1664" /> potential.  The much awaited report from the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities refers in detail to the need to ensure equality for the disabled.</P>
      <P>The Disabled People of Clare have highlighted the needs of the centres for independent living and the group is pressing for the independent living fund to be declared a civil right for people with disabilities, as is the case with their counterparts in Sweden.  Many different regimes exist to help the disabled live an independent life and Germany, the United States, Denmark, France and Britain have taken a particular interest in this.  Ireland could use and perfect these models to improve our schemes.  The Centre for Independent Living wants a budget commitment for an independent living fund. Some people with disabilities may need up to three personal assistants.  This can mean that a substantial number of people could be taken off the dole while at the same time granting the disabled the much needed practical help that would make such a difference to their lives and society generally.</P>
      <P>The hours of work of a personal assistant can be long, and there is little incentive to take up such a position when a similar amount can be got on unemployment assistance.  There is, however, much need for the provision of personal assistants, and I hope the Minister will give some practical response to the House this evening.</P>
      <P>At present there is no health board training scheme for personal assistants.  A system of minimal training should be provided and financed.  A strategy for rolling back dependency must be implemented in the Mid-Western Health Board area.  All the other health boards have a personal assistance programme in place, but the Mid-Western Health Board seems to be left behind in this regard.  I would be very grateful if the Minister would elaborate on this point.  There should be a co-ordinated approach to people with disabilities combining the Departments of Health, Social Welfare, Environment and Transport and Communications.  Will the Minister undertake to initiate funding in the forthcoming budget for the personal assistance programme so that the Centre for Independent Living and all its branches throughout the country can begin to plan in the long-term for the future of those it represents.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a personal assistance service was first made here through INCARE, a two-year Horizon funded action research programme run by the Centre for Independent Living.  When INCARE ended in December 1994, the Minister for Health agreed to fund the continuation of this service, on a pilot basis, to the existing participants pending an examination by an advisory group of the whole question of future provision of personal assistance services.  In the <Col N="1665" /> past two years, other personal assistance services have been established and funded through a number of different schemes such as FÁS community employment schemes and Horizon backed programmes.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the provision of personal assistance services needs to be formalised.  An advisory group was established following completion of the INCARE programme to report to the Minister for Health on future policy of providing and developing a personal assistance service to enable persons with physical disabilities to live independently.  The advisory group agreed that the independent living model can offer a higher degree of social gain to individuals than the residential model.  However, it pointed to the high cost of providing this service and the equity of providing a high &ldquo;total independence&rdquo; service for a relatively small number of people against the benefits of providing other less costly supports to a far greater number of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The personal assistance service is one element of a much broader range of services required by people with disabilities.  These include home support services, day care, respite care, residential care, various forms of therapy, technical aids, income support, vocational training, employment support and funding of voluntary agencies which provide services.  The development and funding of a personal assistance service must, therefore, be considered in the context of the development of support services generally for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the provision of personal assistance services is being addressed by the Review Group on Services for People with a Physical and Sensory Disability as part of a review of the broader service needs of people with physical disabilities.  The review group's report is being finalised.  Following consideration of its recommendations and those of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the Minister will make a decision about the personal assistant scheme as part of the overall decision on the appropriate development of support services for people with disabilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to deal with the issue.  Recent newspaper reports that children are being placed in hospitals in Dublin because there are no suitable residential care places available for them are alarming.  There are no suitable foster care places available either, or at least not in sufficient numbers to meet the current need.  Children placed in hospitals are there for social reasons, not because they are ill.  They are placed in hospitals because of the failure of the Government to meet its responsibilities under the <Col N="1666" /> law for children who need emergency accommodation or emergency foster care accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, stipulates clearly that it shall be the function of the health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and attention. This has clearly not happened in recent cases.</P>
      <P>The weekend newspaper reports that three children in need of emergency care were allegedly placed in Cherry Orchard Hospital and while there contracted infectious illness is very disturbing.  The children concerned are all under ten years of age, and they contracted chickenpox while in the hospital which is an infectious diseases hospital.  They were brought there by social workers who had taken the children into care but could not find any proper residential or foster care for them.</P>
      <P>This is a disgraceful situation which raises serious questions.  It reflects a crisis and is probably only the tip of the iceberg.  Apparently it has been reported that five other children were in emergency care in Cherry Orchard Hospital for one week.  It is also suggested that in 1995 up to 50 children were placed in one hospital for social reasons, that is, because there were no emergency care places available.  In some cases it is suggested that children remained in hospitals, inappropriately placed, for up to five months.</P>
      <P>The situation has been described by the Assistant General Secretary of IMPACT, the trade union representing social workers, as a mess.  The Child Care Act, 1991, places responsibility on the Minister and through him the various health boards, in this case, the Eastern Health Board for the provision of adequate child care facilities, including the need to provide emergency accommodation for children out of home.  Social workers are being put under intolerable strain seeking emergency accommodation.  They are utilising most of their valuable time going from one place to another seeking emergency accommodation which is clearly not available.  They should be spending their time dealing with the factors that give rise to children coming into the care of the health board rather than trying to locate suitable accommodation for them.</P>
      <P>In the 1995 Child Care Action Plan, it was stated that children's residential care facilities were to be provided by the Eastern Health Board at Kilbarrack and in Dublin's north inner city. Has this happened and, if so, how many additional places have been provided because of the provision of those two facilities?  The board was also to recruit additional foster care parents. Has this happened and, if so, how many additional foster care parents are now available to the service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1996 plan which the Minister also announced in addressing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Family, he referred again to facilities of this kind being provided.  Is the Minister not referring to the same facilities on <Col N="1667" /> each occasion, because a problem continues to exist?</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that when a child comes into care it is usually as a result of a traumatic situation, and the last thing the child needs is to be shunted from one location to another in an effort to find suitable accommodation.  What these children need is proper accommodation and staff with the professional qualifications to meet the needs of vulnerable children when they come into the care of the health board.  They may have been abused, neglected or exposed to circumstances which lead to a traumatic situation.  They need every support they can get rather than to be placed in the care of social workers who are unable to find appropriate accommodation for them.</P>
    <P>I understand that 3,200 children are in care and that in the Eastern Health Board area there are 1,400 children in care, 1,000 of whom are in foster care.  Many of those in foster care do not have a social worker assigned to them to meet their needs and track their progress.  This is a serious matter and will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>We are informed by those working with children in the circumstances to which I have referred that serious situations will develop if we do not provide emergency accommodation for them.  I sincerely hope that will not happen and that the Minister will be able to inform us about providing the essential accommodation to meet the emergency needs of children who, for one reason or another, can no longer reside in their home settings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to inform the House of the position in relation to residential and foster care requirements for children in the Eastern Health Board area and I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, places a duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  Section 4 of the Act states:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to a health board that a child who resides or is found in its area requires care or protection that he is unlikely to receive unless he is taken into its care, it shall be the duty of the health board to take him into its care under this section.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where it is necessary for a health board to take a child into its care, on an emergency basis, immediate steps are taken to secure an appropriate residential or family placement for the child.  I recognise that occasions may arise where appropriate accommodation or care facilities are not immediately available to the board.  In these circumstances alternative arrangements must be made to ensure the safety of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time social admissions to hospitals are made by gardaí, health board <Col N="1668" /> personnel and others in situations where no other immediate options are available.  While the board recognises that such placements are not appropriate locations for taking children into care they are nevertheless suitable places of safety in an emergency.  The Eastern Health Board is grateful to the hospital authorities for their understanding and co-operation in responding to the crisis needs of children and families in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the issue raised this evening I assume the Deputy was referring to recent media reports which alleged that children had fallen sick with an infectious illness while placed in hospital as an emergency care arrangement by the Eastern Health Board.  I have had inquiries made with the board in relation to this report and the board has stated that children have not fallen ill with infection by virtue of the fact that they had been placed in hospital.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that at any one time the Eastern Health Board has in its care about 1,400 children, 1,000 of whom are in foster care.  The remaining number are in residential care.  While it still remains a reality that health boards cannot always provide an ideal placement in a crisis, significant progress has been made in the development of child care and family support services in recent years.</P>
    <P>Health boards have developed a range of services to meet the needs of children at risk. Since 1993 over £35 million has been provided to develop services under the Child Care Act, including family support and community services. A significant proportion of this amount has been used by all eight health boards to improve supports to existing foster families and to recruit additional foster families.  This policy reflects the increased importance of foster care within our overall child care services.</P>
    <P>I announced earlier this year an increase in the basic rate of allowance payable in respect of foster children aged 12 years and over.  This increase, effective from 1 March last, raised the basic allowance to £60 per child per week.  The total additional cost of this measure is in the region of £1 million per annum.  I consider this move to be a first phase in the provision of increased supports to foster parents and it is my intention to improve the level of allowances on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board recently held a fostering publicity campaign which yielded a total of 66 applications from people interested in fostering.  These applications are currently being assessed by the board.  Further families are being recruited who will be available at night to care for children who present in a sudden crisis.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board will be opening two additional residential units.  One, which will come on stream early next year, will provide short-term emergency care for adolescents and the other will be a crisis unit for children under 12 years of age. The board has also strengthened its out-of-hours social work service by providing night time <Col N="1669" /> supervisors and additional social workers.  I am pleased to inform the House that proposals submitted to Government for the further development of our child care services over the next three years have been approved in principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue.  In January 1996, 11 houses were flooded in King Street in Wexford town. The ground floors of 11 houses were flooded up to one foot in depth.  Newly refurbished sitting rooms were destroyed and electrical equipment had to be dumped.  The Irish Red Cross, following strong representations, provided some compensation which resulted in more refurbishment and new carpets and new electrical equipment was bought and installed.</P>
      <P>I drove through King Street on Tuesday, 19 November 1996 and the sight of sandbags at the doors and carpets, which had been laid in March and April, hanging over the walls opposite the terrace would bring tears to a stone.  To see children, mothers and grandparents out on the street looking on in disbelief was heartrending, to say the least.  This is the town of the Minister for the Environment.  Will he condemn these decent families to more years of worry, expense and fear, remembering that already there has been a fatality in this street resulting from drowning?  I accept it is not the Minister's fault but it is incumbent on him to provide a short-term and long-term solution in order that these decent people can live life in reasonable comfort.</P>
      <P>The main drainage scheme and flash floods have been blamed but the bottom line is that this is a major problem for 13 families who fear another flood before the year is out.  Adequate drainage is urgently required.  Will the completion of the main drainage scheme ensure there will be no further flooding problems in King Street?  It is expected that the scheme will be complete in 1998.  Will compensation be paid to the 13 families?</P>
      <P>I understand the problem is caused by a combination of four occurrences simultaneously: low atmospheric pressure; heavy rainfall; south east gales at 70 miles per hour or more and high tide, aggravated by leaves blocking the shores. On this occasion I understand the tide was not so high.  What has been suggested to me by the Department of the Environment and by Wexford Corporation is not necessarily true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has had long enough to put a plan in place.  The houses are over 100 years old and have always been flooded, but to a much greater degree in recent years.  This severe flooding happened in January 1996 and again last <Col N="1670" /> Monday night.  What has been done in the meantime?  Shame on the Department of the Environment and on the Minister if we do not have a plan in place to protect these families.  It is a disgrace to treat the people of King Street in this way.</P>
    <P>Is it possible to provide drainage and sluice gates and a pumping station?  Will compensation be paid?  Some of the tenants have purchased these homes with loans from Wexford Corporation.  I do not want any PR exercise.  Give these people a sense of hope and do not condemn them any further.  This problem will not go away on its own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Byrne for sharing his time with me.  Earlier this week I called on the Minister for the Environment to initiate an inquiry into this most recent flooding of houses in King Street, Wexford.  Millions of pounds have been spent on a main drainage scheme in Wexford town.  Yet we discover that flooding has recurred in King Street.  The Minister told us here last January that, because of the main drainage scheme under way, there would no longer be flooding in King Street.  As Deputy Hugh Byrne said, some 13 houses were flooded this week, three more than previously, at a period when there were no tide problems, thus leading one to the conclusion that the flooding was caused in the street.</P>
      <P>Residents inform me that new gulleys were installed in the new main drainage scheme but the water flowing down the street was of such volume they were unable to take it.</P>
      <P>Residents also informed me that on 2 August 1995 the town engineer and Wexford Corporation promised them that extra gulleys would be installed.  Over a year has elapsed, yet no extra gulleys have been installed by Wexford Corporation or the operators of the main drainage scheme.</P>
      <P>Obviously, some major engineering fault has led to this latest flooding.  The Minister for the Environment, not merely because he represents the Wexford constituency but any Minister for the Environment, and Wexford Corporation under whose direction the main drainage scheme is being carried out, should investigate what has gone wrong.  It has caused severe hardship to families, old age pensioners, the unemployed and working families living on that street.  They have become so annoyed at the present position they are seeking compensation for the damage to their homes from this recent flooding and transference from those houses in King Street to Upper King Street where a new housing scheme is about to commence under the direction of Wexford Corporation.</P>

    <P>Someone must be held responsible for this latest flooding, not caused by high tides or the sea but from inadequate gulleys and bad workmanship on this main drainage scheme. Although almost a year has expired since Deputy Hugh Byrne and I last raised the matter but <Col N="1671" /> residents of King Street have experienced even worse flooding and more homes have been flooded in the construction of a main drainage scheme.  The Minister has a duty to assure us that she will fully investigate the reasons for this most recent flooding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent serious flooding in Wexford occurred as a result of very heavy rainfall in the area.  I understand that almost 32 millimetres of rainfall was recorded in a six hour period which, on that scale, amounts to ten times the daily average for November. This, in combination with other climatic conditions, which included south east gales averaging 40 miles per hour, with gusts of 70 miles per hour, with high tides, gave rise to a substantial amount of surface water which could not discharge sufficiently quickly into the harbour from King Street.  This resulted in a number of houses being flooded to a depth of approximately 350 millimetres.</P>
      <P>I should like to offer my sympathy to those affected.  I understand that Wexford Corporation is assisting householders in the area in the clean-up operation, which assistance included the provision of heaters and dehumidifiers, sand bags and manpower to help them.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, in the first instance responsibility for dealing with flooding incidents such as occurred in Wexford lies with the local authority concerned.  My Department has no direct responsibility for combating flooding but does approve and fund public sewerage schemes proposed by local authorities.  In appropriate cases, these schemes may include provision for dealing with factors such as storm overflows and run-offs of excessive surface water.  In the case of Wexford, the main drainage scheme at present under construction will address both the general waste water problem and the drainage requirements of streets such as King Street, where run-off of rain water from streets and houses appears to have contributed to the flooding.</P>
      <P>The Wexford main drainage scheme involves the laying of some 27 kilometres of foul, storm and combined sewers and the laying of an interceptor sewer.  Work is under way on these elements of the project while planning on other elements, including the treatment works, is being advanced.  The cost of the overall project is estimated to be of the order of £40 million.  The scheme is designed to provide increased accommodation for storm waterflows and, consequently, to alleviate the risks of flooding from this source at King Street and other areas of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no special funds available to my Department to provide assistance to households whose homes may be affected by flooding. However, the health board may provide <Col N="1672" /> assistance under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme in necessitous cases.</P>
    <P>I again sympathise with those affected by the recent flooding.  All public representatives are acutely aware of the hardship and distrust associated with the flooding of homes.  In the case of Wexford town the good news is that a major investment project is already under way which, when completed, should ensure that this type of occurrence is a thing of the past.</P>

      <P>The problem relates to Rathbane national school, Ballina, a three teacher school comprised of a main structure of two rooms and a prefab, built in 1910 and due for replacement since last year.</P>
      <P>There are 58 pupils and three teachers in the school, located in a rural area with a great reputation for its academic achievements.  The school is now infested with rats and the Western Health Board has advised its closure because of the risk to health.  The parents and board of management, correctly, have done so as rat infestation poses the danger of a virus disease with a high mortality rate.  Naturally the parents wish to send their children to a safe school.  The Minister and her Department must provide alternative local accommodation immediately, the Department agreed replacement of the school in 1995.  Since building the new school should have commenced already, there is no sense in spending money on the old school.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Education to provide immediate suitable alternative accommodation for its pupils and teachers at no cost to the board of management and to commence the construction of the new school approved since last year.  Planning permission by Mayo County Council is already in place and the Department sought contractors in August last.  I cannot understand why the Department has not availed of the relevant contract and put this work in train.</P>
      <P>Since the school is located in a disadvantaged area and has disadvantaged status, will the Minister advise the board of management, in writing, that the local contribution will be 5 per cent in keeping with that status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support everything my colleague, Deputy Moffatt, said.  Parents of the <Col N="1673" /> children attending the school will meet on Sunday next and, dependent on the contents of the Minister's reply this evening, will determine their attitude to the future education of their children. The children have been withdrawn from the school indefinitely because, for the second time within two years, it has been condemned by the Western Health Board, on both occasions because of rat infestation.</P>
      <P>Quite properly this matter was covered not only on local radio but on the main national news programmes and newspapers today.  It is atrocious that once again a rat infestation occurred, scaring young children out of their wits.</P>
      <P>The problems associated with this school have been known to the Department for a number of years but it appears that the departmental mechanism moved at a pedantic pace, regardless of the urgency of the position.</P>
      <P>As my colleague pointed out, what is urgently required is an immediate decision by the Minister to fund the transfer of the 58 pupils, principal and two teachers to temporary accommodation.  It is a matter for negotiation, but it has been suggested that the GAA club house or community centre should be used as temporary accommodation while the building work is in progress.  Both these premises should be examined urgently with a view to upgrading the heating system and the accommodation facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that the Department will fast track the selection process for a contractor?  Will he confirm that within the past 24 hours the Department authorised the invitation of tenders for this school?  The tendering process can sometimes be slow, and the examination of tenders can be extremely slow, depending on the will of the Department.  The examination of submitted tenders and the selection of the approved contractor should be considered urgently with a view to completing the new school as soon as possible.  It will take a minimum of six months to build the school and <Col N="1674" /> the Department should put a maximum time scale of one year on its completion.  It is not satisfactory for pupils to be educated in a community facility which should be available to the wider community.  A public meeting will be held on Sunday and this will determine the attitude of the board of management and parents to this serious issue.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education I am pleased to outline to the House the Department's position regarding Rathbane national school, Boffenaun, Crossmolina, County Mayo.  The school, which has a staffing level of a principal and two assistant teachers and an enrolment of 58 pupils, is currently housed in a two classroom permanent structure and one prefab.  The Department accepts that these conditions are unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>A building project for the school was included in the 1995 capital programme announced by the Minister.  The design work has been completed and the new school will comprise three classrooms and ancillary accommodation.  The contracts section of the Department has also completed the pre-qualification tender process for the project.  I am pleased to inform the House the Minister is now in a position to allow this project to progress to tender.  Tenders will be invited next Tuesday and contractors must submit tenders within three weeks.  It is anticipated the contractor will commence work after the Christmas break.  The school management has been informed of this development and is exploring the possibility of securing alternative accommodation while the building work is in progress.</P>
      <P>I assure the House the project will be progressed quickly.  The Minister looks forward to the successful completion of the new school.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 40, 45 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The incident to which the Deputies referred occurred on Sunday, 3 November 1996.  A prisoner was for operational reasons being transferred from Mountjoy Prison to Cork Prison in a Garda vehicle.  He travelled in the rear of the van with two prison officers and was handcuffed to one of them.  A third officer in charge of the escort, was in the front of the van with the Garda driver.  In the vicinity of the Red Cow Inn on the Naas Road, the officer in charge, on detecting a disturbance in the rear of the van, directed that the vehicle be stopped.  On proceeding to the rear of the vehicle he discovered the prisoner had in his possession a blood filled syringe which he used in a most threatening manner towards the officer to whom he was handcuffed.</P>
      <P>Following several attempts to approach the prisoner and remove the syringe it was decided by the officer in charge, in the light of the prisoner's aggressive and menacing demeanour and the potentially grave risks posed by the syringe, that the handcuffs be removed.  At that stage the prisoner, still carrying the syringe, escaped into nearby fields and, to date, he remains at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Security considerations play a major role in the arrangements for escort of prisoners, whether between prisons, to court, hospital, or for other purposes.  The level of security in each case is <Col N="1676" /> determined by a number of factors including the length of sentence being served by an offender, an assessment of the risk of attempted escape and the potential risk to the community in each case.</P>
    <P>Despite the most stringent precautions however, there will always be an element of risk inherent in transporting prisoners outside of the secure confines of the prisons.  It is important to keep the level of such incidents in context.  In the year to date, more than 13,000 prisoners have been escorted outside the prisons.  Of this number, in less than one in every thousand cases incidents occurred leading to the escape of prisoners and, of these four prisoners remain at large today.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned at any level of escapes from custody wherever and however they occur. As a matter of routine, security of escorts is reviewed after every escape or attempted escape. Following the Naas Road escape the arrangements for handcuffing prisoners have been reviewed as a matter of urgency.  New equipment has been ordered which will, when in place, greatly reduce the possibility of incidents of the type described above.  The question of the type and design of vehicle best suited for the transport of prisoners is also being reviewed.  I have also ordered a tightening up of the procedures for searching prisoners prior to and following escorts and I am satisfied these measures will substantially lower the risk of further similar incidents.</P>
    <P>There have been many incidents, usually unreported, where prison staff, by their vigilance and professionalism have succeeded in preventing the escape of prisoners, often when faced with considerable threats to their own safety.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to her of 30 October 1996, asylum applications are dealt with in accordance with a 1985 arrangement entered into with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The large increase in asylum applications over the past three years, and over the past year in particular, have caused the build up of a significant backlog of cases awaiting finalisation.  This has come about as neither the UNHCR nor my Department has had sufficient resources to deal with the increasing numbers.  Mechanisms for the clearance of this backlog are currently being examined by my Department and the UNHCR are being consulted in the matter.  Within these constraints, I am satisfied that the current procedures are operating satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that standard driving courses for members of An Garda Síochána are conducted at the Driving School, Garda College, Templemore on an ongoing basis.  The driving school forms part of the specialist school at the Garda College.  The course is of two weeks duration and incorporates cars from 1.4cc to 2.9cc, vans and personnel carriers and also includes automatic cars.  In addition, courses are conducted for other vehicles used throughout the force including VIP, four wheel drive, tow wagon, heavy goods vehicle and motor cycles.</P>
      <P>The selection of members to be trained on any particular driving course is made on a divisional basis, and the number is influenced by the availability of qualified drivers in each division, the number of official vehicles allocated to the division and the requirement for drivers for these vehicles.  The demand for driving courses depends on the number of members nominated by divisional officers, and the Garda authorities are satisfied that the number of courses provided is meeting this demand.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that at all times chief superintendents have the power to authorise a member who is holder of a full class &ldquo;B&rdquo; driving licence to drive offical cars, subject to the member concerned being deemed suitable.</P>

      <P>I understand the tone of newspaper reports of statements made at the conference may have been misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that relations between the Garda national drugs unit <Col N="1679" /> and the RUC drugs unit are excellent and that there are regular meetings between both agencies to exchange intelligence in relation to drug smuggling across the border.</P>
    <P>While it is not the practice of the Minister for Justice to give detailed information to the House about individual Garda operations, I can confirm that the co-operation between the gardaí and RUC extends to involvement in a number of joint operations in relation to drugs.</P>
    <P>The Customs national drugs team was set up in 1992, with specific responsibility for detecting and preventing drug smuggling.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs national drugs team maintains direct contacts with Customs administrations in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland, with whom there is extensive exchange of intelligence.</P>
    <P>In October 1995, the Irish Revenue Commissioners and H.M.  Customs and Excise signed a Memorandum of Understanding aimed at combating cross-Border fraud and smuggling, including drug related activities.  This memorandum further developed the already close co-operation between the two agencies.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the role of the Navy.  While responsibility for the prevention of the cross-Border drugs problem rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners I am advised that the Naval Service responds effectively to requests from the civil authorities for assistance in combating the illegal importation of drugs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>On 21 April 1995, the Minister of State at the Departments of Health, Education and Justice launched a new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and the Garda.  This document was finalised following extensive discussions between officers of the Department of Health, my Department, the health boards and senior Garda officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 guidelines represent a major amendment of the 1987 Guidelines &mdash; in 1987, the <Col N="1680" /> Department of Health issued revised guidelines on procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse.  The new procedure clarifies the circumstances in which the health boards and the Garda are to notify one another of suspected cases of physical, sexual or emotional neglect of children and gives guidelines on the consultations that should take place following such a notification.  A central feature of the procedure is a standardised notification system between the agencies.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied with the way these arrangements are working.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of drug abuse, the first report of the ministerial task force on demand reduction has recommended the establishment of new structures designed to achieve a more effective co-ordinated delivery of drugs services at national, regional and local level.  At national level there is a cabinet drugs committee and a national drugs strategy team to develop the Government's strategy against drugs and oversee its implementation.  At regional level there will be regional co-ordinating committees in each health board area, providing a valuable forum for joint planning between the various agencies and the voluntary/community sector.</P>
    <P>The ministerial task force has also recommended the establishment of a local drugs task force for each of the 11 areas identified by the report as having the most acute drugs problem.  This recommendation has been approved by the Government and is in the process of being implemented.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task force will comprise representatives of all relevant agencies, including the health board, the Garda, the probation and welfare service, the relevant local authority, the local youth service and voluntary drug agencies, together with community representatives and a chairperson proposed by the local partnership board and a co-ordinator provided by the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>I am aware that throughout the country senior management of the Garda make themselves available to meet public representatives when the need arises.</P>

      <P>The annual report on prisons and places of detention for the year 1993 was published on 4 September 1996, and placed in the Oireachtas library.  The compilation of the statistics in respect of 1994 and <Col N="1681" /> 1995 is in progress.  However, as I have already indicated on a number of occasions to the House, I recently decided that the written elements of the reports for those years, which include the main developments in the prison service, the reports of the visiting committees and the various prison services, will be published separately.  I plan to have the interim report for 1994 ready for publication shortly.  The statistical tables would then be published as soon as possible afterwards.</P>
      <P>The lack of resources to provide comprehensive information technology in the prisons has inhibited the preparation of the statistical elements of the prison reports.  Planning for the replacement of the out of date and partial prisoner records system is at an advanced stage.  One of the benefits which the replacement system will provide will be the capacity to provide the required statistics much more quickly than at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Delays in the courts are of particular concern to me and I have taken steps to deal with these delays.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, provided for an increase of 18 in the maximum of judges of all the courts.  I obtained Government approval for the appointment of 16 additional judges i.e. three Supreme Court judges, three High Court judges, seven Circuit Court judges and three District Court judges.</P>
      <P>These additional judges have now all been appointed.  The provision of these additional judges is enabling the current arrears of court business, including criminal cases, to be effectively tackled and will assist in the prompt disposal of cases in the future.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Courts Act, 1996, which formed part of the Government's recent anti-crime package, provides for the appointment of three further Circuit Court judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> My Department obtained the agreement of the Department of Finance for the appointment of about 45 additional court support staff to assist in the workload of these additional judges.  To date about 33 of these staff have been appointed and the remainder are in the course of being appointed.  I am sure the Deputy will also be aware that I obtained the agreement of the Presidents of the High and Circuit Courts to hold sittings of those courts during September this year.  The numbers of civil, criminal and family law cases disposed of during the special sittings of the Circuit Court in September, 1996 were 228, 40 and 238, respectively.  In addition the Central Criminal Court dealt with 17 rape cases in the three weeks from 16-9-1996 to 7-10-1996.  I am confident that the measures I have outlined have had and will continue to have a significant bearing on the question of delays in the hearing of criminal cases in the courts.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for increased judicial and support resources, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, introduced a number of administrative and procedural reforms which simplify and speed up the processing of cases through the courts and enhance the efficiency of the courts system.  Specifically, with regard to the hearing of criminal cases, the Act does away with the automatic right of transfer of criminal cases from provincial Circuit Courts to Dublin.  Such transfers has exacerbated delays in the hearing of criminal cases in Dublin and had also proven very costly in terms of transporting gardaí and witnesses.  It is also possible that the incentive to transfer these cases was often nothing more than a wish to have the hearing of the case delayed.  Of course, there can be legitimate grounds for such transfers.  Therefore, the Act provides that an application to transfer a trial to Dublin will be granted only where the judge is satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust not to do so.  Since the implementation of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, undue delays in the hearing of criminal cases in the Dublin Circuit Court have been very substantially reduced.  The Act also provides for an increase in the powers of county registrars thus freeing up court resources for the hearing of cases.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill passed by the Dáil contains measures to streamline court procedures and ensure the optimum use of court resources.  The most significant provisions in relation to the courts include the proposed extension from eight days to 15 days of the existing statutory limit for remanding an accused person in custody on that person's second or subsequent appearance before the District Court; proposals to eliminate the need for night courts and provisions allowing for the giving of evidence by the Garda by certificate rather than in person.</P>
    <P>To achieve a long-term improvement in the efficiency of the courts it was necessary, in addition to providing increased resources for <Col N="1684" /> courts and the streamlining of court procedures through legislative reform, to carry out a comprehensive review of the courts system.  In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I established the Working Group on a Courts Commission to review and report to me on the operation of the courts and the establishment of a Commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy.  In May the Government agreed in principle to the recommendation of the working group that such a body be established to manage a unified courts system; this body to be known as the Courts Service and to be created by statute as an agency of the State.  On 12 November the Government took a further decision to establish this new service, as approved in principle in May.  Work has already commenced in my Department on the details of the appointment of a chief executive and advertisements for the post will be placed very shortly.  The new Courts Service will centralise the financial and management administration of the courts in a unified system which will focus on the provision of an efficient, effective and economic system capable of meeting the increased demands being placed on the courts in all areas including that of criminal hearings.</P>
    <P>The working group will continue its work in accordance with its terms of reference to review the day to day operation of the courts system and will be submitting further reports to me on various aspects of courts operation.</P>

      <P>It must be emphasised that the majority of those classed as unlawfully at large are so because of a technical breach of their temporary release conditions.  It is estimated that approximately 76 per cent &mdash; i.e. 1,037 and 775 respectively &mdash; of those at large are deemed so having been granted temporary release and failing to return to sign on at the prison or Garda station in accordance with the terms of their release.  It is necessary to bear in mind also that the number of persons at large is a cumulative figure, spanning over eleven years.</P>
      <P>The breach of conditions of temporary release is an offence in itself, punishable by a prison sentence of up to six months and leaves the offender open to being arrested and returned to custody without the need for the issue of a further warrant.</P>
      <P>The granting of temporary or early release is a feature of prison systems internationally and has been operated under statute in this country since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice.

      <P>I have some concerns about this matter and, for this reason, aside from the proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to bail, I am at present preparing legislation to tighten up on bail laws generally, including measures to improve arrangements in relation to estreatment through, for example, introducing a requirement that cash or the equivalent of cash is lodged as part of bail. The matter of estreating bail is a function of the prosecuting authorities and as Minister I have no role in the estreatment process.  It is a matter for the courts to make a decision where a case for estreatment is made.</P>

      <P>His Honour, Judge Dominic Lynch participated in sittings of the Special Criminal Court on four dates since 1 August 1996, viz., 8, 15, 16 and 28 October.  At those sittings the court heard 11 cases involving 21 persons.</P>
      <P>Arising out of these four sittings, a total of 17 persons were remanded in custody and four other persons were remanded on continuing bail.  One of the 17 persons remanded in custody at a sitting of the Special Criminal Court which included Judge Lynch was subsequently granted bail at a sitting of that court which did not include Judge Lynch.  In addition, one of the persons who was remanded in custody at a sitting of the court including Judge Lynch, was so remanded following the refusal of his bail application.</P>
      <P>The cases where persons were remanded on continuing bail at sittings of the Special Criminal Court which included Judge Lynch and the charges brought in those cases are set out hereunder:</P>

      <P>Statistics are not maintained in such a way to facilitate calculation of the figure sought by the Deputy. However, using a method employed in the Penological Information Bulletin produced by the Council of Europe, to provide an indicator of the average length of imprisonment, gives a figure of about 3.7 months for all committals under sentence in 1995.  This figure gives a somewhat distorted view because it includes all committals, including those sentenced to under three months i.e. almost 40 per cent of committals on conviction each year.</P>

The group has been mandated to complete its work and report its findings to Government by the end of January.  The chairperson of this group will be Mr. Dan McAuley, chairman of Gypsum Industries plc., and former chairman of the Labour Relations Commission.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the precise number and annual cost of all Garda escorts of cash in transit are not available because of the multiplicity and varying nature of those escorts.  However, the Garda authorities estimate that in 1995 the Garda manpower costs associated with about 34,000 Garda &mdash; including Garda/Army &mdash; cash escorts between the banks, post offices, cash holding centres and the Central Bank, including escorts to post offices for the purpose of conveying cash required to make social welfare payments, was in the order of £2.5 million.  This estimate does not cover the cost of Army involvement in escorts or the associated Garda transport costs.</P>

      <P>Aspects of the subject matter of the question are still before the courts and the Deputy will appreciate that I am constrained by what I say in answer to her.  I can, however, confirm that the Algerian national who was lawfully refused leave to land in the State on 27 October last has since been granted a visa to travel to the State.</P>
      <P>On his arrival at Dublin Airport on a private aircraft which had departed from France, the person in question was brought by the company which handles private aviation facilities to the Garda Immigration Office at the airport.  He produced an Algerian passport and was questioned by the immigration officers after they had established that he was not in possession of a visa to enable him to travel to the State.  His passport did not contain visas for any countries notwithstanding the fact that he would also have been required to have a visa to enable him to enter France.  He also admitted working in this country without a valid work permit.</P>
      <P>In accordance with law, he was refused leave to land in the State and was placed in detention pending the making of arrangements for his removal to Algeria.  On 29 October he was removed from the State at 10.30 a.m. approximately on an Aer Lingus flight to London to connect with a 1.30 flight from there to Algeria.  He was accompanied by two Garda Immigration Officers on the Dublin-London leg of his return journey to Algeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At approximately 11.20 p.m. on the same day, my Department was notified by telephone that the High Court some few minutes beforehand, had ordered that the person in question should not be removed from the jurisdiction pending further order by the court.  Prior to that notification, my Department had no knowledge whatsoever about the circumstances of the case. No prior notice had been given to my Department that court proceedings were impending &mdash; had such notice been given prior to the Departure of the flight to London, my Department in accordance with settled policy in immigration cases would have arranged to suspend his removal from the State pending the outcome of court case.  I am advised that the person's legal representative telephoned Garda Immigration at Dublin Airport at about 10.40 and <Col N="1693" /> indicated that he was seeking a court order to prevent his client being removed from the jurisdiction.  He was advised that the aircraft with his client on board had departed about ten minutes beforehand.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the case which gave rise to the person's removal ultimately to Algeria are, as I have indicated, still before the courts.  In the circumstances, I am not at liberty to comment on them until such time as they have been fully disposed of by the courts.  If at that time, the Deputy wishes to put down a further question, I will be glad to answer it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 42 and 51 together.  In November 1995, I established the Working Group on a Courts Commission to review and report to me on the operation of the courts and the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy.  That group recommended in its first report that an independent and permanent body be established to manage a unified courts system; this body to be known as the Courts Service and to be created by statute as an agency of the State. I obtained Government approval in principle for this recommendation in May 1996.  On 12 November the Government agreed to the establishment of such a Service as approved in principle in May.</P>
      <P>The Working Group on a Courts Commission submitted its third report to me on 18 November 1996 advising on the steps necessary to establish the Courts Service.  This report sets out a proposed legal framework for the Courts Service and broad managerial approaches to the changing management structure of the courts.  As regards the terms of reference of the Courts Service, its functions will be set out in legislation.  I obtained Government approval on Tuesday, 19 November for steps to be taken as a matter of urgency to legislate for a Courts Service as advised and for the priority drafting of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> The Government also authorised me to request the Working Group to prepare immediately a report on the specific subject of the position of chief executive officer of the Courts Service.  The appointment of the chief executive is vital to the processes of the establishment of a Courts Service and I look forward to receiving this report from the working group.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to once again pay sincere tribute to Mrs. Justice Denham and the members of the working group for their hard work and dedication which has been and continues to be vital to the establishment of a modern Courts Service capable of meeting the needs of society today and in the future.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to different areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me the policing requirements of the Dublin Metropolitan Area are continually monitored by the assistant commissioner responsible for the area with a view to ensuring that Garda resources are deployed to optimum benefit.  The Garda authorities also report that at present they are satisfied that all Garda resources in the Dublin Metropolitan Area are deployed effectively and are sufficient to meet current policing needs.</P>
      <P>An example of the ongoing monitoring of Garda policies and resources was the recent announcement by the Garda Commissioner of a new strategy to combat the drugs problem in Dublin city, Operation Dochas, which came into effect on 7 October 1996.  This strategy is in operation in all Dublin districts and involves the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plain-clothes gardaí.  Uniformed gardaí adopt a high profile through both foot patrols and mobile patrols and work to forge greater links with local communities.  This operation has increased uniformed Garda presence on the streets over a 24 hour period and, while the predominant emphasis of the operation is drugs, it also extends to crime generally and all policing matters.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that other policing issues which are currently being considered include a plan aimed at reducing the incidence of crime, particularly over the Christmas period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services.  These regulations will apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, creches and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.  A draft of the proposed regulations has recently been made available for the purposes of public consultation. The closing date for receipt by my Department of submissions in this regard is 29 November 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new regulations, which will give effect to <Col N="1701" /> the provisions of Part VII, will come into operation before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The new regulations will impact across the various sectors involved in pre-school provision, ranging from voluntary services for disadvantaged children through to full day care in the commercial sector.  While it has been estimated that the total number of individual services to which the regulations will apply may be in the region of 5,000 a precise figure will not be available until the notification requirements outlined in the draft regulations have been complied with next year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of speech and language therapy service in the County Louth area is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, the service has improved in recent years.  Health boards, including the North-Eastern Health Board, have viewed its development as a priority with the recruitment of 28 additional therapists in the last three years. Notwithstanding these improvements, it is clear the service requires further development.  This issue will be given careful consideration in the context of the report of the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities which has examined speech and language therapy services in its review of health services generally for people with disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives.  First, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all registered nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act, and, second, to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the current levels of subvention payable, it must be stressed that a nursing home subvention is not intended to meet the full cost of the nursing home care for those who cannot do so from their own resources.  I am aware that there are certain difficulties being encountered by <Col N="1702" /> some providers and persons seeking nursing home care.  I will continue to endeavour to address these problems, and the issue of increasing the subvention rates, within the resources available to me.</P>

      <P>While I am satisfied that the annual injection of funds into services to persons with a mental handicap in recent years has made a substantial impact, I am aware that more needs to be done if the needs of those awaiting services are to be met.  The Government is committed to the continued development of the services, as resources become available.  This commitment is outlined in both <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and the Health Strategy &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £56.8 million was invested in the services for persons with a mental handicap in the period 1990-96 which has enabled health boards and voluntary organisations to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,300 day care places.</P>
      <P>The National Intellectual Disability Database is now providing my Department, the health boards and the voluntary mental handicap agencies with information on both the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap over a five year period.</P>
      <P>I would hope to continue the development of further services for persons with a mental handicap based on the needs identified by the database.  My priority is to ensure that provision can be made to meet the needs of those who are currently without a service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the dental treatment services scheme introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994 dental treatment will be extended to all adults with medical card eligibility on a phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the initial phasing of the scheme persons aged 65 years and over were identified as a <Col N="1703" /> priority group and additional resources have been made available to health boards to enable them to provide dental treatment including denture treatment for this group.  In addition emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is available under the dental treatment services scheme to all medical card holders irrespective of age and eligible persons over the age of 16 may attend any private dentist under contract with the health boards, if in pain and in need of emergency treatment.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the scheme was introduced from 1 June 1996 and involves the extension of the scheme to provide routine dental treatment services to medical card holders in the 16 to 34 year old age group and the provision of full dentures to all edentulous medical card holders.  These dentures will be mainly provided at health board dental clinics.</P>
    <P>All health boards also operate a priority waiting list for dental treatment for medically compromised persons who are given priority irrespective of age on production of a letter from their general medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>Routine treatment will be extended to the remaining groups at a later stage and will be considered in the context of the funds available to me for the development of dental services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of day care centres in south Tipperary is, in the first instance, a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board.  While the board recognises the need for day care services in Cashel, they must first take into account their overall capital priorities and the availability of resources.</P>
      <P>The board informs me that it has endeavoured to support the Cashel Parish Council in its efforts over the years regarding the provision of day services.  At present the board has agreed to examine the physical lay-out of St. Patrick's, Cashel, with a view to determining whether a day care centre can be incorporated.  If this proves possible, I expect to receive a submission from the board outlining their proposals for such a project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>Requests for funding for this work were received this week from the council.  The management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities and must, as a general rule, be met from their own revenue resources.  Where, under the remedial works scheme, funding is made available to assist authorities in carrying out major structural works to designated housing estates, the installation of central heating may be an element in such works. In the case of the applications from Tipperary UDC, the only work proposed is the installation of central heating which would not therefore qualify under the scheme.  Local authorities were advised in February 1994 that full central heating should be provided in new local authority housing.  It is a matter for each authority to decide on the type of heating system to be provided. They must be satisfied that the cost of the system to be provided is reasonable, that it is safe, efficient in the use of energy and appropriate to the tenant's needs and circumstances, that it can be adequately maintained and that it will not result in unsustainable running and maintenance costs.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my press release of 13 January 1994, £3.7 million was allocated for capital developments at Sligo regional technical college under the National Development Plan 1994 to 1999.  This amount comprises 75 per cent and 25 per cent EU and Exchequer funds respectively. To date, £1.5 million of the allocation has been expended on the upgrading of the science laboratories and on improving the infrastructure of the college.  The balance, amounting to £2.2 million, remains available for investment in information technology and central administration facilities.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer component of the £2.2 million has also been put aside for the project.  In these circumstances there is no danger of the EU funds which I have allocated to Sligo regional technical college being diverted elsewhere.  I am aware however that the cost of the entire project is in excess of £2.2 million.  The additional funding requirement for the project is at present being considered by my Department in the context of the 1997 Estimates.  However, decisions in respect of the provision of any additional capital funding or with regard to the phasing of the project will have to be taken in the context of other priorities and overall resource constraints.</P>

Actions which are being undertaken in order to improve standards include in-career development programmes for teachers and the on-going review of the curriculum in mathematics and science in primary and second-level schools.  The curriculum for primary schools which is under review at present will have a new emphasis on science.</P>
      <P>There has been a threefold increase in the funding of in-career development programmes over the past five years.  Recently I announced a £10 million building programme to develop and upgrade, the education centre network.  This will result in 21 full-time education centres and nine part-time education centres being located throughout the country as part of the strategic development of a network for the in-career development of teachers.</P>
      <P>In order to enhance the capacity of teachers to provide active learning experiences for students a number of science resource centres have been established and more are planned.  These science resource centres will support the introduction and development of the science teaching programmes at both levels and will foster a greater awareness of science and technology among pupils.  My Department has undertaken a number of successful gender equality initiatives to improve the participation rates of girls in science subjects provided as part of the second level curriculum. Regular monitoring of national standards will take place by the inspectorate and through surveys and certificate examinations.</P>

      <P>I should clarify for the Deputy that the Garda authorities will continue to have powers to enforce road traffic law generally following the implementation of the Government decision to the appointment by Dublin Corporation of a director of traffic to take over responsibility from the gardaí for the traffic warden, on-the-spot fines and towaway services, to introduce wheel clamping and have overall responsibility for traffic management in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Minister for the Environment, in response to the Deputy's question to him today, will outline the current position about the appointment of the director of traffic.</P>
      <P>The date for the proposed handover of the traffic services has not yet been decided.  The effects of the proposed transfer of these services on Garda manpower are currently being assessed by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>The question of basic income was examined in some detail by the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, which reported earlier this year. The expert group examined a number of options for full or partial basic income.</P>
      <P>The main conclusions which the expert group reached on the CORI proposal were: the scheme would greatly simplify the tax and social welfare systems; many people would face substantial increases or decreases in net income &mdash; some of those facing a drop in net income are already on low incomes; some aspects of abolition of all tax allowances could cause problems &mdash; in particular, the taxation proposals could have adverse implications for occupational pensions; the scheme would involve substantial increases in marginal tax rates; it was unlikely to have a significant positive effect on employment; the high marginal tax rates might lead to more people working in the black economy.  The group's overall conclusion was that the high tax rate associated with the scheme made its effect on employment uncertain; for this reason the group recommended against the scheme.</P>
      <P>Whether basic income becomes feasible in the future will depend on relative movements of a large number of variables, such as the desired level of the basic income, the tax rate that may be imposed, the dependence ratio in the population, the relative level of employment and unemployment, and any changes in social welfare systems and structures in other EU countries.</P>

      <P>The yield from the operation of the &ldquo;liability to maintain family&rdquo; provisions of the Social Welfare Acts arises through a combination of contributions from liable relatives, claim withdrawl by some lone parents and through claim reductions or termination by the Department on discovery of new facts. Contributions from liable relatives towards the cost of social welfare payments have amounted to almost £0.4 million for the current year to the end of October, with a further £0.23 million in related scheme savings.</P>
      <P>The process of maintenance recovery is a difficult and protracted one.  A large proportion of liable relatives are not in a financial position to pay because they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or are in low-wage employment.  In addition more than a quarter of liable relatives cannot be traced.  Maintenance recovery action can be realistically pursued only with persons who can be traced and who have the means to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>While the number of liable relatives contributing is low, the yield is continuing to grow and ways of building on this are being considered in the Department.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the free travel scheme is to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems. Expenditure on the scheme this year will amount to some £32.7 million and will benefit some 470,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception.  They are necessary because the transport services concerned are under severe pressure from <Col N="1718" /> commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening.  The travel restrictions apply generally from 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday, inclusive, and on Bus Éireann long distance buses from 4 p.m. on Fridays for up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  These restrictions, however, do not apply in the case of mentally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled or blind people.</P>
    <P>The question of removing or easing the peak time travel restrictions has been discussed with CIE on a number of occasions in the past.  With the present size of its bus fleet, CIE would face major passenger capacity constraints at peak hours if the travel restriction were relaxed.  The cost of such a proposal would be significant both for my Department in terms of extra expenditure under the free travel scheme and for CIE which would have to purchase or hire extra buses to cope with the increased demand which would arise.  For these reasons, I have no plans in the foreseeable future to alter the current time restrictions applying in the case of the free travel scheme.</P>

The range of employment supports include the back to work allowance, family income supplement, continuation of child dependant payments for 13 weeks after returning to work and the retention of secondary benefits. The back to work allowance scheme has proved to be highly successful in helping long-term unemployed people aged over 23 years to return to work and I was pleased to be able to announce recently an increase of 2,000 in the number of places available under the scheme, bringing the total number now available to 17,000.</P>

      <P>The impact of the current rates of payment on the quality of life of social welfare recipients needs to be properly assessed in the light of up-to-date research in this area.  For this reason, the Government's policy agreement of December 1994, A Government of Renewal, included a commitment to commission the Economic and Social Research Institute to review the minimum adequate income rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1985.  The ESRI report will, in addition, compare these calculations with current social welfare weekly rates and evaluate the extent to which any newly adopted rates would improve the effectiveness of social welfare payments in reducing income inequality.  This report is due to be published by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The ESRI is also completing a report into poverty in the 1990s in Ireland.  This study makes use of the 1994 living in Ireland survey to provide an updated picture of the extent of poverty in Ireland and who is affected.  Both reports form part of a substantial programme of research being carried out at the ESRI, sponsored by the Department of Social Welfare and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      <P>Together with the national anti-poverty strategy, these studies will contribute to informing public debate on the issue of poverty, while also providing a basis for assessing the adequacy of the current rates of social welfare entitlements and the standard of living of social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>Statistics on appeals finalised during the first ten months of 1996 show that the average processing time was about 18 weeks.  Appeals involving oral hearings tend to take longer than this whereas those where the appeal can be determined on the basis of the documentary evidence would be dealt with more quickly.  This average period includes all phases of appeals including the additional time involved in the determination of a number of appeals where, for example, further investigations have to be made or adjournments have been sought etc.  In 1995 approximately one-third of completed appeals were disposed of within two months of being registered in the social welfare appeals office. These processing times compare favourably with international experience in this area.</P>
      <P>While every effort is made to improve the situation this is contrained by statutory requirements and the quasi-judicial nature of the appeal process itself which involved the resolution of conflicting contentions.</P>

However, it is necessary to ensure that progress in this area is achieved in a manner which is consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all of its merits.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance was introduced in November 1990 and is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with full time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>It is not a condition of the scheme that the carer must be related to the person being cared for.  Accordingly, separate figures are not maintained by my Department as to the number of people getting the allowance who are looking after relatives.  The carer's association, which represents the interests of carers in the country, has estimated that there are about 30,000 people currently providing full time care and attention for those who require it.</P>
      <P>At the end of September, 1996 there were a total of 8,088 people in receipt of the carer's allowance at a cost to end-September 1996 of £19.24 million.  The annual cost of the allowance since its inception and the number of cases in payment at the end of each year are as follows:</P>

      <Quest>whether a person (details supplied) in County Kildare, who has worked specific hours per week for the past two years, is entitled to unemployment assistance for the remaining time; if persons with similar hours of employment in similar employment are currently eligible for unemployment assistance; whether there are other cases with identical hours and days of employment in respect of which unemployment assistance is paid; if his attention has been drawn to the contrasting manner in which this claim was disallowed in comparison to the way in which a recent appeal has been refused; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is a statutory condition for receipt of unemployment benefit that a claimant has sustained a substantial loss of employment.  The person concerned has been employed in regular permanent part-time employment since 1989.  She claimed unemployment benefit from 24 May 1995 and this claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that her normal employment pattern showed no substantial loss of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> Her appeal against that decision to the independent social welfare appeals office was disallowed by an appeals officer for the same reasons as given by the deciding officer.</P>
    <P>The determination as to whether a substantial loss of employment has occurred in any case depends on the particular pattern of employment. A substantial loss of employment occurs where a claimant has lost at least one day of insurable employment in any period of six consecutive days by comparison with the normal pattern of employment provided also that the earnings are reduced as a consequence of the loss of employment.</P>
    <P>Establishing what the normal pattern of employment actually is can give rise to difficulties in particular cases.  However, I am having the application of this condition reviewed at present to ensure that a consistent approach is adapted in situations of this kind.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility of the insurance supervisory authority is to supervise the statutory reserves and solvency requirements of insurers authorised to do business in Ireland and to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet claims as they arise.  To ensure that these requirements are met, insurers must be free to accept or reject individual risks and to set their insurance premiums in the light of their underwriting exsperience.  The Minister is not empowered to compel insurers to either quote in respect of specific insurance risks or to offer premiums at particular rates for such risks.</P>
      <P>In the case of the particular situation to which the Deputy refers, insurers, in making or declining to make quotations, would have to take account of the cost of insurance claims arising from the previous flooding and the risk of recurrence of flooding in the areas affected.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the updating and consolidation of the body of legislation dealing with credit unions, which dates in some cases from 1893, are well advanced.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been unverified reports of an increase in the incidence of sheep scab since the abolition of the countrywide compulsory preventive dipping in 1994 under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  Coupled with this there has been a marked reduction in the sale of dips which itself is an indicator of reduced treatment.  In response to these developments and following consultation with all interested parties a package of measures was introduced in June, 1995 to highlight the need to control and eradicate the disease.</P>
      <P>As part of this awareness programme a confidential phoneline &mdash; telephone 1-850-245900 &mdash; was introduced to enable callers to report suspect sheep scab cases.  In addition, a video campaign was launched to highlight the economic losses and devastating effects of the disease on sheep.  The video set out treatment options through dipping or injectable methods and advises flockowners to practice good animal husbandry to control and eradicate this disease. Livestock mart managers have also been asked to assist in combating sheep scab.  Furthermore, I have asked my officials to increase their vigilance at livestock marts, meat plants and farm inspections and to follow up with the local authorities any indications of scab that arise.</P>
      <P>As a further element of this programme of awareness and eradication, a public two-day conference was held in Tralee on 27-28 March 1996.  This covered aspects such as awareness, diagnosis, treatment, notification and good husbandry practice.  I am currently arranging for the publication of the conference proceedings which I propose to issue to all interest groups and local authorities.  This should provide all concerned with a basis for formulating measures to combat this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that, although the annual autumn compulsory sheep dipping scheme was removed in 1994, sheep scab is by law still a <Col N="1725" /> notifiable disease and outbreaks must be dealt with by compulsory treatment of the affected and contiguous flocks until the outbreak is controlled.</P>

As long as the EU regulations require that an animal must be one year old to qualify for the ewe premium I believe that the dates selected for 1996-7 are the most judicious to enable maximum payment of premiums.</P>

      <P>I am advised that fishery board staff are aware of the need for precautionary measures, where appropriate, to prevent the spread of animal disease.  The board's environmental officers, who have most occasion to traverse farmland, are equipped with approved disinfectant which they apply to footwear prior to entering animal holding areas on farm land.</P>
      <P>The fisheries boards are at present drawing up a code of practice covering, among other matters, procedures and precautions during pollution inspections on farms.  Discussions have taken place with the Irish Farmer's Association in relation to animal disease precautions and other aspects of the proposed code which is expected to be in place early in 1997.</P>

      <P>The provision of port infrastructure such as that referred to by the Deputy is a matter for a commercial harbour authority itself to fund from revenues generated by traffic through the port.</P>
      <P>My Department had supported an application by Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners for EU grant aid towards the installation of a vessel management system but this was unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>I understand that Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners may soon agree an arrangement with port users for the installation of appropriate navigational aids.</P>
