      <P>Before commencing the business of the House, I am sure Members would wish to join me in extending a most warm welcome to the many distinguished persons who are with us, a parliamentary delegation from Finland, the Icelandic Foreign Minister, Mr. Halldor Asgrimsson, and his entourage, which I am pleased to observe includes our former parliamentary colleague, Mr. Pat McCartan.  His parliamentary colleagues will be pleased to see him back in the Dáil, especially in the capacity of Irish Honorary Consul to Iceland.  They will probably consider the distance quite appropriate.  We wish all our visitors a happy and successful time in Ireland.  May they take back with them happy memories of their visit and, in the old gaelic term, I wish them céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding to the Order of Business I am obliged to deal with a request under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  I call on the Deputy <Col N="1262" /> to state the matter of which she has given notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the urgent matter of the discovery of a document in the files of the Blood Transfusion Service Board which shows that the State agency knew since 1976-77 that plasma had been used from a female donor clinically diagnosed as suffering from infective hepatitis, why that information was not made known to the expert group which investigated the Blood Transfusion Service Board and what the Minister for Health proposes to do following this revelation which undermines the Government's compensation tribunal where cases are currently being heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 7 &mdash; motion re. International Natural Rubber Agreement, 1995, No. 14 &mdash; statements on the White Paper on Foreign Policy and No. 15 &mdash; Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: No. 7 shall be decided without debate; and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 14: (1) the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (2) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (3) Members may share time; and (4) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply not exceeding 15 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach twice yesterday if he would report on his conversations with the authorities in Cairo and the developments in regard to the shipments of Irish beef.  I am sure the Department of Foreign Affairs has made available to him cuttings from newspapers in the Gulf, the United Arab Emirates and other countries which focus on Irish beef.  Will the Taoiseach avail of the opportunity either now or later in the day to set the record straight on what the Irish authorities are doing in regard to this very serious matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been the subject of much debate in the House over the past week.  It is not relevant to the Order of Business.  Deputies cannot continually raise matters of this kind which are not strictly relevant.  I would be anxious to facilitate Members in dealing with the matter formally and in accordance with the procedures of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your indulgence for a few moments, a Cheann Comhairle, given that we do not have many billion pound industries and developments seldom move ahead at the rate this one is moving.  Everyone is worried about the way in which the Irish case is being misconstrued by others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a very positive conversation with President Mubarak <Col N="1265" /> yesterday.  I cannot at this stage indicate the definitive outcome of it but I expect to see some outcome shortly.  Over the past two days we have been intensively engaged in discussions with the Iranian authorities about the situation there. The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and its chief veterinary officer will travel to Egypt today to back up what I said in general terms to President Mubarak with detailed technical information which clearly indicates the very good health status of Irish beef.  On the question of the United Arab Emirates, our Ambassador in Riyadh who is accredited to the Emirates is extremely active in this area and is giving reassurances throughout the Gulf about the quality of Irish beef.  This matter is being intensively pursued in every way possible by the appropriate Irish authorities and if we are advised that further interventions by me or Ministers are necessary they will be made promptly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate the matter now.  I have given the Deputy some latitude on the matter this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to consult directly with the Northern Ireland authorities to avoid some of the over the top reports on early morning programmes on Radio Ulster and other stations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will convey Deputy's Ahern's advice to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who is dealing with the issue on a number of fronts.  If he has not already done so, he will certainly pursue that line of inquiry. It is important for people to retain a sense of proportion about the matter, given that Irish precautions have been extremely good historically.  They have been substantially increased since 1990 in terms of the controls and Irish beef <Col N="1266" /> has a very good quality record.  While being justly determined to get all the relevant information about the source of any product they consume &mdash; I would urge them to be anything less than vigilant in this area &mdash; it is important for people to retain a sense of proportion about this matter having regard to consumer safety and that we are talking about an industry whose stock is valued at approximately £5 billion and which makes an enormous contribution to employment in urban and rural areas. We must retain a sense of proportion and be active, as the entire Government is, in pursuing this matter.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing, exceptionally I hope, the leader of the Opposition to raise this matter this morning as it has enabled me to give these reassurances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to allow me raise a serious matter in regard to the compensation tribunal.  It is important for the Minister for Health to make a statement in the House today as the allegations made in court are serious and were not denied by the State.  It means that the women affected can claim aggravated or exemplary damages which they are precluded from claiming under the Government's tribunal.  For that and other reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business the Taoiseach told the Leader of Fianna Fáil that the Government was proceeding with the legislation to sell one third of Telecom Éireann.  Has the Taoiseach reflected on that decision and is he really proposing to introduce some time this year legislation which would allow one third of this company to be sold for a derisory sum in a panic sale after bungled negotiations?</P>

      <P>The publication of Challenges and Opportunities Abroad, the White Paper on Foreign Policy, meets the commitment contained in the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> which was adopted by the Government when we assumed office in 1994.  As provided for in that agreement, the White Paper spells out the principles that underpin Ireland's commitment to peace, security and international co-operation.  It is also a central purpose of the White Paper to encourage debate about all aspects of foreign policy, more transparency in the conduct of policy, and the maximum degree of ownership of policy by the people.</P>
      <P>In meeting these aims we were concerned to provide for public participation in the preparation of the White Paper.  This process involved both the soliciting of written submissions from the public and the holding of a series of public seminars on foreign policy themes.</P>
      <P>The White Paper is intended to provide a comprehensive survey of our foreign policy.  While it cannot, obviously, concern itself with every issue of foreign policy, an effort has been made to address as many of the issues raised at the foreign policy seminars as possible. The White Paper, however, does not, address the question of Northern Ireland.  This is because the situation in Northern Ireland is evolving daily.  Also, we felt that the issues associated with Northern Ireland already receives considerable public attention on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish foreign policy is about much more than self-interest.  The elaboration of our foreign policy is also a matter of self-definition &mdash; simply put, it is for many of us a statement of the kind of people we are.  Foremost among the values set out in the White Paper are those which are contained in Article 29 of the Constitution.  Irish people are committed to those principles &mdash; the <Col N="1274" /> ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality; the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination; and the principles of international law as our rule of conduct in our relations with other states.</P>
    <P>The White Paper recognises that as our country is small and hugely dependent on foreign trade for our well-being, our interests require us to pursue an active policy of external engagement. While holding firmly to the principles which we cherish, that policy &mdash; if it is to allow us pursue our interests to best effect &mdash; must be sufficiently adaptable to enable us to meet the constantly changing circumstances of the modern world.</P>
    <P>The European Union, and Ireland's place in it, is dealt with in considerable detail.  The Union's Intergovernmental Conference is due to open in Turin tomorrow and Ireland will shortly be assuming the Presidency of the Union. This is therefore an appropriate moment at which to present the White Paper for discussion in this House.</P>
    <P>The White Paper points out that participation in the process of European integration has been crucial to Ireland's development.  Through our involvement in this process and, in particular, through our membership of the European Union, Ireland is now in the mainstream of European decision-making.</P>
    <P>Ireland has contributed constructively to the Union's development and we have benefited significantly from our membership of the European Union.  The White Paper outlines the considerable influence the EU has had on the strengthening of our identity and our international policies as well as the positive impact the European Union has had on developments in Northern Ireland.  It also points to the substantial net transfers from the EU that Ireland has received.</P>
    <P>From 1 July, Ireland will once again be to the forefront of both European <Col N="1275" /> and world developments when we take over the Presidency of the European Union.  In the lead-up to the Presidency, as outlined in some detail in the White Paper, the European Union faces five major challenges as it moves towards the 21st century.  My colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell will address the subject of the European Union chapter in more detail, but I will outline briefly the analysis of these issues set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>These are, first, the need for the Union to ensure its balanced economic development and realise the full potential of the Single Market.  Second, the Union must ensure that it functions in an open way and addresses the real concerns of the citizens of the Union, such as unemployment and drugs.  Third, the Union must equip itself to play a role commensurate with its responsibilities. The Intergovernmental Conference will play a significant role here.  Fourth, it must seize the historic challenge and opportunity of enlargement to include the other democratic European countries that wish to become members. Fifth, the Union must continue the process of ever closer union among the peoples of Europe to ensure that the enormous achievements of the Union in terms of peace and prosperity are consolidated for future generations.</P>
    <P>The White Paper states categorically that the central current economic challenge for the European Union and its member states is employment.  It is well recognised that, while economic growth is necessary to tackle unemployment, it is not in itself sufficient.  Active measures must be taken to increase competitiveness and to create an economic structure more favourable to turning growth into sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>We will work during our Presidency to ensure that the EU's activities on the employment front are enhanced and intensified.  The process of maximising the job-creating potential of our economies is not a short-term one.  It <Col N="1276" /> requires sustained effort, but by working together the member states will reinforce each other's individual efforts.</P>
    <P>The future enlargement of the European Union and the many complex issues arising in relation to enlargement are matters of fundamental importance for Ireland, the other existing EU member states, the applicant countries and, for the European continent.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about the context.  Millions of our fellow Europeans, having succeeded after decades in ridding themselves of forced material and spiritual deprivation, seek to reclaim and to re-state their European identity and destiny.  They wish to see their countries accede to the European Union.  They aspire to the economic and political benefits which will flow from this.</P>
    <P>The Union, its member states and the applicant countries must prepare for the challenges of enlargement.  We must ensure that the essential nature of the Union, characterised by its commitment to solidarity and to economic and social cohesion, remains undiminished by the accession of new member states in central, eastern and southern Europe.  This is a matter of essential interest for the Union and its existing member states, including Ireland.  Likewise, the interests of new member states will be best served by a deepening of European intergration.</P>
    <P>For their part, applicant countries must prepare to be able to assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the demanding economic and political conditions required.  We in Ireland must ensure that our essential interests, for example in relation to the CAP and economic and social cohesion, are safeguarded in the context of preparing for enlargement and during accession negotiations.</P>
    <P>The White Paper recognises unambiguously the advantages of economic and monetary union for an open economy such as ours.  It acknowledges it as an important further step in the process of European integration.  The White Paper recognises that the British opt-out is a potential difficulty &mdash; it would <Col N="1277" /> clearly be preferable from our point of view if Britain were to participate from the beginning.  The key priority for the Government is to prepare the economy for participation and to ensure that we meet the criteria for the third stage of European Monetary Union from the beginning.</P>
    <P>The Government believes effective co-ordinated action in the area of justice and home affairs is essential, particularly in combating drug trafficking, international organised crime and terrorism.</P>
    <P>In addition to the many ongoing priorities of the Union which will dominate our Presidency, the effective management of the Intergovernmental Conference will be a major priority. As the White Paper points out, it is neither possible nor appropriate to set out in detail Ireland's negotiating position on the issues which may arise at the Intergovernmental Conference.  Our broad approach to the Intergovernmental Conference will be based on identifying real practical improvements in the functioning of the Union under all three pillars, and enabling the Union to address the challenges posed by further enlargement.  We will attach particular importance to equipping the Union to address the most direct concerns of citizens.  At the same time, part of our ambition will be to preserve those elements, including the broad balances between the institutions and the member states, which have served the Union well and are essential for its future success.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference must, by definition, be acceptable to the public in all member states.  A number of sensitive issues will be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference and will have to be resolved with respect for the concerns of all.  The continued right of all member states to nominate a member of the Commission, for example, is a point of key importance for Ireland.</P>
    <P>As to the practical issues we might pursue during the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, I mention for <Col N="1278" /> instance the commitment in the White Paper to seeking a Treaty change to reflect in an appropriate way the rights of people with a disability.</P>
    <P>In considering Ireland's foreign relations, we cannot forget the extent to which our economic well-being depends on other countries.  Some 70 per cent of the goods we produce are exported. Two out of three jobs in manufacturing depend on export trade.  Certain service sectors such as professional consultancy increasingly find their customers abroad.  Employment in tourism obviously would not be viable without foreign visitors.  Moreover, business in Ireland, especially manufacturing industry, has benefited on a very large scale from investment by foreign companies over the years.  Such companies now number no fewer than a thousand.  Their exports, and the employment they generate, are of enormous value to the economy.</P>
    <P>As is stated in the White Paper, it is in Ireland's interest to seek a just and stable international order, in which peaceful trade can flourish.  We need to encourage less-developed countries towards sustainable development.  We should support international bodies such as the World Trade Organisation which aims to liberalise trade world wide, on the basis of agreed rules and safeguards.  This has been an established part of Ireland's policy for many years.</P>
    <P>The promotion of trade and investment is a major obligation of all Irish diplomatic missions abroad.  My Department works closely with other Government Departments, especially Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Tourism and Trade, and with the State bodies responsible specifically for foreign trade and investment.  I mention in this regard the role currently being played by my Department and our missions in seeking to have certain markets for our beef reopened. Irish diplomatic missions also seek the help and support of Irish business people living and working abroad. In the Chapter on the foreign service I outline further proposals to enhance the <Col N="1279" /> effectiveness of the service in this regard.</P>
    <P>The European Union and the United States together absorb 80 per cent of our exports.  However, new markets are now opening up in Asia and in Central Europe.  With this in mind, the Government decided to open three new embassies last year, one in Malaysia and two in Central Europe, one to Hungary and one to the Czech Republic.  I am happy to refer also to the Government's recent decision to open an embassy in Israel.  The new mission will further our capacity to contribute to the Middle East Peace Process.  It will also assist in promoting our economic interests.</P>
    <P>The new post-Cold War environment presents numerous challenges to the security of Europe and the world.  It is an environment characterized by uncertainty and by a proliferation of risks and challenges, many of which have the capacity to affect our interests and the welfare and prosperity of our people. The threat of global nuclear destruction may have receded, but new risks of nuclear proliferation have appeared. We have seen war and ethnic cleansing return to Europe, genocide in Rwanda, and a number of open and bloody conflicts in parts of the former Soviet Union.  The risks to the environment, the rise of international crime, the scourge of drugs, these and many other problems are cited by governments throughout the world as issues that cannot be addressed by nations acting individually and can only be addressed in a meaningful way by co-operative action.</P>
    <P>We see the issue of security in its broadest sense.  The reality that faces all of us, as the OSCE at the highest level has recognised, is that security is indivisible and it must be constructed on more co-operation, not less; on partnerships that have as their aim peace and friendly co-operation and on more and better use of existing institutions such as the UN, the OSCE and the European Union in the search for enhanced peace and security.  Individual institutions are less able than before to cope with the <Col N="1280" /> new and multifaceted challenges that are arising.  Former Yugoslavia is an obvious example: a NATO-led force, IFOR, including Russia and three of our fellow neutral States, Sweden, Austria and Finland, is implementing the military aspects of the Dayton Accords.  The UN is also undertaking peacekeeping and police operations in the former Yugoslavia.  The Western European Union has been involved at the request of the EU and in co-operation with NATO on sactions, enforcement and police tasks.  The European Union has a central role in diplomatic and peace monitoring aspects.  The OSCE will have a crucial role in overseeing civilian aspects of the peace process.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out the new international context in which Ireland must operate.  I wish to encourage a rational and confident debate.  I want to demonstrate that Ireland has nothing to fear from closer co-operation with other States in the search for a more secure world.  None of this poses any threat to our non-participation in military alliances and I trust the White Paper will serve to correct and clarify any misperceptions that may exist on that account.</P>
    <P>The UN Charter remains the ultimate source of legitimacy for all efforts to preserve, promote and defend international peace and security.  Ireland's commitment to the aims and principles of the United Nations Charter is a cornerstone of our foreign policy.  The United Nations system is uniquely placed to promote the collective security, human rights and economic and social development of the world community.</P>
    <P>As the UN faces new and different challenges in the future, it is the Government's view that the Organisation will benefit from a process of revitalisation and reform.  Reform of the Security Council is overdue.  This body should through enlargement, be made more representative of the overall membership of the United Nations.  It must become more transparent in decision making and build better consultation channels with the Secretary-General and the General Assembly.  The UN's <Col N="1281" /> financial crisis must be addressed and arrears by member states settled.</P>
    <P>The UN is the primary forum for Ireland's efforts to promote disarmament, including nuclear disarmament, and arms control.  The White Paper contains a comprehensive restatement of our disarmament policy and sets out the main objectives for the period ahead. While the post Cold War environment has facilitated progress on nuclear and conventional disarmament excessive accumulation of arms is one of the major contributory causes to international tension and conflict.</P>
    <P>At the UN, Ireland is continuing to promote acceptance of principles of responsibility and restraint in arms transfers.  We wish to ensure that any development of EU co-operation in armaments policy includes a significant strengthening of existing arms export control policies at EU level.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to work for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines through focused efforts in the international fora open to us.  Ireland neither produces nor exports such weapons.  In 1996 the Chemical Weapons Convention should enter into force.  The Government intends that Ireland will ratify it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The promotion and protection of human rights is an essential part of Ireland's approach to foreign policy.  I have established a human rights unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs which will co-ordinate human rights issues including, where necessary, with other relevant Government Departments. We will seek to ensure that our concerns in human rights are given full expression in the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union. We will be intensifying our efforts at the United Nations to achieve agreement on a draft statute for a permanent international criminal court.</P>
    <P>During his recent visit here, President Clinton paid eloquent tribute to Ireland's record on peacekeeping.  We can be justifiably proud of our tradition <Col N="1282" /> of service to the United Nations in this regard.</P>
    <P>The current wave of intra-state conflicts poses new challenges for peace-keeping and points to the need for responses which cover all aspects of conflict &mdash; problems of underdevelopment, human rights violations, humanitarian assistance, mass movements of refugees, reconciliation and post conflict reconstruction.  We need a better understanding of the causes of conflict and a more systematic and speedy reaction to mitigate them before they develop into open conflict.  The focus for the future should be on conflict prevention and rapid deployment of adequately resourced and equipped peacekeeping forces with realistic and achievable mandates.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 of the White Paper identifies the central elements of Ireland's security policy over many years, including our policy of military neutrality, embodied by non-participation in military alliances.  As the White Paper makes clear, our approach to the formulation and expression of our security policy will continue to be in harmony with our outlook and traditions, and at the same time responsive to the new and still evolving challenges that face us in promoting peace, security and progress at the European and global level. This approach underpins our policies towards the UN, the OSCE, the Partnership for Peace, the Western European Union, and to Intergovernmental Conference security and defence issues.</P>
    <P>The White Paper acknowledges that the majority of Irish people have always cherished Ireland's military neutrality and that this policy has served Ireland well.  The Government will not propose that Ireland should seek membership of NATO or the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The White Paper surveys the emerging security landscape.  I have already mentioned the UN.  The OSCE, the only regional organisation to which all the states of Europe and North America adhere, is uniquely placed to develop further its existing role as a focal point <Col N="1283" /> for European security co-operation.  We will seek to strengthen the OSCE as a permanent organisation for European security co-operation and to further develop its capacity for preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>The OSCE has endorsed the pursuit of systematic and practical co-operation between European and other regional and transatlantic organisations that share its values and objectives.  Both NATO and the Western European Union have gone beyond their core functions as defence alliances and have announced their willingness to contribute to conflict prevention and crisis management tasks at the request of the UN and the OSCE.  This reflects a developing feature of the new security landscape: the concept of mutually reinforcing co-operation between these institutions.</P>
    <P>There is an emerging consensus that the EU should be better equipped to make a contribution internationally in such areas as peacekeeping and humanitarian operations &mdash; the so called Petersberg Tasks identified by the Western European Union.  It is envisaged that the Western European Union involvement in such operations would be at the request of the UN, the OSCE or the EU under its Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The White Paper states it is desirable and right that Ireland should be prepared to make a contribution in areas where it has proven capacity and experience.  Our other EU partners which have remained outside military alliances &mdash; Austria, Finland and Sweden, are like us, observers at the Western European Union.  They have also shown interest in Western European Union peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to discuss with the Western European Union the possibility of Ireland taking part, on a case by case basis, in humanitarian and rescue tasks and peacekeeping tasks under the Petersberg declaration and to consider such changes as may be necessary in the Defence and Garda Síochána <Col N="1284" /> Acts to enable Ireland's Defence Forces and gardaí to take part in such operations.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is expected to consider how the Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions, including through the EU-WEU relationship and the handling of the Petersberg Tasks in the framework of the relationship, can best be developed to enhance the EU's contribution to European and global peace and security.  This is a challenge that faces all members of the EU, neutral or allied.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be on the basis of the principles set out in Chapter 4.  The White Paper restates the Government's commitment that the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy would be put to the people in a referendum, thus ensuring that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace has already attracted much attention.  I regret that some of it has been misinformed.  I invite all Deputies to read the White Paper closely.  The White Paper sets out the reasons Ireland should consider participating in this co-operative initiative which the vast majority of OSCE member states have already joined.  Partnership for Peace has already assumed an important role in European security co-operation, particularly in such areas as training for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, environmental protection and drugs interdiction.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace does not involve membership of NATO, the assumption of any alliance commitments, or any commitment to future membership of NATO.  Austria, Finland, Sweden and Malta have all joined on this basis.  Participation in Partnership for Peace in no sense impinges on our policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> Partnership for Peace is a flexible arrangement, which allows each participating state to focus on its own interests in the security area: ours is that of peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, and environmental and drugs issues.  It is incorrect and misleading to suggest that Partnership for Peace is somehow a back door for Irish entry to NATO.  The Government has decided that a final decision on participation should be taken on the basis of further consultations, including with the relevant Oireachtas committees, and that such a decision should be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Turning now to development co-operation, Chapter 9 of the White Paper opens with an acknowledgement of the unprecedented increase which has already taken place in Irish aid funding as a result of the commitments made both in the Programme for a Partnership Government and in a Government of Renewal.</P>
    <P>What these commitments have meant in practice is that expenditure on development co-operation activities more than doubled between 1992 and 1995.  The Irish aid budget this year, amounting to £106 million or 0.3 per cent of GNP, represents the highest ever Irish Government investment in development co-operation, both in cash terms and as a percentage of our GNP.</P>
    <P>The availability of funding at this level makes it especially important that the Government has in place a set of policy objectives which govern the way in which our contribution is actually used.</P>
    <P>Chapter 9 of the White Paper provides such a policy framework.  It builds on principles already highlighted in the Irish Aid: Consolidation and Growth Strategy Plan, which was published in 1993, but it also develops our thinking in certain key areas such as rehabilitation assistance and emergency humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>An important initiative, which I am sure will be widely welcomed, is the establishment of a humanitarian liaison group to co-ordinate at a national level <Col N="1286" /> our response to emergency humanitarian crises, with the preparation of a rapid response register of personnel who would be willing to travel to developing countries at short notice in the event of an emergency.</P>
    <P>Above all, what we have tried to do in formulating the White Paper is to ensure that there is a coherence at all levels between aid policy and other elements of Irish foreign policy.  The White Paper, therefore, places our development effort firmly within the context of our larger foreign policy aspirations.</P>
    <P>The level of funding which has been allocated to the bilateral aid programme is an indication of our ongoing commitment to development co-operation as one of the most important instruments of our foreign policy both in the medium and in the longer term.  In this context, I am happy to register the fact that the White Paper unambiguously confirms that it is the Government's intention to make further increases in ODA expenditure in the years ahead in order to put Ireland's performance on a par with that of our partners in the European Union.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, will be addressing these issues more fully.</P>
    <P>The White Paper addresses also important issues such as the environment. We hope that the inclusion of this chapter in a document on foreign policy will be taken as evidence of the seriousness with which the Government intends to address our concerns in this regard.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Irish abroad the White Paper recognises that the tens of millions of people of Irish descent throughout the world are an important asset which should not be under-estimated. They are proud of their Irish connections and have special affection for this country.  Many of them directly or indirectly assist us in the pursuit of our national objectives &mdash; for example, in the political sphere by supporting and supplementing our efforts to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation in our country and, in the economic field, by <Col N="1287" /> helping investment, exports and tourism. We in the Government greatly appreciate that assistance and will continue to express that appreciation at every opportunity.  I am sure that others will do likewise.</P>
    <P>Looking after the consular interests of the large number of our citizens abroad, both resident in and visiting other countries, is one of the foremost tasks of our network of diplomatic and consular missions.  In addition to opening new Embassies where that is justified we are gradually enlarging our network of Honorary Consulates.  These also have a role in assisting with the promotion of our economic interests.</P>
    <P>Providing adequate consular protection for our citizens abroad entails a wide variety of services such as issuing passports, helping to repatriate the remains of people who die, assisting people in distress and protecting the rights of those arrested or imprisoned.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that queues and delays at the passport offices are now things of the past.  There has been a significant increase in staff, the &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; joint venture with An Post introduced a year ago has proved to be very popular, the Dublin office has been extended and the Cork office upgraded to a full issuing office for people in Munster.  We are committed to maintaining and, if possible, improving the service provided by the passport offices.</P>
    <P>I regret there is not sufficient time for me to address all of the issues and themes covered in the White Paper. Challenges and Opportunities Abroad is a comprehensive statement of our foreign policy and, as I have noted, this is the first time that an Irish Government has produced such a White Paper.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised by some of the comments to the effect that the Government has been unduly tardy in publishing the White Paper.  Yes, we would indeed have liked to have brought forward the White Paper at an earlier stage.  As I stated on previous occasions, however, we were unwilling to publish until such time as we felt the <Col N="1288" /> document was sufficiently comprehensive, balanced and thought through to enable it serve the purpose for which it is intended.  I should like to emphasise that, despite what has been implied, no guillotine shall descend on public debate of Ireland's approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, or on any other aspect of our foreign policy.  The White Paper has been formulated by us for the very purpose of encouraging and contributing to such a debate.</P>
    <P>I consider that this is an appropriate moment to present the White Paper, given the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and our forthcoming Presidency of the European Union.  The House will be aware that a number of other EU member states have brought forward, or are intending to bring forward, policy statements regarding the European Union.  I have no doubt but Challenges and Opportunities Abroad is a most worthwhile contribution by Ireland to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the eventual publication of the White Paper.  I regret it was delayed for eight months following the promised publication date of June last.  It can best be described as a bland document, in many cases merely descriptive.  It lacks vision and is obviously the result of a thought process of a committee with a double-think on the crucial issue of neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of a section on Northern Ireland is a major shortcoming of this document.  The Tánaiste attempted to describe that omission by saying that the situation in Northern Ireland is evolving daily and that the issues associated with Northern Ireland already receive considerable public attention on a regular basis.  The fact that they receive considerable public attention on a regular basis should be no reason for the Government, in the publication of such a White Paper, not to take the opportunity to lay down the basic principles on what is our foremost national priority, the consolidation of peace and the bringing about of a settlement of the <Col N="1289" /> Northern Ireland problem through the three stranded process on the basis of the Framework Document, which is the agreed policy statement of the two Governments.  There is no reference in the document to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  The decision by the Government not to include a section on Northern Ireland and North-South funding through Europe is a major omission from this document.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech the Tánaiste attempted to answer the criticism of the delay in publication of the White Paper. I welcome the holding of open fora throughout the country to seek the views of people interested in foreign policy.  That was a very good process which was well carried out, but it concluded last spring.  We were told at that stage that the White Paper would be published in June, then we were told it would be July.  We were then told it would definitely be published before the Dáil resumed in September, then that it would be October, November, December, and then definitely before the Dáil resumed at the end of January. It is now published the week in which we start the review of the Intergovernmental Conference which, after the peace process, is the single biggest issue we face in the period ahead in terms of foreign policy.  It is ludicrous that the Government is merely stating its position &mdash; a fudged position &mdash; at this stage.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is not, as the Tánaiste would have us believe, for the purpose of encouraging and contributing to a debate on foreign policy. Rather than encouraging such a debate the Government has published a document of 350 pages two or three days before the Intergovernmental Conference begins.  That is no way to carry on business.  I will come back to the question of the Intergovernmental Conference later.  The document, Challenges and Opportunities Abroad, containing a specific chapter headed The Democratic Accountability of Foreign Policy which extols the virtues of accountability, transparency and freedom of information, stands indicted on <Col N="1290" /> the basis that it is published on the Tuesday before the Intergovernmental Conference begins.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste's refusal to answer questions in this House makes a sham of democratic accountability for foreign policy.  For example, I recently put down a question to the Tánaiste on his knowledge of whether the Taoiseach, in a phone call to Mr. John Hume, asked him to vote in a particular way in a House of Commons vote.  The Tánaiste referred the question back to the Taoiseach who tells us regularly that at all stages in negotiations on matters related to Northern Ireland, he informs the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare. Yet, the Tánaiste refuses to answer the fundamental question of interference with the voting intentions of the SDLP.</P>
    <P>The section of the White Paper dealing with overseas development aid is a rehash of the Government's five year strategic plan on ODA which was prepared and published by Deputy Tom Kitt when he was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in the last Government.  The White Paper is a watering down on the commitments made in the strategic plan.  It gave a specific outline of funding over a five year period to achieve the 0.7 per cent of GNP level of funding for ODA.  This has been watered down in the White Paper because there is no firm commitment to that target.  The people have clearly indicated their ongoing support for and commitment to development assistance.  They have shown in it their encouragement to Governments to increase funding to the 0.7 per cent of GNP level and in their generous voluntary contributions to NGOs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of a humanitarian co-ordination committee between NGOs and Government Departments proposed in the White Paper.  It is a good move and deserves support.  The rapid response register is also a good idea.  It will allow for a quick response from Irish specialists who will be on the register.  In preparing the register we <Col N="1291" /> must ensure that the tax and PRSI position and the career opportunities of the specialists are not damaged by their voluntary efforts to assist in crises.  The humanitarian co-ordination committee should consider clarifying these issues of tax, PRSI and career prospects for volunteers.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to landmines. He is aware that on behalf of Fianna Fáil I published the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Land Mines Bill, 1996.  This is a major human rights issue which ranks in importance with debt and the problem of AIDS for the Third World.  The Tánaiste should welcome this Bill and support its passage through the House in Government time.  Landmines are not manufactured here but we could send a clear message on our position on the issue.  A ban in Ireland would put pressure on our EU and UN partners.  To suggest we have no role to play on the issue because we do not manufacture mines would be to shirk our responsibility. An Irish ban would help to bring the issue to the forefront in international debate.  We are not the only country to consider such action; Belgium already has such a ban.</P>
    <P>There are over 110 million mines in the world and more are planted every year than are taken out of the ground. In 1993 approximately 100,000 mines were cleared, yet in the same year two million to five million mines were planted.  Cambodia has a population of nine million people, yet it has about nine million planted mines and about 40,000 mine victims.  In the past we led the way on the question of nuclear nonproliferation with Frank Aiken, then Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We did not have a nuclear industry then nor do we now, but we led the world on that issue. We should give a moral lead on the issue of landmines and I appeal to the Tánaiste to respond positively on the issue.</P>
    <P>Third World debt is an issue of great importance.  We should support the call for a world conference on Third World debt which would see a writing off of <Col N="1292" /> the debts of those countries most severely affected.  In many cases assistance is given by the developed world to Third World countries whose annual level of debt repayment is greater than the amount of aid received.</P>
    <P>With regard to humanitarian assistance and ODA, we should have a co-ordinated international programme and policies which are targeted against child prostitution and the exploitation of child labour.  These matters require urgent attention and we could give a moral lead during our forthcoming Presidency of the EU which will give us an opportunity to indicate that our future is as an enthusiastic member of the EU.  We want the retention of the present institutional balance in the EU &mdash; for example, the right of each member state to appoint a Commissioner.  If ever we needed proof of how important it is for each state to have its own Commissioner, we have it in the excellent work done by Commissioner Flynn in securing a major reduction in the fine imposed on us by the EU.  It is important that the rights of smaller states are maintained in the context of enlargement.  It has been indicated that some of the larger member states do not want smaller member states to have the Presidency of the Union.  The principle of smaller member states holding the Presidency on rotation is an important one and we should continue to fight for that.</P>
    <P>In the context of the review of the Maastricht Treaty it is important that we strive for a jargon free Europe because many of the problems that arise in Europe are due to a lack of knowledge and respect on the part of its citizens in regard to what is happening in its member states.  We should also uphold the principle of subsidiarity which allows national, regional and local issues to be dealt with at the appropriate level.  That is important in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference which must address the real concerns of Europe's citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> One of the major concerns of Europe's citizens is the global environment. We must ensure the European Union does not become a nuclear superpower. We must adhere to a policy of total nuclear disarmament and it is important to establish an independent nuclear inspectorate at EU level which would be welcomed by the citizens of Europe, if not the governments of the nuclear states.  Ireland's Presidency in 1996 should be seen as an opportunity to promote the environment as a global issue because it is one of great concern not just to our citizens but to all the citizens of the European Union.  We want to see the implementation of the Dublin Declaration of 1990 and the objectives of the Rio Summit of 1992.</P>
    <P>On the question of common foreign and security policy, security in the widest sense involves the fight against drugs, terrorism and international terrorism. Unfortunately, international terrorism now includes the smuggling and marketing of nuclear materials.  That threatens the security of the people of Europe and the world generally.  International security should not be concerned merely with the question of armies on the borders of Europe facing up to some military threat; our consideration of that question should be much broader.  For example, there should be a co-ordinated European security effort to protect our hundreds of miles of coastline, particularly in the south west which faces the ongoing threat of the importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>Drugs damage young people not only in Ireland but in Europe generally.  This country is facing the scourge of drugs and there must be concerted action taken by all the EU member states in the fight against this problem.  This issue should be at the top of the agenda of our forthcoming Presidency and also in any review of security that may take place in the EU.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Government's stance on the question of neutrality.  The White Paper is an exercise in double <Col N="1294" /> think.  The Government seeks to participate in the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace and the Western European Union.  Both NATO and the Western European Union have nuclear armouries, and it clearly wishes to become a constructive participant in negotiations on a common defence policy for the European Union.  It wants to contribute to and influence the outcome as well as participate in its implementation.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what that will involve for Ireland.  We strongly believe the Irish people want to contribute to peacekeeping operations around the world.  That has been evident since 1960 when we first became involved in UN peacekeeping operations.  They want to contribute not just to the UN but, through the EU, to a common foreign and security policy but they do not want second-hand membership of NATO through the Partnership for Peace or through the Western European Union. We can make our Garda and Army expertise, developed over the past 35 years, available to the European Union on a case by case basis at the request of the EU but not through the two nuclear capacity organisations, NATO and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Tánaiste to come into this House and talk to us in bland terms about the Petersberg Tasks. It is worth recalling the objectives set out in the Petersberg Tasks in the declaration of June 1992.  Those tasks were defined as follows: &ldquo;Military units of the Western European Union member states, acting under the authority of the Western European Union, could be employed for humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management including peace making&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the declaration that participation in the Petersberg Tasks involves placing Irish armed forces under the authority of the Western European Union.  It also presupposes that participation in the Petersberg Tasks is a matter for the military units of Western European Union member <Col N="1295" /> states.  The reality is we are neither members of the Western European Union nor is it acceptable that we place our armed forces under the authority of such a military alliance.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes it is not appropriate for Ireland to join this ill-named Partnership for Peace.  The rationale behind it is to forge security links with the countries of the former eastern bloc and the former Soviet Union.  Malcolm Rifkind, the then British Defence Secretary, now Foreign Secretary, described the Partnership for Peace as the basis for the beginning of a structured security relationship with Russia. It would not be logical for Ireland to participate in such an arrangement. That three other neutral countries &mdash; Sweden, Austria and Finland &mdash; have joined the Partnership for Peace is not relevant to Ireland.  All three countries have different geo-political considerations to us and are much closer to instability in the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia.  It would be a tragic mistake to associate ourselves with the Western European Union or the Partnership for Peace and I believe the nature of the latter is being whitewashed. The rationale behind it is to forge a link between the countries of the former Soviet bloc and the west, not to act as a benevolent peace-keeping force. The partnership is a wolf in sheep's clothing, an entity designed by NATO as a means to its end of consolidating and expanding its role as a military alliance.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste unfortunately, is tinkering with Irish neutrality, for which our people have a deep feeling.  This side of the House believes there is a positive value to our military neutrality but one of the tragedies of our three-party Government is that, with its different ideologies, it is unable to give a clear statement on the subject.  It has avoided making a definitive policy statement on the issue, but left no one under any illusions as to where it wants to go.  An illustration of its inability to make a clear statement is in paragraph 34 of the <Col N="1296" />&ldquo;Agenda for Irish Foreign Policy&rdquo; in the White Paper.  This is supposed to be a clear policy position but some would be uncharitable and call it a fudge or worse.  It is a classic illustration of a lack of decision making:</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to discuss with the Western European Union the possibility of Ireland's taking part, on a case-by-case basis...[in] the &ldquo;Petersberg tasks&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Should there not be any discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No clear statement is made but the thrust of the document is that the Irish people will be asked to join the Partnership for Peace, which is simply second-class membership of NATO, and to sign up for the Western European Union's &ldquo;Petersberg tasks&rdquo;, which are also unacceptable.  We do not reject them because they entail humanitarian aid and peace-keeping work, in which we should be involved, but because we are not prepared to do that work as a full member of the Western European Union.  The White Paper is a bland fudge.  It was drawn up by a committee with no specific political input other than the fear of making decisions, as can be seen from the paragraph I quoted.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste will do the nation's business in the Intergovernmental Conference and deserves the support of the House.  I also wish him well for the EU Presidency.  I ask him to fight on behalf of the Irish people and not to fall victim to the &ldquo;me to&rdquo; syndrome.  Just because Austria, Sweden and Finland have joined the partnership, the Irish need not also join if there is no logical reason. There is nothing to be ashamed of in being different.  If the Tánaiste stands up for the people of Ireland.  I will wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that because of the size of this area and the length of the White Paper it is not possible to deal with all the topics in it.  It is better to <Col N="1297" /> deal with a few matters at some length while, unfortunately, ignoring others.  I will not be able to deal with Economic and Monetary Union, which is perhaps the most important issue, nor with the institutional changes proposed.  I will confine my remarks primarily to security and defence policy and to some of the economic consequences of enlargement, both of which are of vital interest to this country but no more so than some topics I cannot cover.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy has been welcomed in many quarters and we should at least welcome the fact that it has finally appeared, some nine months after the initial proposed publication date.  It was originally expected we would have it in ample time to consider and debate the issues involved before the start of the Intergovernmental Conference; however, the White Paper has been published only three days and is being debated here only one day before the start of the Intergovernmental Conference in Turin.  The paper is extraordinarily and unnecessarily long.  It is full of waffle and padding which has nothing to do with foreign policy but was put in because it sounds nice, is quite harmless and will cause offence to no one.  I could not help contrasting it with the document on the Intergovernmental Conference issued by the Institute of European Affairs towards the end of last year, which confronts the issues and has a point of view to express.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the comment and interest has centred on the sections of the White Paper dealing with defence and security but what strikes one when looking through it is how coy the presentation is.  The titles of the two most pertinent chapters are &ldquo;The European Union and the New Europe&rdquo; and &ldquo;International Security&rdquo;.  There is nothing there to upset anybody concerned about military alliances.  Contrast that with the report of the reflections group for the Institute of European Affairs chaired by Professor Dooge, who was heavily involved in the preparations for the Single European Act.  The relevant chapter titles in <Col N="1298" /> that report are &ldquo;A Common Foreign and Security Policy&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Common Defence Policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Chapter three of the White Paper leads us gently through some of the aspects of our membership of the EU. We are reminded that one of the fundamental reasons for Ireland joining was that:</P>
    <P>... it was felt that membership would enable us to participate fully with other democratic and like-minded countries in the movement towards European unity based on ideals and objectives to which Ireland as a nation could readily subscribe.</P>
    <P>Having summarised some of the benefits and other effects of membership, we are informed in paragraph 3.13 that &ldquo;in the next century Ireland will develop a deeper and more complex relationship with Europe.  We are then informed that in the coming months, during the Irish Presidency of the EU, among the items which will be the main focus is the implementation of a common foreign and security policy.  Paragraph 3.21 informs us that the EU faces five major challenges as it moves towards the 21st century, which is only four years away. We are informed that the EU must &ldquo;equip itself to play a role commensurate with its responsibilities on the European continent and in the wider family of nations in pursuit of its essential interests and in the furtherance of its most fundamental values.&rdquo;.  Later paragraphs elaborate on what is entailed by this challenge.  They include a reminder that the Maastricht Treaty provisions on the common foreign and security policy set an agenda for determining specific objectives in this area.</P>
    <P>With this prelude, we are introduced to the issue of international security in chapter 4.  Following a brief resumé of our traditional stance on these issues, we are immediately introduced to a discussion of neutrality which hastens to reassure us in paragraph 4.9 that no change will take place on that aspect <Col N="1299" /> without a referendum.  As if that assurance were not sufficient, we are again reminded of this commitment in the closing paragraph.  In addition we are informed in paragraph 4.10 that: &ldquo;The Government will not be proposing that Ireland should seek membership of NATO or the Western European Union, or the assumption of their mutual defence guarantees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Only after these assurances does the chapter move on to discuss some aspects of the security issue but, again, it is approached in a delicate manner.</P>
    <P>There are paragraphs on the security environment for Ireland, and on UN and regional arrangements before any of the existing European formats are mentioned.  The first issue to be touched on is the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &mdash; OSCE &mdash; which emerged from the Helsinki Conference in 1973.  There is nothing too disturbing in this.  It is followed by reference to NATO which leads to a discussion of the Partnership for Peace &mdash; PFP &mdash; which was initiated by NATO in 1994 following the end of the Cold War, and membership is open to all member states of the OSCE.  Indeed it includes neutral countries such as Austria, Finland and Sweden, so that Ireland is in the company of Switzerland, which does not join any international bodies, and Cyprus, as the European non-members. Even Albania, which, until recently, was the most isolated country in the world is a member of the PFP.  We are informed in paragraph 4.44 that the &ldquo;PFP is a feasible concept in that each participating state determines the areas of interest, and the level and extent of involvement in PFP activities&rdquo;, that its purposes include the protection and promotion of human rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace, the preservation of democracy and upholding international law.</P>
    <P>After this, a decision to join might have been expected, but even that is too adventurous.  Instead we are informed that &ldquo;the Government has decided to explore further the benefits that Ireland <Col N="1300" /> might derive from participation.&rdquo;  Following this show of decisiveness the question of the European Union is introduced.  We are again reminded in paragraph 4.54 of what Ireland joined in the 1970s &mdash;&ldquo;the European Community has always been more than an economic grouping&rdquo;&mdash; and that the 1972 White Paper made clear that our &ldquo;membership of the EEC was made in full awareness of the political ideals and aims of the Treaty which inspired the founding members of the Community&rdquo;.  I will return to this point later.  We are again informed that the Maastricht Treaty provisions for a common foreign and security policy &mdash; CFSP &mdash; include &ldquo;all questions related to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy which might in time lead to a common defence.&rdquo;.  In paragraph 4.68 we are informed that: &ldquo;In the Maastricht Treaty the members of the European Union agreed that the Western European Union was an integral part of the development of the European Union.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later paragraphs refer to the &ldquo;Petersberg Tasks of peace-keeping and humanitarian and rescue activities&rdquo;. There then follow nine paragraphs which set out how Ireland might manage to participate in some of these Western European Union related activities without committing itself to membership &mdash;&ldquo;the Government has decided to discuss with the Western European Union the possibility of Ireland taking part, on a case by case basis in humanitarian, rescue and peace-keeping tasks under the Petersberg Declaration.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Finally, after this extended preamble, the White Paper manages to mention the dreaded &ldquo;D&rdquo; word &mdash; defence &mdash; and the likely topics for the Intergovernmental Conference.  However, having informed us that a discussion on security and defence would raise fundamental questions for Ireland, and having indicated some of the options before us, the concluding paragraphs inform us that &ldquo;it would be difficult and possibly counterproductive, to <Col N="1301" /> predetermine negotiating positions at this stage.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How extraordinary that this should be termed a &ldquo;White Paper&rdquo;, which traditionally contains decisions and statements of Government policy.  In place of that we have a long-winded discourse on the issues facing this country which manages to bend over backwards to avoid making decisions, other than the purely negative ones of saying that there will be no change in the <i>status quo</i>.  This is conservatism gone mad and is a far cry from the early days of discussion on European membership.</P>
    <P>I recall Seán Lemass stating that &ldquo;A Europe worth joining is a Europe worth defending.&rdquo;.  Let me recall some of the context in which those previous discussions happened and decisions were taken.  Earlier I mentioned the White Paper's reference to the 1972 White Paper and our then awareness of the Community's political ideals and aims. Let me recall the earlier context.  The original proposals in the 1950s were for the establishment of a European economic, political and defence community among the members.  The draft treaties were approved by five of the six founder States.  They failed in the French Parliament in 1954 because the prospect of a European army with soldiers from all six, serving side by side, was probably too ambitious so soon after the ending of World War II.  It was then that the six embarked on the more gradual programme for an eventual &ldquo;union of the European peoples&rdquo;, beginning with the economic communities.  However, it would be misleading for anybody who was involved in European policy issues during those decades to suggest that these other political and defence issues were not also part of the long-term agenda.</P>
    <P>Given the developments in the 23 years since we embarked on membership, the White Paper statement on our neutrality position is hopelessly inadequate. It tells us, for example, that &ldquo;Neutrality represents an attitude of impartiality adopted by a state towards the participants in a conflict.&rdquo;.  If there <Col N="1302" /> were to be some attack by an external aggressor on the European Union, is it credible that we could be impartial? Could we really be indifferent to the plight of our fellow members?  Thankfully, with the ending of the Cold War, such a prospect of conflict may be remote, but it does not remove the basic issue involved.</P>
    <P>It is all very nice and cosy to keep picking and choosing the bits and pieces of security issues which command universal support.  We favour humanitarian rescue and supporting peace-keeping efforts as much as we favour motherhood and apple pie.  However, what is the best way to try to secure and maintain peace?  Is it by declaring that one wishes to be neutral?  During World War II, many states were given no choice about their neutrality.  More recently during the Gulf War, the views of Kuwait carried little weight with Iraq. Why did the founding fathers believe that the best way to make a future war impossible in Europe was to merge their security concerns into a common defence policy?  Why did they not opt for a policy of neutrality for each member with the collapse of the Cold War? Did that happen because the western powers embarked on a policy of unilateral disarmament and appeasement or because the West demonstrated that it would maintain the necessary united resolve to oppose any external aggression?  I make these points because the issues raised by defence and security in Europe deserve a far more substantial treatment than the facile and cowardly approach in this White Paper. There is no attempt to provide leadership in forming public opinion.  Instead, there is a search for the easy way out by always focusing on the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; aspects of security issues.  The White Paper seeks the line of least resistance. Unfortunately, history shows that attempts to avoid the difficult and unpleasant issues usually end in disaster. The future of Europe deserves serious and responsible consideration of the issues posed by security and defence. This White Paper fails to provide that <Col N="1303" /> and fails to give the positive leadership the people are entitled to expect from their Government.</P>
    <P>The consequences for Ireland of enlargement of the European Union have been afforded little discussion. Yet, significant enlargement of the Union is now imminent and the impact of that expansion on the Irish economy could be as significant as anything that has happened since we first joined the European Community in 1973.  Several countries aspire to membership of the EU.  Among these are Malta, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania, while Turkey, essentially an Asian country, also harbours an ambition to join the Union some day.</P>
    <P>Within ten years the Union could be expanded to include 25 or more states. Five countries, however, are unmistakably of interest to us in their applications for EU membership.  These five are: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia.  All are former Iron Curtain countries engaged in a rapid transition to democratic free market societies.  Four of these are on target to become members at the end of the decade or, at most, perhaps two to three years afterwards.  Slovakia, on the other hand, is finding the transition to democracy somewhat more difficult.  As long as the present authoritarian and unconventional regime of Prime Minister Meciar remains in power, Slovakia may have problems satisfying Brussels and the existing members of the Union of its democratic bona fides.</P>
    <P>The last round of enlargement caused hardly a ripple of discussion in the Irish political system.  This was due in no small measure to the fact that the new entrants Austria, Finland and Sweden were among the richest and most successful countries in Europe.  None of these states would make significant calls on the EU's regional budget.  Equally their agricultural systems, although admittedly highly subsidised, were well developed and were small relevant to the Union as a whole and capable of being fairly easily accommodated within <Col N="1304" /> the existing Common Agricultural Policy. Things will be very different the next time round.</P>
    <P>The five new aspirant members are very poor countries by European standards. Half a century of economic mismanagement under the Communist system has frustrated their development potential so that they are now decades behind the rest of the continent in terms of economic advancement.  All are much poorer than Ireland.  While GDP per head here is about $17,000 the comparable figure for the Czech Republic, the wealthiest and most dynamic of the former Communist economies, at about $8,000 is less than half of ours.</P>
    <P>The Czechs, in turn, are well ahead of other central European states.  GDP per head in Poland, for example, is only about a third of the Irish level.  The implications for Ireland are clear.  At present we are the poorest member of the European Union apart from Portugal and Greece.  If enlargement goes ahead there will be seven member states poorer than us.  In this changed situation we are likely to be far less entitled to special treatments as regards Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.  For the past ten years Ireland has been effectively the largest recipient of development aid in the world on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  During that period we have received huge financial assistance from Brussels to enable us to develop our economic infrastructure.  Now it will be someone else's turn to benefit from EU generosity.</P>
    <P>Flows of Structural and Cohesion Funds to this country are unlikely to dry up altogether.  However, they will fall considerably from their present level. Major questions will arise as to the way in which we have chosen to deploy these funds.  By this stage, thanks to European funding, we should have one of the finest transport infrastructures anywhere in the world, but clearly, we have not. Our national primary road network is still essentially the same as it was 20 years ago, although a number of bottlenecks have been eliminated through the <Col N="1305" /> construction of new bypasses.  Nevertheless, it is still not possible to make a journey between any of the main urban centres on what would be considered proper national routes by European standards.  Even when present works in progress are completed, the road between Dublin and Cork &mdash; the two main population centres in the State &mdash; will still pass through no fewer than 15 towns and villages and dozens of sets of traffic lights.  The roads programme seems to have slowed down in the past 12 months and despite the abundant availability of funds from the European Union, spending on national roads in 1995 was lower than in 1993.  Much of the available funding has not been wisely used.  Although we were given an opportunity to transform our national infrastructure, we chose instead to channel these resources into supporting current spending programmes, many of them of dubious value.</P>
    <P>We could face a very difficult situation at the end of this decade.  If European funding falls off sharply, how are these expenditure programmes to be financed?  Will we cut these programmes abruptly, causing huge economic disruption, or will we push personal taxation rates to unsustainable levels to pay for them?  A White Paper on this issue from the Minister for Finance might be just as valuable as the document on foreign policy we are debating today.</P>
    <P>The Germans have long been the paymasters of Europe.  In net terms they contribute the bulk of the European Union's budget.  This is not an exercise in economic altruism but rather an investment in European cohesion, of which the huge German economy is ultimately the main beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the single biggest item in the EU budget.  It is estimated that extending the Common Agricultural Policy, as it stands, to the five central European aspirant members would cost about £10 billion per year.  The Germans are already investing enormous sums in modernisation of the former East Germany.  This is taking a toll on <Col N="1306" /> their economy which is now running out of steam.  They want to see enlargement of the Union, but will they be prepared to pump £10 billion per year in agricultural subsidies into central Europe? Enlargement is likely to trigger a major reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  All the trends internationally are towards free trade, an eventuality for which countries such as Australia and New Zealand have already prepared themselves well.</P>
    <P>Rather than a costly extension of the existing CAP eastwards, the Germans may argue for a complete overhaul of the system and a major move in the direction of a free market in food products. We would not have a completely free market but some of the more costly market management systems currently in place would be very vulnerable.  The implications for Ireland are clear.  We receive about £1.4 billion per year in agricultural supports of one kind or another from Brussels.  Some 40 per cent of the value of gross agricultural output in 1995 consisted of direct payments to farmers which were funded by Brussels.</P>
    <P>In the case of the beef export sector, more than 50 per cent of all cattle disposals, both live and carcase, went to what are called third country markets. This is essentially an artificial trade with Middle Eastern and North African countries which is heavily dependent on export refunds; without this subsidy the whole trade would be unsustainable. Our whole agricultural system is still very dependent on EU handouts.  If we do not make rapid progress towards a more market-oriented approach, our food industry could face huge problems if there was a sharp reduction in subsidies at the end of the decade.  We should start preparing for such an eventuality now.  Indeed, in the case of the beef industry, the present difficulties experienced by the beef sector in Britain present a tremendous opportunity to Irish exporters to build high-quality commercial markets in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is a huge gap in Ireland between two vital national statistics &mdash;<Col N="1307" /> gross national product and gross domestic product.  Last year, the difference between them amounted to £5 billion, an enormous figure for an economy of this size.  The GNP/GDP gap in Ireland, for example, is four times wider than it is in New Zealand, an economy of similar size to ours.</P>
    <P>The reason for the differential is the transfer-pricing policies operated by many of the transnational corporations with subsidiaries in this country; this activity is designed to concentrate profits in Ireland's low-tax environment and has the effect of artificially boosting stated GDP.</P>
    <P>Our inflated GDP figures allow us to indulge in a bit of economic self-delusion, enabling us to claim that our economy is about 15 per cent bigger than it really is.  This might be harmless were it not for the fact that the European Union attaches great importance to the GDP statistic as a benchmark for the measurement of international economic performance.  The fiscal criteria for membership of European Monetary Union, for instance, are largely based on GDP.</P>
    <P>The GDP problem could yet come back to haunt us in the context of EU enlargement.  Our entitlement to Structural and Cohesion Funds depends on our poverty relative to the EU average. Because GDP seriously overstates the real wealth of the Irish economy, the net result is that, in the next round of negotiations, we will be in danger of shortchanging ourselves.  Quite simply, the authorities in Brussels can point to our own official figures as evidence that we no longer qualify for special assistance. We will hardly be in a position at that stage to argue publicly that our own official figures are inaccurate and an unreliable measure of Irish economic output.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should ensure that this situation does not arise. He should clarify the situation with regard to the GNP and GDP statistics so that we are no longer overstating our economic situation.  I understand that <Col N="1308" /> the Minister has an expert committee of officials looking into this problem.  Perhaps he might give the House some indication as to when this committee might report or if its conclusions will be made public.  If all else fails, we might look at the possibility of compiling economic statistics on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>Ireland, by any standards, is a very small country.  Nevertheless, there are significant disparities between different regions.  At the moment there is no accurate information to enable us to quantify these disparities and this is something that might be looked into.  In seeking further assistance from the European Union at the end of the decade, our case might be helped if we adopted a regional approach, and if we could show that living standards in certain areas outside Dublin were still well below the European average.  Many years ago the ESRI was able to produce output statistics on a county by county basis.  With the availability of today's modern technology should it not be possible to do so again?</P>
    <P>As I said, Ireland is a small country and it would make sense to the authorities in Brussels to look at the whole island as a single economy.  There are obvious political difficulties in pursuing this approach but I wonder how much consideration has been given to the issue.  Economic integration need not necessarily impinge on sovereignty.  The Luxembourg economy, for instance, is not just linked with that of Belgium, it is almost fused with it, yet nobody questions the sovereignty of Luxembourg as an independent state.</P>
    <P>We seem to be making little progress in the creation of a single island economy in Ireland.  In fact, in recent years, it seems that our economic policies have been designed to accentuate the differences between North and South.  In the area of personal taxation, for example, we have persisted in imposing penal rates of taxation on work, while UK taxation policy is pushing the North in the opposite direction.  This means, assuming the peace process holds, that Northern Ireland will, in time, begin to <Col N="1309" /> enjoy a substantial advantage over the Republic in the job-creation stakes.</P>
    <P>Enlargement will effectively shift the centre of gravity of the European Union from Brussels to Berlin.  If we are to maintain the momentum of the Irish economy in the first decade of the next century then we must prepare for that shift and ensure that we are not disadvantaged by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a privilege to participate in this debate.  I welcome the publication of the White Paper, entitled <i>Challenges and Opportunities Abroad.</i> This is the first comprehensive document on Irish foreign policy and I smile at the criticism that it is late in its production. If it is a little late because it is comprehensive, all the better.  The White Paper looks at all aspects of Irish foreign policy, our relationship with the Third World, Europe and the rest of the developed world.  It also examines our neutrality.</P>
      <P>This is the first time these issues have been examined comprehensively. Governments in the past, particularly Fianna Fáil led Governments &mdash; I always felt there was a certain amount of xenophobia in the way Fianna Fáil looked at the world outside &mdash; did not examine in any depth the way we conducted our foreign policy.  We often did not have a coherent foreign policy.  I do not want to talk about neutrality but I am amused when it is mentioned.  I always make the point that Irish neutrality was off the agenda for a long time and it is only brought back occasionally, when it suits political expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were a neutral country, we were told, during the time when neutrality in the world was a major political force. Sometimes it is difficult to know the difference between non-alignment and neutrality but in the 1960s &mdash; I am old enough to remember this &mdash; there was a whole bloc of neutral/non-aligned countries. There were many international conflicts at that time in which the great powers always got involved.  There was the meddling of the Eastern bloc, as we called it, and equally the meddling of <Col N="1310" /> the United States and their allies in the conflicts in newly emerging countries, in Africa and Asia especially.</P>
    <P>We remember the Congo, the descent from democracy in Nigeria, the descent into dictatorship in Ghana and so on. Positions were taken up on these issues by the neutral countries.  The debates about what was happening in these countries and the way they affected other countries in their region or further afield took up much of the time of the United Nations in the 1960s and 1970s. The United States and its allies insisted that these issues went to a vote in the General Assembly.  Did Ireland join the neutral/non-aligned movement at the time?  No, we always voted with the United States and the western allies; so much for our neutrality.</P>
    <P>Neutrality must have been dead for 20 years as a matter of public debate in Ireland until the Falklands war in 1982, when it was reintroduced because of political difficulties in this House.  Mr. Haughey's minority Government depended on the late Deputy Blaney and a few others who had a very nationalist agenda.  They saw an advantage in a Government with a small majority.  Here was a conflict &mdash; I am not making any particular judgment on it &mdash; between Argentina and the United Kingdom over an island off Argentina, where the United Kingdom should never have been in the first place.  The then British Prime Minister was not a good European.  However, at that time she decided to use Europe and insisted on the European Community supporting the United Kingdom in its claim that Argentina was carrying out an act of international aggression and that the Falklands were properly part of the United Kingdom.  While most European countries supported that position, Italy, because of its links with Argentina, and Ireland did not.  It was not because of our links with Argentina that we suddenly unshelved neutrality.  We adopted that position because Mr. Haughey's Government was a hostage to certain republican elements in this Parliament. It was decided the Falklands was a good <Col N="1311" /> issue on which to embarrass the British and we declared our neutrality.  If Fianna Fáil had enjoyed an overall majority in the House it would have supported the common policy, whether it was right or wrong, demanded by Margaret Thatcher.  She got the support of her European partners probably in order that she would be less troublesome in the councils of the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fed up with the nonsense and bleating on this issue.  I welcome the Government's policy of increasing our overseas development assistance to Third World countries. Since 1992 Irish overseas aid has <Col N="1312" /> increased from £40 million to £103 million or £104 million this year.  We should be proud of this in an era when almost every developed country, including the United States, is cutting back on their overseas development assistance.  Jesse Helms and others responsible for foreign affairs matters in the United States Congress have done everything possible to cut back on their overseas development assistance.  ODA is always expressed as a percentage of a country's gross domestic product.  Therefore, the United States provides the largest amount of ODA to the Third World and developing countries, but it and the United Kingdom have cut back significantly on such assistance.  Mr. Helms, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, talked about throwing money down a Third World rat hole.  That is his perception of foreign aid.</P>
      <P>To our credit, in the past few years we have more than doubled our ODA contribution.  I do not want to hear criticism from the Opposition benches about us not reaching the UN target because in each year from 1987 to 1992, when Fianna Fáil was in Government on its own or with the Progressive Democrats there were significant cutbacks in our overseas development assistance.  In those years our contribution in GDP terms to the poor of the Third World was almost halved.  That is the record of those who may wish to criticise us today on this matter.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the White Paper has not set a target for reaching the UN recommended figure of 0.7 per cent of GDP for overseas development assistance. Only two or three countries in Europe have reached that figure.  We have moved from the second lowest in the league of OECD countries in terms of ODA contributions to having almost reached the European Union average of approximately 0.4 per cent of GDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Third World, at which our ODA is targeted, the picture is rather grim.  It is difficult to see light at the end of the tunnel, although democracy is spreading in Africa.  In recent years <Col N="1313" /> Zambia has moved towards a more meaningful system of democracy, major conflict has ended in Mozambique, there have been significant changes in South Africa, although that is not a Third World country, and there have been major problems in Rwanda and Burundi.  For many years the west has lectured African countries about their dictatorships, tribalism and their failure to live up to western standards in terms of democracy and accountability for public moneys.  There have been 17 years of civil war in Mozambique during which the institutions which we take for granted in areas such as health and education have been destroyed.  Approximately two years ago, through international efforts, the parties to the conflict were brought together and a ceasefire and an election process were agreed.  It was agreed that the winners of the election would form the government. However, I am one of those who believes that the winner should not take all in countries where democracy is established after serious conflict.  It is to the great credit of South Africa that its interim Constitution provided that the first government would be one of national unity and, effectively, a power sharing one.</P>
    <P>One of the South African parliamentary representatives who recently attended the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs said he looked forward very much to the introduction of majoritarianism after the next general election. Even though it is more advanced than most other African countries in economic terms I cautioned him that South Africa would not be ready for a majority government after five years.  It takes ten years or longer in countries where there has been serious conflict to achieve such normality that people will accept a majority democratic government. One cannot criticise certain social structures in African countries or say that their structures are inferior to ours. However, democracy is very much a western concept and it cannot be easily transplanted in countries which have different cultures and practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> In this context I would refer to the position in Mozambique which played by the rules and set up a fully fledged democratic government following elections. I hope that the guerrillas, the Renamo, are now the loyal opposition in that country.  It is not possible for Mozambique to put in place from its own resources the necessary infrastructure by which it can be governed and it is a tragedy that only half the international assistance promised to it on the establishment of democracy has been delivered.  This does not reflect well on the international community.  The Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF and the World Bank are the only lenders of money for investment and they still continue to apply their conventional borrowing rules.  Even worse, they often insist on what are known as structural adjustment programmes which were proven to be disastrous in Tanzania and Zambia.</P>
    <P>Under these programmes the lender insists that certain economic policies are pursued to ensure that the loan is safe. However, they are totally inappropriate to the economic conditions in these countries.  The Minister for Finance attends the annual or bi-annual meetings of the World Bank and even though we are not a major contributor and our voice may be diminished we must be a voice for the world's poor at this very important forum and insist that loans are given to countries which do not have the wherewithal or ability to repay them at the same rate as a developed economy on the basis of developing basic needs.</P>
    <P>I welcome this comprehensive document which gives us an opportunity to discuss our foreign policy.  We do not have a colonial past and are not involved in conflict with other countries. I know from my travels that Ireland is a popular country and that it is a bonus to be Irish.  We must develop our foreign policy to the maximum benefit of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Connor is maintaining his interest in this <Col N="1315" /> issue.  Our NGOs do much work in other countries and I assure him that Ireland is listened to at meetings of the World Bank; even though we may be small in terms of numbers we carry significant weight.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy is an important document which should give rise to serious debate in certain areas.  I compliment the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and his personal and departmental staff on the publication of this substantial document. As Deputy Burke stated on numerous occasions, the White Paper should have been published much earlier so as to allow ample time for public debate well in advance of the Intergovernmental Conference in Turin tomorrow.  If it was held back for negotiating reasons this was not valid as we have had a broad idea of the opening positions of most partner countries for some considerable time.  If it was held back to the last possible moment for domestic political reasons or fear of controversy about neutrality then it is not consistent with the requirements of openness, transparency and accountability. Diplomats, by the very nature of their profession, have little enthusiasm for such matters and would much prefer if foreign policy was above and beyond domestic debate.  That criticism apart, we are well served by the energetic, dedicated and, by and large, professional foreign service which is respected by Members of the House.</P>
      <P>The White Paper should not be seen as a product of the reflection of the policies of the Government.  To a large extent, it reflects the main strands of Irish foreign policy since we entered the European Community in 1973.  There is considerable overlap between the White Paper and Fianna Fáil's paper on foreign policy published by Deputy Ray Burke last autumn which was clearly taken into account in drafting.  I am glad that those who drafted the document used Deputy Burke's work in some areas but, unfortunately, they had a blank on some important ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> I am glad the bedrock of the White Paper remains Article 29 of the Constitution in which Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality, the pacific settlement of international disputes and the acceptance of international law.  I am also glad that the ideals set out in the Constitution and the fine examples set by Eamon de Valera and Frank Aiken in their foreign policy remain relevant today.  I will go through the White Paper in the order in which it is presented.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have suggested that the White Paper is a featherless tome.  I am not sure about this as it acknowledges that we continue to live in a world of nation states which are likely to remain the essential bloc of the international order for some time to come.  I am not happy with the statement that, &ldquo;The identification of specific territory with a particular nation does not necessarily lead to peace and stability&rdquo; as it is an insidious attempt to undermine Article 2 of the Constitution to which Northern Nationalists and this party remain strongly attached.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiment that neutrality has come to be regarded as a touchstone in terms of our approach to international relations even though much of our policy is not strictly dependent on it.  The brief history of it given in the White Paper is seriously incomplete. Statements indicating willingness to participate in common defence of a fully-fledged political union are often cited, but rarely the equally important statements about reluctance to join existing alliances.  The reaffirmation of Ireland's neutrality during the Falkland's war, the strong sentiments of neutrality <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Cold War, the nuclear arms race and oppressive US policies towards Latin America during the Regan era are not mentioned.  The White Paper does not mention the important statement of military neutrality attached to Ireland's ratification of the Single European Act in 1987.  I find it quite an extraordinary omission <Col N="1317" /> that the White Paper does not refer to Article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty originally negotiated by Mr. Haughey as Taoiseach in Rome in the summer of 1990 which gives treaty protection to Ireland's neutrality.  It states that the policy of the Union in accordance with this Article should not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states. This means there is no obligation on us to join existing alliances, to enter old treaty commitments that essentially belong to the Cold War era, and this is without prejudice to our willingness to consider taking on specific obligations that the European Union, in its own capacity, may decide to adopt.  That is our preferred approach.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that our interest is in an internationally secure and stable environment and the debate should really be about the best way of doing this. Although European Union membership has been of great benefit to us, it has also been of benefit to others, and has costs as well as benefits.  We are prone to be somewhat naive about this.  All member states, not just Ireland, are beneficiaries of membership.  Germany is a huge beneficiary of EU membership despite being a large net contributor. Something we must not forget is that employment and much of our indigenous industry was wiped out during the first ten years of European Union membership. We opened up our markets and had to allow other countries more generous access to our fish stocks than we have ourselves.  These are items on both sides of the balance sheet.  If we are to be realistic, we should not labour under the idea that we have some special debt or obligation to our partners or that we have been the beneficiary of positive discrimination.  We have not.  As the person who negotiated the two rounds of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds for this country over the past ten years, I did not once feel the necessity to bend the knee to anybody.  We got what we were due, what was our right, perhaps not all we were due, but that is for discussion on another day.  It is not for <Col N="1318" /> Irish politicians to apologise.  The increase in Structural and Cohesion Funds were the <i>quid pro quo</i> for the intensification of the Single Market and progress to Economic and Monetary Union and were necessary for the cohesion of the European Union.  They were not a special sign of favour towards Ireland by its partners which we will have to repay by other means.</P>
    <P>The passage on the Common Agricultural Policy is rather perfunctory.  I am surprised that there is not much more emphasis on farmers as guardians of the countryside or any serious reflection on the need to maintain the highest consumer quality and standards.</P>
    <P>The passage on the common fisheries policy to the effect that it will be difficult to negotiate increased quota shares for Ireland is positively defeatist.  I have no doubt but that the people in Green-castle who are trying to build up their whitefish campaign for the future did not read the whole 360 pages Deputy Burke will read in that regard.  They will not find much positive in this document.</P>
    <P>I note the White Paper states that the Government fully supports moves within the European Union towards the introduction of greater transparency and openness in the institutions and business of the Union.  I was, therefore, surprised to see in the <i>Financial Times</i> on Tuesday an article stating that Sweden is to step up its campaign for greater openness within the European Union and to have the right of public access to official documents worked into revised articles of the Maastricht Treaty. The Swedish Justice Minister mentioned support from Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands but did not refer to Ireland.  She said: &ldquo;If we do not get support, I do not know how all these countries that have declared themselves in favour of openness will explain themselves&rdquo;. Is Ireland fully behind the Swedish initiative?  The White Paper is much too vague.</P>
    <P>I agree with the approach to enlargement which has been the policy of successive Governments since 1990 at least. The White Paper states that the <Col N="1319" /> Government will not accept an enlargement process which alters the essential character of the Union to that of an expanded free trade area, and that the Government wants existing policies of the Union protected, including continued cohesion and is opposed to the creation of an exclusive hard core.  The policy on Economic and Monetary Union is the one followed by me when I was Minister for Finance.  The GDP <i>per capita</i> measure is 89 per cent of European Union averages in 1996, and the more accurate measure, as the Taoiseach informed me in reply to a parliamentary question on 14 February is GNDI, gross national disposable income, which was 79 per cent in 1994 as against GDP of 85 per cent.</P>
    <P>The section of the document concerning many of the topics of the Intergovernmental Conference is disappointingly thin.  It does not spell out the problems of majority voting on the common foreign security policy where there is no exclusive and neutral source of initiative like the Commission.</P>
    <P>The paragraph on drugs is positively feeble.  The United States actively combats drug production abroad, especially in its sphere of influence in Latin America. The European Union should use its influence with those countries with which it has association or other agreements to stamp out illegal drug production. Morocco is a primary case in point.</P>
    <P>France is making employment the centrepiece of its Intergovernmental Conference strategy but there is no evidence in the White Paper that Ireland is doing the same.  Why not?  There is a timid reference to strengthening EURATOM provisions on nuclear safety. Can we not seek allies in a 15-country Union?</P>
    <P>We have also insisted that each existing member state must retain a full commissioner. The bigger countries in Europe have national cabinets of 20 to 30 members &mdash; France has closer to 35 or 40.  It is pure hypocrisy or self-interest on the part of large countries to suggest <Col N="1320" /> that small countries should give up their right to a commissioner sooner than they should give up one of their two commissioners.  Yesterday gave us a vivid illustration of the importance of having our own commissioner at the table.  He was obviously in a better position to reduce a heavy beef fine against Ireland than the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil also attaches importance to the European Council not referred to in the White Paper.  I have no quarrel with the section on international security dealing with our commitment to the UN and the OSCE, but the case for concluding a bilateral pact with NATO under the Partnership For Peace has not been made.  It is true that a number of countries have joined, including neutral ones, but they are all situated geographically on either side of the former East-West divide or in the former Soviet Union.  Switzerland has not joined.  The countries in question who have joined are all close to potential zones of instability. Some are in a half-way house and cannot wait to join NATO as full members.  Others want a half-way house between membership of NATO and neutrality, giving them an each way bet. Yet others, parts of the former Soviet Union, have no doubt joined for a mixture of economic and security reasons. Irish membership of PFP will be seen in a different light &mdash;&ldquo;Irish may seek to join NATO partnership&rdquo; was the headline in the <i>Financial Times</i> yesterday.</P>
    <P>While the Government may reassure the public that there are no implications for neutrality &mdash; and that may be technically true at this time &mdash; it will be seen by other countries as a gratuitous signal that Ireland is moving away from its neutrality and towards gradual co-operation in NATO and Western European Union in due course.  It is the thin end of the wedge which will be justified for all sorts of practical reasons and to increase our alleged influence, whereas in reality we will have no influence on alliance thinking as junior or second-class partners.  We need to cop on to <Col N="1321" /> ourselves if we think we have PFP involves joint exercises with NATO on sea or land.  Will they take place in Ireland?  Will we be able to choose the NATO countries with whom we wish to have exercises?  Will we have British troops back in the Curragh, the French in Bantry Bay, the Germans on Banna Strand, the Spanish in Kinsale and the Americans in Lough Foyle?  Is that what we are talking about, or will we take part in exercises abroad under NATO command?  NATO does not even have a direct connection with the European Union.</P>
    <P>The separate defence identities have served us all well.  Ireland's position helps preserve the distinction between EU and NATO, and that is no bad thing.  For the European Union to become a military superpower with nuclear weapons would be a retrograde step.  It should concentrate on being something new and progressive in international relationships.  The White Paper seems to indicate that we should create forces answerable to the Western European Union.  At least the so-called Petersberg Tasks related to humanitarian peacekeeping and peaceful enforcement tasks at the request of the UN and-or the OSCE.  Unfortunately, while the tasks are worthy in themselves, the approach suggested by the Government would involve Ireland becoming, in effect, a partial member of the Western European Union and placing our resources under Western European Union command.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the Western European Union is a regional organisation of NATO with a first strike nuclear doctrine.  Fianna Fáil's approach is different.  It is that the EU should be capable of assuming directly humanitarian peace-keeping tasks and this would be an excellent foundation for a common security policy adapted to modern conditions.  I point out to the Government that while Ireland should be willing to negotiate on matters related to defence, we are under no obligation to associate with pre-existing Cold War and nuclear based military <Col N="1322" /> alliances, even for peace-keeping purposes.</P>
    <P>Our view is that any decisions involving a closer association with NATO or the Western European Union would represent a substantial change in defence policy, and would have long term if not immediate implications for our policy on neutrality.  Any such proposals must be put to the people in a referendum before a decision is taken. The four party leaders solemnly declared on 9 June 1992, prior to the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, that any decision related to defence would be put to the people by way of referendum.  This would also be in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court judgment of 1987 requiring that Title III of the Single European Act to be put to the people, as Fianna Fáil had argued in Opposition.</P>
    <P>We would regard any attempt to push Partnership for Peace or participation in Western European Union tasks by resolution through this House without reference to the people who under our Constitution have the right &ldquo;in final appeal to decide on all questions of national policy&rdquo;, as a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic. My party's direct answer to what the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said this morning is that this will not and cannot happen.  Under our Constitution this is a matter for the people to decide and any sleight of hand in trying to put it through the House would be fundamentally undemocratic.</P>
    <P>The Irish people attach great importance to our neutrality and they should have the right to decide whether we enter into a closer association with existing military alliances on the basis of full information on what is proposed.  I would like a cast-iron pledge from the Government that it will not make any move without first consulting the people in the interest of openness, transparency and accountability.  I would like to dwell longer on this point but time does not permit me.  I hope the Government will take note of our position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> We all realise that this Government is all the colours of the rainbow on the issue of neutrality.  The Fine Gael Party to all intents and purposes abandoned neutrality but many will be surprised that the Labour Party and the Democratic Left Party are going along with a serious erosion of that policy for no good reason except the desire to be one of the crowd.  Whereas the Tánaiste may claim for domestic consumption that our neutrality is safe, the message being sent out in the officially drafted White Paper, which will be read abroad, is quite different.  The Fianna Fáil Party has always been proud of the policy of positive neutrality and I believe the proposals that my party and I made last year are far more in keeping with a logical development for our traditions than the proposals in the White Paper.  We should be building up the European Union and not the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>Ireland strongly supports the United Nations and I agree with the proposals in the chapter on its role in mediation, the enlargement of the Security Council, and the restriction of the use of the veto. I welcome the proposal to establish an interdepartmental liaison group and to publish an annual report on UN issues so as to make better and more accountable use of our UN membership.  I urge that the report be published soon after the end of the year to which it relates and well before the next General Assembly so as to allow proper debate.</P>
    <P>We always have been strongly in favour of a ban on nuclear testing and progress towards complete nuclear disarmament, a position articulated at the United Nations by successive Fianna Fáil Taoisigh and Foreign Ministers.</P>
    <P>I note the Government is supporting the ban on the production of plutonium for military purposes and it should also be seeking a ban on its production for civilian purposes because of the proliferation problem as well as the fact that it is uneconomic.  This would result in the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I agree on the need to scale down <Col N="1324" /> arms industries and exports.  In general the chapter on disarmament and arms control is strong and we should pursue our policy at the United Nations without being held back by parties with a different view.</P>
    <P>The White Paper records that since 1958 more than 42,000 members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána served on peacekeeping missions with 75 being killed on UN service and some 750 personnel currently on 11 UN missions. We should be equally keen to participate in future OSCE missions.  I do not see the necessity for us to become directly involved in Western European Union missions which, inevitably, are of a less neutral character.</P>
    <P>The chapter on human rights is laudable but the White Paper contains no commitment to incorporate the European Human Rights Convention into domestic law, as accepted by the parties in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. There is value in the idea of establishing an international criminal court and I welcome the establishment of a human rights unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in 1992 signalled a change to a more progressive policy in development aid incorporated in the Programme for a Partnership Government which has resulted in a virtual doubling of aid.  Deputy Tom Kitt, as the then Minister of State with responsibility in that area, played a major role under the Tánaiste in developing that policy.  The White Paper is a further development with a more detailed definition of aims, and the chapter on this topic is good. The proposed rapid response register is a good idea and there is a broad spread of developing countries with whom we work.</P>
    <P>I support the extension of the diplomatic service in recent times to countries that are potentially economically important to us in South-East Asia and Central and Eastern Europe.  The &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo; concept was initiated by Fianna Fáil back in 1987 with two in operation, in New York and Tokyo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> The cultural relations committee has a limited budget to subsidise non-commercial cultural activity but it does very useful work.  Its role, budget and relationship with other countries should be reviewed in depth and I want to give my clear support to it.</P>
    <P>The picture of our foreign policy is incomplete because Northern Ireland and relations with Britain and America are virtually excluded.  This is a pity.  It means that the White Paper covers only half the picture.  We integrated Northern Ireland and related matters into our paper and Deputy Raphael Burke articulated the reasons for doing that. The Government should have done the same without allowing the Northern Ireland element to dominate.  With our forthcoming role of Presidency of the European Union &mdash; we wish it well &mdash; and the peace process requiring full-time attention, the question will have to be faced as to whether we need separate Ministers of Cabinet rank to manage the Presidency and the peace process at least for the duration of the Presidency. I raised this issue many weeks ago and perhaps we might get an answer to it shortly.</P>
    <P>Apart from a large colour picture of the Tánaiste, which looks very nice, and his foreword, there is no reference to any of the Taoisigh or Ministers who played a part in shaping our foreign policy. I regret the impersonal bureaucratic style of that.  The White Paper will be an important point of reference for Irish foreign policy but I hope it will be subject to keen debate.  I am glad that at last we have it on the table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome the opportunity to speak in this historic debate on the first White Paper on foreign policy produced here. Successive Governments have taken excellent initiatives on foreign policy <Col N="1326" /> but this is the first time that such a comprehensive overview of our foreign policy has been put before this House and the people for consideration.</P>
      <P>There was criticism of the time it has taken to produce this report.  I do not join in that criticism for a number of reasons: first, this is not just a document that was taken out of a hat by a Minister or Government Department.  A most extensive round of public consultation was undertaken in the preparation of the Green Paper &mdash; I can think of only one other example, the Minister for Education's consultations on the Education White Paper.  I attended a number of the public meetings and the fact that they were held in different locations around the country gave people who were interested in aspects of our foreign policy an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I also participated in two meetings on the Forum on Development Aid referred to in this document.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs &mdash; I was Chairman of the subcommittee on Development Co-operation &mdash; I know that both bodies played a very important role in debating issues and making submissions to Government. The various strands of opinion are well represented and the White Paper is a good synthesis of where the Irish people stand on foreign policy and where this Government in particular, stand on particular issues.  I welcome the clear and unambiguous statement on our neutrality but Deputy Burke's position is unclear judging by his contributions to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last year and in his comments on the White Paper today.  To cover that up he is claiming the Government is unclear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the White Paper the Government clearly states that neutrality will not be changed against the will of the people. That is a clear and unambiguous guarantee.  In this document neutrality is not a statement that we will not take <Col N="1327" /> part in military alliances; it is a fundamental attitude which permeates all other elements of our foreign policy. This has helped us to forge links and understandings with countries in the developing world.</P>
    <P>It is recognised in the White Paper that we must have discussion and debate on Ireland's co-operation with other states.  If we were to follow the logic of what Deputy Burke said, we would not be in the United Nations or in the OSCE.  As members of those organisations we must co-operate to some degree with nuclear powers, such as France, Britain, China and others.</P>
    <P>We co-operate with them in humanitarian, peacekeeping and security areas. To say that any link with the Partnership for Peace, the Western European Union or other similar organisation means abandoning our neutrality is a fundamental contradiction in terms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke is disingenuous in what he has put forward here and in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Deputy Burke managed to confuse his party colleagues on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last year when he made his party's submission on the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union.  He stated:</P>
    <P>We believe that the people of Ireland want to contribute positively to the development of a more cohesive foreign and security policy.  Over the past 35 years, since the Congo, our troops have developed immense expertise in peacekeeping at the behest of the UN Security Council. We believe our Defence Forces should be put at the disposal of the European Union under the auspices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy for the purposes of helping in situations of crisis management, where peacekeeping skills and resources would be required.  That would be the best contribution that we could make.</P>
    <P>As we laboured to put forward the joint committee's submission on this issue to the Department, we included Deputy <Col N="1328" /> Burke's particular concern although many of us had reservations about it. However, other Fianna Fáil members of the joint committee criticised that point, not realising it was Deputy Burke's unique contribution to our attempted joint effort.  Having regard to that, I wonder where is the fudge or the lack of clarity.  Given that Deputy Burke is the main Opposition spokesperson on foreign policy, his comments on this issue indicate a surprising lack of understanding of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union, the Western European Union and the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>Nobody on this side of the House is making a blanket assertion that we might put our Defence Forces at the disposal of the European Union.  The White Paper provides that in the context of European and world security we can co-operate with other members of the European Union and other states in humanitarian tasks, search and rescue operations and peacekeeping and consider those possibilities for co-operation. However, we are not saying that our troops should be put at the disposal of anybody else, which is what Deputy Burke said in his contribution to the joint committee last year.</P>
    <P>I question if Deputy Burke appreciates the terms of the Maastricht Treaty which was negotiated by his party in Government.  It states that the Western European Union, as most people understand it, shall be the military arm of the European Union.  Many of us disagreed with that but that provision was accepted by the people and we cannot start rowing back on what is included in the Treaty.  In his article in <i>The Irish Times</i> Deputy Burke has shown a lack of understanding of the links and distinctions between the European Union and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke went further than what is provided in the White Paper in his contribution to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in stating that our Defence Forces should be put at the disposal of the European Union to help in situations of crisis management.  The <Col N="1329" /> Government has stated clearly in the White Paper that it is not prepared to go that far.  It states that combat forces would not be involved in crisis management. We would consider involvement in humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping operations, but would not consider putting our combat forces at the disposal of the European Union for involvement in crisis management or anything else.  Deputy Burke is contradicting his position, assuming he is clear about what that is.  He has misunderstood what is involved in the Partnership for Peace and in the Petersberg Tasks.  I do not suggest we should join them.  Our starting point is that our neutral position militarily informs our foreign policy across a range of issues. Having identified our fundamental values, we should consider a range of ways in which we could co-operate with other countries in securing those objectives. Nothing should be off the table in our considerations, and that is made clear in the White Paper.  The Tánaiste stated that in his contribution.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Ahern to some extent took up the suggestion that an honest and open debate should be held before any decision was made.  I welcome the clear statement in the White Paper that any changes which the Government may contemplate as a result of such a public discussion would be implemented only after consultation with the relevant Oireachtas committees and following sanction by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is nothing more democratically accountable than that, and I welcome that clear Government statement in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas in which we might seek co-operation with other countries, irrespective of whether they are members of the Partnership for Peace or another organisation in pursuing some of our objectives.  We have much to offer in peacekeeping training and much to learn from other countries. Aspects of environmental protection might involve participation by members of our security or Defence Forces and <Col N="1330" /> we should not be afraid to share our experience in training with others or to learn from them.  In the context of the control of drugs, given our exposed coastline, we cannot be involved in effective policing against the drugs menace without some level of co-operation with others.  Those issues should be put on the table and discussed rationally. Members should not engage in scare-mongering.</P>
    <P>I welcome the clear and unambiguous statement in the White Paper that relations with developing countries form an integral part of our foreign policy. Irish aid is an expression of public support for developing countries.  The taxpayer is prepared to contribute to that fund because our people are willing to understand and respond to the needs of developing countries.  I am delighted the Government has restated that it will increase the allocation for developmental assistance on an annual basis to reach the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  Our contribution this year of £106 million to developmental assistance has increased greatly since our 1992 contribution of £42 million.  This year our contribution will be 260 per cent of its 1992 level.  Actions speak louder than words in this context.  Deputy Burke said that his party agrees on this matter and I acknowledge the work of the former Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, in this area.  However, the record of Deputy Burke's party in the previous Government does not support the assertion he made today.  I welcome the recommitment of his party's support for the Government's objectives and I am satisfied that the Government will deliver on this issue.  This year we have the highest level ever of overseas development assistance in absolute terms and in terms of percentage of GDP.  I am sure all Members will support the Government in increasing our allocation to this area on an annual basis, as proposed in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I agree with the objectives for development co-operation set out in the document.  The battle about the amount of money has been won and we now, <Col N="1331" /> rightly, focus our attention on questions of objectives and effectiveness. Reduction of poverty must remain the most important element of our overseas development assistance.  The development in which we engage must be sustainable. I understand sustainable development in the Third World to mean development local people will be capable of sustaining in financial terms and in terms of human skills, technology and public administration.</P>
    <P>Last year a number of members of the Sub-Committee on Development Co-operation had an opportunity to see the work of Irish aid workers in Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda.  On other occasions I had an opportunity to see the work done in South Africa.  The reduction of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development are very much part of that work at ground level, as anybody who looks at the projects in developing countries funded through Irish aid will agree.</P>
    <P>I welcome a clearer statement of objectives in terms of helping to establish peace.  Many of the conflicts that took place since the end of the Cold War have been intra-state conflicts, many of them in the developing world. We have a duty not alone to respond to crises but to give support in terms of education, health, public administration, structures of Government and dialogue between different parties within countries. We have a duty to help in preventing conflict and supporting peace.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statement that we will continue to fund emergency and humanitarian relief and will engage in a less photogenic way, in the longer-term process of building a civil society and social solidarity in developing countries. Even though Ireland is a small country, we are in an excellent position to assist the developing world.  I pointed out to a visiting deputation from Tanzania on Tuesday last that we are the only member of the European Union that was colonised by another member.  Our colonial history, our history of recent <Col N="1332" /> development, our position of military neutrality and the work done by our missionaries and lay people through involvement with NGOs, Irish Aid and international agencies enables us in a unique manner to be a bridge between the developing world and the European Union.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Burton has taken a very proactive role in the Development Council of the European Union.  That council should meet often during our Presidency and try to focus European Union policy better in that regard.</P>
    <P>Our aid programme has expanded hugely, but in global terms it is still quite small.  For that reason I support the prioritisation of countries, mainly in Africa, such as Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda and Sudan &mdash; Mozambique is included this year.  That does not exclude countries such as Rwanda, South Africa, Palestine, Zimbabwe or South-East Asia.  We must be selective and clear in our objectives, and prioritisation is the way forward.  One of the outstanding features of Irish aid is that it is not tied, and that is very much appreciated and recognised by recipient countries.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the White Paper relating to development aid which is very significant is the way it seeks to achieve coherence in development policy and between development policy and other areas of public policy.  I will address trade and debt, two aspects of this matter which were considered by the Sub-Committee on Development Co-operation in the past two years.  I welcome the fact that there is a specific section in the White Paper on both of those issues.</P>
    <P>Through the work of the joint committee we try to encourage greater understanding by Government Departments and at European Union level of the link between trade and aid.  Many would argue, correctly, that trade is more important than aid.  We need a fairer system of trade for developing countries and to ensure that in the implementation of proposals from <Col N="1333" /> GATT to the World Trade Organisation everything possible is done to improve access by developing countries to markets in the European Union and other developed countries.  I am glad the Government is focusing policy in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the area of debt, the joint committee produced two reports on Third World debt.  I welcome the Government's move in the desired direction in that regard.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and his predecessor, Deputy Ahern, used participation in the IMF and the World Bank to further the need to introduce debt cancellation and debt reduction measures for the most severely indebted countries.  They did a very good job in trying to reform the policies of the World Bank and the IMF in terms of the structural adjustment programme referred to by Deputy Connor and in trying to get better consultation with the ordinary people in recipient countries about the terms imposed on them.  On whether we should contribute to the enhanced structural adjustment facility of the International Monetary Fund our money could be better spent than by contributing to such a programme.  Last year money was allocated in the Estimates for that purpose but I am glad the Minister for Finance did not proceed with the necessary legislation.  Money has been allocated again this year and the Minister for Finance has assured me that legislation will not be forthcoming this year in that area.  I would not, however, like to see that money lost to the aid budget.  The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance should reconsider the spending of that money.</P>
    <P>Some people believe our money is not best spent on multilateral aid.  There are questions about the way large UN agencies have spent money, but we should contribute on the basis of the principles set out in this document, that is on a case by case basis after careful assessment. Where possible we should try to gain membership of the governing executive of the bodies involved, whether the IMF, the World Bank or <Col N="1334" /> the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the work of NGOs in the formulation of this White Paper.  Many of them went to great trouble to make written and oral submissions and attend public consultations.  Government recognition of their distinct and complementary role in overseas development is well outlined here.  I welcome the fact that they have been given a formal role through the Forum for Development Aid and the Irish Aid Advisory Council.  The principles by which the Government will continue to work with NGOs will serve not only the NGOs and the Government but the Irish people in terms of our perception in the developing world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy is a major advance in the operation of Government.  There was a time when foreign policy was conducted behind closed doors in a highly secretive fashion for fear of disclosing strategic nation-state interests, and in that world the military review was predominant. Foreign policy was the preserve of diplomats and the general public had no role to play in it.  The establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs was a major reform in this regard.  It opened up proceedings for all to see.  For the first time public consultation and discussion on our international affairs is positively encouraged and facilitated.  Paragraph 2.40 of the White Paper states: &ldquo;[Our) foreign policy is about much more than self-interest... it is a statement of the kind of people we are&rdquo;.  I subscribe fully to that view.  Our foreign policy should reflect our historical development as a nation, our traditions, morals and values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am critical of the delay in publishing the White Paper.  It was promised last year and published only two days ago. The Dáil is discussing this lengthy document which we received only two days ago, yet the Intergovernmental Conference begins tomorrow.  That is not <Col N="1335" /> how we should do our business.  There must have been disagreements between the parties in Government over some of the central issues in the White Paper. This is evidenced by the fudging in the document on security and defence.  The Intergovernmental Conference negotiations begin and we can now initiate a national debate on the central issues.</P>
    <P>The Irish School of Ecumenics held a conference recently to discuss the role of morality in foreign policy.  Some would argue that morality has no role to play in international affairs.  They see the world from a realistic perspective &mdash; anarchy prevails in the world of nation states, survival and self-interest rule and conflict and war are inevitable.  In such a situation there is no room for ethical behaviour as far as foreign policy is concerned. In common with many in this country I do not share that old fashioned view.</P>
    <P>We live in an interdependent world with an interdependent international economy.  The world is characterised by multilateral conference diplomacy and intergovernmental organisations.  From this point of view, morality can be considered and promoted, and states are obliged to do what is right to promote peace, justice and equality.</P>
    <P>We need to define our neutrality. What does it mean?  Different interpretations and connotations are part and parcel of Irish neutrality and many different types of neutrality can be practised. The historical evolution of our policy is important.  Irish neutrality was part of Irish nationalism.  It was tied into arguments about sovereignty and the need to demonstrate our sovereign independence.  It was linked to the Northern Ireland question.  The late Seán MacBride said that we could not become part of a military alliance as long as the country remained divided. Irish neutrality was seen in the past as being anti-British.</P>
    <P>However, our neutrality has evolved. It is now seen as a political value and we consider there is a moral duty to pursue world peace.  That was the view of Frank <Col N="1336" /> Aiken when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs and promoted his policies in the UN.  Irish neutrality is again being redefined in the context of the evolution of the EU.  Our neutrality has a hallowed status in Irish political culture and widespread political support.  The Irish people are proud of our neutrality whether it is defined in terms of its historical evolution or in the contemporary attempt to pursue world peace and justice. We are proud of our policy and we will adhere to it.</P>
    <P>This adherence means the avoidance of military alliances and operations and involves the condemnation of nuclear operations whether in the context of warfare or domestic use.  In that context, Irish neutrality is seen as positive, moral and principled.  It is related to the principles of peace, justice and human rights.  Irish neutrality was originally a characteristic of Irish nationalism, gradually became morally virtuous and has been additionally coloured by moral arguments from groups such as CND, Amnesty International, Trócaire and GOAL.</P>

      <P>We do not consider ourselves superior or inferior to any other State.  We have a unique history and tradition in Europe and we have a role to play.  We have no colonial past and, therefore, we have a special input to foreign policy.  Ireland should take a lead on Third World issues.  The President, Mrs. Robinson, demonstrated that by her role in the Rwandan crisis. We could play a crucial role and take a positive lead with regard to the Nigerian crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who has responsibility for European affairs, wrote an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 25 March 1996 in which he accused Fianna Fáil of being isolationist and protectionist because of its opposition to NATO.  He also said our party was propagandist.  The Partnership for Peace has a nuclear capability and is NATO linked as it involves a second-class membership of NATO. The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, said our attitude to the Partnership for Peace is Albanian in character.  As we initiate a new public debate on foreign policy, are such comments from the Minister of State helpful?  To criticise and denigrate the views of 40 per cent of the population and the views of the <Col N="1338" /> Labour Party and Democratic Left in such an outrageous fashion is completely unhelpful.  We want a constructive debate and I wonder if the Minister of State is the right person to conduct a national debate on the European Union.  His interventions are most unhelpful and I hope he takes note of my comments.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil subscribes to the policy of peace-making, regardless of whether that is with a European Union mandate. Western European Union involvement in the Petersberg Tasks is also unacceptable, given the nuclear capability of that organisation.</P>
    <P>Another Fine Gael member, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, threw in his tuppence ha'penny worth recently regarding Irish neutrality.  He went so far as to say it would be immoral not to join NATO. That is really turning the argument on its head.  He also mischievously suggested that three former Fianna Fáil Taoisigh were not in favour of Irish neutrality and produced selective quotes to prove his point.  That is balderdash.  He may have confused his definition of neutrality and that of Seán Lemass, Jack Lynch and Charles Haughey when they made reference to our policy in that regard.  Fianna Fáil's policy has been consistent from the time of Éamon de Valera and Frank Aiken up to the present day.</P>

      <P>I am sure the issue of neutrality will be tested in any future referendum.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the question of overseas development aid and the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  The question is often asked whether aid should be given to the UN or to non-governmental organisations.  Some people would question giving more money to the UN or the EU for Third World assistance.  We need accountability and monitoring to ensure there is no corruption with regard to the distribution of aid.</P>
      <P>Ireland can be proud of its non-governmental organisations such as GOAL.  As a small nation we can best contribute to Third World aid by giving money to non-governmental organisations because the aid goes directly to the poorest of the poor.  The NGOs have direct access to small communities and their programmes are seen to have immediate benefits.</P>
      <P>Larger countries should promote a balance between aid to the United Nations and to the NGOs, given that each has a special role to play.  This State should not cut back on overseas development aid and if we begin to question the role of the United Nations in this regard we are giving other states an excuse not to contribute.  World aid will be privatised and Government aid programmes will be curtailed.  The United Nations looks at the wider picture and it has no less than all of humanity on its agenda.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay special tribute to President Mary Robinson.  Her visit to South Africa highlights the role Ireland played in relation to the Irish anti-apartheid movement and shows how our unique tradition could have a direct influence on events.  The City of Dublin granted the freedom of the city to Nelson Mandela while he was still a prisoner in South Africa.  We are all proud of the role we played in bringing about democracy and justice in South Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Haughey on adopting my tactics in Opposition.  If he would also adopt my policies he would be doing an excellent job for himself and his party.</P>
      <P>The publication of a White Paper on Foreign Policy is an important event in itself but this one is even more important, as it is the first general exposition of a foreign policy approach ever made by an Irish Government.  The Government is to be congratulated on this, the Tánaiste especially, for the imaginative steps of holding a series of public seminars on foreign policy issues &mdash; the first time this has ever been done &mdash; and for the breadth and scope of the document before us.  The innovative nature of this publication goes a long way to explaining its excessively protracted publication and the curious process of briefing the media, deliberately or accidentally, some time in advance of bringing the document to the attention of Members of the Oireachtas on the Opposition and Government sides.</P>
      <P>In truth, we should not call this a White Paper as it contains few statements of a firm intent to take specific action.  From that point of view it is rather more in the nature of a green paper &mdash; a consultation document &mdash; and the Oireachtas, its committees and the public should treat it that way.  It sets out a full description of the underlying principles which have inspired our foreign policy and continue to guide the Government in its approach to the major issues of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That recitation of principles is useful but the real interest for policy makers and the public lies in the application of these principles to the issues which are current in the world.  I have not read the document in every particular and in fine detail but I think I cannot be faulted in saying that it comes nearest to the application of principles to concrete situations where it deals with current issues in the EU.  However, it avoids a series <Col N="1342" /> of specific statements on the grounds that it is not intended or thought wise at this juncture to prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The document then goes on to rule out some possible outcomes of the Intergovernmental Conference, even if these are only remote possibilities.  For example, it firmly rules out membership of the Western European Union and asserts, correctly, that smaller EU member states must continue to have the right to nominate a member of the Commission. That certainly prejudges a possible outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference in a way approved of by this House and myself.</P>
    <P>I regret that the document has been-drafted so carefully, particularly on issues which will come up in the Intergovernmental Conference.  Most of the issues are not new; they have been in discussion for a long time in the Reflection Group and in the wider public debate.  It would not have done the Government's position any great damage, nor would it have compromised it greatly, to state clearly at this juncture a number of firm approaches to major issues which will come up during discussion in the Intergovernmental Conference. However, as I have shown, even in stating that it does not want to prejudge issues the White Paper is inconsistent, because it prejudges two.  I approve of one and the other requires more debate and discussion than it is possible to give, even in a document of this length.</P>
    <P>The White Paper goes further in its treatment of the common foreign and security policy and a European defence policy than any Government document up to now, which is welcome.  I had hoped, in the light of the refreshingly open decision to make these issues the subject of a public seminar, that we would at last have a Government document which set out to tear down the myths which for so long have obscured our view of the world and stultified real debate.  This means the kind of myths we heard from Deputy Haughey &mdash; the smug self-delusion which ascribes to a <Col N="1343" /> tactic properly adopted in 1939 all the virtues of a full-fledged policy which has left the world open-mouthed in admiration and rushing to do our bidding on major issues like disarmament and development.  I hoped the document would bring us past that but I have been disappointed; it has done some of that work but not enough.  While I detect a clear desire on the Government's part to bring the debate closer to reality, the document's treatment of these issues is far too tentative.  I congratulate the Tánaiste and the Government for wanting to set out on this path but it appears they have also tried to cajole the myth peddlers &mdash; Fianna Fáil in the vanguard, followed by that curious combination of neo-Marxism and Catholic fundamentalism which combine to paint a picture of the world and international relations which depicts no reality which ever existed.  We were treated to more of this myth-peddling today in the House and in our newspapers.</P>
    <P>This morning, I received a considerable package of documents from an organisation called People Against War (Ireland), with an address in Dún Laoghaire.  The key phrases show what general line it takes; it speaks of &ldquo;imperialist or adventurist endeavours&rdquo; and &ldquo;this Goebbelsian technique of demonisation of whomsoever should be occupying a space desired by multinational corporations&rdquo;.  Is that not fantastic?  An expert on language is present in the House; she knows how much words can obscure because she has made quite a study of it, not that she ever obscures anything herself.  One can see immediately from this language where these people are coming from.  Judging by this mountain of documentation, it appears to be from a Serb apologist organisation.</P>
    <P>They presume to lecture me, the chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on defence issues and criticise me for having proselytised for increased Irish operational involvement with multinational military <Col N="1344" /> forces.  That is the kind of mythology which has damned this country to irrelevance in so many international debates.  It is the kind of nonsense to which the main Opposition party subscribes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Raphael Burke published an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning which is a revelation and he continued his arguments during this debate.  It is curious that Fianna Fáil aligns itself with Marxist groups on this issue and even uses Marxist language to make its point. In his article, Deputy Burke refers to &ldquo;exercise of adventurism&rdquo;, a term which originated in the ideology of Karl Marx. Has Fianna Fáil suddenly become a Marxist organisation or, in its craven attempts to avoid reality, will it borrow words from other people because it lacks the moxie to make its own argument?</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke's article also refers to the &ldquo;NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace&rdquo;.  A great way to condemn any initiative is to state that it is sponsored by NATO.  Deputy Burke never once referred to the charter which established the Partnership for Peace or the objectives of the partnership, to which, I believe, the vast majority of Irish people would subscribe.  I travel around the country on a regular basis and I have discovered no significant lobby which wants to create a situation where the former states of the Soviet Union, the states that are now known as the Confederation of Independent States or Russia, should continue to be left out in the cold, feel threatened or believe that the West is against them.  Many people have told me that we must create a situation where the different peoples of Europe can work together for peace.  It is with this that the Partnership for Peace is concerned.  Fianna Fáil is against it.</P>
    <P>If I were to adopt the flippant, facile and easy line that party usually takes, I would have to conclude that Fianna Fáil is against peace.  I am sure this is incorrect, but Fianna Fáil is not aware of what it supports and what it opposes. Deputy Burke has difficulty with the <Col N="1345" /> idea that Ireland should become &ldquo;a constructive participant&rdquo; in negotiations on a common defence policy for the European Union, &ldquo;one which wants to contribute to and influence the outcome and one which wishes to participate in its implementation.&rdquo;  Is Fianna Fáil informing us that Irish people have no interest in the security of Europe?  Is Deputy Burke stating that we do not wish to have any influence on the shape of that which guarantees our security? Is he stating that he does not like to discuss security because such discussion will lead to our making decisions about operations?  The Deputy does not want to make those decisions.  I do not believe that the Irish people &mdash; by way of referendum or any other measure will state that they are not interested in the security of Ireland or its neighbours. The people are most certainly interested in that security.  Ireland is involved in peacekeeping operations in the Middle East, Africa and Europe.  Such operations are designed to promote the security of people who live in areas of conflict.  We are contributing to maintaining the security of people in those areas.  Will anyone inform me that the Irish people are prepared to guarantee and ensure the security of people anywhere in the world except in the European Union?  That is simply not credible or tenable.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of his article Deputy Burke states the policy his party favours in this area.  He informs us that &ldquo;We also favour a collective security under the auspices of international organisations, for example, the UN and the OSCE&rdquo;.  It has, therefore, been established that Fianna Fáil favours a collective security under the auspices of international organisations and the Deputy provides two examples.  Does he favour collective security under the auspices of other international organisations, or is this merely sloppy drafting?</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke offers the example of the UN.  Ireland has participated in collective security operations under the auspices of the UN.  One such operation, with a UN mandate, is being carried out <Col N="1346" /> in the former Yugoslavia at present.  It has been deemed necessary to deploy a substantial body of troops to try to maintain the peace there.  Once this occurs, a command structure becomes necessary.  The UN discovered that it did not have in place a command structure or the instruments to create one and requested help from the only organisation at hand which seemed able to provide such structures, the Western European Union.  However, the Western European Union discovered that its structures were inadequate for the task and requested help from NATO.  When it becomes necessary to take action to defend the security of troops deployed under a UN mandate and remove the capacity of other elements to attack them, air strikes are required.  NATO was the only organisation capable of providing such strikes.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Burke stating that, because the Western European Union and NATO are involved in implementing a UN-mandated operation in the former Yugoslavia, we should disapprove of this?  Will he turn his back on reality and state that Ireland should take no further part in such operations because of the involvement of the Western European Union and NATO?  I do not believe that he would, but he should not indulge in nonsensical and broad denunciation of those bodies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also referred to the Petersberg Tasks &mdash; humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking &mdash; which it appears he dislikes.  Is the Deputy stating that he approves of such tasks, which are the same as those that the UN sets out for itself, provided that they are not carried out by the Western European Union or NATO, which he dislikes? Is he stating that he will have nothing to do with such tasks because he is not enamoured of those organisations? Is he further stating that he approves of such tasks while their completion remains unfeasible or impossible, but when they prove possible to <Col N="1347" /> achieve, with the only available machinery, he does not approve of them?  That is the real meaning of Fianna Fáil's position on the issues in this debate.</P>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Leader of Fianna Fáil, plumbed the depths of ignorance and myth-peddling during his contribution.  When speaking about our involvement with other organisations he inquired if there would be British troops in the Curragh or French forces in Bantry Bay.  He had the ignorance to forget there was a time when the Irish wanted to see the French navy enter Bantry Bay.  This is the worst, most despicable and contemptible form of jingoism and has no place in a debate on foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The White Paper contains a great deal of information, including a welcome chapter on human rights.  It informs us that a human rights unit is being established in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This will be widely welcomed, but what will it mean?  Present and future Irish Governments will continue to work in defence of human rights throughout the world in the UN, the OSCE and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is unspecific.  What will we do, for example, in defence of human rights in Central America?  All the principles are contained in the document, all the adherence to UN actions and our support for UN resolutions down through the years.  What will we do, apart from agreeing with resolutions in the UN General Assembly and in the other fora where these are discussed? Will we use our special relationship with Washington to encourage the United States authorities to adopt a saner, less defensive, more open and democratically inspired approach to its relations with the countries of Central America and the Caribbean?  There is some evidence that we are prepared to do that because, after argument in the House over many years, the Irish Government voted in the last UN General Assembly against the continuation of the embargo on Cuba.  I would have wished that a White Paper on Foreign <Col N="1348" /> Policy would have been more specific, especially in the areas where we can use influence which we pretend to have.</P>
    <P>The treatment of the question of the enlargement of the European Union in this document certainly covers all the main questions and concerns but it lacks a certain sense of history.  I am happy that the Government appears to agree with the view, which is common in the European Union, that enlargement is a political imperative, rather than a generous option for the EU.  I am pleased there is a very positive approach to resolving the problems of enlargement rather than a simple recitation of their complexity.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen a simple reflection on the experience of previous enlargements in which, up to and including the one that took place last year &mdash; the accession of Ireland, UK, Denmark, Greece, Spain and Portugal &mdash; problems were foreseen and undoubtedly fears were justified.  Up to 1995 &mdash; I am sure it will be the case with that enlargement also &mdash; every enlargement added to the strength of the Community, as it was then, both politically and economically, and the result has always been enormously positive.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the chapter on trade and international economic co-operation says nothing about the imbalance in world trade arrangements which works against the interests of the developing world or about the failure of the Uruguay Round of the GATT even to begin to address that issue.  The chapter on development co-operation is worthy, it is classic, it is acceptable in its own framework but it is an inadequate treatment of the real problem.  This document lacks that vital political spark that should illumine our foreign policy. I hope the debate we will have on it will provide that spark.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an bPáipéar Basn agus tá díomá orm nach bhfuil mórán socruithe sa Pháipéar Bán.  Ar bhealach tá sé cosúil le Páipéar Glas.  As Deputy Dukes said, perhaps we should treat this White Paper like a <Col N="1349" /> green paper.  Indeed, not to be hypocritical we should call it a green paper and discuss it on that basis, whether at the Committee on Foreign Affairs or at other committees of the House.  I had hoped more decisions would be taken. We had been promised, following a long delay, that the White Paper would address many issues.  On that score it is disappointing in that it is more like a green paper.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's commitment to Europe.  The points raised by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson.  Deputy Ray Burke, on the question of Ireland insisting on a commissioner, a Minister at the Council of Ministers and a rotating Presidency are important issues which we &mdash; and I have no doubt the Government &mdash; support.  If there are to be changes in any of these matters it is imperative that the larger countries in Europe agree to one fewer commissioner than at present and ensure smaller countries are represented.  The smaller countries who will join the European Union would wish to have a commissioner as this is where the power lies in Europe.</P>
      <P>Overseas development aid has played an important role for this and previous Governments and it has provided the basis for countries in the developed world to deal with their difficulties.  Our proud record in this regard has been supported by the people, particularly through the NGOs.  Bishop Kirby, speaking before Lent, referred to the fact that there was so much poverty in the world today and gave the UN statistic of 700 million people suffering from hunger, I understand the figure is now nearer to 800 million.  This is happening in a world of plenty.  Unfortunately, this hardship is a burden for the people in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Government to stress once-off debt cancellation for some of the countries who are paying out huge loan repayments, where the debt burden is increasing.  There is tremendous hypocrisy where many countries in the European Union support the Third World on the one hand and, on the other, supply <Col N="1350" /> them with weapons of war, sometimes supplying them to both sides of the conflict. This matter must be continually addressed by the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs in particular.</P>
    <P>I would like our commitment to increasing overseas development aid continued to reach a target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  I understand the figure for this year will possibly be in the region of 0.3 per cent, which is welcome, but we must build on it.  The United States is cutting back on overseas development aid and many countries in Europe question whether we should have a target of 0.7 per cent.  In Britain, they say this figure was plucked out of the air and that we should not have a target based on GNP but on some other criteria.  That is sad when there is so much hunger and poverty in the world.</P>
    <P>The two countries making headlines in the Third World are Rwanda and the neighbouring states and Nigeria.  On the borders of Rwanda, in Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi, up to two million refugees live in fear and face uncertainty on returning to their own country.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State have continually made the point here that they are trying to get the international community to address the justice system in these countries and trying to build up confidence.  One of the areas that needs urgent attention is a fair system of justice.  I urge the Minister to continue to build up that aspect of the justice system.</P>
    <P>The treatment of the Ogoni people by Nigeria has come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on many occasions.  I hope that the call we made in this House and at that committee for a complete oil embargo on Nigeria will be followed up.  I am particularly glad that the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is here because that his responsibility.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that the imposition of sanctions will affect the people of Nigeria.  That is not the case.  The warlords in Nigeria are sustained by the <Col N="1351" /> present policies.  We heard the same arguments made in regard to South Africa when embargoes were in place. It is important that we get this oil embargo.  I know a White Paper cannot concentrate on any particular country but in terms of our development programme and our relationships with people in the Third World this assistance should be given to the Ogoni people.  Those in power in Nigeria are kept in power by these policies which we should do more to combat.  The role of Shell International in Nigeria comes into question.  What will Shell do to have the policies of the Nigerian Government changed?  What will Shell do about the environment?  Shell have been very slow to clean up their oil spillages. These issues need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>We must not forget about Latin America or South Asia because in these places huge humanitarian issues need to be addressed.  The Department of Foreign Affairs must continue to work on these problems because I am not convinced that they are highlighted enough at United Nations level or within the international community.  Much more work is done by the NGOs who are working on the ground and who can deal specifically with the very small projects that are so badly needed.  This was pointed out in our overseas development programme in 1993.  There is a great need for small projects such as building a small school, providing a school with an extra room or providing a water supply for a village.  I hope this kind of work will continue, particularly as we seem to be moving more towards bilateral assistance than multilateral.  I ask the Government to help the NGOs in their work.</P>
    <P>One of the chapters in the White Paper deals with the United Nations, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.  It is perhaps indicative of the regard in which some countries hold the United Nations that it is owed a lot of money.  I saw figures for 1995 indicating that it is owed $3 billion by member states.  Some $1.8 billion of that was for <Col N="1352" /> peacekeeping.  It is time this situation was rectified.  I hope the countries which owe the UN money will face up to their responsibilities.  To its credit, Ireland has always faced up to the contributions we have had to make and I know it has been the policy of every Government to do so.  The question of debt cancellation is one issue which must be dealt with when speaking about overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>The other issue which I wish to address is that of land mines, which is part of the whole issue of European countries manufacturing arms and selling them to Third World countries. Land mines are most insidious weapons which have taken many lives, often years after they have been planted.  In the Fianna Fáil policy document we made the point that 100,000 million land mines have been laid throughout the world, most of them in poor developing countries.  They claim at least 12,000 lives a year and up to 85 per cent of their victims are children in countries like Afghanistan, Cambodia and Angola. I am glad Deputy Burke has published a Bill dealing with the prohibition of these land mines.  The issues of land mines and chemical weapons have to be addressed.  As a country that does not produce mines, we can make a start by passing this legislation, debating the question in Europe and, I hope, getting the European Union to agree with the Oireachtas in this matter.</P>
    <P>Chapter 12 of the document deals with the Irish abroad.  I hope the position of this chapter, near the end of the document, does not indicate that the topic is of less importance than any other.  The Irish abroad are often mentioned in very nostalgic terms, but we should have a policy on emigration.  A number of Government Departments deal with information about emigration at present.  For example, the CSO gives us figures on emigration.  The Department of Foreign Affairs appears to formulate our policy in relation to emigrants and funds emigrants' associations in Australia and the United States.  The <Col N="1353" /> Department of Enterprise and Employment provides funding through the DÍON committee for emigrants in Britain.  The Department of the Environment is considering legislation to allow the election of three Senators by emigrants.</P>
    <P>Four Government Departments are dealing with policy on emigration and it looks as if the Government is not organised in regard to this issue.  I would prefer to see one Department and Minister or Minister of State dealing with the question.  We should find out the exact number of emigrants and establish a world-wide register of emigrants.  We should provide counselling for emigrants before they leave Ireland and maintain the links between them and this country.  Giving emigrants a right to vote is one way of achieving this.</P>
    <P>We should also provide help and assistance, as is done in other countries and in Northern Ireland, for emigrants who wish to return, particularly if they are returning to set up businesses. Grants of up to £75,000 are available in the North of Ireland for entrepreneurs who wish to provide employment at home.  That is very positive and I put it to the Minister of State that we should include such provision in chapter 12 of the White Paper to encourage our emigrants to return and create employment.</P>
    <P>Last year Trócaire, which does such excellent work in the Third World, produced a submission for this White Paper.  It is significant that they produced this document in March 1995 because we thought at the time that the White Paper would be published early that year.  This did not happen; we had to wait until March 1996 for the document to be produced.  When Trócaire produced their submission they were particularly concerned about the discussion on the Famine commemoration. It suggested the Government should set up a famine prevention fund, but this did not happen.  It pointed to the contradiction in the Government's ODA programme in that people are hungry while, in accordance with EU policy, food is dumped.  It also referred to the <Col N="1354" /> welcome announcement in 1995 by the Minister for Finance concerning tax relief on donations.  This should not be taken out of the ODA fund.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Following my decision on 14 December to have an independent inquiry, it was necessary for my Department to consider the most appropriate parties to conduct that inquiry.  This necessitated a range of contacts and culminated in the choice of Price Waterhouse. The precise commencement date of the inquiry was also related to the availability of key and experienced personnel from Price Waterhouse.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Price Waterhouse that the preparation of its report is well advanced.  I am also informed that it has received legal advice which emphasises the importance of adhering to the principles of natural justice in fulfilling this assignment.  This advice stresses the need to ensure that it is seen to have adopted fair procedures in carrying out its investigation and completing its report and points out that if it fails to do so the conclusions and recommendations in the report could be open to legal challenge.</P>
      <P>In the light of this advice Price Waterhouse advised me that although it is unable to be precise as to the date when the report will be finalised and made available for publication it understands the interest of the general public, public representatives and many other interested parties in bringing this matter to an early conclusion.  It is proceeding as quickly as possible to achieve that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned about the time lag between the Minister's decision on 14 December to proceed with an inquiry and its commencement one month later.  Given the importance of this matter to students and the examination system, why did the Minister not make a public announcement on 15 December or in mid-January stating that such an inquiry would be established?  The story did not break until 2 February.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's reference to the story breaking is unfortunate. The error was brought to my notice on 12 December and within two days I made a decision on the matter. Officials in my Department did not hesitate to meet students, there was no secrecy about the matter.  I did not deem it appropriate to issue a public statement. I was more concerned about properly examining the proceedings.  I did not believe we would retain the confidence of the House by asking the Department to investigate itself, although Deputy Martin believed that might be sufficient.</P>
      <P>We made the necessary contacts and soundings before deciding to proceed with an inquiry.  There was open communication between the school involved and the Department.  The investigation proceeded before the House returned from recess.  Perhaps the Deputy believes I should have issued a statement because the House was in recess. I was much more concerned that the inquiry's terms of reference would be acceptable to the public and those involved.  I did not think of breaking it as a story.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>I did not suggest the Minister broke the story, we did not hear about it until the story broke in a newspaper.  If the Minister had issued a public statement other art students who were concerned about their results could have made inquiries to the <Col N="1357" /> Department.  The integrity of the examination system was at stake because of this fundamental error and in those circumstances the Minister should have issued a public statement on the matter.</P>

I am confident the considered decision of my Department will succeed in discovering what happened in 1995 and retain the confidence of students sitting public examinations in 1996.</P>

      <Quest>what progress, if any, has been made in relation to the dispute concerning the marking of the 1995 leaving certificate higher level English papers of students in St. Mary's College, Dundalk, County Louth.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hundred and four candidates sat the higher level English paper at St. Mary's College, Dundalk.  Eighty of them were attempting the examination for the first time, 22 were repeating and two were external candidates.  Eighteen <Col N="1358" /> of the 80 first time candidates appealed their results and one of them was upgraded as a result.  A further recheck was made following representations in October and as a result no further upgrades were warranted.</P>
    <P>I have received the formal report on the circumstances surrounding the delay in conveying this to the correspondents from St. Mary's school, Dundalk.  I regret the delay in giving the result of the rechecks.  The delay was due to oversight and no other reason.</P>
    <P>The report indicates that the correspondence from the parents and the school was immediately acknowledged by my Department.  On receipt of the correspondence all 18 scripts were rechecked but no change was recommended.</P>
    <P>As is normal practice, the matter was then referred to a senior member of the inspectorate.  At that time he was engaged in other important duties, including preparation for the 1996 examination.  He laid the papers aside for further consideration but, regrettably, overlooked the matter.  This does not condone the delay and the matter is being followed up in line with the Department's internal procedures.  I repeat that the scripts from the candidates were marked strictly in accordance with national criteria and this was confirmed by the rechecking process.</P>
    <P>When I issued the press release of 1 March last I was not aware that the management of St. Mary's school had written to the Department independently from the letter from the parents' group to me of 10 October 1995.  I was also not aware of this when the Adjournment debate took place on Tuesday, 5 March last.  It was only subsequent to that debate it was established that a letter from the school was also with the papers which had been referred to the senior member of the inspectorate. I regret I may have inadvertently misled the House on 5 March last in this regard.</P>
    <P>I had indicated I was prepared to ask the chief examiner for English, with the chief advising examiner and the deputy <Col N="1359" /> chief inspector, to again visit the school by appointment to meet all three teachers and the principal, but this did not take place because the school side wished to broaden the scope of the meeting.</P>
    <P>The school and the parents wished the meeting to address the issue as to why candidates from the school with different perceived abilities were awarded the same grades and they wished to have comparisons made between the scripts of candidates on whose behalf an appeal had been made and candidates from the school on whose behalf no appeal had been submitted. This could not be accepted. Marks in the State examinations are awarded on the basis of nationally agreed criteria and these cannot be the subject of negotiation.  Having been briefed on the four stages of marking and rechecks of the work of the candidates of St. Mary's College, I am satisfied that the grades awarded are fair and in line with national criteria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of deep regret that the Minister should attempt to lay the blame for the delay in dealing with correspondence initially sent to her on one official in her Department.  This correspondence was acknowledged by the Minister on 13 October and it was promised that inquiries would be made. Will the Minister outline the procedure she adopts when responding to correspondence of this type?  It is clear that the correspondence sent by the parents was very considered and that it dealt with a serious issue.  Having acknowledged the correspondence, did the Minister at any stage between 13 October and February follow it up, check with an official about what was happening, what developments had taken place and whether the parents had received any further communication?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>After the correspondence was acknowledged the results were rechecked.  I have every <Col N="1360" /> confidence that the administrative procedure was followed through.  Although the papers had been corrected three times I did not think it was fair that an error or breakdown in communications should have caused so much disquiet to the parents, school and pupils.  I bent over backwards to make up for this breakdown in communications by arranging for officials to visit the school in February.  I regret the breakdown in communications which should not have happened.</P>
      <P>An internal investigation will be carried out to ensure that this problem does not again arise.  If we learn from this unfortunate incident and ensure that the procedures are tightened then we can move forward with confidence.</P>

When the matter was brought to my attention in February I took the exceptional step of facilitating the opening up of communication.  That is an honest account of what happened.  I arranged for officials to visit the school because I took seriously this breakdown <Col N="1361" /> in communications.  I assure the Deputy and students who will sit the examination this year that the communication system will not break down again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a wide-ranging issue which deals with more than the delay in replying to the correspondence. The Minister has revealed that no meeting has taken place to date and none will apparently take place.  The terms of reference being laid down by departmental officials on the structure and content of the meeting are much too restrictive.  The idea of appointing an independent chairperson is undermined if the meeting is to be ring-fenced in advance.  There has been a clear attempt to ring-fence the meeting between the parents, the teachers and Department officials, giving the independent chairperson little room for manoeuvre in arbitrating independently on the issue. The Minister raised false expectations among the parents by appointing an independent chairperson and not following through on the implications of that decision.  The parents are extremely frustrated as a result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was never a question of renegotiating these marks. The papers were checked and rechecked and I have absolute confidence that they were marked according to national criteria.  I was facilitating the communication of that information to the parents.  However, it was not acceptable that I should extend the terms of reference by examining papers of pupils <Col N="1362" /> who had not sought a recheck.  At that stage the terms demanded for the meeting were outside the scope of any form of communication.  I had to convey that it was not a meeting for negotiation and that the papers had been corrected a sufficient number of times by three correctors overseen by the subject inspector and the senior inspector.  I am confident that those papers were marked in the way that all other papers were marked.  To enter into a meeting under an independent chairperson and put on the table the question of making comparisons with students who had never asked for a recheck was not acceptable to me or to the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of comparing the scripts of those who had sought rechecks and those who had not was raised and discussed with Department officials at earlier meetings between the parents and the teachers.  Preliminary agreement was given by the officials at one such meeting.  It would be unfair to reverse that decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the core issue not the integrity of the marking system applied to leaving certificate honours English? A senior teacher in the school with ten years senior examining experience with the Department is of the opinion, along with other senior teachers, that the marking in this instance was seriously askew with 72 students bunched together around the same grades.  That is the core issue.  We need a mechanism to resolve that issue and the parents have put forward a reasonable one. There has been an attempt to cover up in order to protect the examination system itself.  There seems to be a view abroad &mdash; we have heard it from officials off the record &mdash; that an appalling vista will open up if anything breaks in this regard.</P>

I refer the Deputy to the preface to the White Paper which states that the budget for education is one that is subject to yearly consultation between the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance within the Maastricht Treaty guidelines. The budget of the Department of Education has increased substantially each year I have been in Marlborough Street. The Government has given a commitment to the establishment of the regional education boards.  That in itself says more about the willingness of the Government to secure this legislation which will have widespread implications for the whole structure of education and how it is delivered.  The Vote was for more than £2 billion, and I have agreement with Government colleagues in relation to delivering that centrally in Marlborough Street so the boards will make a great contribution to necessary changes in structures in the education system.</P>

      <P>I know this has been the subject of earlier questions.  I refer the Deputy to the commitment in the foreword of the White Paper as it has implications for many sectors where we are bringing about change.  The Government is committed to bringing about change within the constraints of the Maastricht guidelines.  The Department is focused on preparing the legislation. The heads of the Bill have been approved by the Cabinet.  When the <Col N="1366" /> legislation comes to the House I am sure it will be debated line by line.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received the report of the Working Group on Third Level Private Commercial Colleges.  The working group was required to make recommendations to me on the following <Col N="1368" /> issues: (a)  a code of standards for the purposes of approving colleges and courses which would be eligible for tax relief on fees; (b) appropriate administrative arrangements and procedures for determining those colleges and courses which comply with the code of standards; and (c) guidelines for determining the amount of tuition fees that I should approve, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in respect of each approved course for the purposes of tax relief.</P>
    <P>I expect to take decisions on the report in the near future.  I will then, in accordance with the provisions in the 1995 Finance Act, seek the approval of the Minister for Finance for the codes of standards and the level of tuition fees that will be eligible for tax relief.  I will make copies of the report available to the public when I am in a position to make an announcement about these matters.</P>
    <P>In preparing its report the working group considered submissions from a number of private colleges, including the Higher Education Colleges Association. The group also met representatives of the Higher Education Colleges Association.  Officials from my Department will be available to meet the association.</P>

The Minister as the political head of the Department will make the ultimate decisions.</P>

      <P>I have spelled out to the Deputy the way in which this is proceeding.  I suggest he should not attempt to read my mind.  The working group was set up.  A public advertisement was placed in the newspapers and every opportunity was given to people to make submissions.  Those who did so were the Higher Education Colleges Association comprising the Byrne College and HSI College in Limerick, the Mid-West Business Institute, Skerries Business College, Griffith College, LSB College and the American College. <Col N="1370" /> Their submissions were considered very seriously.  There were submissions also from Portobello College, St. Nicholas College, Loreto Business College, Leinster Business Institute, the Montessori Education Centre, the Gaiety School of Acting, the Business and Education College in Cork, the Institute of Public Administration, the Union of Students of Ireland.  The working group met the Higher Education Colleges Association and Mr. Ray Kearns of Portobello College in the course of its work. The Deputy can be assured that they were given the opportunity to make the points they wished to make.  The report is with me and I will be making decisions with the Minister for Finance. Those decisions will be conveyed to all people whom we met and the report will be put in the public domain.  I think I should concentrate on doing that.  The information must be available by 1 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to have a problem with meeting groups and delegations generally.  I regret that I have not received confirmation that she will meet representatives of this association prior to making the decisions.  Will she agree that since the introduction of free fees students attending NCEA designated courses in independent colleges are unfairly discriminated against in that they must pay fees and many of them attend those colleges because of the lack of places in public colleges?  Having regard to the time factor, there is an urgent need to ensure social equity in the treatment of students attending those colleges, particularly prior to the new academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's comments.  I do not consider those students are discriminated against as extra places have been made available and a regressive tax has been abolished. I responded to calls by the Deputy two years ago to open third level State institutions to students through the abolition of fees.  There is a commitment in the 1995 Finance Act to allow tax relief on tuition fees paid to private colleges.  I <Col N="1371" /> will communicate the decisions and recommendations taken to the Deputy and I will publish the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give priority to providing grant aid to students on approved NCEA courses in private colleges here over students in British colleges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not asked to prioritise in that way.  The 1995 Finance Act provides for tax relief on tuition fees paid to private colleges for approved courses.  The Act states that courses and colleges will be approved by the Minister for Education having regard to a code of standards laid down by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  A commitment was given that tax relief on fees paid in the 1996-97 tax year will come into effect in that year.  The Act also requires the Minister for Education to provide the Revenue Commissioners with relevant information on or before 1 July.  We are on time in meeting that commitment.  I was not asked to make a difficult choice on this matter.  The question refers to the commitment given on this matter in the Finance Act.  I assure Deputies that I will meet that commitment and will put the report into the public arena.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The key point in terms of social equity is that students attending NCEA approved courses in independent colleges should qualify for the same financial support as that given to students attending other State-funded institutions.

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister has the report, that many students are preparing for their leaving certificates and that their parents are anxious about what will be available at the beginning of September, will she publish the report to allow decisions to be made prior to July and closer to the end of the academic year?</P>

Under the Finance Act a commitment in this regard was given to meet the 1 July deadline.  I will consider the Deputy's points.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>whether she is committed to the growth and development of a fully fledged independent regional technical college in Castlebar, County Mayo; and financial resources, if any, what have been made available in the 1996 Estimates to give effect to such growth and expansion.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6846/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of the order of £2.2 million has been expended to date on third level capital developments at the Castlebar campus.  A further provision of around £450,000 has been included in my Department's 1996 capital programme to meet the final costs of the current project.  A recent proposal from Galway regional technical college to expand facilities at the Castlebar <Col N="1373" /> campus is being evaluated by my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department does not allocate specific recurrent funding for the Castlebar campus.  Such provision is a matter for Galway regional technical college from within its annual budget.  It is estimated that such recurrent funding is in excess of £1 million.</P>
      <P>The development of the Castlebar campus of Galway regional technical college is a new and unique concept in the regional technical college sector. The steering committee on the future development of higher education recommended in its report that this new concept should be kept under review over the next three to five years.  Pending this review of the development, it would be premature to make decisions on the question of a fully independent regional technical college for Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on concerns expressed by the regional technical college action committee in Castlebar that the Department of Education has not adopted a proactive approach to the growth and development of the facility at Castlebar? That committee is extremely concerned about the Minister's lack of political commitment to develop this facility into a fully fledged independent regional technical college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reassure the people of Castlebar, including those in the action committee, that a financial commitment to the facility there has been met.  I demonstrated my commitment to the success of the Castlebar campus by visiting it and I was delighted with the welcome I received.  There is a financial commitment to that campus to accommodate the educational needs of the people in Mayo and the surrounding region.  The Programme for Government stated that we would consolidate and develop the educational programme in Castlebar.  That has been done and development will continue. The steering committee established to report on the future development of <Col N="1374" /> higher education needs recommended that the position should be kept under review to evaluate the success and effectiveness of the second campus concept and its impact on other institutions in the region over, say, three to five years. It recommended that emphasis should be placed on the development of specialisations linked to local needs.  I met any commitment I gave by investment in that facility.  It is very much part of the overall picture addressed by the steering committee.  The campus was opened in the past year and it was agreed it would be reviewed in three to five years.  I must wait for that review. It is premature to question the Government's commitment to the facility which has been opened for one academic year. A firm commitment to the needs in that area is evidenced by the building of that complex and facilities on that campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern about this matter in the region and the articulation of it in the terms I outlined to the Minister, is that the language used in the context of Castlebar in the Programme for Government is much different from that used in dealing with facilities at Dún Laoghaire and Tipperary.  The term &ldquo;consolidation&rdquo; does not give great grounds for optimism that the Department will take a lead role in expanding and developing the facility at Castlebar.  National decisions will impinge on the development in Castlebar of degree courses and particular flagship courses.  There is a view that the Department is not taking a leadership role in developing the facility in Castlebar. In the context of other developments it is considered the poor relation.</P>

      <P>I reassure those who are concerned about this matter that the Government is committed to and has made a concrete investment in the Castlebar campus.  The steering committee recommended that its development be reviewed in three to five years' time, and that will be done. It is timely as the first academic year <Col N="1375" /> draws to a close to congratulate all those involved in this unique development. We are very concerned it will be a great success for the sector and the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 13, 22, 29, 30, 33, 39, 41, 48, 52, 57 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>It is my policy to provide suitable equipment and reading materials, including Perkins braillers and brailled reading materials, to pupils with visual impairments who need them both in ordinary and special schools.  Requests for conversion of specific textbooks into braille come through my Department's visiting teacher service and directly from the special schools for pupils with visual impairments.</P>
      <P>The service for the brailling of textbooks for students with visual impairment is provided, through an arrangement between my Department and the Department of Justice, by Arbour Hill Prison.  The brailling process at Arbour Hill uses modern computer-based technology. The equipment is supplied and funded by the Department of Justice. The cost of brailling textbooks is borne by my Department and are supplied free to students at first and second levels.</P>
      <P>The service provided by Arbour Hill is reviewed on a continuing basis by officials of my Department.  The visiting teacher service of my Department is in regular contact with students with visual impairments, their parents and their teachers.  I am assured that they find the existing service satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's assurance that the parents find the system satisfactory is extraordinary given that the question was tabled on foot of complaints from parents and particularly from one organisation representing children with visual impairment.  I ask the Minister to consider taking complete control of the braille service, the production of books, repair of braille machines and so on.  The Department of Education should contact DCU or UCD where technology is available to develop a first class service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister concerned that some students have experienced delays of up to six months in getting the required school books?  Children with visual <Col N="1378" /> impairment should not be disadvantaged in securing textbooks, they should receive a similar service to that provided for other children.  I am concerned that parents who have to bring braille machines to Arbour Hill very often have to wait with their children in the prison waiting room.  It is unfair and unsatisfactory in this modern age that people with such a disability are treated in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that students feel they are treated badly. There are no more than 70 students in the education system who are fully braille dependent.  Two years ago complaints were made of delays in providing school books.  That arose from the fact that there were many textual changes within the curriculum and the books were not sent to Arbour Hill in time for the start of the new school year.  There was genuine concern that the matter was not treated with the required urgency.  I have been assured that these difficulties have been overcome.  There will be a meeting with the authorities in Arbour Hill, representatives of special schools and the visiting teacher service in the near future to discuss existing arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to investigate the matter further.  Will she agree to meet the organisation involved &mdash; I will supply the names to her?  It is important that she directly hear the views of those availing of the service.  I urge her to seriously consider establishing a new system because I am informed that the existing system is a hit and miss affair, with no continuity or consistency in delivery of the service. The children involved deserve the best and should be treated in the same way as other school children.  I urge the Minister to consider using the available technologies in DCU and UCD to establish a new system, which would also provide considerable employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that these students feel in any <Col N="1379" /> way discriminated against.  The forum referred to will provide an opportunity for representatives from the special schools in question, the visiting teacher service and the authorities in Arbour Hill to express their concerns.  I visited the brailling service in UCD and was surprised at the process that must be gone through in brailling a book.  Some publishers are very helpful in that they do not allow copyright laws to get in the way of making discs available, which would be a much easier and quicker service. Technology is improving all the time and the education needs of these students will be met by the Department.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>the funds from the EU and other sources available for the southern Border counties; the funds that are additional or consequent on the peace process; and the purposes for which they have been or will be used in each of the years from 1994 to 1996.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3928/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main EU sources of funding from my Department are the Operational Programmes for Human Resources Development, Tourism and Industrial Development.  These come under the Community Support Framework 1994-1999.  The education measures aided under these operational programmes are national programmes delivered by vocational education committees, second level schools, regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities as well as the capital programmes at second and third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU aid for these programmes in 1994 in the southern Border counties, including capital, amounted to almost £13 million.  The figure for 1995 is not yet available; the necessary data from vocational education committees, schools and colleges is being collated by my Department at present.  The estimate of EU aid for the southern Border <Col N="1380" /> counties for 1995 and 1996 is in the region of £19 million per annum.</P>
    <P>In addition to the mainstream operational programmes, education sector activities are also eligible for EU aid under a number of Community initiatives, including the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. This programme has particular relevance for the Border counties &mdash; North and South.</P>
    <P>Management and administration of measures under this programme, including the measures relevant to the education sector, have been allocated to Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd. and the Combat Poverty Agency.  These agencies will jointly administer the measures, primarily through a joint management committee. The allocation to the education sector will depend on the extent to which project promoters apply and are successful in securing funding for education-related projects.</P>
    <P>Other sources of EU funding in the education sector are the EU acting programmes &mdash; SOCRATES and LEONARDO DA VINCI.  Within the framework of the European Commission guidelines and eligibility criteria for these programmes, individuals and education interests throughout the State, including the Border counties, may apply for assistance under these programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister guarantee that the funding which will be made available through the Delors package will be additional, that is, over and above the operational programme funding?  What role will the Department have in the administration of the Delors package which is to be administered through ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency?  What role will the Department have in setting guidelines for eligibility for funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The special support programme for peace and reconciliation is known as the Delors package.  Shortly after the cessation of violence in autumn <Col N="1381" /> 1994 a task force was set up to look at giving practical assistance to the Northern Ireland and Border counties in consultation with the national authorities. The result was the Delors package.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the initiative would run for five years from 1995 to 1999, equivalent to the remaining period of application for the current Structural Funds programmes.  It runs in parallel but it is additional.  Community funding amounting to ECU300 million or £240 million will be provided for a three-year period from 1995 to 1997.  Further finance for the last two years will be subject to a review based on a Commission report.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of information which I will make available to the Deputy.  The Department of Education has a specific role in support of the programme for peace and reconciliation's measures two, three and six, which are mainly concerned with disseminating information and clarification.  The information was circulated widely to all the education interests &mdash; in the Border areas mainly the vocational education committees and the regional technical colleges.  The implementation of these measures is still at an early stage and proposals from promoters are still coming in.</P>
      <P>I have a responsibility to broadcast this information.  There are many different programmes and I will convey the information to the Deputy.  The main role of the Department is in disseminating information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main concerns of Deputies from Border areas is that money which has been earmarked through the operational programme may be reduced and supplemented by EU funding through the Delors package and INTERREG.  This has been done by the Minister for the Environment and I would like a guarantee it will not be done by the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise it is quite complex and has not been finalised.  Many of us are anxious that through measure six projects other than those that might be <Col N="1382" /> termed &ldquo;mainstream education&rdquo; would be eligible for funding, in particular outdoor pursuit centres.  Will the Minister meet with ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency to ensure there is no misunderstanding with regard to eligibility criteria?  Will she guarantee that she will be vigilant in the allocation of funding to ensure it will be additional?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's points.  The main role for the Department is in the dissemination of information and we might proceed in greater detail on the different measures when I make the information available to the Deputy.  The issue includes the Community initiatives, INTERREG and the guidelines, and we are at an early stage. I take the Deputy's point about additionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the existence of strong, efficient and effective vocational education committees in the Border counties is useful in the context of this additional European funding, that they have proved to be an effective conduit and partner in the decision making process for the allocation of the funds and that the experience demands that the Minister adopt a more benign attitude to the vocational education committees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are national programmes delivered by many of the partners.  The vocational education committees played a positive role along with the second level schools, the regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities. Without any of those bodies there would be difficulty in disseminating relevant programmes.  I thank all the partners in education who play a positive role in ensuring that this generous investment is reaching those who can respond best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Border county vocational education committees have any further confidence they will not be abolished by the Minister following the <Col N="1383" /> establishment of the regional education boards?  This is a real concern in the Border counties.</P>

      <P>Why have I had to wait until March 1996 to get this reply? This is not an isolated incident.  It is not unusual to have to wait so long to get a simple factual reply from her Department. Every time I ask a member of this Government a question on any matter I am told that a commission, committee or working group is examining it.  Other Members are more fortunate in getting replies.  What is the explanation for the decision to appoint a full-time stiúrthóir in Port Láirge yet a similar decision could not be made for a city the size of Galway?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's remarks about waiting for a reply to his correspondence and I will convey them to the relevant officials.  On the specific question concerning the Galway Education Centre, some centres have been established while others are under consideration. Phase I has commenced and active consideration is being given to identifying the areas where full-time education centres should be established. I assure the Deputy that when those decisions are taken neither he nor the Galway Education Centre, which I hold in high esteem, will have to wait the same length of time for the information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">

      <P>The Minister said she will convey my remarks to officials in her Department but it was the Minister who wrote to me saying she would be in contact with me soon.  &ldquo;Tá fiosrucháin á dhéanamh agam sa cheist seo agus scríobhfaidh mé chugat chomh luath agus is féidir,&rdquo; a dúirt sí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That letter came from the Minister, not an official, and it is unfair of her to blame people who cannot be here to defend themselves if a system fails in <Col N="1385" /> her office.

      <P>Why do we not get replies from the Department when they are promised by the Minister?  In regard to my original question, the Minister said the matter is under active consideration. Is she telling me that 18 months ago it was also under active consideration? Does the Minister believe that spending 18 months cogitating over a matter is &ldquo;active consideration&rdquo;?

      <P>I again apologise to the Deputy for any discourtesy arising from delays to correspondence.  During the term of the Structural Funds investment education centres will be upgraded in the area for which I have responsibility.  Phase I has begun and decisions on Phase II will be taken. &ldquo;Inactive&rdquo; is like a stone in a fireplace but that is not how I would describe Galway and other areas to which we make more funding available as it comes on-stream.  We are all well aware of the work of the Galway Education Centre, particularly in regard to the in-career development unit in the Department which was given an allocation of £10,000 for operational costs in 1995.</P>

      <P>This is the third time the Minister has had to apologise for delays in replying to correspondence.  Something is dreadfully wrong in the Minister's office, and it is not a laughing matter. On a serious issue earlier today she apportioned blame to a senior official in her Department for the delay in relation to the examinations issue.  The Minister <Col N="1386" /> signed the letters of acknowledgment.  It is extraordinary that it takes months for Members of this House to receive considered replies from the Minister who must accept responsibility for the operation of her office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter must be kept in proportion.  My Department receives approximately 1,000 letters a week and the number of delays compared to the number of letters received is quite small.  I agree there should not be any delays and I have been willing to apologise to the House for delays which occurred.  When such delays are brought to my attention I investigate the system that allows that to happen so as to ensure delays do not occur in the future. I would not like the view to be conveyed to the public that the system is inefficient; the system is generally efficient and is handled well by the officials in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the system is efficient and Members of this House, in the first instance, should receive priority over any system.  The Minister has been in office for more than three years.  The volume of correspondence dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare, for example, far exceeds that dealt with by the Department of Education.  There is an urgent need for a review and a radical overhaul of the mechanisms employed by the Minister to respond to representations by Members.  The examinations issue was a fundamental one which should have set alarm bells ringing immediately but the Minister did not respond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital <Col N="1387" /> schemes administered by my Department for the provision of sports facilities include a requirement that the facilities in receipt of grant-in-aid be available to the community.</P>
      <P>The recently published &ldquo;Code of Practice for Safety at Sports Grounds&rdquo; includes a chapter devoted specifically to the provision of safe accommodation for people with disabilities at these venues.</P>
      <P>The code, which is voluntary, recommends that provision should be made at all sports grounds for the safe accommodation of people with disabilities.  It recommends also that access requirements for physically disabled persons should be incorporated in the designs of sports grounds and stands and should be accessible to disabled people, including wheelchair users, whether they be spectators or employees.</P>
      <P>In addition, the building regulations 1991, issued by the Department of the Environment, place a clear duty on those providing or reconstructing buildings to cater for the needs of people with disabilities.  The provision of access for people with disabilities to existing buildings to which the public has access is a matter for the owners or occupiers of the buildings concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but I put it to him that while the code's standards are welcome they are essentially voluntary.  Has the Minister of State given consideration to providing a package of financial incentives, using national lottery funds available to his Department, to encourage the owners of sports grounds to improve their facilities thereby making them more accessible to people with disabilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the need for organisations and clubs to upgrade their facilities.  I have a budget of about £6 million per year for the upgrading of sports grounds and any grant given to an organisation is conditional on getting <Col N="1388" /> planning permission for the development involved.  As I have already mentioned, that would require incorporating the regulations.  Even though the codes are voluntary.  I received widespread support in the consultation process I held with all the national governing bodies.  I am confident that in any new developments, the organisations will incorporate such facilities and that in any improvements to existing facilities, the organisations will comply with regulations and will incorporate on a voluntary basis the facilities required for the disabled.</P>

      <P>While accepting the normal grant procedures whereby clubs apply to the national lottery and the Department for funding, would the Minister not give consideration to a separate grant scheme specifically for alterations to make facilities more accessible to people with disabilities, so that there would be a clear scheme which would act as an incentive for owners of sports facilities to take the necessary remedial steps?</P>

      <P>Within the context of the present scheme, any organisation which makes proposals for this type of development will receive sympathetic consideration from me.  Many of the projects already grant aided have incorporated facilities for the disabled but I treat each application on its merits. Many applications for development include provisions for the disabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue my comments on development co-operation, the subject of Chapter 9 of the White Paper.  I welcome the Government's commitment to this issue but am disappointed that there is little reference to education in the chapter.  The Tánaiste and the Government spoke about local capacity and self-reliance and surely education is the most important part of that.  I have spoken to NGOs and last year had the opportunity to inspect the education programme in the Kilosa district of Tanzania, which showed me the importance of setting up an extra classroom or a small school.  There is a tendency to provide free education at university level in developing countries but it should not be at the expense of education at primary level and the Department of Foreign Affairs should put further emphasis on this.</P>
      <P>The chapter also discusses the prevention of violent conflict.  Trócaire estimated there were 82 ongoing conflicts in the world between 1989 and 1992, of which 79 were internal.  An expert on conflicts told the Oireachtas Joint Commitee of Foreign Affairs recently that there were 32 major conflicts in the world, major being defined as conflicts where over 1,000 people were killed in a year.  The figure is frightening.  I agree totally with the Government's emphasis in this chapter on preventative diplomacy to avoid violent conflict.  In introducing the Fianna Fáil policy document <i>A Place in the World</i> and in speaking this morning Deputy Burke also suggested putting such a diplomatic initiative in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue which needs greater emphasis is drugs and international crime.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is not the only Department involved but it should put greater stress on this area.  We have seen how drugs <Col N="1455" /> have entered the country despite our best efforts to police the coastline, air ports and ports of entry.  They are a cause of major problems not just in the cities but throughout the country.  I hope when we discuss the White Paper at further length we will focus on tackling drugs and the international crime connected with them, in order to make this country and the world safer by eliminating drug peddling.</P>

      <P>As someone who has regularly put down questions to the Tánaiste on various foreign policy issues, I am more that gratified to see a comprehensive policy on our attitude to issues outside our country.  Most people who are interested in foreign policy have been carrying the White Paper with them for the last few days and I am sure it will become our bible on the subject, whether we agree or disagree with it.  Undoubtedly, like the Bible, there will be parts we accept and parts we do not and I hope that out of this debate will come something we can be proud of.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes pointed out the similarities between Deputy Burke, Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on foreign affairs, and Marxists. It was stated that Deputy Burke used terms from the ideology of Karl Marx because he did not have the wherewithal to produce his own language to deal with the issue.  In recent years we have begun to develop a foreign policy, based on a set of clearly identifiable principles, culminating with the publication this week of the White Paper on foreign policy.  I welcome this development and hope the debate will not be confined to this arena, and others such as television and radio.  The people have an enormous interest in foreign policy, so I hope the debate on this issue will take place at every possible forum. It is our responsibility to ensure that debate is well-informed.  This is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past our foreign policy was largely reactive.  Our neutrality was <Col N="1456" /> developed not as a positive instrument with which to confront global challenges, but to respond to European developments in the 1930s and 1940s, and it served the country well.  If something is not broken we should not try to fix it but we should frankly discuss our policy of neutrality.  Much has changed since the 1930s and 1940s.  Entry to the EU and increasing global interdependence means Ireland can no longer stand apart from the rest of the Continent. During the past decade we witnessed momentous changes which could not have been foreseen by those who implemented our neutrality policy.  The division of the world into two Cold War blocks has ended and has been replaced in some areas by militant nationalism. Members are aware of the areas to which I refer.  Ethnic tensions, nationalism and fascism are on the increase and have spread throughout Europe, 50 years after the end of World War II.  In the developing world, political and territorial colonialism have been replaced by the colonialism of the dollar, the mark and the yen.  These currencies have been described as &ldquo;the all-important dollar, the God-given mark and the godlike yen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Throughout the southern hemisphere, emerging nations struggle to serve new masters in the form of the World Bank and the IMF.  The European Union currently reflects many international tensions. Larger and more influential countries at the centre of Europe are intent on creating a two-speed process which would see peripheral countries such as Ireland relegated to the slow lane.  Both the European Commission and the Franco-German alliance recently produced proposals to introduce majority voting and to eliminate automatic seats at the Commission for countries such as Ireland.  The Franco-German alliance is also promoting the concept of a merger between the EU and the Western European Union which would draw Ireland into a military alliance.</P>
    <P>International news has not been all bad.  Democracy, always very fragile, has taken root in countries where we <Col N="1457" /> did not suspect it would, for example, Hungary, the Czech and Slovac Republics, Taiwan, South Africa and elsewhere.  However, the quality of that democracy varies from country to country. In many regions, dictators still lurk in the political wings.  We must be extremely careful in the language we use and the action we take.  That is why our foreign policy is more important that our cultural diversity is some cases.</P>
    <P>It is against this background the Government produced the White Paper on foreign policy which, I hope, is not cast in stone.  Our foreign policy must change as the world changes.  The White Paper sets out some of the guiding principles which will determine the conduct of Irish foreign policy in the future.  As one of the partners in Government, Democratic Left had considerable input into the policies outlined in the White Paper.  It is reflected in the emphasis laid on Ireland's membership of the United Nations and the prominence given to issues such as development, co-operation and the centrality of human rights in the formulation of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs must be congratulated on producing a comprehensive and progressive set of guiding principles which will help shape Ireland's foreign policy as we approach the end of the century. However, certain aspects of the White Paper require closer examination.  I hope the debate will not be restricted in geographic terms or in terms of providing people with information or permitting them to advance their arguments.</P>
    <P>The issue which attracted most headlines in recent weeks is Ireland's security arrangements within the new Europe.  Following the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Ireland must develop a positive neutrality which will enable us to contribute to the development of a global security system.  We must ensure our voice is heard and respected on matters such as nuclear disarmament, outlawing chemical and biological weapons, a comprehensive ban on land-mines and similar issues.  In the past <Col N="1458" /> such matters were seen as fringe rather than mainstream issues.  It is crucial that we work for the dissolution of military blocs such as NATO.  We must also work to ensure that the Western European Union is eventually superseded by a reinvigorated OSCE.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, a concerted attempt was made to portray the Partnership for Peace as a force for stability in Europe and to sell the benefits which Ireland would allegedly derive from membership of that body.  Democratic Left is opposed to Ireland joining the Partnership for Peace.  The party believes membership of the PFP would lock Ireland into a militaristic view of the world and lessen the scope for developing a peaceful European security architecture throughout the EU foreign policy structure and within the OSCE.  It is clear that membership of the PFP would be incompatible with Ireland's neutrality. In developing the PFP and touting it around Europe, NATO is attempting to establish its control of security arrangements in post-Cold War Europe.  The answer to the security question in Europe is not to give responsibility for it to an American-led militarist alliance. Instead we must build on the non-militaristic structures of EU foreign policy and the OSCE to create a non-threatening and inclusive all-European security system.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left has continuously argued for the development of positive neutrality which would build on the extensive peacekeeping role played by Ireland since the 1960s.  Not anyone in Ireland or throughout Europe need be reminded of that role.  Positive neutrality would also focus on developing a peaceful but effective EU foreign policy and the all-Europe structure of the OSCE, and reforming the United Nations.  Rather than giving responsibility for European security to an untried, untested and untrusted structure &mdash; the PFP &mdash; we must develop new and innovative structures within the EU which reflect the aspirations and concerns of all Europeans.</P>
    <P>From this point onward the only wars <Col N="1459" /> in which we can engage are trade wars. The majority of Irish people are not prepared to see young European and Irish men and women used by NATO as some kind of cannon fodder in an unimaginable war.  Ireland, given its history in the developing world, would not stand for that.  I am not prepared to allow headline writers set the agenda.  It is important that everyone participates in this debate.</P>
    <P>Media coverage of the White Paper has focused on Ireland's security arrangements.  Yet this accounts for only one chapter out of 16.  It is extremely depressing that commentators have largely ignored issues such as human rights, development co-operation, the environment and justice co-operation within the EU.  The White Paper makes a worthwhile contribution in these areas.  I welcome in particular the section dealing with international human rights.  The priority accorded by the Government to the development of human rights was highlighted by setting up a human rights unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs, which should be welcomed by all.  This priority is further underpinned by the decision to establish an interdepartmental committee on human rights and the formation of a permanent standing committee which will include NGO representatives. This should have been done long ago and should be welcomed by us all.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that high ideals are often the victims of economic considerations.  In this context I am disappointed that the Government did not seize the opportunity to impose strict human rights conditions on trade arrangements.  One need only think of our growing trade with Indonesia and the human rights issue in East Timor to realise the importance of such conditions. The most fundamental human rights include freedom from hunger and the right to a clean water supply, health care, education and work.  I often compare these with the fundamental demands of the women's rights movement at a time when it was one family, <Col N="1460" /> one home and payments for deserted wives and widows.  It is sad that in a world of too much people can still go to bed hungry.  The right to clean water supply is essential &mdash; in churches it is referred to as the water of life &mdash; yet we cannot guarantee this right.</P>
    <P>The chapter on development co-operation sets out a number of welcome goals in this area which can be summed up by the statement in paragraph 9.6 of the White Paper which outlines the Government's aim to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development in some of the poorest countries of the world.  The word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; is the key word in this statement.  We cannot allow the developing world to become a social and environmental dumping ground for the developed world.  I welcome the commitment to establish a humanitarian liaison group which will co-ordinate the responses of the Government and NGOs to humanitarian emergencies.  This is long overdue. However, there is one glaring omission in this chapter.  While it reiterates the Government's commitment to reach the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP, the White Paper does not specifically endorse the commitment in paragraph 83 of the <i>Programme for a Government of Renewal</i> to increase development assistance by 0.5 per cent of GNP each year.  I hope this was an oversight and I look forward to hearing the explanation.</P>
    <P>Aid and trade are closely linked. Much of the developing world is trying to cope not only with an ever increasing debt burden but with a world trade order which is balanced in favour of the north rather than the south.  In 1944 the Bretton Woods Agreement sought to address the social and economic challenges of the post-war era and the glaring economic disparities between different parts of the world, disparities which today have left the developing world groaning under a massive debt burden with thousands of people sacrificed to the need to export food to earn hard currency to pay off debts.  Famine is caused not only by drought and crop <Col N="1461" /> failure but also by the failure of the system. During the 1980s it became increasingly clear that the Bretton Woods system was failing developing countries.  Unless we address the debt crisis facing the developing world and ensure that the World Bank's ostensible commitment to equitable growth and sustainable development is translated into reality famine and near famine will continue to be a part of modern life.</P>
    <P>The economic adjustment policies which are an intrinsic part of the World Bank's approach continue to impose unacceptable costs on the south.  Those costs have been compounded by the GATT agreement and its regional sub-treaties such as NAFTA which have given respectability to the concepts of social and environmental dumping.  At a time when political democracy is making slow but measurable advances the World Bank continues to be a profoundly undemocratic institution. Developing countries have, in effect, been forced to transfer their economic sovereignty to two remote and undemocratic institutions, the World Bank and IMF, whose policies are dictated by the developed world.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the World Bank and IMF should continue imposing liberal economic policies on the developing world at a time when the politics of Reagan and Thatcher have been discredited in the developed world.  In exchange for balance of payments loans the structural adjustment policies imposed on developing countries require them to reduce their budget deficit, liberalise imports, deregulate internal markets and promote exports. This has the inevitable result of imposing on these countries a system which they cannot sustain.  At the same time the export-led strategy has been a two pronged disaster.  Developing countries, for example Zimbabwe, have not only been forced to export foodstuffs desperately needed to feed their populations but increased commodity exports have also led to a sharp drop in commodity prices, an underlying trend which is obscured but not alleviated by <Col N="1462" /> the occasional price fluctuation.  If one looks at this area &mdash; the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, have a deep knowledge of it &mdash; one realises that bombs are not the only cause of death, the non-allocation of money is usually the greatest cause of poverty and death in these countries.</P>
    <P>Oxfam referred to the 1980s as the lost decade in development terms. There is a very real danger that the 1990s will be seen as another lost decade unless governments in the north and south insist on radical transformation of development policies, accompanied by an overhaul of the World Bank and the IMF.  In this context I welcome the acknowledgment in section 9.86 of the White Paper that the option of debt cancellation should be examined.  I hope the Government will press for such a cancellation at international level.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the section on development co-operation I wish to refer to land mines, an issue which affects large parts of the developing world.  No one is unaffected by this problem.  It is estimated that there are 100 million active land mines throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  We are judged abroad by our foreign policy as much as by our culture, people, how we treat people in the international arena and how we react in the international arena. Individual citizens do not often know the fine detail but it is vitally important when it comes to taking action.  That is why it is important to look at the White Paper in detail, where it will take us and the consequences.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, their Government colleagues and the Department of Foreign Affairs officials on producing a set of innovative and challenging policies.  I agree with many of the principles which will strike a chord among the public which has consistently demonstrated its commitment to issues such as human rights, development co-operation and the peaceful resolution of problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this document, although the delay was regrettable.  My party agrees with much of what is contained in it.  It reflects the positive role successive Irish Governments and the Irish people have played and will continue to play on the international scene.</P>
      <P>Much of the debate on the White Paper has rightly been focused on defence and security issues.  The reason for that and why members of my party have raised the issue, is that we recognise a major fudge here.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Lynch said and she confirmed my opinions.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste said he wanted to stimulate greater public debate and give the public a greater sense of ownership of foreign policy; that was part of the agenda of openness and transparency. This very well produced document runs to 348 pages but if we analyse it we will see that the language used in it is largely descriptive; we are none the wiser for having read it.  We are confused about the specific issues of security and defence, having waited patiently to see the end result.</P>
      <P>Much of the work on this document was relatively easy in that the material is factual and I have no doubt, having spent time at the Department of Foreign Affairs, that some of the fine officials there contributed to the various sections.  The difficult part was the question of EU security and defence.  It was always going to be impossible for the Government to deal with this issue.  It struck me when the Government was formed that it would be very difficult for it, with the Presidency of the European Union coming up, to accommodate the different views of the various parties on EU security and the long standing policy of neutrality.  Fine Gael stated in its manifesto for the European elections that we should become full members of the Western European Union.  The Labour and Democratic Left parties held the opposite view.  It is clear that there is no room for compromise on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This White Paper reveals a farcical situation.  The chapters on security and <Col N="1464" /> defence policy discredit and overshadow the more positive elements of the document, especially in light of our forthcoming Presidency of the European Union and with the intergovernmental conference about to take place. On the security question, as far as I am concerned, the three parties in Government put their respective toes in the water and then ran for cover.  The end product on this central issue was simply not worth waiting for.  The parties in Government would have been better off if they had stated that they could not agree.</P>
    <P>The whole exercise has been meaningless, a wasted opportunity.  I will have some alternative suggestions to make. The most frightening aspect of this White Paper is the number of times the word &ldquo;consider&rdquo; appears in the text. The Government will consider doing many things.  For example, on Partnership for Peace, the document states that the Government is giving consideration to whether the Partnership for Peace is one to which Ireland could contribute. We are also told that the Government has decided to explain further the benefit that Ireland might derive from participation in Partnership for Peace and to determine the contribution Ireland might make to the partnership.  This could not be described as earth shattering material.  It would not send diplomats throughout the European Union rushing out to find a copy of this document to see where Ireland stood on these issues.</P>
    <P>I have seen many statements at departmental and European level on the Western European Union, but the statement in the White Paper on it is one of the best.  It is to the effect that the Government has decided to discuss with the Western European Union the possibility of Ireland taking part in specific Western European Union operations. It will consider, we are told, such changes as may be necessary to defence forces and Garda legislation to enable Ireland's defence forces and the Garda to take part in such operations.  After all of that, in case we get carried away, the <Col N="1465" /> document states that the Government will not propose membership of NATO or the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The document contains a bit of this and a bit of that.  The authors of the document have tried, by using cleverly crafted language, to weave in and out between the positions of the various parties in Government on the issues of defence and neutrality.  The end result is incoherent and confusing and shows that the Government is not in a position to make any decisions.  In many respects the construction of the White Paper on foreign policy is similar to the process undertaken by the Government parties prior to the publication of the budget, when we got a bit of this and a bit of that cobbled together to allow all parties to claim credit for the final document. Deputy Lynch, whose views I listened to carefully, made this point when she said that Democratic Left has a position on the PFP and that it has obviously had an input, as is their right.</P>
    <P>The finished product is ideologically confusing and, in my view, worthless. This document cannot be fairly described as innovative, because it steps in and out of Western European Union and the Partnership for Peace in an almost tantalising manner.  We are told that the Government intends to increase the level of participation in the OSCE. This is presented as an important initiative but the reality is that the OSCE is not the most dynamic and effective international organisation in existence. It should be more effective in the area of collective security.</P>
    <P>Why should we necessarily move towards closer involvement with the Western European Union and PFP? There is no doubt that this is the way the document is leaning.  The reality is that the Western European Union is not interested in neutral countries becoming involved in a limited number of tasks. We could achieve what the Tánaiste appears to want to achieve in areas of peace-keeping, humanitarian work and crisis management within the common foreign and security policy of the EU. All of these issues can be sorted out <Col N="1466" /> around the table of 15 Ministers.  We could put our defence forces and the Garda at the disposal of the EU under the common foreign and security policy on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>Each member of the EU knows its own strength and the strengths and resources of its fellow members.  We do not have any great military might here, or logistical power, but we have enormous strengths in peace-keeping and humanitarian work.  Our commitment in these areas could not be questioned, and no Member of this House has questioned that fact.</P>
    <P>Ireland's stance, if an EU fellow state was attacked, has often been inquired of.  If France was attacked &mdash; this is unlikely &mdash; what could or should Ireland do?  As we do not have any huge military or logistical strength, we do not have any contribution to make at that level.  We do not have the aircraft or the sophisticated equipment that is required for war.  We could, under a common foreign and security policy, on a case by case basis, provide personnel to give medical assistance and humanitarian support in the field as the situation required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes seems to ridicule that type of policy but in my view he is not living in the real world.  The reality is that we do certain things with great skill and expertise and we do not have the resources to excel in other areas, so a pooling of resources and skills under the EU common foreign and security policy could be put in place.  The case for closer co-operation under the EU becomes even more obvious in relation to Africa.  The EU is duty bound to play a much more co-ordinated role in conflicts and humanitarian crises in Africa. In accordance with its expertise, it is possible for each member state to contribute to any peace mission or co-ordinated effort to deal with a crisis.</P>
    <P>Our contribution to Somalia and Rwanda through the NGOs would complement EU initiatives.  During my time as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs the crisis in Rwanda <Col N="1467" /> was of particular concern and it was frequently suggested that the EU should get its act together and support such countries.  Some neighbouring states sought logistical support to get involved. Many EU initiatives could be adopted in conjunction with UN intervention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal in the White Paper to increase ODA, but the language is phrased in a cautious manner.  It states it is the Government's aim to make further significant increases in ODA in the years ahead, but there is no reference to a scheduled increase each year.  I also welcome the proposal to establish a humanitarian co-ordination committee.  In a crisis it is important that the Department, the Minister and NGOs co-ordinate their efforts.  The problems of Sudan and Rwanda were dealt with in that fashion during my time as Minister of State and I am glad this is being formalised.  However, from the point of view of saving lives in an emergency, it is even more important to have a speedy and co-ordinated response to humanitarian aid at EU level.  From my experience of emergencies, European NGOs, such as Medecins sans Frontiere and British and Irish aid agencies move quickly into troubled areas, set up support systems and eventually co-ordinate their efforts on site.  However, there is no overall master plan at EU level which would lead to a more efficient and effective response, save lives and lead to a process of reconstruction and development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to establish a rapid response register of personnel in the public service and elsewhere who would be available for speedy deployment in emergency relief activities.  In compiling such a list, individuals' entitlements for their period abroad and on their return should be clearly established so that there is not a repeat of what happened to some members of the Defence Forces who went out to help in the Rwandan tragedy and were stationed at Goma.  We have, rightly, increased our overseas aid budget in recent years.  This places additional <Col N="1468" /> responsibility on the Government to spend these moneys wisely and to ensure that the poorest of the poor in the developing world benefit.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government not to underestimate the value of the missionary movement in providing assistance in the most deprived and disadvantaged regions of Africa and elsewhere.  I saw members of religious orders in Soweto and other townships working with AIDS sufferers and the very poor in Zambia and Zimbabwe.  I have no hesitation in recommending that our aid budget be targeted at some of the projects undertaken by those missionaries. We must not allow the recent revelations and scandals about the behaviour of certain priests and nuns to cloud the fact that thousands of good people in religious orders unselfishly serve the poor, live in their communities and care in a real sense.  Our focus must remain on sustainable development for the poorest of the poor, but that is not the case in all EU countries, many of whom provide aid to former colonies.</P>
    <P>This debate on the White Paper will serve one useful purpose.  It will clarify once and for all where Ireland should and can make its international contribution. The most significant contribution we can make as a neutral State is to ensure we have a strong voice on the international stage for the oppressed, poor countries and the developing world.  During my period as Minister of State I was impressed to discover that because we take our position seriously the Irish voice is listened to at UN and EU level, particularly on human rights and development issues. The staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs are committed to their work. Foreign policy is about conviction and I am convinced that, if leadership is provided by the Government, staff at home and abroad will be genuinely committed and supportive.</P>
    <P>Being a strong voice for the oppressed means speaking out consistently for countries such as East Timor. In some cases we may be advised to ensure that our stance does not damage <Col N="1469" /> our international trade relations with large powers.  The protection of human rights should be our main objective and we should not be deflected from that position.  If we compromise we will lose the credibility we have rightly earned over many decades, back to the days of the late Frank Aiken, who spoke at UN level on many important human rights issues.</P>
    <P>We should also be a strong voice at World Bank and IMF level for the developing world on the issue of debt. The Fianna Fáil Party proposed that a special international conference should be called with the specific objective of wiping out the debt that is crippling the economic and social development of many Third World counties.  I welcome the proposal to expand the work of ECOSOC, the UN Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>We must intensify our efforts on disarmament. The Non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference in the year 2000 will provide an opportunity to mobilise support in the EU and world wide to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons and bring about nuclear disarmament. We should also, as a matter of priority, ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention and campaign vigorously at EU level to ensure that happens.  The treaty was negotiated and signed, but three years later it has not been enforced.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support for an international Court of Justice and the strong emphasis on human rights in the document. It is appropriate that the Irish aid programme should contribute towards training the Judiciary, police and media in countries where that is necessary.  It is also appropriate that education on human rights for police and military personnel should be provided by the Garda and Defence Forces.  The people of many African countries appreciate the work we have already done in this area, and, because of our neutral independent status, we are seen as a most suitable country to provide this kind of support.  It is regrettable that time does <Col N="1470" /> not allow me deal with the issues of EU enlargement and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to knock the White Paper for the sake of doing so.  It is a fine document in many respects and I hope it will stimulate a worth-while debate.  However, it failed to give direction on the difficult questions of security, defence and neutrality.  It pretends to deal with them, but an objective analysis will show that at a minimum it is an unbelievable fudge.  It is regrettable that the Government, in the run-up to our Presidency of the EU, did not spell out our position in that regard more coherently.  In my brief contribution I made some constructive proposals as to how this could be done.  It is, nevertheless, understandable that we were presented this week with a confused paper on the issues of security, defence and neutrality.  The Fine Gael Party supports Ireland becoming a full member of the Western European Union but the Labour Party and Democratic Left hold an opposing view.  It is regrettable that on this occasion the parties of the Left did not win the argument and the Government did not come up with new thinking to allow us continue to play our special and unique role in international affairs.</P>

    <P>In contributing to the debate on the White Paper on Foreign Policy, the view of the Green Party &mdash; An Comhaontas Glas &mdash; is informed by the Green philosophy of thinking globally, acting locally, Being aligned to 28 Green parties from Scotland to Estonia to Australia and Tasmania means that Green party views on foreign policy are informed by global realities.  An Comhaontas Glas policy on foreign affairs is based on the seven <Col N="1471" /> principles adopted by the membership through consensus.  These are: the impact of society on the environment should not be ecologically disruptive; conservation of resources is vital to a sustainable society; all political, social and economic decisions should be taken at the lowest effective level; society should be guided by self-reliance and co-operation at all levels; as caretakers of the earth we have the responsibility to pass it on in a fit and healthy state; the need for world peace overrides national and commercial interests; the poverty of two thirds of the world's family demands a redistribution of the world's resources.</P>
    <P>In wishing to present Ireland to the world in a good light, it would be desirable to lavish praise on the White Paper but, regrettably, the Government has made this impossible, for at least three reasons.  First, TDs have had this 348 page document for only two days, even though copies were given to journalists some time ago.  Second, the study of the White Paper is not helped by the omission of an index, given word search facilities nowadays and computer technology, this would have been extremely easy.  Clearly, it is a deliberate decision to stifle examination.  Third, at the end of the day the intergovernmental conference negotiations will still take place behind closed doors and the public will have to rely on leaks and rumours until the final agreements are arrived at.  If we are lucky, we might have a referendum &mdash; although this seems extremely unlikely given the Government's attitude &mdash; during which we will be told we have no choice but to accept, going on past experience.  As the Danes discovered, even if we decide to reject it, the referendum result will be ignored. What options are left to me as a Green Party TD, having speedily read this White Paper while the Tánaiste is packing his bags to attend the intergovernmental conference in Turin?</P>
    <P>I will attempt to analyse constructively each core section of the document beginning with the introduction in <Col N="1472" /> which the Tánaiste claims he wants the Irish people to feel a sense of ownership of Irish foreign policy.  The best way to ensure this sense of ownership is to set out the options facing Ireland in terms of foreign policy and allow each voter to partake in a referendum or, at the very least, a referendum on future policy options.  The realities of free market economics form the earlier part of the document.  Unfortunately, these realities are largely overlooked.  The lack of critical analysis of the section referring to economic trends is frightening.  In page 70 there is a reference to &ldquo;rising trend in gross domestic product&rdquo; as if our involvement with the EU was a blossoming rosy garden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because of my concern at the drastic cut in funding for Positively Irish Action on AIDS in London.  PIA is a casualty of a 7.7 per cent reduction in the UK Department of Health's allocation to health and local authorities for HIV-AIDS treatment and care in London. The organisation offers a range of support services to Irish people living in the UK, or travelling between the UK and Ireland, who are affected by HIV and AIDS.  It is a community based initiative working not only with people affected by HIV and AIDS but also with their partners, families and carers.  It is a flexible, proactive and culturally sensitive service.  Over half of the clients who have attended this service have not utilised services at the time of initial contact with the group.  This is a stunning statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent study concluded that this service met the needs of a client group who are otherwise hard to reach and who experience difficulties in assessing generic HIV and AIDS services.  The isolation experienced by this group should cause us to examine our own <Col N="1473" /> standards.  Until these attitudes change, services such as PIA are essential.  It is recognised internationally as responding to a complex problem, which crosses geographic welfare and community boundaries.  The organisation is at risk of closure from 1 April.  This will leave a significant number of Irish people, with HIV and AIDS, living in London without an essential source of support and possibly unable to access other more mainstream services.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of this service means that many Irish people may find themselves isolated and lonely.  I understand from the staff of this service, which totals eight, that there has been a huge outpouring of support from the families of people who have used the service in the past in London.  They are extremely concerned that the service will not now be available.  It has provided a vital bridge between the clients and their families in Ireland.  If the service is withdrawn, many people will lose the support which has enabled them to form more stable lifestyles, obtain the help they need and, in some cases, stabilise their drug abusing patterns.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a small country.  We know each other well, perhaps too well.  Many young people who have contracted HIV and AIDS do not wish to stay here and have gone instead to bigger, more impersonal, less intrusive London.  They are entitled to their anonymity but this does not mean they should feel isolated or be isolated in London.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the role of the Irish Embassy so far in addressing this issue. It is important that the UK authorities, in this instance, acknowledge their statutory obligations to the welfare of Irish people living in London.  I ask the Minister to make representations to his counterpart in the UK Department of Health.  I also ask the Department here to consider providing some funding to the organisation as a gesture of support and a recognition of the work being done there.  The vulnerability of people affected by HIV and AIDS fully justifies this kind of intervention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Frances Fitzgerald for raising this very important matter.  I agree that Positively Irish Action on AIDS does excellent work for Irish people in London affected by HIV and AIDS and their dependants.  It plays a particularly important role as a link between counselling and support agencies in Ireland and London in assisting those people.</P>
      <P>Assistance to voluntary Irish advice, counselling and welfare bodies in Britain is provided from the Enterprise and Employment Vote through the Díon Committee which is chaired by the Labour Attaché at the Embassy in London. The Díon Committee has been supporting PIAA since 1989.  This is evidence of our recognition of the way PIAA addresses the otherwise unmet needs of Irish people affected by HIV and AIDS in a culturally sensitive way. PIAA is regarded by the Díon Committee as one of the most professional of the voluntary organisations which it supports.</P>
      <P>The Government would be concerned at any negative development, such as the cessation of funding from other sources, liable to affect the ability of PIAA to continue to provide its services to members of the Irish community in London.  As soon as we heard from PIAA of the possibility that funding by the Inner London HIV Health Commissioners' Group might be withdrawn, the embassy there discussed the matter with PIAA and, on that basis, made our concern known to the relevant British authorities, including the Department of Health.  It was asked to defer any decision until a full service review of the needs of the HIV-Aids community in London is carried out and to meet the shortfall in PIAA's budget for 1996-97 to give it an opportunity to rebuild confidence in the solvency of its operations and to ensure its survival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the health authorities in London has offered short-term transitional funding amounting to 50 per cent of what PIAA has received in 1995-96. <Col N="1475" /> PIAA's future is not yet safeguarded and negotiations are continuing between PIAA and the health authority concerned.  PIAA has also requested an increase in the level of funding which it has been receiving direct from the European Union's Europe against AIDS programme.  A decision on that application is still awaited.</P>
    <P>PIAA is also seeking replacement funding from the British Department of Health's communicable disease programme. These negotiations are continuing. I understand that there is no immediate risk to PIAA's continuing to operate.  The embassy in London and the Díon Committee are continuing to monitor developments closely and will do what they can to ensure that its valuable services continue to be available to Irish people who need them.</P>

      <P>Before calling Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn I wish to advise the House that this matter has been permitted to be raised under the revised <i>sub judice</i> rule to allay public concern which may have arisen from the various allegations made concerning the matters raised by the Deputy.  Members should be aware that the matters before us relate to issues which are currently seized by the courts and which have yet to be determined. This House is not a court, and I am asking Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, to take due account of the sensitivity of the issues involved and not to take advantage of the generosity of the Chair in permitting these matters to be raised on the Adjournment.  I wish to remind Members that under paragraph (3) of the revised <i>sub judice</i> rule a matter should not be raised in such an overt manner as to appear to be an attempt by the Oireachtas to encroach on the functions of the courts or the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>The Chair <Col N="1476" /> may rest assured that I will not do anything to encroach on the courts in this matter.</P>
      <P>Since the hepatitis C scandal began, I have always maintained that there has never been as serious a scandal in the history of the State.  It was so serious because a State board, the Blood Transfusion Service Board, was the guilty party.</P>
      <P>A body that was established by the State to maintain people's health through supplying blood and blood products had infected as many as 1,800 people with a potentially life-threatening disease.  That seemed to be the worst possible thing that could happen in any State agency.</P>
      <P>Initially I thought the scandal was a simple case of misjudgment by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, but following revelations in recent days in the High Court, I now believe there is clear evidence of negligence.  I will go further and say that there appears to have been absolute recklessness at play, and I also believe there has been a massive cover-up of that recklessness.</P>
      <P>I wish to place on the record of the House information contained in affidavits presented to the High Court.  The information has not been disputed by the State's legal team which was present in the High Court yesterday.</P>
      <P>In the affidavits, it is stated:</P>
      <P>In 1976 and 1977 the first Defendant (BTSB) used plasma from a female plasma exchange patient who to the knowledge of the first Defendant (BTSB) had been clincially diagnosed as suffering from infective hepatitis and had become jaundiced... The plasma of the exchange donor was used without her knowledge and consent for the production of Anti-D Immunoglobulin and without the knowledge and consent of the person or persons in the hospital who were conducting her plasma exchange treatment and without the knowledge of her treating clinician under whose care she was receiving the said treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> Further the first Defendant (BTSB) knew since in or about the month of November 1976 that a donor to the batch of Anti-D Immunoglobulin Number 250 which was administered to the Plaintiff was then in November and December 1976 diagnosed as suffering from infective hepatitis.</P>
    <P>As many as six tests showed that the female plasma exchange patient was suffering from infective hepatitis.  There tests were clearly marked as having been seen by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Yet, when an investigation was carried out by an expert group which investigated the hepatitis C controversy in 1994, the BTSB said:</P>
    <P>Blood donors with a history of jaundice not related to infectious causes could be accepted as donors. However, if the jaundice was defined as being due to an infectious origin and thus potentially hepatitis B, the donation would not be accepted.</P>
    <P>This information raises a number of serious questions.  Since the documents were found in files at the BTSB, they can hardly be false.  I also remind the House of a statement the Minister made to the House during Question Time on 13 March last:</P>
    <P>Whatever the criticisms of the Blood Transfusion Services Board, its records were accurate.  They stood up to real scrutiny when one had to trace a donation of blood through different transfusions given.</P>
    <P>Why was this information about the tests not made known to the expert group which investigated the hepatitis C controversy?  Why were the documents not uncovered then or brought to the attention of the group?  Was the group deliberately misled?</P>
    <P>Did the Minister or his Department ask the BTSB if the donor's tests had all been clear or if the donor had infective hepatitis?  When did the Minister or his Department seek this information?  Did the Minister or the Department ever <Col N="1478" /> seek or examine documentation from the BTSB?  How otherwise did the Minister know their records stood up to scrutiny?</P>
    <P>This new information also raises the most serious questions about the Minister's tribunal.  Are victims appearing before this tribunal in false circumstances? Those appearing are prohibited from seeking damages for negligence. Awards are made only on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis and do not take account of compensation for aggravated or punitive damages.  Surely the terms of reference establishing the tribunal are fundamentally undermined given this new information?  What is the status now of the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal?</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have asked why the Government has been so keen to send the victims of this scandal to a tribunal that even before now appeared to be fundamentally flawed.  I wish to again ask that now.  Why were the Minister and the Government willing to push people into the tribunal at any cost? There are many examples, most notably a letter dated 25 July from the Chief State Solicitor's office signed by Michael A. Buckley which stated:</P>
    <P>If, despite the Scheme of Compensation, any of your clients are advised to ignore the Tribunal and to pursue litigation, and any such clients choose to accept such advice, any resulting litigation will be fully defended by the State, if necessary to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>That is interesting, because it means that even before the court hearing the State was saying it would appeal the High Court's decision if it was not in its favour.  This whole situation smacks of a huge cover-up.  There are serious questions to be answered by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the Department of Health, the Minister for Health, the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to <Col N="1479" /> have the opportunity to clarify the issues raised by the Deputy and refute any suggestion that the Expert Group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board was not given the full information in this matter.  I refer the Deputy to the report of the Expert Group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board in this regard and in particular to paragraphs 3.13 to 3.16, which deal with the infection of the anti-D product with hepatitis C.  I also refer the Deputy to paragraphs 3.33, 3.34, 3.35, 3.59, 3.60, 3.62 and 3.63 of the report which is an analysis of the circumstances surrounding the infection of the anti-D product.  I suggest that appendix 3.1 on pages 49 and 50 should be closely read by the Deputy.  These paragraphs and appendix 3.1 should of course be read in the context of the expert group report as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the information in the report that the expert group, which consisted of a microbiologist and a professor of haematology with an independent chairman, was informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that the donor in question was clinically diagnosed as having infective hepatitis in 1976.  As a result of this clinical diagnosis, the Blood Transfusion Service Board ceased using her plasma for the anti-D programme.  Samples of the patient's plasma were sent to Middlesex Hospital at University of London in November 1976 to ensure that all relevant tests available at that time were carried out.  The samples tested negative. In 1976 there was no test for hepatitis C available and it was not until 1989 the hepatitis C virus was described. Adhering to normal practice, Middlesex Hospital retained samples for additional testing if and when more advanced tests became available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is therefore clear from the report that the expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board was made aware of the diagnosis of the female plasma donor and that this information is not a new revelation as indicated by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  I do not wish to comment further on this issue as <Col N="1480" /> it is inappropriate for me to do so, since this matter is at issue in proceedings before the High Court.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to say that 26 cases have been heard to date by the compensation tribunal.  A further 28 cases have been listed for hearing from 15 April to 2 May 1996 and a total of 264 applications have been received by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The issue being debated has no implications for the compensation tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of raising the important issue of the care of disabled children in institutions.  There is no statutory code of practice governing those who look after children with disabilities.  The Child Care Act, 1991 excludes children with disabilities from its remit.  Under section 59 (c) of the Child Care Act these children are further excluded from protection.  Residential centres for physically and mentally handicapped children are precluded from registration with health boards.  This means in effect that health boards are not required to inspect and register residential centres for children with disabilities or to check staff volunteers with substantial access to children.  We are all too well aware of the cases of abuse of children that have occurred and it must be recognised that children with disability are more vulnerable to abuse whether at home, in the wider community or in institutions. Therefore they need greater, not less, protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Disability Federation of Ireland has taken the initiative by issuing a voluntary code of practice.  It knows that principles must be established to promote a safe environment for those most vulnerable.  Children are children, disabled or not.  We should review the Child Care Act to include all of our children. Anyone who has substantial access to children with disabilities should operate under a code of practice. <Col N="1481" /> The guidelines that have been issued by the Disability Federation of Ireland, which represents nearly 60 voluntary organisations working with children with disabilities, offer such a voluntary code of practice.  However, it should not be left to the goodwill of voluntary bodies to ensure the operation of a code of practice for working with vulnerable children.  These children must be offered the protection of the Child Care Act as a matter of urgency.  I congratulate the Disability Federation of Ireland for bringing this matter to my attention. It has issued a comprehensive set of guidelines but the organisation is concerned that it should have been left to a voluntary body and is not within the remit of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Keogh for raising this important matter and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the issues involved.  I wish to correct the mistaken impression that the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, do not apply to children with disabilities.  This is not the case and statements to this effect can only cause unnecessary anxiety to the parents of these particularly vulnerable children as well as creating confusion among staff working in services for the disabled.  The provisions of the Act apply to all children wherever they reside.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that the statutory powers of the health boards enshrined in the Act in relation to the investigation and management of suspected cases of child abuse or neglect apply equally to children with a disability regardless of their location.  The majority of children with a disability live at home with their parents or in foster care and there are only a small number of such children in residential care.  Part VIII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the making of regulations to provide for the registration and inspection of children's residential centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Part of the Act a &ldquo;children's residential centre&rdquo; excludes, <i>inter alia,</i>&ldquo;an institution for the care and maintenance of physically or mentally <Col N="1482" /> handicapped children&rdquo;.  It was considered at the time that registration of the small number of such homes should be provided for under separate disabilities legislation.  The current situation is that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is considering a recommendation on the provision of an inspectorate of disabilities services.  Its report is expected in April and I will review this issue in the light of any recommendations made by the commission.</P>
    <P>My Department's guidelines on child abuse equally apply to all children. These were circulated, via the health boards, to all residential and day centres catering for persons with a disability when they were published.</P>
    <P>In addition, most of the individual voluntary agencies have developed their own procedures for investigating abuse based on the Department's guidelines. These procedures include the involvement of the health boards, as independent adjudicators, in investigating alleged incidences of abuse.  Most recently, there have been discussions between officials of my Department and the voluntary agencies involved in providing mental handicap services as part of a review of existing institutional procedures to ensure that all agencies have kept their procedures up-to-date.  My officials have also met the Cheshire Foundation to offer, <i>inter alia,</i> assistance in relation to the preparation of the foundation's new draft guidelines on investigating abuse.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report a commendable initiative by the Disability Federation of Ireland in issuing a code of practice for all voluntary agencies working with children with a disability.  This complements my Department's guidelines on child abuse and should help to ensure best practice by staff providing services for children with a disability.  Unfortunately, I have to say that the code is inaccurate when it says that the Child Care Act, 1991, excludes children with a disability.  Officials of my Department will shortly be meeting DFI to discuss <Col N="1483" /> how this misunderstanding can be clarified for the agencies which have received the code so that this important DFI initiative fully achieves its aim of strengthening child care safeguards, an aim which this Government fully supports.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, contains a comprehensive statutory framework for the development of services and supports for the care and protection of children, including children who have suffered abuse.  The Act is being implemented on a phased basis.  Sixty-one of the 79 sections of the Act are now in force.  The remaining 18 sections dealing with the supervision and inspection of pre-school services and the registration of children's residential centres will be brought into operation later this year.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional funding has been made available for the development of the infrastructure required to support the legislation.  Since 1993 the Minister for Health has approved a range of new child care developments costing £35 million in a full year.  Over 850 new posts have been created for the child care services and a range of new services and facilities have been put in place in each health board area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, children with a disability are covered both by the Child Care Act and by the Department's guidelines and the existing codes of practice of the voluntary agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Telecom Éireann remains one of the State's finest companies and through no fault of that company the strategic alliance process is now in a shambles.  This was due solely to confusion in the Cabinet about what will happen to the remaining 65 per cent stake in Telecom Éireann.  Apparently nobody can get a clear answer from the Government on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy <Col N="1484" /> and Communications, Deputy Lowry, has evidently completely mishandled this process.  He failed to get agreement from his Cabinet colleagues on a mandate for the Telecom Éireann negotiations. The year lost was vital because of the pace of change in telecommunications and the rapid arrival of full competition. He also failed to clear up the position regarding the remaining 65 per cent of the company for the parties interested in Telecom Éireann.  This lack of clarity and the confusion within the Cabinet led directly to eight of the ten interested groups withdrawing from the process.  There is something fundamentally wrong when so many good partners withdraw yet the Government persists.</P>
    <P>While money is not the primary consideration in getting a partner for Telecom Éireann, that company remains a jewel in the State's crown and it should not be given away in a fire sale.  Fianna Fáil will oppose any panic sale of 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann in this derisory, knock-down fashion, as is currently the intention of the Minister especially now that there is only one horse left in the race.</P>
    <P>The Minister's handling of this process during the past year has resulted directly in one of the partners bidding £200 million less than was on offer for a stake in Telecom Éireann.  Twelve months ago the Minister spoke of £500 million for this share of the company, but I understand the offer is now in the region of £250 million.  That is some ministerial miscalculation.  The Minister wasted vast sums of taxpayers' money on this flawed exercise.  Consultancy fees on the strategic alliance process amounted to £4.1 million and that figure will increase.  That expense in fees for a one horse race is a scandal and the Minister should stop the process.  Fianna Fáil will table a Private Members' motion condemning the Minister's handling of the process and demanding that he stops it.  Effective negotiations are not possible when competition is reduced to a one horse race.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> It is also worth noting that Irish companies need not apply.  Recently £250 million of Irish pension funds was invested in foreign telecommunication companies, not in Telecom Éireann. Those foreign companies are not being asked to put Irish pension funds into Telecom Éireann.  Why are Irish investors excluded from this company?  We will call for a full debate and public consultations on the future of Telecom Éireann.  This would help to chart the future direction of the company now that it is in a shambles and a strategic alliance process has effectively collapsed.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to explain why he claimed Ireland's derogation was safe, but at a Council of Minister's meeting last week voted against a decision pushed through by other EU Ministers.  I would like that position cleared up.  The Minister negotiated a bad deal for the taxpayer.  It cost hundreds of millions of pounds and the process should be stopped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Preliminary proposals have been received from not one but two parties interested in entering into an equity based strategic alliance with Telecom Éireann.  These two partners are a consortium of KPN and Telia, the Dutch and Swedish public telecommunications operators respectively, on the one hand, and Teledanmark, the Danish public telecommunications operator on the other.  Each of these parties has an outstanding reputation in the telecommunications industry.  They have experience both in their home markets and internationally which would be of interest to Telecom Éireann as it continues its development and restructuring in preparation for full competitive markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These preliminary proposals are currently being evaluated by representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance, Telecom Éireann and the advisers to the stategic alliance process. This evaluation is not yet complete. The assessment of the proposals includes consideration of the ability and <Col N="1486" /> commitment of the potential partner to assist Telecom Éireann to adapt to an emerging competitive marketplace.  This is the key purpose of the strategic alliance.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable publicity and speculation regarding the contents of the bids received and regarding the whole strategic alliance process.  The bidding process is a sensitive, commercial process for those involved.  It is important for the success of this process that it be allowed to continue without interference from external factors and that a negotiation position is not compromised by disclosure.</P>
    <P>Recent withdrawals from the process are not a reflection on the selection process nor on the attractiveness of Telecom Éireann as an investment opportunity. Those companies which withdrew did so for their own reasons. We have two parties who are interested in Telecom Éireann and it is important that we pursue this interest for the benefit of not just the company but the economy generally.</P>
    <P>The Government's objectives for the telecommunications sector and for Telecom Éireann remain steadfast.  The national policy objective is to achieve a telecommunications sector which is in the upper quartile of OECD indicators of price, quality and availability as soon as possible.  The basis for this policy is that the long-term economic prosperity of the country is heavily dependent on the provision of top quality telecommunications services at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy for the sector embraces the introduction of full competition.  However it is important that the transition to full competition proceed in a fair manner to Telecom Éireann while taking into account the interests of the consumer and of other players in the market.</P>
    <P>Ireland may avail of a derogation of five years to 1 January 2003 in relation to the introduction of competition in <Col N="1487" /> voice telephony services and the construction of telecommunications infrastructure independent of that of Telecom Éireann for the commercial provision of services.  However, the Government has decided to allow full competition in network and voice services from 1 January 2000 &mdash; a derogation of only two years.  The agreement reached in relation to the draft Interconnection Directive at the Telecommunications Council last week did not as was suggested in press reports undermine this derogation.  Commissioner Bangemann confirmed that the political decisions taken by the ministerial Council on these derogations in 1993 and 1994 remains in place.  The draft directive allows certain member states, including Ireland, to defer cross-border interconnection by mobile phone operators for the duration of the derogation. This is very important in order to defend the international revenue of Telecom Éireann for the period needed to complete the restructuring of the company &mdash; that is, up to 2000.  The Minister said he would have preferred in the interest of clarity in the directive if that deferment had not been limited to international traffic.  However, in <Col N="1488" /> other articles in the directive it is provided, for example, that only operators with significant market power, as defined nationally, will be compelled to grant interconnection.  This directive, which will not be finally adopted for several months yet, is only one part of a regulatory framework being put in place by the European Union in preparation for the liberalisation of the market.</P>
    <P>There are several other directives and proposals for directives each of which contains a deferment clause applicable to the states, including Ireland, which are eligible for the derogation.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy for telecommunications is one which recognises the realities of the marketplace but also has special regard for Irish needs and circumstances.  That strategy is realistic and is being fully implemented and will represent an important contribution to economic growth and development into the medium term.</P>
    <P>I assure the House and the Deputy there is not panic or a scandal and there will not be a fire sale.</P>

      <P>A general report of an evaluation of the Transition Year Programme (1994-1995) by the Inspectorate of the Department was published in February 1996.  The report included a number of recommendations of a general character which are essentially a matter for implementation at school level.</P>
      <P>This evaluation indicated that 89 per cent of the schools evaluated were following the Department of Education's guidelines on the transition year programme in a satisfactory manner.  Reservations were expressed on some aspects of these programmes in 11 per cent of the schools evaluated.  An individual confidential report was issued to all schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of those schools where reservations have been expressed, inspectors have visited or will shortly visit the schools for the purpose of discussing the report and offering further advice and support to the school authorities. Ongoing support and advice on implementing the recommendations of the general report will be given to all schools by the Inspectorate and the transition year support team.  The transition year support team is comprised of 14 experienced transition year co-ordinators who are on release from their schools for a two year period.</P>

      <P>The latest report available to my Department for the Child Abuse Prevention Programme (CAPP) team indicates that some 2,300 or 70 per cent of primary schools are teaching the programme.  This represents an increase of 10 per cent in the number of schools <Col N="1390" /> participating in the programme in the current school year.</P>
      <P>About 2,800 schools (85 per cent of the total) have held parent meetings with a view to introducing the programme. I expect that most, if not all, these schools will teach the programme in the relatively near future.  Virtually all the primary schools in the country have participated in the teacher training programme.</P>
      <P>Special schools are included in the overall figures in relation to teaching of the standard programme and have not been categorised separately by CAPP in their reports.  The indications are that 50 per cent of special schools have used the standard programme to some degree.</P>
      <P>CAPP personnel have been engaged in adapting the programme for use in special schools.  Work on this project is at a very advanced stage.  The adapted programme has been piloted in a number of special schools.  Teachers in special schools were trained to deliver the standard programme when it was launched.  Arrangements are now being made to provide these teachers with appropriate in-service training on the specially adapted programme with a view to having it available in all special schools in the autumn.  I have provided funding to CAPP to support a nationwide network of teachers.  These teachers conduct the programme of parent education which is crucial to having the programme introduced in schools. In particular they target those schools which currently are not teaching the programme.</P>
      <P>I am confident that progress can be maintained on having this important programme taught in all primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent to which children with disabilities can be integrated into mainstream schools is governed by the particular needs of the individual children concerned.  In some cases, full integration can be achieved with extra support.  In other cases, the needs of a child may be such that placement in a special dedicated school or class is the appropriate response.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have attached a high priority to improving the quality and level of support services available to all children with special educational needs, including those who are integrated in mainstream schools.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that substantial progress has been achieved in this area. Measures which I have introduced include:</P>
      <P>The appointment of an additional 241 remedial teachers at primary level and 98 such teachers at second-level bringing the totals now in place nationwide to 1,188 and 350 respectively.</P>
      <P>The appointment of an additional 29 resource teachers in ordinary primary schools and 56 such teachers to second-level schools, bringing the totals now in place to 36 and 130 respectively.</P>
      <P>The remedial and resource teachers are a key support service for pupils with special needs who have been integrated into ordinary schools.  In addition, children with specific disabilities such as hearing or visual impairment or Down's Syndrome also have access to the visiting teacher service.  My Department may also allow extra teaching hours to cater for such children attending second-level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not keep precise records of the number of children with special needs who are integrated into ordinary primary schools at any <Col N="1392" /> given time.  A survey conducted in 1992 on behalf of the special education review committee indicated that there were approximately 8,000 pupils with specific disabilities in ordinary classes in primary schools.  The number of students with special needs attending post-primary schools is in the region of 1,500.</P>
    <P>The measures set out in the White Paper in relation to special needs pupils are intended to refine and develop the current range of responses.  A key objective will be to ensure that all children with special educational needs will have access to the necessary range of support services and in their own areas.  This includes support for children with special needs in mainstream schools.</P>

      <P>The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women concluded that the fact that so few lay women teachers become principals is a result, in part, of a lack of experience of interviewing by selection boards.  In particular, the commission pointed to a lack of sensitivity to gender issues on the part of selection boards.</P>
      <P>The commission also noted that most teachers believed that being male is an advantage in securing a promotion. Only a small number believed that being female is helpful in securing a promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, states that the principals of schools will be selected on the basis of procedures prescribed by the Department of Education, following consultation with the relevant interests.  Officials of my Department will shortly commence discussions with the partners in education <Col N="1393" /> regarding revised selection procedures for the appointment of principal teachers.  The issues raised by the commission will be taken into account in these discussions.  In particular, adequate representation of both sexes on selection boards and an awareness of gender equality issues by members of boards will be addressed as part of these discussions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23, 24, 25, 36, 44, 51, 56, 59, 63, 66 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In appealing the decision of the High Court in the case of Paul O'Donoghue the State is not appealing the central element in the High Court judgment &mdash; that a profoundly handicapped child is <Col N="1399" /> educable.  Neither will the appeal, however it is resolved, in any way diminish the services made available, after this judgement, to the child involved or to children with similar disabilities.  The appeal is being pursued entirely without prejudice to the present or future level of education services to such children.</P>
    <P>The judgment, however, raises issues of more general concern, primarily to do with the separation of the powers and duties of the Executive and judicial arms of Government and the appropriate relationship between the two.  These are constitutional matters of the utmost importance, having a relevance across the entire spectrum of State activities. The Government has been advised by counsel and the Attorney General that the Supreme Court, which has a special role in interpreting the Constitution, should, in the public interest, be asked to consider these aspects of the judgement.  It is on this basis that an appeal has been lodged.</P>

Once this review has been completed it will be possible to identify with some assurance the categories of children for whom provision will be required in the young offender centres.

Consideration of the arrangements and conditions in relation to the extension of maintenance grants abroad is close to finalisation in my Department at present.  Students attending private commercial colleges in Ireland are not eligible for student support and it is not proposed to extend the student support arrangements to them.  The 1995 Finance Act does, however, provide for tax relief from income tax in respect of tuition fees paid to private colleges in respect of approved courses.

      <Quest>the reason a letter of sanction dated 29 September 1995 addressed to the Assistant City Manager of Cork Corporation sanctioning a tender for the erection of a swimming pool complex was withdrawn and subsequently replaced with a further letter of sanction dated 23 October 1995, from which the first condition relating to access to the site through Rossbrook residential estate had been deleted.</Quest>

      <P>A grant of £2.5 million was allocated by my Department under the major sports capital programme to Cork Corporation for the provision of a regional sports centre, including a swimming pool, at Bishopstown in Cork.</P>
      <P>A letter issued from my Department on 29 September 1996 authorising Cork Corporation to accept a tender for the construction of the building.  This letter outlined the terms and conditions for the payment of the grant and sought confirmation from Cork Corporation, as client for the project, that the contractor had access to the construction site through the adjoining Rossbrook housing estate.  This confirmation was sought as Cork Corporation had identified this road for access to the site in the late 1980s when planning for the project commenced and the tenders for the project included access to the site through this estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the question of access to the site was the subject of legal proceedings between Cork Corporation and the residents of Rossbrook estate, Cork Corporation was not in a position to give the confirmation sought.  Cork Corporation, based on legal advice received, requested that this condition be withdrawn. As the access to the site was essentially a matter between Cork Corporation and the residents and as my Department's main concern was to ensure that the project proceeded to construction without further delay, a <Col N="1409" /> revised letter of sanction was issued on 23 October 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to make changes in the tax treatment of covenants not only as part of the restructuring of State support for third level education but also to curb the growing cost of covenant tax relief to the Exchequer. The withdrawal of covenant tax relief, except for some restricted categories, means that the abolition of full-time undergraduate fees has been achieved for a relatively small additional cost to the State.</P>
      <P>The benefit conferred under the covenant tax relief was available to students in both publicly funded and private third level colleges.  It was highly regressive as the extent of the tax relief was greater for those on higher incomes and the rate at which relief was given was not restricted to the standard rate of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of covenant tax relief is offset by the free fees initiative for those students who are eligible to avail of it. Students in private colleges are not eligible for free fees and it was deemed appropriate to introduce some measure <Col N="1410" /> of assistance for them by way of tax relief on tuition fees.  Unlike the covenant tax relief, this relief will be subject to a maximum limit of tuition fee and will be given only at the standard rate of tax.</P>

      <P>In so far as the question refers to teaching English as a foreign language I am fully aware of the great potential of Ireland with its extensive network of people with expertise and experience in this area.  The significant development of this service into a major industry is a matter of great satisfaction. According to a survey commissioned by Bord Fáilte over 150,000 foreign students visited Ireland in 1993 to study English as a foreign language spending an estimated £180 million in tuition and accommodation.  Throughout the 1960s to the 1990s the Department of Education monitored the educational aspects and provided a system of official recognition.  More recently the reconstituted ACELS organisation with its <Col N="1412" /> registration, monitoring, inspection and promotion roles was established in partnership with the main interests in order to ensure that the quality of provision is excellent in all respects.</P>
      <P>I believe that the existence of the reconstituted ACELS, which works in close co-operation with Bord Fáilte, ensures we have the structures in place to enhance the reputation of Dublin and Ireland as a centre of excellence for the teaching of English as a foreign language.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question may infer that some specific institute dedicated to English language studies should be established to make Dublin an international centre of excellence for English language studies I would wish to be further advised on that matter.  A number of universities have established specialisms related to this field and Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann is also concerned with work in the area of language learning.</P>

      <P>Primary or second-level schools are not required to notify my Department of cases where children are suspended or otherwise excluded from <Col N="1414" /> schools.  However, I am aware of the problem of children who are not attending school because they have been expelled or excluded from second-level schools and the related difficulties this presents for both schools and parents.</P>
      <P>Under the rules for national schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>The managerial authorities of second-level schools are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.</P>
      <P>Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up the detail of a code of discipline appropriate for that school. Accordingly, the most effective method of countering indiscipline is for each individual school to draw up its own code of behaviour.  In drawing up the code, school authorities should have regard to guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>In 1990 and 1991, my Department issued <i>Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline</i> together with <i>A Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline</i> to all schools.</P>
      <P>Within these guidelines individual boards are given the discretion to work out specific details.  The guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of expulsion only as a last resort and I am satisfied that schools also see it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically this can rise where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made.  In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through its Inspectorate to assist in the reinstatement of <Col N="1415" /> the pupil in the school or alternatively, his/her placement in another school.  In more difficult situations, my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner. Programmes such as Youth Encounter Projects and Youthreach are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside of the mainstream school system.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Deputy has been in touch with officials of my Department regarding the situation in the Cork area and my Department is endeavouring to assist in relation to one particular case.</P>

      <P>The Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education was established under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority to advise on the future development of the higher education system.</P>
      <P>The committee's published report is based on a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the demographic and policy framework and a thorough examination of the needs of all regions, including Waterford.  The report of the steering committee takes account of the interim report of the technical working group which was established to support the steering committee and carried out research to facilitate the committee's consideration of the range of issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered the technical working group's findings the steering committee recommended an increase in student places in Waterford regional technical college, an increase in the degree level awards and a change of <Col N="1420" /> title to Regional Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>I understand that representatives of both the technical working group and the steering committee met the Waterford University Action Group prior to finalising their reports and conclusions in relation to third level provision in the south-east region.</P>
    <P>The report of the steering committee is currently being examined together with the recommendations of the Higher Education Authority.  When the report has been fully considered I will take the necessary decisions on the various recommendations in consultation with my colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I do not consider that a meeting between the action group and myself would serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the EU Commission that billboards be erected on the sites of capital projects part-financed by the European Regional Development Fund.  As a consequence, since the proposed new regional technical college at Dún Laoghaire is receiving financial aid under the EU's Structural Fund Programme it was necessary and normal to have a billboard erected on the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire regional technical college has not yet been statutorily established and the site for the college remains vested in the Minister for Education. In addition, unlike third level projects generally, in this particular case the Minister for Education is the client. Accordingly, my Department considered it appropriate to include reference to both the EU and the Minister for Education on the billboard.  The use <Col N="1427" /> of the term Minister is in line with the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.</P>
    <P>The sign erected on the site of the proposed new regional technical college was authorised by the manager of the third level section of the planning and building unit of the Department of Education. The wording on the billboard was decided following inquiries into European Regional Development Fund signs generally and having regard in particular to the requirements of the EU.</P>

      <P>On 13 January 1994 I announced that I had included £120 million in the 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund programme for a broad range of capital developments in the third level sector. Of this amount £73.5 million would be allocated for developments at regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and other technical colleges.</P>
      <P>The Government subsequently agreed that a special projects provision of £9 million included in the programme would be set aside for the development of regional technical college at Dún Laoghaire and for a proposed new Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute.  Both of these developments accord in full with the recommendations of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A financial provision of the order of £1.5 million has been included in the Department's 1996 third level capital programme in respect of the planning of the new regional technical college and for the upgrading of the existing College of Art and Design, Dún Laoghaire.  The <Col N="1428" /> latter college will form part of the proposed new regional technical college.</P>

      <P>The queries which are generally from candidates or their parents have, for the most part, expressed concern about individual results achieved in earlier years.</P>
      <P>In addressing the specific concerns of correspondents my Department outlines both the nature of the appeal process and the fact that it provides for remarking by an experienced examiner. Candidates are also informed that examination scripts for years prior to 1995 are not generally available.</P>
      <P>The position is that over 1.2 million scripts are received in my Department each year.  Subsequent to the examination cycle these are disposed of as confidential waste on an annual basis.</P>

      <P>I am acutely aware of the need for increased representation of women in technological education.  To this end I have set out in the White Paper on Education that</P>
      <P>All institutions will be asked to develop and publish policies to promote gender equality.  These will include ... strategies to encourage increased participation by women students in faculties and courses of study in which they have been traditionally under-represented, including liaison with second-level schools and the preparation and distribution of suitable promotional material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the legislation relating to the regional technical colleges passed in 1992 contains a commitment to &ldquo;the attainment of gender equity and of equality of opportunity in education&rdquo;. <Col N="1430" /> Furthermore, the regional technical college-DIT Amendment Acts, 1994, stipulate that at least 40 per cent of members of governing bodies must be female.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of programmes specifically for women which are being assisted under the New Opportunities for Women (NOW) initiative.  It is expected that these will have a positive impact on the number of women students in technological education. The figures for the number of female students enrolled in full-time third-level technology courses are: 1991-92, 2,004; 1992-93, 1,924; 1993-94, 2,061.

      <P>The authorities of primary or second-level schools are not required to notify my Department of bullying cases in their schools and, consequently, I am not in a position to supply the Deputy with the information he has requested.</P>
      <P>I established an expert working group in 1993 to produce draft guidelines to counter such behaviour in schools.  Following consultations with the education partners, the guidelines on countering bullying behaviour were issued to all schools in September 1993.  The guidelines state that the creation of a positive school climate, which focuses on respect for the individual, is at the centre of a whole school response to bullying. When staff, pupils and parents are involved in the development of a school behaviour policy, they are more likely to actively support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident, therefore, that the guidelines, which were issued to primary and post-primary schools, will assist schools in identifying the incidence of bullying and in reducing the level of bullying in our schools.  I expect <Col N="1431" /> the guidelines to be adopted by each school board of management.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in the guidelines that schools monitor the effectiveness of school policy on this issue and their views will, of course, be taken into account in any review of the guidelines.</P>

      <P>I am aware of considerable concern about the possible detrimental effect on children of carrying heavy school bags.  My own view is that optimum solutions to this problem are most likely to be achieved at school level.</P>
      <P>Teachers and parents working in partnership at the level of each individual school can make suitable practical arrangements for schoolwork and homework.  These involve time-tabling and advance planning by teachers so that pupils know in advance what books are required on any particular day. Arrangements for storing books in schools where this is possible can also be helpful.</P>
      <P>Parents can ensure that schoolbags themselves do not add to the problem by being excessively heavy and also by ensuring that pupils do not carry unnecessary material in their schoolbags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of primary schools the advisory committee on textbooks and materials which I established has been requested to take these concerns into account when new guidelines are being prepared for publishers.

They are necessary on city bus routes because the transport services concerned are under sever pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled or blind people.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> The European Commission's proposals on the premium arrangements in the context of the 1996/97 prices package are as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)withdrawal of the second instalment of the special beef premium for bulls and its replacement by a single premium at 14 per cent above the premium for steers;</P>
    <P>(ii)reduction in the trigger for qualification for the deseasonalisation slaughter premium from 40 per cent to 38 per cent based on total steer slaughterings on the island of Ireland.  In addition, when the trigger is no longer met, member states would have the option of maintaining the premium at 60 per cent of its current rate, which would be financed by way of a reduction in the second instalment of the special beef premium.  Discussion on all elements of the 1996/97 prices proposals is ongoing in the Council and I am seeking to secure the best possible outcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 127 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU beef regime has traditionally focused its support, through the intervention system, on male cattle.  Accordingly, when the beef support system was reformed in 1992, it was decided to switch the emphasis away from market support through intervention purchasing and to compensate producers for the expected fall in prices by increases in <Col N="1449" /> the existing premium arrangements viz. the special beef premium and the suckler cow premium and by the introduction of the extensification premium.  The increases in these premiums were deemed to be sufficient to compensate producers for the expected reduction in prices for all categories of cattle, including heifers.  For example, the 15 per cent reduction in the intervention price over a three year period was expected to translate into a 13p-lb reduction in cattle prices.  By way of compensation for this, the suckler cow premium was increased from £68.54 per head in 1992 to £140.76 per head over three years; the special beef premium was increased from £35.15 per head to £90.16 per head and made payable twice in the lifetime of each male animal.  A new extensification premium was introduced and this is worth £30 per head on all qualifying animals on holdings with a stocking density of less than 1.4L.U-hectare.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the scale of the increases in the premiums that they were designed to compensate for the expected fall both in steer and heifer prices.  Premium payments to producers under all premium schemes in respect of applications lodged during a calendar year increased by about £250 million between 1992 and 1995 and this represents an increase of 20p-lb deadweight on all cattle (cow, bullocks and heifers) slaughtered annually in the country.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the EU Commission and other member states would insist that if a premium were to be introduced for heifers it would have to be financed out of the existing envelope for premiums, which would result in reduced payments for male cattle.  In view of this and of the fact that most producers have a reasonable mix of steers and heifers, the introduction of a heifer premium would not result in increased payments for the majority of Irish beef producers. Indeed, it is likely that a heifer premium would lead to lower premium payments for beef producers generally.  This arises from the fact that if heifers were included in the premium system they <Col N="1450" /> would have to be included in the calculation of the stocking density and this would increase the stocking density on the vast majority of holdings.  The inclusion of heifers in the premium system could lead in some cases to the nonpayment of the premium on otherwise eligible cattle because the stocking density on the holding would be pushed above 2.0L.U-ha and in other cases to the loss of the extensification premium because the stocking density would be pushed above 1.4L.U-ha.  In general, the overall average stocking density in the country would be substantially increased thus reducing the national take from the premium system generally and, in particular, from the extensification premium.</P>
    <P>As regards equity in CAP expenditure, the position is that CAP expenditure on the beef sector is reasonably proportionate to the sector's share of gross agricultural output in the European Union.  It should also be noted that equity in CAP expenditure has also to take account of several factors, such as the level of capital investment and the manwork units required, which vary considerably from sector to sector.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to respond publicly to the specific questions raised about the proposed light rail system by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce recently and in particular the cost of running the city centre part of this scheme underground.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6782/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen press reports of remarks attributed to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Policy in relation to light rail is quite clear.  The Dublin Transportation <Col N="1452" /> Initiative recommended that an on-street light rail system should form part of its overall transport strategy for the greater Dublin Area.  The DTI report supported light rail because it represented a sound investment, because it would achieve a significant transfer of people from cars to public transport, because it had a proven capacity to support urban regeneration and because it was environmentally friendly and accessible to mobility impaired people. The DTI report also concluded that a wholly bus-based solution would not be as effective as an integrated public transport strategy based on DART, suburban rail, quality bus corridors and light rail.</P>
      <P>The DTI strategy has been accepted by the Government as the policy framework for transportation planning in Dublin.  The Operational Programme for Transport, agreed by the Government and the European Commission, make provision for an expenditure of £200 million on the implementation of the first phase of the on-street light rail network as recommended by DTI.  The CIE project team is proceeding with its detailed design and consultation work on the basis of these decisions.</P>
      <P>When I launched the public consultation programme on the planned light rail links, I stated that its purpose was to explain the light rail proposals, to listen carefully to any concerns expressed in relation to those proposals and to respond to those concerns where possible.</P>
      <P>New legislation will be introduced shortly which, among other things, will provide for a mandatory public inquiry into all aspects of the proposed light rail project.  It will enable people who are not fully convinced that light rail is the best option to argue their case and have their views considered.</P>
      <P>As I indicated during a recent Seanad debate, any people who have concerns about the light rail proposals should use the opportunities afforded by the public consultation programme and the statutory public inquiry to explain their concerns and have them considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> Notwithstanding the state policy position on light rail, I, as the responsible Minister will be obliged by the legislation to fully and objectively consider the inspector's report on the public inquiry and the submissions made by interested parties before making a final decision on CIE's application for the statutory powers to construct light rail. This requirement holds true for all infrastructure projects which are subject to statutory procedures.</P>
