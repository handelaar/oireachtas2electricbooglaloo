      <P>In my reply to the House on 27 March 1996, I outlined the role and functions of the Government press secretary.  Under the terms of his contract, the Government press secretary may not engage in party political activities such as fund-raising, nor has he done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made two statements during the Easter period relating to the peace process &mdash; one on 7 April and another at Maynooth College on 11 April.  I have arranged to have copies placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>In both speeches, I pointed out that the agreement to a fixed date for talks &mdash; 10 June &mdash; without a precondition of prior arms decommissioning was a major achievement.  This agreement turned the Joint Framework Document, which I had earlier agreed with the British Prime Minister, from the parameters for a possible outcome into a practical and attainable arrangement which could be agreed to and would come into effect as a result of the talks that will now start on 10 June.</P>
      <P>I said that the Framework Document model, which includes the principle of consent, represents the real Irish democratic consensus and I asked all Irish democratic parties to support this approach.</P>
      <P>I also placed special emphasis on the fact that there are two sets of allegiances on this island.  The Government accords a very high priority to ensuring that the Irish identity of northern Nationalists is respected and its expression promoted, and that their many other legitimate concerns are addressed effectively. However, the structures proposed in the Joint Framework Document are predicated on the full and equal legitimacy and worth of both the Unionist and Nationalist identities.  It is incumbent, therefore, on both traditions to accept each other's allegiances and aspirations in the interests of reaching a political agreement.  The Government's approach to the peace process has throughout been guided by a recognition of this key reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any clear idea of what is necessary to reinstate the ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I believe it is obviously a decision for the Army Council of the Provisional IRA that violence does not serve the <Col N="2039" /> interests either of the country as a whole or of the people who support the republican movement.  I believe that is self-evidently the case.  I do not believe that violence &mdash; whether by the use of a firearm or any other methods &mdash; serves the interests of bringing the people who live on this island to a sense of agreement with one another.  I believe that violence is entirely contrary to that. There are people of very high intelligence in the republican movement who fully understand and see that violence is counterproductive and partitionist in the true meaning of the term, in the sense that the fears it engenders partition communities that previously had some measure of mutual connection with one another.  I believe the people in the republican movement, who as I have said are people of intelligence and idealism, can understand these things and it is up to them to translate that understanding into a decision to reinstate the ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach said &ldquo;firstly&rdquo;.  Perhaps there are other matters that he thinks will help to clarify it.  If the Taoiseach were to be asked by the republican movement to provide clarification of what it believes are outstanding matters, would he do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Information sought by any quarter, including the republican movement, to clarify matters will be provided.  As the House is well aware, a channel exists through meetings with officials whereby Sinn Féin can convey its views or question the Irish Government. If such views are conveyed or questions asked, they will be answered or dealt with as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is important for everybody's sake that we recognise that the talks starting on 10 June represent a huge opportunity for all the people of this island.  Never before have we had talks of this nature on offer.  Never before have we had available talks of a kind that encompass potentially all the <Col N="2040" /> interests on the island without the precondition of prior arms decommissioning. They are available on 10 June and I hope that everyone will do everything they can in the interests not just of the present generation but of subsequent generations living on this island to avail of the opportunity we succeeded in getting in the agreement I made with the British Prime Minister on 28 February &mdash; namely a date for all-party talks on 10 June of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach agreed with the British Government the procedures and remit of the proposed forum for Northern Ireland and will he encourage parties to participate in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following consultations with the Northern Ireland parties, the Irish and British Governments have agreed a paper setting out our best judgment on the most suitable and broadly acceptable ground rules for the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of the negotiations.  We have also established a clear separation between those negotiations and the work of the forum.  I have assured the Deputy on many occasions that this separation exists and it will be manifest in the ground rules paper which will be published today.  I am arranging for a copy of the paper to be placed in the Oireachtas Library and I will also send copies to Deputy Harney and Deputy Ahern.</P>
      <P>The paper provides the necessary reassurance for Nationalists and Unionists and clears the way for all party negotiations to take place on 10 June on a basis which is fair to everybody and conducive to a settlement.  It will be demonstrated today that we have not only reached agreement with the British Government on a framework for a possible agreement but also established the instrument, which is talks whereby that framework can be turned into reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to <Col N="2041" /> the Taoiseach's comments on statements made by the republican movement over Easter.  The Taoiseach seemed to be constantly involved in exchanges with the Sinn Féin president, Mr. Gerry Adams.  Many people felt this was undignified and that the Taoiseach does not seem to have the same gusto in his dealings with the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party who has made much stronger comments about him.  While it may be necessary for the Taoiseach to refute statements from time to time, is it his policy continually to take on comments made by Mr. Gerry Adams and ignore those made by others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern will recollect that when Mr. David Trimble made some comments about this jurisdiction which I felt were unfair to me, my predecessors, the people of this State and its security forces, I answered him firmly.  I described his speech as bizarre and I subsequently described it in the House as coming from a book of leprechauns' peculiar Irish statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would he understand that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be considered a firm rebuke to Mr. Trimble for what I consider was an ill-advised and intemperate speech.  If other parties fail to see that agreement to talks on 10 June constitutes a major opportunity for all the people of this island to move forward and if they persist in saying the glass is half empty rather than recognising that it is three quarters full, I will also tackle that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it important that both Governments act together and face down intransigence from their allies on both sides?  With that in mind, does the Taoiseach consider the Government should encourage the Nationalist parties to participate in the proposed forum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks on offer and the mechanism whereby we reach those <Col N="2042" /> talks should be examined in totality.  We should consider the total opportunity which is available and the fact that it may not be readily available again.  All participants who have decisions to make about documents, which they will see for the first time later today, should take them while bearing in mind that this is an unprecedented opportunity for peace.  A fixed date for all party talks without a precondition of prior decommissioning of arms has never before been available in our history.  This was obtained on 28 February last in the communiqué I agreed with the British Prime Minister on the basis of the Mitchell report.  This report was not binned and it would have been impossible to obtain a date for all party talks without it.  The Mitchell report was not binned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mitchell report is the basis on which a date for all party talks is now available.  I respect the right of all parties to make their own decisions and I urge them to keep in mind the overall objective of reaching agreement.  This can only be achieved if we make these talks work.  They should bear this in mind when assessing their approach, rather than the undoubted fact that there are elements in this package, as in any compromise package, to which one or other or all the participants will object.  Rather than considering that aspect, they should look instead at the opportunity which is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach agreed with the British Government that other matters can be discussed while the issue of decommissioning is being resolved within the all party talks framework?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, it is my firm intention to ensure there will be no logjam on one issue in the talks when they commence.  The communiqué agreed on 28 February makes this clear. Other issues must also be addressed and that will be provided for.  I took the <Col N="2043" /> opportunity during my visit to the United States of America to seek the support, understanding and agreement of President Clinton to ensure that the talks will range across the entire spectrum of issues and will not be logjammed or exclusively focused on one issue, however important that issue may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In his next contact with the Unionist leadership, will the Taoiseach consider suggesting to them that it is unreasonable to expect Nationalists to participate fully in the Northern Ireland forum while they refuse to participate in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the British-Irish Parliamentary Body?  Is there any update on the Taoiseach's contact with the British Government regarding how the Framework Document will be used in the talks to further the process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not wise to draw the types of parallels the Deputy is seeking to draw.  I regret that the Unionist parties did not participate in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, but one should not take the view that a mistake made by the Unionist parties governs all future decision making.  Each forum and opportunity must be considered on its merits and I have no doubt that is what the parties will do when they consider the matter in the coming days.  I have confined myself to making a general statement to the effect that we must consider the opportunity which exists.  It is an enormous and unprecedented opportunity for successful talks which have been sought for years to start on 10 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything should be done in the meantime and in conjunction with that to ensure the atmosphere for success is the best possible.  I urge people to look forward in that way rather than looking back, going over precedents and saying that others did certain things on particular occasions.  We can all find plenty of precedents in past decisions of our political antagonists to justify making no <Col N="2044" /> step forward at any time on any issue. The approach should not be one of searching the record books for precedents to justify a lack of movement, rather one of seeking to take the unprecedented opportunity which is available.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the exact information requested is not available given that similar information was available in the past.  The poultry industry is experiencing serious problems mainly due to price differentials arising from the currency crisis.  Will the Minister of State intercede with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to assist the Industry?  A report of the poultry meat forum set up to examine aspects of the trade is on the Minister's desk and I ask him to deal with it in the interests of our poultry producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>I will host a Trade Ministers Seminar on 18-19 September in Dublin Castle. The seminar will enable Trade Ministers of the EU to exchange views among themselves and with the EU Commissioner as well as the director-general of the World Trade Organisation.  This will be a very useful opportunity to advance the preparation of the first World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2046" /> My Department proposes to host three meetings in Dublin Castle during the Irish Presidency of the EU, as follows: a meeting of the Export Control Co-ordination Group on 22 July 1996; a meeting of the committee of senior trade officials on 18 September 1996; a meeting of the Export Credit Group on 18 October 1996.  It is possible that it will be necessary to hold further meetings in Ireland depending on how issues are developing on Council agendae.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that approximately £30,000 of the £52,000 allocated to my Department towards the costs of the EU Presidency will be expended on the Trade Ministers seminar, including catering and accommodation costs.  The balance of funding will be spent mainly on the costs associated with holding the other three meetings.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to quantify the benefits arising for Irish tourism from hosting EU meetings in Ireland during the Presidency.  It is clear, however, that the convening of meetings by my Department, and indeed by other Government Departments, will provide a unique opportunity to contribute to the promotion of Ireland as a tourism destination and also as an ideal location for conference business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the nature of a meeting that will take place in Singapore in December? Will he chair it and what will happen arising directly from it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was not specifically tabled by the Deputy.  The meeting will constitute the first ministerial involvement in the World Trade Organisation in December.  I expect to chair it and act as President of the Council on behalf of the European Union.  All countries are currently drawing up specific agenda for the conference in Singapore.  We look forward to proving on that occasion that the World Trade Organisation can stand on its own and will leave Singapore with a clear agenda for the future.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend to hold any of the meetings he proposes to host here in the main cities outside Dublin?  He will participate in many important meetings and I congratulate him and wish him well in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am not being narrow in the context of our membership of the EU as the Presidency is a broad canvass, but will the Minister quantify the advantages to tourism from his participation in such important functions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to hold any meetings outside Dublin.  Other Ministers and Departments have made arrangements concerning meetings throughout the country.  It is difficult to quantify the advantages to tourism but it is important to show the best of Ireland to people who may not have been here before or who have been here on a few occasions.  It should be deemed an attractive holiday destination and an island that offers facilities and state of the art equipment for conference business. In terms of conference business, the lead in time can be quite long, but the more people from various countries are involved in meetings of this nature, the more options will be opened for our tourism industry and for business conferences.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister disappointed that some of the meetings will not beheld outside Dublin?  Does that not show a bias on the part of the Minister for Tourism and Trade against the rest of the country?  There is a legitimate complaint by certain tourism interests, particularly in the south west and west, that &mdash; for obvious reasons &mdash; there has been a larger influx of tourists in the eastern part of the island and that other areas are not getting their fair <Col N="2048" /> share.  This was an opportunity for the Minister to show his support for that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 36, 53, 145, 148 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised that since the end of February there have been ongoing contacts between the RDS and its advisers in relation to the development of its proposal for the national conference centre with Bord Fáilte and its assessment teams.  Inevitably, because this is a major project which needs thorough and careful consideration, much of the discussion has been of a highly technical and detailed nature and architectural plans cannot be agreed and finalised until this stage in the process is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once this has been achieved, Bord Fáilte will present its conclusions to the independent Management Board for Product Development which decides on applications for EU assistance under the Tourism Operational Programme.  This paves the way for the matter to be considered by Government with a view to submission, if appropriate, to the European Commission for final approval. Until then, the issue of alternative options or locations and the necessity to <Col N="2050" /> examine same does not arise.  My objective remains that work on site should begin by December 1996.</P>
    <P>Neither my Department nor Bord Fáilte has received legal notice of action following the termination of the competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to this important question the Minister referred to Bord Fáilte and its assessment teams.  What are the functions of these teams in the context of this proposal? The Minister also said that work on site should begin in December.  I presume, therefore, that it is all systems go and that the Government has taken a definite decision on the location of the conference centre at the RDS.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal has been submitted by the RDS which has had regular and intensive meetings with Bord Fáilte, which has retained Carr and Angier as consultants.  It has prepared a brief for the national conference centre which sets out the type of building, break-out rooms and other facilities that will be required.  It was sent by Bord Fáilte to the RDS for its consideration. It has examined it and responded with its views.  In turn, Bord Fáilte's assessment team has examined the plans of the RDS and in the last few days forwarded its written comments.  Discussions on all aspects, architectural, financial, planning etc., are ongoing between the RDS and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy that EU funding will be available in the light of the initial mishaps in the context of the proposals submitted by other persons and that Bord Fáilte and its assessment teams in conjunction with the RDS will be able to indicate clearly that the RDS will be able to operate the conference centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a separate matter which specifically affects the RDS and Punchestown in particular, the World Equestrian Games, would it have been the Minister's intention to hold them in the RDS <Col N="2051" /> and will he explain why they will not be held in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, who is well aware of the procedures of the House has gone over a few jumps together.  In order to claim EU assistance the approved brief has to be sent from Bord Fáilte to the independent management board for examination.  I, in turn, have to obtain Government approval to seek EU Commission support. Assuming this will be forthcoming, I hope that work will commence by December this year.</P>

      <P>The value of export credit insurance cover provided in 1995 was £7.2 million.  No claims have arisen to date in respect of this cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any situation where a claim has <Col N="2052" /> been paid, efforts are made to effect recoveries where there are realistic prospects of obtaining payments. Recovery options used would depend on the particular circumstances of the individual cases concerned.  As an example, in sovereign debt cases, direct state-to-state contracts would be used.  In commercial debt cases, litigation or the threat thereof might prove to be the best option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 9, 12, 27 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputies to the lengthy reply I gave to Questions Nos. 17, 26, 37, 48, 50 and 224 on 27 February 1996 concerning the implications for tourism of the breakdown in the ceasefire.  Monitoring since then indicates that the situation has not changed significantly from that described in my February response. We are now in the key holiday booking period and response levels to the various campaigns being operated by the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, Bord Fáilte and others are holding up well.  Bord Fáilte continues to monitor the situation within the various markets with key carriers, tour operators and product suppliers, as well as in Ireland through the regional tourism organisations. The situation will be kept under close review.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Ulster marching season, the Deputy will understand that this is something over which I have no direct control.  The only comment I would make is that overall strategy in relation to promotion and marketing will continue to be to highlight the many and varied attractions of holidaying in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to meeting the chairman and chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board on many occasions, as well as industry representatives, I have met the Minister for the Economy in Northern Ireland, Baroness <Col N="2054" /> Denton, on several occasions recently in order to build on progress to date in the area of trade and tourism promotion on an all-Ireland basis.  Most recently I met her at a joint Bord Fáilte-Northern Ireland Tourist Board workshop in London on 15 February and in New York on 11 March at the Top 100 Irish-American Awards Ceremony to honour President Clinton as US Irishman of the year.  I look forward to continuing these meetings with Baroness Denton which are not only very useful from the trade and tourism promotion point of view but also provide the opportunity to review developments in all areas of mutual interest.  I will join with her later this month in advancing a special joint North-South trade and investment initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister every success in advancing the North South trade and investment initiative. On Question No. 12 which relates to the cancellations there have been by British tourists following the breakdown in the peace process, it is my information that, unfortunately, the number is considerable and that perhaps Bord Fáilte is not facing up to the reality.  The figures being given to the Minister do not coincide with the figures being given to me.  Can the Minister say the figures being given to me are wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As of 15 April, following the Canary Wharf bomb on 9 February, there was a drop off in inquiries to Bord Fáilte's London office and among the major tour operators with programmes to Ireland.  While most tour <Col N="2055" /> operators experienced some cancellation of bookings to Ireland, their numbers were not considered to be as bad as they might have been, given the serious and grave nature of the incident. Because of the sensitivity of the issue, the overseas tourism marketing initiative was suspended on the evening of 9 February and restarted on 28 February. Since then inquiries have recovered and are at satisfactory levels for this time of the year.</P>
      <P>Bookings of holidays from Britain are slow to most destinations, including Ireland, due to consumer expectations of a price war among operators.  Bookings for Ireland, even in a good year, are considered to be late and have a short lead in time.  This pattern is also evident this year and a fuller picture will emerge towards mid-to late May as consumers make their final decisions as to where they will take their holidays this summer. The early indications suggest that Ireland should enjoy another good year in terms of numbers of British tourists.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Andrews</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>the range of help given to tourists when they fall victim to crime; the areas in which victim support is available throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7524/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in the past in response to similar Dáil Questions, support for tourists who fall victim to crime is provided primarily through the Tourist Victim Support Service. This is, of course, in addition to measures designed to address the problem of crime against tourists generally, such as increased Garda activity in areas of high tourist interest, regular liaison between the Garda authorities, Bord <Col N="2056" /> Fáilte and other tourism interests and distribution of safety leaflets to tourists.</P>
      <P>The Tourist Victim Support Service was set up in 1994 and operates from premises provided by the Department of Justice in Harcourt Square, Dublin. It provides emotional and practical support, such as assistance in replacing passports, travel documents, travellers cheques etc. to tourist victims, who must be referred to it by the Garda.  Benefit-in-kind rather than direct financial aid is provided by the tourism industry.  This includes emergency accommodation, travel tickets, clothing and toiletries, meal vouchers etc.  The service has a full time co-ordinator and some 30 volunteer staff with a range of foreign languages and specialist training in tourist victim support.</P>
      <P>While the service was initially set up to serve the Dublin area, where most of the crime against tourists occurs, it has assisted tourist victims referred by the Garda from outside Dublin.  The Garda authorities throughout the country have accordingly been made aware of the service and the range of support it provides.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in response to a similar question on 27 February last, consideration is being given to an extension of the service to other parts of the country where the Victim Support organisation already has a presence.  At present, as Deputies will be aware, the organisation has branches in Dublin, Carlow, Cork, Louth, Laois, Mayo, Sligo, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.  These branches are being asked to nominate volunteers to attend a training course in tourist victim support to be held in Dublin on 7 and 8 June 1996.  Future extension of the service will depend on the take up of training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Victim Support organisation also plans to expand its national coverage in relation to its core victim support activities and I understand that there is a particular interest in forming new branches in Counties Galway, Kerry and Limerick.  If this happens, the new branches may, in time, be in a position to also offer a tourist victim service <Col N="2057" /> locally especially given the very low level of crime against tourists in areas outside Dublin and the level of expertise available within the organisation.</P>
    <P>The success of the service to date is reflected in the rising level of support it receives from the business community and the positive feedback from tourists that it has assisted.</P>
    <P>Finally, it must be remembered that crime is a worldwide phenomenon and that the levels of crime in Ireland are very low in comparison with other countries. While Ireland is a safe and friendly destination, people should take reasonable precautions as they would in any other country.  Such precautionary measures will help to ensure that our overseas visitors enjoy a wonderful holiday in a friendly environment and that Ireland retains its positive image in our overseas markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Tourist Victim Support Service which does a marvellous job with little financial support from the State.  Does the Minister intend to give additional financial support to this wonderful service, which is operated by individuals with the great assistance of the Garda Síochána? Having visited the premises in Harcourt Square, does the Minister intend to uplift the operation and relocate it in a separate premises, having regard to the need to expand the service? While we have a positive tourist image, nevertheless some tourists do fall victim to thuggery and crime which is, unfortunately, prevalent in our cities and towns.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider locating this service in close proximity to a Garda station and does he intend to give it extra financial support in light of its excellent work?</P>

      <P>That Department also funds the victim support organisation with an annual grant in excess of £100,000.  On expanding the service, I referred to the training days taking place this year and consideration will certainly be given to that, depending on its take up.  It has been decided that the service could be extended to areas already served by the Victim Support organisation and would only involve training costs, which would amount to little in 1996.  We will look at the various issues that arise as the situation develops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Current policy regarding funding for marinas for tourism development purposes is set out in the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99.  The objective is to increase the supply of suitable and safe berthing facilities on the south and west coasts, and on the east/south-east coast, which is the natural landfall for sailors from <Col N="2059" /> Britain and mainland Europe.  Specific financial provision is made for assisting the development of good mooring and appropriate on-shore facilities, especially availing of the natural advantages of a number of small coves and inlets which often offer the most cost effective way of achieving our overall objective.</P>
      <P>In berthing areas to which visitors have unrestricted access, it is also planned to encourage the development of yacht chartering operations, sail training and other marine tourism facilities, enabling visitors to be provided with sailing vessels on their arrival in Ireland.</P>
      <P>With regard to the complementary cruising product, priority will be given to the development of new cruising bases in selected areas to continue the spread of tourism into the Barrow navigation, the Grand and Royal Canals and the Shannon/Erne waterway.</P>
      <P>Other EU initiatives, such as the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme (1994-99), the Ireland-Wales Maritime Programme (1994-99) and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (1995-99) may, on a limited basis, provide some assistance towards small scale developments within the eligible areas.</P>
      <P>Other incentives that are available to stimulate investment in marina facilities include tax incentive schemes such as the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas and the business expansion scheme and subsidised loan schemes such as the access to finance scheme, which operates under the small business operational programme of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 40 and 152 together. CERT, the State training agency for the <Col N="2061" /> hotel, catering and tourist industry, monitors the sector's training needs on an ongoing basis and provides an extensive range of courses to meet the skill needs of both the industry and its employees.</P>
      <P>Its goal is to train 25,000 young people on formal craft courses over the duration of the tourism operational programme. In response to employer demand an additional hotel school was opened in 1995 which provided an additional 100 training places for craft workers.  CERT also plans to provide training for over 36,000 persons already employed in the sector, to improve their skills levels and provide them with a wide range of opportunities to advance their careers within the industry.</P>
      <P>However, over the past few years, the industry has experienced some problems in recruiting the numbers it needs to keep pace with expanding business, despite a steady increase in the numbers being trained each year.  The main issues seem to be difficulties in retaining trained staff in the industry and negative perceptions among school leavers of a career in tourism.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry must take an increasing share of responsibility for the development of attractive careers for its employees to ensure that they are at least comparable with those available in competing industries.  Young people attach significant importance to career progression in deciding on a career and the tourism sector must develop and promote a visible career path.  CERT, for its part, will continue to assist in the provision of a highly skilled workforce but quality training must be supported by quality employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions I have emphasised to industry the importance of addressing the negative factors of conditions of employment in the sector, such as the lack of career progression for employees, low pay and long hours of work.  At its recent conference the Irish Hotels Federation undertook to address these negative factors which are affecting recruitment and retention of staff.  Moreover, the Irish Hotel and <Col N="2062" /> Catering Institute at its annual general meeting yesterday also highlighted this area as one that needs to be addressed by the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that under the tourism operational programme it is intended to invest £110 million in training 72,000 personnel for the hotel and catering industry.  The lack of career opportunities for trained personnel and young people's reluctance to take up a full time career in the industry because of pay and conditions has resulted in severe criticism being levelled at the industry.  Surely the Minister will recognise that investing such a large sum in training personnel will result in them being frustrated if they do not have a career opportunity with sufficient remunerative rewards at the end of their training.  What action does the Minister propose to take?  The Minister will be aware of criticisms at recent conferences and on the &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo; programme which highlighted this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been recognised not only in the House but by the industry.  The Government will spend that money on training.  If we are to give quality training there must be quality employment at the end of the training otherwise young people will not become involved in the industry.  I have concentrated on this issue with the industry in the last 15 months so that the industry itself can respond in a broad sense.  It is the fastest growing industry in the world and the third largest employer in Ireland.  It is critical for the industry and for the economy that it be seen as an area where a high level of skill is employed with good conditions and remuneration, pension schemes and so on.  I am working with CERT, the various sectors in the industry and the Tourism Council to achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is a pity that a co-ordinated approach was not taken to the industry over the years?  Many young people spent five years training and are frustrated at the <Col N="2063" /> lack of a career path in the industry.  At the end of the day they do not have a decent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. Tourism was always seen as the Cinderella industry but it is now recognised as a major economic player.  As Minister for Tourism and Trade I am privileged to be responsible for it.  I will work with the industry in putting a structure in place which will ensure people's perception of the industry will change and young people will find the industry an attractive and worthwhile area in which to work.  This will not happen overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been looking at the problem for 15 months.  It is time to make decisions on the matter having regard to the fact that it has been raised by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Irish Hotel and Catering Institute.  They are examining the shortcomings in terms of career opportunities and the type of careers that are available in the hotel industry, which do not measure up to the expectations of young people.  Will the Minister agree that if action is taken now rather than waiting for a further 15 months or setting up more useless committees he should be able to identify the solution and give hope to those young people now?  Will the Minister indicate when his exhaustive 15 months examination will come to a conclusion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am by no means exhausted from considering this problem, and in addition I am considering many other matters.  Only recently I published the findings of research conducted by CERT which clearly indicates dissatisfaction among some employees <Col N="2064" /> in the tourism industry.  I am not in the business of setting up further quango committees to consider problems, I am working with the industry to put in place measures to ensure that young people will want to join this industry and will find it satisfying, offering a career with good pay and conditions and long-term prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept as legitimate criticism that the Government's policy for the tourism industry lays greater emphasis on quantity than quality?  Unless greater emphasis is placed on quality and high spending tourists the level of remuneration will not be sufficient to make the industry attractive for a full time career in tourism. By favouring low cost, high number, the industry is not able to employ at a proper salary level those who receive training.  Many of the establishments in the catering and accommodation area are at the cheaper end of the market where untrained people provide facilities and services to tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has broadened the question into another area.  I am very supportive of bringing in high yield, high spending visitors to our country.  I have no intention of allowing Ireland to become a mass tourism destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>By the end of this century we can expect an average of five million visitors to our island from abroad.  I am as keen as the Deputy to ensure that higher spending visitors come here.  If the tourism industry is to be attractive to young people this question must be addressed by the industry, with the Government.  We are doing a great deal of work in terms of marketing Ireland and providing facilities under the European Regional Development Fund and I would like to see that followed through by the industry.  It must understand that its attractiveness to <Col N="2065" /> young people has been limited in the past, as has its promotion by Government, but that is changing rapidly and we are working towards the desired objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We should get across the idea that we are not operating a scrooge industry.  The hotel industry is an excellent one which provides a service second to none, and that applies across the board.  Our bed and breakfast operation, which gives marvellous value, is probably one of the best in Europe, if not in the world.  Is it the Minister's intention to draw all the strands together, the Hotel Federation, the catering industry, his Department and Bord Fáilte with all its expertise, to come up with a solution to this problem? The Minister is aware there is a problem, as does the industry, and a solution must be found as a matter of immediacy.  There is a huge opportunity for young people to be employed in this decent, honourable industry and there is no reason the Minister should not take a lead in this regard.  Why wait 15 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

      <P>This month I published the findings of CERT which identified the areas of dissatisfaction and made recommendations on how to deal with the problems.

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be noted that there will be difficulties in terms of <Col N="2066" /> recruiting numbers of personnel in the tourism industry in future years.  First, in 1996 there will be 10,000 fewer students leaving second level education because of the extension of the senior cycle from two to three years.  Second, the continuing decline in the population means that by the year 2005 the number of 18 year olds in the Republic will be 20 per cent fewer than in 1995.  Third, in line with other service sectors CERT recruits its trainees in a very competitive environment. The attractiveness of the tourism industry is very dependent upon the perception of young people and their parents, career prospects and working conditions in the industry.  I am working with the industry to respond to those needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred on a number of occasions to the CERT report on young people's attitudes to work in the industry and related matters. Am I right in thinking that a body of research exists which has not been published?  Does the Minister intend to publish it?  On co-ordination of training, does the Minister intend, in the interests of the industry, to ensure standards are reached by all those involved in training &mdash; a number of bodies other than CERT are involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure to what information Deputy Killeen is referring that remains unpublished.  If he gives me details I will see if it is available for publication. On the training element, CERT submitted its strategic plan for development of that body and I intend to deal with that matter shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that to encourage the tens of thousands of people being trained in the industry to commit themselves to a lifetime career in the industry incomes must be high, and that will not be achieved unless we improve access to this country for tourists, particularly high spending tourists from places such as the southwest coast of America?  Those people do not have direct access to this country <Col N="2067" /> but must travel through a number of airports in order to get here.  Because of the tediousness of the travel arrangements they are not coming here and we are losing out to the English and continental markets.  Until definite action is taken in that area we will not be able to build a high income career for young people who should have the opportunity to earn a decent living in the tourism industry.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether equality and fairness should apply in the provision of funding and grants to registered bed and breakfast projects in view of the fact that the funds and grants available to registered bed and breakfasts are limited and that under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999, such funds and grants are allocated on a strictly selective basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7563/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 focuses primarily on the development of top quality tourist attractions and amenities, training and overseas marketing primarily to assist Irish tourism generate increased visitor numbers and revenue. Assistance under the programme for new accommodation in the bed and breakfast category applies only where such facilities are associated with other tourism developments.</P>
      <P>The provision of commercially driven facilities such as tourist accommodation and catering has to be a matter for the individual entrepreneur and the tourism industry itself, in direct response to their assessment of the market opportunities generated by increased tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to assist with further expansion plans, all registered and approved tourist accommodation has been deemed eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  A total of £52 million of this £208 million fund has been specially earmarked for tourism projects.  A similar scheme confined to the Border counties was recently <Col N="2069" /> introduced under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund and certain tourism projects are also eligible under this scheme. Moreover, investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for tax relief under the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>The Minister's response smacks of discrimination and it is clear that the philosophy of the Government is anti-bed and breakfast facilities.  The Minister did not reply to the specifics of Deputy Callely's question. As one who travels the country and who uses bed and breakfast outlets a great deal in my pursuit of the elusive fish, I know and appreciate them and I am sure the Minister will agree they give a service second to none.

      <P>The growth in this area is self-evident from the number of international users.  On assistance for the bed and breakfast sector or any other <Col N="2070" /> approved accommodation, the access to funds scheme, introduced last year by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment with £52 million included for tourism projects, was established as a result of claims made by people in the sector who did not want grants but access to cheap money.  That money was made available and is being used.  The scheme is successful.  In addition, as Deputy Leonard will be aware, a certain amount is available under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund for Border areas and that is being used successfully also.</P>

      <P>For some reason, better known to him, the Minister continues to refuse to answer Deputy Callely's question.  What was the take-up of either grants or loans by the bed and breakfast sector?  That might help the Minister to focus his mind on the question.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that in areas such as mine, not traditionally known for tourism, although they are trying to develop rural tourism, the 20 per cent to 25 per cent grant aid for bed and breakfast facilities is meagre and does not provide any incentive? The Minister referred to the Border fund but an EU official, Carlo Trojan, stated that he favours a cocktail of measures to supplement such funding. Will the Minister consider providing additional funding to these areas from the Peace and Reconciliation Fund to supplement those grants?</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised an interesting point.  The development of the tourism sector generally in the Border counties has been hampered by 25 years of violence and, as a result, a great deal of infrastructural development must take place.  While the portion of the Peace and Reconciliation Fund available may not be as much as one would wish, it is an initiative of sorts for the commencement of that development. I will take the Deputy's views into account and I will examine the various elements of the cross-Border funds for accommodation purposes to see if we can agree on a measure that might be of some benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are some options in respect of unapproved accommodation and I am considering them.  There is a lack of accommodation in many parts of the country not only in the bed and breakfast sector but also in regard to hotels and other types of accommodation.  These issues must be examined in terms of the dispersal of the visitors so that as many areas as possible can benefit from the revenue generated.</P>

Some of those changes have been detrimental to projects planned in the past six to nine months.  The Minister introduced this scheme on 1 July 1995 and it boggles the mind that it is being changed nine months later.

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>the calculations, if any, made by his Department on the effects on Irish exports of the high value of the punt against sterling.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The degree to which <Col N="2073" /> accurate calculations can be made at any time of the effects on Irish exports of variations in the value of the punt against sterling is very much circumscribed by other factors influencing performance by individual firms, such as raw materials sourcing, use of sophisticated financial instruments like hedging, overall supply in the market and competition from other producers for individual products and ability to diversify into more lucrative markets.</P>
      <P>At the end of last year An Bord Tráchtála carried out a survey of indigenous firms exporting to Britain.  It indicated that a small number of firms with exceptionally high UK market dependency were experiencing difficulties, particularly in the depressed consumer and construction sectors.  The board established a special task force in the UK market consisting of marketing specialists which is focusing on exporters experiencing particular difficulties and which have limited scope for diversifying out of Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The firms involved were exporters which were not in a position, for a variety of reasons, to export outside Britain, to diversify into other elements of the British market or to Europe.  I can supply the Deputy, in confidence, with information on the nature of the industries involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of firms which close down in any year for a variety of reasons is probably considerable. I cannot put a figure on the exact number of industries which have gone out of business specifically as a result of the <Col N="2074" /> currency fluctuations.  ABT, in recognition of the small number of exporters to the British market experiencing severe difficulties, appointed a number of marketing experts to work with them so that they might trade out of these difficulties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Official trade statistics from the Central Statistics Office do not distinguish between exports from foreign-owned and Irish-owned firms.  Latest available figures for 1995 relate to the first three quarters which show total merchandise exports were valued at £19,764 million of which we would estimate foreign-owned companies could account for in the region of 65 per cent.</P>
      <P>The non-food indigenous sector, which is the principal focus of An Bord Tráchtála's promotion effort, accounted for £2,872 million of this figure according to a survey carried out on their behalf by the ESRI.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for Irish food exports rests with An Bord Bia which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from what the Minister said that 65 per cent of the <Col N="2077" /> non food exports were manufactured by foreign-owned companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister draw any conclusions from that having regard to the tax incentive for foreign manufacturers exporting, the favourable tax regime for foreign companies located here and the way in which they can invoice their goods and static level of exports from Irish manufacturers because of the higher tax regime which applies to them and the fact they do not have access to the invoicing facilities of foreign owned companies to maximise on the tax regime?  A lower tax regime would increase exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>

Estimates are not available on a specific breakdown as between foreign and Irish owned companies, as I have pointed out to Deputy Molloy.

Indigenous industry is defined as a group of firms who trade in and from the Irish market and have management functions, marketing, production and finance, established or located in Ireland. I am not sure of the mechanics of obtaining a breakdown of those statistics.

      <Quest>the progress, if any, made in 1995 to promote Irish tourism in the Japanese market; the funds provided for this purpose in 1995; the plans, if any, he has to further develop this market in 1996; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Japanese visitors to Ireland have grown rapidly over the past two years, from 18,000 in 1993 to an estimated 30,000 in 1995, representing an increase of 67 per cent. Additional funding of £100,000 was made available to Bord Fáilte in 1995 from the Tourism Promotion and Development Fund under subhead B3 of my Department's Vote to support increased promotional activity in the Japanese market.  Additional resources are being made available again in 1996 from this fund to supplement Bord Fáilte's tourism promotion and marketing activities in overseas markets.  The <Col N="2079" /> board is currently finalising plans for the expenditure of these resources and it is understood that among the items again under consideration are marketing activities in third country markets such as Japan and Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept the Japanese are high spending tourists of the kind we should be attracting if we are to create an industry that will support its employees with high level incomes and worthwhile careers.  I extend my appreciation and congratulations to Bord Fáilte on its success in increasing the numbers by 67 per cent over the two-year period mentioned by the Minister.  The Minister said that £100,000 extra was provided to help develop this market in 1995 but he did not state what sum is being provided in 1996.  Will he indicate if that amount has been increased?  Bord Fáilte can only be active in selling Irish tourism in the Japanese market if it has the resources to do so.  A sum of £100,000 is very small in view of the high level of spending from the 30,000 Japanese visitors who came to Ireland in 1995.  This figure can easily be increased to 100,000 in a short period.</P>
      <P>In his travels to London, Paris, Rome and other capitals of Europe throughout the 12 months of the year, has the Minister noticed, as I have, the large numbers of Japanese tourists?  There is a 12-month tourist trade to be tapped from the Japanese market and countries throughout the world are getting a much larger share.  The increases shown are from a low base.  This is a market well worth going after which would greatly benefit the industry here and we should be much more vigorous in seeking an increase in the level of Japanese tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first point is correct and I agree with it.  The Japanese visitor is among the highest spending tourist in the world.  However, they have a series of requirements in <Col N="2080" /> that they like to visit well-known landmarks in Rome, London or Paris.  It is true that when passing through these cities huge numbers of Japanese visitors are evident.  The economic well-being of Japan has meant that the numbers travelling have risen from 100,000 in 1963 to over 13 million in 1995, two million of whom visit Europe on an annual basis. Bord Fáilte is again examining the issue of marketing in Japan in order to increase the numbers coming here. Also, in a trading sense, we are trying to do this in terms of our attractiveness as a golf location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The factors which inhibit the growth of Japanese tourism include the low consumer awareness of Ireland and the lack of traditional and family ancestral links as compared with other long haul markets such as Australia or the US, the high cost of travel between Ireland and Japan and the absence of direct air links.  While discussions have taken place on this matter over the years, given the relatively low numbers involved I am not sure airlines would find this prospect commercially viable.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte is focusing on the Japanese market and a number of encouraging developments have taken place in recent years.  These include the appointment in 1992 of a part-time Bord Fáilte representative, who is a Japanese tour operator in Tokyo; packages to Ireland featured by 19 Japanese tour operators as opposed to 11 in 1993, ten of which include a number of days in Britain; a further five <Col N="2081" /> Japanese operators offering fully inclusive tours for individuals only and language study tours.  A sum of £1,235 million is available in 1996 under the Tourism Promotion and Development Fund under subhead 3 of my Department's Vote to supplement Bord Fáilte's tourism promotion and marketing spend overseas.  The emphasis in the past two years has been on direct promotional activities, particularly in third markets such as Japan and Australia.  Bord Fáilte is examining this for 1996.  I will be able to reply in detail on the next occasion in respect of that.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made little mention of access and he has not mentioned the possibility of access over Moscow.  As the Minister is aware, Aeroflot has a number of flights into Ireland and has built up a huge level of business.  There is much business between Moscow and Tokyo which could be looked at in terms of improving access for Japanese tourists to Ireland.  He has not referred to those Japanese tourists who are particularly interested in outdoor pursuits such as golfing and fishing, who might be enticed to visit the west, areas such as his and mine which have had negligible growth in recent years.</P>

The question of Japanese visitors who wish to avail of our golfing facilities is taken into account.  It is part of the Japanese mentality towards the taking of holidays in any event.

I launched recently the overseas membership scheme for 24 golf clubs in Ireland. There was a great expression of interest <Col N="2082" /> in this by Japanese companies who would like their members and clients to avail of this facility.  It may well be that this scheme could be expanded and be part of an overall package being offered by Japanese companies interested in coming here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 31 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development operates as an integrated development agency for the mid-west region.  As a regional development company, part of Shannon Development's role is to initiate and support tourism development as a key element in the achievement of overall economic growth throughout the mid-west region. To accomplish these objectives, the company has established four units focusing on key support activities as follows: tourism industry development; tourism visitor servicing; tourism project development and tourism product promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although established on a different statutory basis Shannon Development's tourism functions are, in many respects, similar to those of the regional tourism organisations who were established by Bord Fáilte.  However, the company has <Col N="2083" /> additional responsibilities in that it acts as an implementing agency for the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999 dealing with project proposals in the mid-west region in the same way as Bord Fáilte does for the rest of the country.  In addition, Shannon Development's subsidiary company, Shannon Castle Banquets and Heritage, develops, operates and markets day visitor attractions and nighttime entertainments.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to amend the already extensive role played by Shannon Development in the development of the tourism sector in the Mid-West region. Their role is different but complementary to that of Bord Fáilte, which is responsible for marketing Ireland abroad.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Shannon Development is in a position to discharge its tourism responsibilities effectively within its available budgets in 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concerns in tourism circles in the mid-west that the role of Shannon Development may not be complementary to that of Bord Fáilte and that the region may be losing out because of a perceived overlap in the roles of the two bodies?  Will he set people's minds at ease by assuring them that he does not propose any further diminution of Bord Fáilte's tourism role?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to reduce Bord Fáilte's tourism role.  When concern was expressed publicly some months ago about Shannon Development's responsibilities in the tourism sector I met the individuals and hoteliers involved and representatives of Shannon Development.  Its responsibilities were outlined and I expect it to do the job it was set up to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of Shannon Development in marketing Shannon Airport was removed by the Minister's <Col N="2084" /> colleague.  What effect has that had on its role as a tourism promotion body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Shannon Development is well aware of its responsibilities and this change is being implemented.  I expect Shannon Development to continue to work for the region and I hope we will see the benefits of that in increased visitors' spend and economic yield.</P>

      <P>The IBEC survey on barriers to trade, which was carried out last year at my request to determine if the Single Market was working for Irish companies, found that one-third of respondent exporters had experienced difficulties in gaining market access to other EU markets.  IBEC was subsequently requested to further analyse the survey results to ascertain the nature of the problems concerned, to enable my Department to pursue these problems with the EU Commission and other member states concerned.</P>
      <P>In late November 1995 IBEC confirmed that almost all cases of difficulties reported by Irish exporters had been successfully resolved.  Efforts were still being made to settle the small number of unresolved cases and, if these proved unsuccessful, the assistance of my Department would be sought.  Because of the progress made through other channels, the need for representations to the EU Commission and other member states regarding difficulties experienced by Irish exporters in EU markets has not arisen to date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 52 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>Progress is advanced on the development of a new tourism brand for Ireland which will build upon our recognised image strengths as a green, friendly and relaxed destination with excellent scenery and facilities and a warm welcoming friendly people.  The brand will seek to convey a more complete and lasting holiday experience which will encourage more new, repeat and overall higher value tourists.  At this stage it is estimated that the total development cost of the brand and the associated images could be of the order of £3 million to £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In developing the tourism brand, Bord Fáilte and its tourism industry partners are liaising closely with a number of other agencies, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs, An <Col N="2088" /> Bord Tráchtála.  An Bord Bia and the IDA, involved in promoting Ireland's image abroad.  Regular co-ordination is also taking place within the foreign earnings committee.</P>
    <P>I will convene a special meeting of the foreign earnings committee tomorrow to examine the response of State bodies in dealing with the impact of the recent BSE scare.  The main purpose of that meeting will be to ensure maximum co-ordination of effort and use of State resources to ensure that the message about the superior quality and clean, green image of Ireland's food produce is being communicated coherently, especially in our key international markets.</P>

We must improve the seasonality profile of tourism and enhance existing investment rather than create new developments.  The brand proposition which builds on the emotional experience and our key tourism assets, that is accessible unspoilt scenery and interaction with friendly and engaging people, has been derived from extensive consumer research abroad.  The proposition is being worked on in an effort to develop various identities, images and advertising and to support a major marketing push later this year.

County Mayo; (2) Deputy Martin &mdash; the need to clarify the situation regarding the threat posed to the scheduling of the 1996 leaving certificate, junior certificate and NCVA examinations as a result of the industrial relations dispute regarding pay and conditions for members of the Civil and Public Service Union and the plans, if any, the Minister for Education has to ensure that the examinations are organised smoothly; (3) Deputy Noel Ahern &mdash; the unsatisfactory nature of the reply <Col N="2197" /> given by the Minister for Justice to Parliamentary Question No. 48 of 2 April 1996 which dealt with the confiscation of cars which are idiomatically referred to as company cars; (4) Deputy Shortall &mdash; the need to tackle illegal drug dealers by establishing a special unit involving the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare; (5) Deputy Quill &mdash; the hardship caused to asthma sufferers as a result of the recent decision by the Southern Health Board to withdraw benefits under the drugs cost subsidisation scheme to patients who did not avail of the scheme in 11 out of the preceding 12 months; (6) Deputy Joe Walsh &mdash; the need to confirm reports that the Minister for Social Welfare is preparing to close social welfare branch offices nationwide; (7) Deputy Séamus Brennan &mdash; the reason the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, gave allegedly misleading information to both Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to the Dublin light rail system and the reason the light rail system was announced subsequent to an EU investigation which could have wide-ranging consequences for the funding of the project; (8) Deputy O'Donnell &mdash; the present position on the provision of a light rail transit system for Dublin; (9) Deputy Molloy &mdash; whether the reason for the delay in signing the GSM licence for ESAT Digifone relates to concerns expressed by other applicants regarding the circumstances surrounding the awarding of this licence; (10) Deputy Costello &mdash; the need to expedite the transfer of Irish prisoners under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995; and (11) Deputies Mary O'Rourke and Charlie McCreevy &mdash; the need to take immediate steps to resolve the dispute in the Civil Service regarding the embargo and promotions which is causing massive disruption.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the very long illness he suffered, I was not alone in this House in feeling a deep sense of shock when I learned of the death of my friend, and the friend of many Members, Gerry L'Estrange.  Those of us who have served in the House for any length of time will remember vividly Gerry L'Estrange speaking from a seat which rather poignantly is one of the few seats left vacant at present &mdash; beside where Deputy Callely is seated &mdash; and excoriating the then Government in an eloquence which has not been matched in this House either for its colour or vigour. He could speak strongly and from a deep conviction &mdash; his convictions were very deep &mdash; and at the same time hold no personal malice towards any of the victims of his eloquence, and this was understood and appreciated.</P>
      <P>He made many friends during his long public career, which did not commence as a political one.  He was a noted athlete who competed on the national and local stage in long distance running.  He is known still by those active in that field of endeavour.  He was subsequently elected to Westmeath County Council in 1942, and served on that body until 1981 &mdash; one of its longest records of service.  He chaired Westmeath County Council for three years from 1959 to 1961 and served on virtually all the subsidiary and other bodies to which the council makes appointments.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy L'Estrange was a member of the Seanad from 1954 to 1965.  His particularly robust political style may not have been entirely suited to that House.  He found his true home when he was elected to this House in 1965 where he served until he retired undefeated in 1987.  He was also a member of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Leader of the Fine Gael Party I recall that when no member of the Front Bench was willing to attend a meeting at the far end of the country and everybody else had important personal or political engagements more convenient to home, Gerry L'Estrange <Col N="2199" /> was always willing to go wherever the party wanted him to go.  He was, in the best sense of that term, a true party man.  He believed in and served his party.  He shared all its good and bad points and expressed them in this House, sometimes to the annoyance of others but always in a way that was truly authentic.  Gerry L'Estrange was a genuine politician.  He spoke from his heart about things as he saw them.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party and the Government I would like to express my deep sympathy to Eileen, and to Sally L'Estrange, his cousin who looked after him during his long illness, and all those in County Westmeath and Longford who feel bereaved by the passing on Good Friday to his eternal and well earned reward of the late Gerry L'Estrange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great sadness that we on this side of the House learned of the passing of Gerry L'Estrange.  He was a Member of the Oireachtas for over 30 years, and I remember him as a courteous gentleman. He was well liked on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I remember how he used to sit in the Whip's chair bombarding the Government when I was first elected to this House in 1977.  He struck me than as a tough and outspoken opponent.  He seemed to be the permanent Whip, having held that position for a long time. When I was a young assistant Whip he took time to teach me some of his tricks at which he seemed expert.  As a young Deputy I certainly found him a very nice person to deal with.</P>
      <P>It is said that he served in all positions in Westmeath working for his people. He was a constituency person and a great member of the party he served and loved so well.  He was a Minister of State and worked very closely with the general council of county councils of which he was three times chairman and which, in its own way, helped the democratic process and the important role of councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to extend our sympathies to his wife, Eileen, his family, friends <Col N="2200" /> and former constituents and to his party for which he worked so hard.  He was one of the great characters in this House during his years here.  I do not know how he fitted into the Seanad.  Here he seemed not to take too much notice of the Chair and managed to make his point.  I am sure he acted differently in the Seanad.  Outside the House he was certainly a very nice person.  We send our sympathy to all his family and to his friends.  Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh a anam fíor uasal agus go dtugfhaidh Dia beannacht don a chlann agus don a chairde go léir.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I extend to the family of the late Gerry L'Estrange and to Fine Gael, the political family of which he was so proud to be a member, our condolences and our deepest sympathies.</P>
      <P>I was honoured to be elected to this House in 1977 and I recall Gerry L'Estrange at that time.  That was before the arrival of high technology, including the televising of the proceedings in these Chambers.  One of your predecesors, a Cheann Comhairle, the late Cormac Breslin, had a habit on occasion of talking to himself without turning off the microphone, and would make a running commentary on the contributions of various speakers &mdash; something I know the present Chair would never indulge in.  On one occasion a great friend of Gerry L'Estrange, the late Frank Cluskey having had an almighty row with Cormac Breslin which had just subsided, was interrupted by Gerry L'Estrange who had rushed down from his offices upstairs to tell Frank Cluskey what Cormac Breslin had been saying about him whereupon the whole row started up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gerry L'Estrange was a fighter.  He fought vigorously for what he passionately believed in, but he fought without malice.  Although he could have deeply held opinions which differed from those of other Deputies, this difference never travelled outside this Chamber.  There was no personal malice ever associated <Col N="2201" /> with his very strong invective and his very strong language.</P>
    <P>He was a major personality in this House and in the Seanad.  Colleagues in Westmeath will recall that he was also a major character in his own county of which he was very proud.  His passing is mourned.  He left this House of his own accord in 1987 with a very honourable record, having made a considerable contribution to the party-political and democratic processes.  I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to his wife and family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of the late Gerry L'Estrange and to his party, the Fine Gael Party.  Gerry L'Estrange was first elected to this House in 1965, replacing General Seán MacEoin.  He served as a Minister of State in two Departments, as Government Chief Whip and Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party.  Unlike many Deputies who were noted for their reticence in contributing to Dáil debates, Gerry L'Estrange was known for his vociferous contributions and was in frequent argument with the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>He was, I understand, a meticulous record keeper, keeping detailed notes of every meeting he attended.  The conversion of those records into a book would, perhaps be a mouth watering prospect for any journalist &mdash; Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who is about to produce her book, is already laughing.  Perhaps somebody might be able to get their hands on those records and translate them into a book we would all enjoy reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gerry L'Estrange was very much an old-style politician.  Although I have been in this complex since 1977, he was not somebody I knew well.  I do remember his vociferous contributions.  I am pleased to know &mdash; and it speaks volumes for the kind of person he was &mdash; that he did not take the rows outside this Chamber, and I believe that is important.  We can have very robust debates in this House, sometimes of an <Col N="2202" /> extreme kind, but it is important that we have a sense of balance and not take our party political differences into other arenas.</P>
    <P>To the family of Gerry L'Estrange and the Fine Gael Party I extend my sympathy on his passing.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the expressions of sympathy with the family, friends and party colleagues of the late Gerry L'Estrange.  I was here for a number of years and knew him casually.  He was a quieter man during the few years I knew him than the one I remembered from listening over the years to reports of the Oireachtas on the radio.  Such reports always seemed to lead off with Gerry L'Estrange having been in trouble with the Chair or some Minister of the day.  It struck me the Dáil must be a very interesting place, so I resolved to become a Member.  In private I found the late Deputy L'Estrange to be a very kind, courteous man not at all matching his public image in radio and newspaper reports.  As the Taoiseach has said, he was a passionate politician and argued from the depths of his convictions, which is the kind of politics needed.</P>

    <P>In compliance with Standing Order 142 of the Standing Orders relative to <Col N="2203" /> Public Business, I have to announce that at the by-elections held on 2 April 1996, consequent on the deaths of Deputies Neil T. Blaney and Brian Lenihan, the following Members have been elected to the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dáilcheantar Dhún na nGall Thoir Thuaidh</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for the courtesy.  I extend hearty congratulations to Deputies Cecilia Keaveney and Brian Lenihan on being elected to this House.  I was elected at a comparatively young age and know it to be a very exciting experience to enter this House on one's first day as a Member. It must be all the more rewarding for both of them to feel they are continuing or completing the work of a much loved parent.  In both cases their fathers served this House very well and were much loved by all Members, one having had the privilege of serving for a very long time, the other for a lesser period.  Both were greatly admired for their work.  I know that these new Members will continue that admirable work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a day of great celebration for both, one on which each must be looking forward to their work and attainments as public representatives representing their respective constituencies. Also it is a great day for their supporters gathered in the Public Gallery who can barely restrain themselves. While we on this side of the House, worked tirelessly to ensure that they were not elected, we vicariously share in <Col N="2204" /> the sense of enjoyment, happiness and celebration of their supporters on their success.</P>
    <P>Warmest contratulations to both new Members, to their party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and all associated with their success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>Is mór an onir domsa mar Cheannaire ar Fhianna Fáil fáilte agus fiche a chur roimh an bheirt Teachta Dála nua de chuid Fhianna Fáil, Cecilia Keaveney agus Brian Lenihan.  Cuireann sé áthas agus bród ar gach ball d'Fhianna Fáil ar fud an tíre gur éirigh linn an dá shuíochán seo a breith ag an am céanna, rud nar tharla le scór bliana.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has said, it is an honour for any Members to take his or her seat in this House.  Needless to say, as Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, it is a great honour for me to welcome two new Members to the House, both having fought hard to have the initials &ldquo;TD&rdquo; appended to their names.  Both will have had much family experience of politics through their respective fathers who between them served a long period, Deputy Cecilia Keaveney's father for a short period and Deputy Brian Lenihan's father for a much longer one. They replace two great people, Neil Blaney and Brian Lenihan whom we remember fondly today.</P>
      <P>I thank all who worked so hard on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party to achieve their victories, their families who will know what politics is all about and their supporters, old and new, who have been campaigning over many years.  I also want to thank all those who gave them their No. 1 preference vote and those candidates whose votes were transferred to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt both new Members will be very conscious of what is expected of them.  They have learned during the campaign of the rigours of political life. Sometimes politics is a much maligned profession, but Members see it as a worthwhile vocation in which they believe.  We are proud to serve, which is why we spend so much of our lives <Col N="2205" /> endeavouring to achieve worthty objectives. It is my hope that these two new Members will find it a worthy occupation, even if at times they wonder if it is so.  They should forget about those times and remember that at the end of their term people will always say nice things about them, though that may not be the case during it.  Today all Members unite in saying they are great people and at the end they will do the same.  In between is a matter for themselves.</P>
    <P>Although on this occasion my party is the victor, I acknowledge the efforts of the supporters of all the other candidates, many of whom in the course of the count may have thought they would be here today.  I should like to remember and thank them also because all of their efforts encapsulate the ups and downs of political life.  Meeting them in the course of political campaigning, one is very much aware of their feelings. They are people who subscribe to the democratic process and should not be forgotten on a day like this.</P>
    <P>Since the end of this Dáil is not too far distant, as the Fianna Fáil Front Bench, Parliamentary Party, national executive and all our supporters prepare to take our places on the opposite side of the House, I hope these two new Members will work assiduously to ensure that we and they are returned in 12 months' time.</P>
    <P>We congratulate both and wish them well &mdash; Cecilia for her great success in Donegal North-East and Brian in Dublin West.  I also thank our director of elections, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, who worked so hard in Donegal and Deputy Noel Dempsey on his efforts in Dublin West, Deputy McDaid, Senators and other public representatives in Donegal, Deputy Liam Lawlor and other public representatives in Dublin West on their achievement.</P>

      <P>On <Col N="2206" /> behalf of the Labour Party, I congratulate the Fianna Fáil Party on the election of their two new Members who won the democratic mandate to be represented in this House.  Frequently we tend to take for granted, perhaps in a disparaging way, the reality not shared by many others worldwide &mdash; a modern, developed, functioning democracy based on party politics, the rule of law and the ballot box, a democratic system not merely respected but actively engaged in by a wide range of citizens, the vast majority of whom devote much of their free time voluntarily to that end.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the work of all parties to enable the system to function.  Without the people in the gallery, whose presence I acknowledge, and people throughout the country, we would not have a functioning democracy.  This is a celebration for everybody but particularly for the two newly elected Deputies.</P>

      <P>I too congratulate the two new Deputies on behalf of the Progressive Democrats Party.  As the Taoiseach and Deputy Bertie Ahern said these two young Deputies follow a proud family tradition.  I am sure their families are very proud of their achievements. I am sure they will find their work in this House very challenging and satisfying.  It is a great honour to be elected at such a young age to represent the people of Donegal North East and Dublin West.  As the only leader of a party that is gender balanced I am pleased we have another woman in the Dáil.  In each of the three most recent by-elections, a woman was elected and that is very good indeed.  I look forward to the election of many more women at the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputies may well know that other than today the next time nice things may be said about them is when they unfortunately pass away, so they should not get too carried away with today's nice words.  Neither should they get too comfortable in their seats because there will be a general election before too long &mdash; one only has to look <Col N="2207" /> at how unhappy the Government is to realise that.</P>

I also acknowledge the support we received from the parliamentary party and the extended party; their work enabled us to take our seats today.  I thank the supporters of other parties who transferred their votes to me as this was also important.  I thank my supporters who travelled far today and who worked very hard on my behalf.</P>
      <P>The people of Donegal North-East were eager to elect a Fianna Fáil person to look after their interests, in conjunction with Deputy McDaid, and I am glad Deputy Harte will make my life easy for a while.  I look forward to working with both Deputies and to trying to help Donegal North-East.  I intend to work closely with Deputies McDaid and Harte, particularly on behalf of Inishowen which area has not had a representative since my late father held the seat in 1976.  I thank the Deputies for the help I am sure they will provide to help me settle in.  I anticipate a long stay and I thank the House.</P>

Does the Taoiseach agree that, when I raised this legislation on a number of occasions in the last session, it would have been reasonable for me to expect him to outline that the Bill could not be taken in the normal way as a result of major changes?  The Taoiseach was kind enough on one occasion when I asked him to instruct the Minister concerned to talk to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce about its objections to the project, but the Minister responded, and I raised it in this House, that he could not change anything and could not listen to the objections of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce as the submission was in Brussels and could not be changed.  The Minister had known for several months that the matter was under question in Brussels and had a report on his desk which he did not forward to Brussels.</P>

      <P>The safety of Irish troops serving under the UN in south <Col N="2221" /> Lebanon is a matter of paramount concern to the Government.  From the outset, we have been in close contact with the commander of the troops in question, Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Lucey, who is in constant contact with the defence forces headquarters and the Minister.  There have been consultations today at my request with the Israeli Ambassador to convey our concern about the shelling of south Lebanon, the risk it poses to Irish soldiers serving with the United Nations and the importance of resolving difficulties of this nature by diplomatic means.  I am in constant contact with this matter, as is the Tánaiste and the Minister for Defence and the Marine.  As and when necessary, I will report to the House on any matters that arise.</P>
      <P>The question of having a special debate on the subject can be considered but I assure the House that the concern expressed by Deputy Burke is shared by the Government.</P>

From a national point of view, we are concerned about the safety of our troops in south Lebanon and we want to see peace in that area.  I welcome the fact that the Government has called in the Israeli Ambassador to discuss the situation with him.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs should take every action possible at EU and UN levels to ensure the shelling is discontinued and the peace process is re-established in the Middle East at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's comments following questions I asked about proposed legislation on education, indicated that a number of Bills, particularly the universities Bill, would be published before the summer recess.  However, it now appears from the list sent to us by the Government Chief Whip that an education Bill will not be published prior to that date.  It is now more than a year since the publication of the White Paper on education and it appears the momentum for change and reform in the education world forecast by the White Paper has stopped.

The heads of the Bill were approved by the Cabinet on 13 February. At this point, it is simply a question of drafting the legislation in its proper form.  There has been a recent improvement in the availability of drafting resources in the draftsman's office. However, many technical and difficult legal questions remain to be dealt with <Col N="2223" /> in the drafting.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill sets out to achieve a number of goals.  First, it gives effect to the taxation changes announced in the budget.  Secondly, it introduces a variety of new tax reliefs and allowances to encourage particular social and economic objectives.  Thirdly, it closes off certain tax loopholes and avoidance schemes and, finally, it seeks to refine a number of major tax reliefs to ensure that the original intention of these reliefs &mdash; employment, productive investment or innovation &mdash; remain the central focus of the schemes of relief. This last goal delivers on an undertaking in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and the continued and critical examination of all tax relief schemes will remain part of the ongoing process of review and evaluation of the effectiveness and rationale of such schemes.</P>
      <P>This year's Finance Bill breaks new ground in that a considerable number of its measures were announced well in advance of publication.  The Bill also sets out a series of tax consolidation provisions which are necessary to prepare the way for the full consolidation of the income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax Acts to be enacted next year.  An additional innovation is that the Bill has been made available in disk format this year for the first time.  This, I know, will be welcomed by practitioners who track the passage of the Bill very closely.  Turning to the individual sections of the Bill, the main changes in personal tax reliefs are to be found in sections 1 to 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 1 to 3 provide for the increases in basic personal allowances, income tax exemption limits and widening of the standard rate tax band provided for in the budget.  There are also increases in the blind person's tax allowance, the allowance for an incapacitated child and the maximum income tax allowance for the provision of a carer <Col N="2225" /> for an incapacitated taxpayer &mdash; a number of these allowances have not been increased since the middle of the last decade.</P>
    <P>Section 4 renews for a further year up to 6 April 1997 the special exemption from unemployment benefit taxation for all systematic short-time workers, which was introduced in the Finance Act, 1994 and broadened in the Finance Act, 1995.  It is worth recalling that the general exemption from tax of the first £10 per week of unemployment benefit will continue at its current level.  The exemption from tax of the child dependant additions payable with unemployment benefit and disability benefit will also continue.  These two measures were provided for in the Finance Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 5 implements the budget announcement of a tax allowance of up to £800 at the standard rate for persons aged 65 or over, living alone, for the purchase of and installation of alarm systems.  The relief is now being extended to relatives of those elderly living alone who pay for the installation of the alarm.  The new relief will apply in respect of expenditure incurred in the period from 23 January 1996 to 5 April 1998.  The definition of &ldquo;relative&rdquo; is wide in scope and includes relationship by marriage or by legal guardianship. Much interest has been generated in this relief and I am confident it will assist the elderly in providing for their personal security.  In addition, the Minister for Social Welfare has announced further measures to assist the aged generally in this regard.  The tax relief will be claimable with the minimum of fuss or formality, as set out in this section.</P>
    <P>I have been examining for some time how the benefit-in-kind charge on genuine sales representatives could be ameliorated.  The problem has been to define a set of parameters which would identify this group from others for whom the use of a company car is not an absolute necessity.  The group at whom the relief is aimed are those employees who spend a lot of time travelling but do not do enough business <Col N="2226" /> mileage to qualify for the existing tapering relief.  To meet this, a 20 per cent relief from BIK on cars is being introduced in section 6 for those company representatives who spend 70 per cent or more of their time on business away from their place of work.  This relief will operate as an alternative to the existing high mileage tapering relief and is available only where the business mileage exceeds 5,000 miles per annum and where the employee works on average at least 20 hours per week.</P>
    <P>Claims for the new relief will be based on a two part certification process by employees and employers. Employees will have to maintain a log book containing details of business mileage travelled, business transacted, business time travelling and date of journey.  The employer will have to certify that the details in the log book are correct.  These requirements are needed to ensure that the relief is not abused by those outside the target group.</P>
    <P>Section 7 brings the definition of an &ldquo;authorised insurer&rdquo; into line with the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which regulates the health insurance market in the State.  Income tax relief will also be available on foreign medical insurance originally taken out while an individual was resident in another EU member state.</P>
    <P>Section 8 updates the list of accountable bodies who must deduct 27 per cent withholding tax from payments made by them for professional services. Details of the bodies affected are set out in section 8.  In section 9 it is proposed to ensure that awards by the hepatitis C tribunal, or by a court in these cases, will not be subject to income tax.</P>
    <P>In relation to taxation of farmers, sections 10 and 11 provide some important improved reliefs.  The £3,000 exemption for income derived from certain leases of farmland is being increased to £4,000 in section 10 for leases of five or six years taken out from 23 January 1996.  Where such leases are for seven or more years, an exemption <Col N="2227" /> of £6,000 will apply instead of the previous limit of £4,000.  This will encourage older farmers to lease land to young farmers on a long-term basis.  A special measure is being introduced in section 11 in regard to the valuation of farm stocks on the discontinuance of a farming trade where the stock is transferred free of charge under the EU Early Retirement Scheme.  This measure is designed to remove a disincentive to farmers transferring farm stocks under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 12 proposes to increase the lifetime cap on existing tax relief for the purchase by full-time employees and directors of new shares in their employing company, whether quoted or unquoted, from £3,000 to £5,000.  The relief is also being extended to part-time employees and directors.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 21 deal with BES relief which is being renewed for a further three years from 6 April 1996, subject to certain changes announced in the budget.  These changes include a statutory certification system for any investment of over £250,000, whether single or cumulative, in a company or associated company and additional measures to combat companies splitting to get around the £1 million BES limit.  The guidelines for certification of industrial projects were issued on 15 February 1996 after discussion with the relevant fund managers.  Guidelines for tourism projects have been put in place and those for the remaining qualifying areas are being finalised.</P>
    <P>The Bill also sets out transitional provisions for &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; cases which were well advanced before budget day.  As a result of further changes announced by me on 29 February, a small number of projects, which were well advanced and in respect of which BES funds were raised by a designated fund prior to 6 April 1995, will qualify under pre-budget BES rules provided at least two-thirds of the moneys raised by the fund had already been invested by budget day in other qualifying projects.  I <Col N="2228" /> believe that these transitional provisions are fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>The BES is being extended, from the passing of the Bill, to the music industry for investments in the production, publication, marketing and promotion of a new artist's recordings and associated videos subject to a detailed certification system to be operated by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The BES is also being extended to FINEX &mdash; the financial futures exchange in the IFSC &mdash; for a period of two years subject to certification of individual projects and a limit of £100,000 in BES funds per project and £2 million in total BES funds over the two year period.</P>
    <P>The various changes to the BES scheme are intended to ensure that funds are invested in genuine business ventures that create additional economic activity and jobs.  Since the annual amount of funds invested in BES schemes in recent years has been very substantial &mdash; at least £50 million &mdash; I will monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangements in producing an enhanced economic benefit to compensate for the substantial tax resources absorbed by BES.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for the exemption from tax of income from greyhound stud fees on the same basis as the existing exemption from tax of stallion stud fees.  This relief is aimed at assisting the development of the greyhound industry in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 23 renews the 50 per cent initial capital allowance for buildings in the Custom House Docks area and Shannon Airport zone up to 24 January 1999 and for buildings in the Temple Bar area up to 5 April 1998.  The standard rate of capital allowances for industrial buildings was due to revert from 4 per cent to its former 2 per cent level on 1 April 1996.  Section 24, however, provides for a permanent 4 per cent allowance for such buildings. This is a useful industrial incentive in the tax code.</P>
    <P>Section 25 closes off an undesirable loophole in the relief for seaside resorts <Col N="2229" /> in so far as holiday cottages and apartments are concerned.  The proposed amendment will modify the tax incentive by providing that both the double rent allowance and the capital allowances cannot apply in relation to holiday cottages, apartments and other self-catering accommodation at the same time, and by ring-fencing the capital allowances for registered apartments and other self-catering accommodation to rental income or the income from the trade of operating holiday cottages or apartments, as is the case already for registered holiday cottages.</P>
    <P>The changes will apply from 28 March 1996, the date of publication of the Bill, except in cases where before that date an application for planning permission had been received by a planning authority, or a binding contract for acquisition or construction had been entered into, or where the Revenue Commissioners had given a favourable opinion in a particular case.  The proposed amendments are intended to prevent the use of certain tax aggressive schemes based on holiday cottages which are excessively costly to the Exchequer and to redress the balance in favour of other more worthwhile tourist projects in the resort areas covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, section 26 overhauls the existing section 35 film relief along the following lines.  Section 35 relief will be continued for a further three years, with effect on and from budget day, subject to a reduction in the amount of expenditure on larger films which qualifies for relief; an increase in the limit for corporate investment; the restriction of the tax deduction to 80 per cent of the investment; and the substitution of a one year holding requirement for capital gains tax purposes for the current three year holding period for investments.  Tax relief will only be available in future from the date of commencement of principal photography to encourage films to be commenced within a reasonable period of investment in the film.</P>
    <P>In addition to details announced in <Col N="2230" /> the budget, the Bill provides for certain transitional measures for investment in film companies made before budget day and announced by me on 29 February. Essentially, these allow for the continuation of relief where funds were invested in good time but the film had not proceeded or been certified.</P>
    <P>Two further changes are proposed to the section 35 relief.  First, an additional special 10 per cent increase in the maximum level of qualifying expenditure eligible for the relief will apply for off-seasonal activity &mdash; i.e. where principal photography commences between 1 October and 31 January.  Second, corporate investors will be allowed to invest on a annual basis up to £4 million in addition to their new £2 million annual limit, provided the additional investment is in small scale projects which tend, by their nature, to be Irish made films.</P>
    <P>Section 27 deals with tax relief on royalties from patents.  As this is a somewhat complex provision I will go into the matter in some detail.  The use of certain patents to construct tax relief schemes has been well advertised among professional advisers.  There is evidence which indicates that the relief is being used by manufacturing companies as a means of rewarding directors and certain employees in a tax efficient manner without any obvious benefit to the economy from greater research and development activity.  The Exchequer cost associated with this practice is significant and the indications are that the cost will continue to increase substantially in the future if no action is taken.</P>
    <P>A survey of a sample of cases undertaken by Revenue indicated that relief is being claimed in many cases for quite small changes to manufacturing and ancillary processes involving little or no technical innovation.  The estimated cost over a four year period of the reliefs in this sample was £10 million to £20 million. As Deputies will be aware a patent can last for 20 years.</P>
    <P>Abuses in the non-manufacturing sector were countered in the 1994 Finance Act by restricting the relief to royalty <Col N="2231" /> payments between unconnected persons. This year's Bill tackles abuses in the manufacturing sector.  To target the relief at those companies pursuing ongoing research and development programmes or exploiting significant innovations protected by patent, the Bill proposes first to retain tax relief for patent royalties by a company from a manufacturing company whether connected or not.  However, the Bill restricts the amount of tax free royalty income to the amount which would have been received if the parties were dealing at arm's-length.  This will enable Revenue to challenge the amount of tax exempt patent income received by an individual or company where it bears little relationship to the commercial value of the patent.</P>
    <P>Second, it is proposed to retain tax relief in full for distribution to shareholders made by companies out of patent royalty income received from unconnected companies.  Third, in the case of a company receiving patent royalty income from a connected company, the maximum amount of tax exempt distributions which the company can make in an accounting period to shareholders will be determined by the actual level of research and development expenditure incurred by the company in that accounting period and in the two preceding accounting periods.</P>
    <P>However, where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the patent is in respect of a radical innovation, and not taken out for tax avoidance purposes, the tax exempt distribution of the royalty income will not be limited in this way.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that the measures proposed are balanced and reasonable.  They will help to curb more questionable claims for relief, and refocus the relief on productive research and development expenditure.  In this way the section will reduce the necessary cost of relief to the Exchequer while at the same time conforming to the original intention of the relief when introduced in 1973, to stimulate genuine <Col N="2232" /> research and development and innovation.</P>
    <P>Sections 28, 30, 44 and 46 amend certain IFSC and Shannon reliefs.  Provision is being made in section 28 to permit IFSC-Shannon fund undertakings to pay interest gross to non-residents bringing the position for this type of entity into line with that for IFSC companies. Section 30 will allow certain IFSC and Shannon financial services companies to hold units in IFSC-Shannon managed collective funds.  The types of companies in question are treasury, insurance and fund management companies.  At present the tax transparent status of funds under section 18 of the 1989 Finance Act would be jeopardised if these IFSC or Shannon companies held units in the funds.  Section 46 allows the securitisation of a much wider range of assets by IFSC certified companies.  These include loans, leases, trade receivables, such as debts, and consumer receivables, such as credit card debts.</P>
    <P>All retail operations are currently excluded from the Shannon 10 per cent regime.  This rules out mail order or distance selling activities to the extent that such operations are targeted at the final consumer.  Section 44, however, will amend the law so as to facilitate the carrying on of such mail order operations in the Shannon zone which contribute to the use and development of the airport.  It is hoped to attract a number of such mail-order businesses to the region in the near future.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is aimed at assisting a mining company to return a mine site to a greenfield state after the closure of the mining operation.  The section provides a tax allowance for expenditure incurred in this way and also for advance payments made by a mining company into a fund to finance the eventual closure costs, where such advance payments are required under a State mining facility or other agreement with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>Sections 31, 32, 33 and 40 deal with the tax treatment of gilt sales in certain <Col N="2233" /> life assurance and other investment media and the spreading of unrealised non-gilt gains by life assurance companies and undertakings for collective investment.  These measures seek to ensure that the losses on gilt disposals, where the disposal is ex-dividend, are not allowable for offset against income or gains until the related interest accrues and that no unintentional relief arises from the procedure whereby life assurance companies and undertakings for collective investment can spread their unrealised non-gilt capital gains over a seven year period.  The spreading process was intended to lessen the effect on such companies of the taxation of unrealised gains but the facility has been used in certain cases to bring forward the benefit of capital losses while deferring associated tax liability on the spread of unrealised gains for up to six years.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes changes, in section 36, to the tax treatment of certain longer-term deposits subject to DIRT.  The Bill provides that DIRT will be levied on these deposits each year on the annual accrued interest of the relevant deposits instead of being rolled-up until the final year.  The financial institutions will now have to pay the DIRT to the Exchequer annually, to the extent that this is not already done in certain cases.</P>
    <P>This amendment and those I have mentioned above seeks to ensure that life assurance products and competing deposit-based savings products are taxed on as level a basis as possible having regard, nonetheless, to inherent differences in the way in which these products are operated or constructed.</P>
    <P>I will be examining on an ongoing basis what other tax changes might be undertaken over time in the savings market to maintain a level playing field and to encourage the provision of a greater range of savings and lending instruments best suited to customer needs and to the requirements of developing financial markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2234" /> As the House will know, the Government has extended the range and increased the scope of various employment grants and subsidies to encourage the creation of employment opportunities, in particular for the long-term unemployed.  To make these incentives attractive to firms, section 35 provides that, as with IDA employment grants, the following employment grants will be exempt from tax in the hands of employers with effect from 6 April 1996: grants paid by county enterprise boards under their operating agreements with the Department of Enterprise and Employment; grants paid under the back to work allowance scheme, and grants paid under the Leader and area partnership programmes.</P>
    <P>The new £80 per week subsidy announced in the budget for the recruitment of persons who have been unemployed for at least three years will also be exempted.  The exemption will apply from the date of commencement of the scheme, scheduled for 1 June next.</P>
    <P>Sections 37 to 48 contain the main corporation tax provisions.  Section 37 introduces the 30 per cent rate of corporation tax on the first £50,000 of proofits announced in the budget.  Section 38 amends the tax treatment of certain exchange rate gains and losses on hedging instruments which are used to remove exchange risks on the corporation tax liabilities of trading companies. Other provisions in sections 41 and 42 are designed to close off certain corporation tax avoidance schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 48 broadens the scope of tax relief on research and development expenditure introduced in the 1995 Finance Act.  This relief already provides for an exceptional quadruple allowance for incremental research and development expenditure by manufacturing companies over a three year period.</P>
    <P>The relief is being extended, first, to allow companies or groups which receive grants for research and development not exceeding £50,000 in a relevant accounting year to obtain the relief in respect of their non-grant aided <Col N="2235" /> expenditure.  At present, companies receiving grants, no matter how small, are disqualified from the relief.  This amendment will enable about half of the 200 or so companies which are being grant assisted under the EU operational programme for research and development to claim the relief in respect of non-grant aided expenditure.</P>
    <P>Second, relief will now be calculated by reference to increases in expenditure over a fixed base year level in contrast to the previous regime which required increasing yearly expenditure.  Finally, a definite termination date is being set for the scheme to ensure that the scheme is not open-ended.</P>
    <P>The 1995 scheme has been slow to get off the ground and the take up of the relief has been disappointing.  The changes now proposed should allow for a better take-up without escalating the cost of the relief in an unacceptable manner.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, the number and scope of reliefs from capital gains tax has been extended significantly. There is much debate on the appropriate rate of CGT with calls by some for a substantial reduction.  There are two rates of CGT &mdash; the full rate of 40 per cent on the generality of capital gains and a lower 27 per cent rate on gains from shares in unquoted trading companies with a net worth of less than £25 million.  There are also generous roll-over relief provisions and business retirement relief.  The object of these provisions is to target the relief on productive investment and to facilitate the transfer of business assets to this end.</P>
    <P>Sections 49 to 53 make further changes in the area of capital gains tax. Sections 49 allows insurance companies to pay claims under material damages policies without operating the capital gains tax withholding provisions.  This is to rectify an unintentional side-effect of an anti-avoidance provision introduced by section 76 of last year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Section 50 is intended to remove any doubt as to the correct treatment applying where, on the reorganisation of a <Col N="2236" /> company, a taxpayer receives a loan note in exchange for shares.  Any subsequent disposal of the loan note will give rise to a charge to CGT in the same way as disposal of shares.</P>
    <P>Section 51 amends roll-over relief on the disposal of certain quoted or unquoted shares and the acquisition of shares in an unquoted trading company. It does so by relaxing the requirements in relation to holding periods and employment with the company which a person must satisfy in order to qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>The lower rate of CGT &mdash; 27 per cent &mdash; applies to gains realised by individuals on the disposal of ordinary shares in certain small and medium-sized companies. The shares in question must be held for at least five years prior to disposal. This ownership period is now being reduced to three years by virtue of section 52.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill provides in section 53 for an exemption from any CGT liabilities that might arise from the winding-up and dissolution of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards.  Since the proceeds of these disposals are to be paid into the Exchequer, the net effect of the exemption is to avoid a circular transfer of funds out of and into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the recent report on island development and the proposals in that report to address the economic and population decline of offshore islands.  To assist in this objective, the Bill proposes in sections 54 to 59 to extend to certain offshore islands two specific reliefs to encourage the construction or refurbishment of residential accommodation.  The reliefs are, first, an allowance against income tax of 50 per cent of expenditure on construction or refurbishment of permanent accommodation for owner occupiers at a rate of 5 per cent per annum for a period of ten years.  Second, the offsetting of construction, conversion and refurbishment expenditure on the provision of rented accommodation against all rental income of the owner provided that the accommodation lease, to the same tenant, is for a period of at least 12 months. <Col N="2237" /> The reliefs will apply to qualifying expenditure in the three year period from 1 August 1996.  The islands concerned are those 21 offshore islands listed in the report on island development.</P>
    <P>Turning now to indirect taxes, sections 60 to 63 make a limited number of changes to VRT as it applies to certain special vehicles, namely, motor caravans and crew cabs.  This involves a reduction in the VRT rate to 13.3 per cent.  A small change is being made to the VRT scrappage scheme.  In a limited number of cases involving married couples, the car being scrapped is in the name of one spouse while the new car is being registered in the name of the other.  Section 62 will allow the VRT refund to be made in such cases.  In fact, Revenue has exercised its discretion in allowing the relief in the few cases which have arisen so far.</P>
    <P>Sections 64 to 75 deal in the main with the principal budget excise duty changes.  I do not need to re-cap these at this stage.  There are other new reliefs, however, contained in these sections. Section 64 will abolish betting duty on bets placed on course at greyhound tracks in respect of events taking place at other locations.  Section 66 removes the value of food sales from the turnover basis on which pub licence duty is calculated.  This will apply both to pubs and to restaurants with full pub licences and brings the basis of charging excise duty into line with hotels.</P>
    <P>Section 67 relates to the disabled drivers scheme.  This scheme provides exemptions from VRT, VAT and road tax on motor vehicles, and excise duties on fuel used in such vehicles, driven by disabled drivers or used to carry disabled passengers.  To qualify for relief in respect of a disabled passenger, adaptations to take account of the passenger's disablement must be carried out to the vehicle at a cost of not less than 20 per cent of the pre-tax price of the vehicle, that is excluding VRT and VAT.  In response to representations, section 67 provides that this requirement will be reduced to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2238" /> Section 71 makes a minor adjustment in the spirits duty rate on a revenue neutral basis in order to ensure that the average amount of duty payable on a bottle of spirits will not increase as a result of the implementation of EU rules on the definition of spirituous products.  Section 71 will also reduce the duty on spirits based &ldquo;alcoholic lemonades&rdquo; to bring it into line with that on other similar lemonades based on beer or made wine.</P>
    <P>Section 72 of the Finance Act, 1994, prohibits the sale of cigarettes at a price higher than the manufacturers' listed price.  Section 73 of this Bill amends that provision to permit the price of cigarettes sold through coin-operated vending machines to be rounded to the nearest 5p.  This amendment takes account of the shortage of copper coins and the practical difficulties in relation to using such coins in the machines.</P>
    <P>Section 74 makes two minor changes to the offences provisions relating to tobacco tax stamps.  First, it will be an offence to have unstamped cigarettes on display in shops, etc.  Secondly, counterfeit or altered stamps will be seizable.  I will introduce a further change on Committee Stage to make it an offence to misuse a valid stamp from one packet by putting it on another.  These amendments are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the tobacco stamp regime which came into full effect on 4 March 1996.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to VAT are to be found in sections 76 to 89.  These give effect to the incorporation into primary legislation of the EU Second Simplification Directive with effect from 1 January 1996.  Other measures are as follows: an increase in the rate of farmers' flat rate VAT, and the rate of VAT on livestock, from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent announced in the budget, with effect from 1 March; and a number of technical changes to the VAT treatment of second-hand goods and the invoice rules in the case of hire-purchase transactions. The Second Simplification Directive to which I referred simplifies, among other things, the VAT rules in <Col N="2239" /> relation to contract work and cross-frontier supplies.  It is already in force by virtue of EU regulations signed by me in December which are now being confirmed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 90 to 100 introduce new stamp duty charging provisions in respect of the transfer of uncertificated securities.  Most Irish quoted companies will opt later this year to allow the title to their shares to be transferred by a new electronic settlement system called CREST.  This will replace the existing paper-based system and will do away with the need for share certificates for those shareholders and companies who opt into the new electronic system.  It is necessary, therefore, to revise the stamp duty charging arrangements which are based at present on the taxing or stamping of documents.</P>
    <P>There have been extensive discussions between Revenue and my Department and the Stock Exchange and investment managers on the new form of stamp duty taxation.  My concern has been to protect the substantial annual revenue yield of almost £25 million from share transfers while, at the same time, seeking arrangements which allow the trading of shares to proceed in an efficient manner.  Following detailed discussions with the Stock Exchange and other interested parties, the Bill now provides for the following: the electronic instruction to a company registrar to update the Share Register will be liable to stamp duty at the rate of 1 per cent of the sale consideration; transfers between the date of purchase and the date of settlement on the Exchange &mdash; called &ldquo;closings&rdquo;&mdash; will continue to be exempted from the stamp duty charge; a stamp duty liability will not generally be imposed unless the transfer involves a change in beneficial ownership; broker-dealers who purchase shares will not be liable to pay duty provided the shares are sold on within one month; and market makers who undertake to facilitate the sale and purchase of Irish shares for which they are recognised as <Col N="2240" /> market makers will retain their exemption from duty.  The effect of these changes will be broadly revenue neutral and will ensure that the normal operations and liquidity of the market are not upset by the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>A number of other changes are also being made to the stamp duty regime. Section 101 repeals the £10 stamp duty charge that at present applies on the incorporation of a company on both the Memorandum and the Articles of Association of the company.  The revenue loss is estimated at £300,000 per annum and the need to remove the charge arises from a recent ruling of the EU Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, new houses with a floor area of less than 125 square metres are exempt from stamp duty. However, the deed of transfer or conveyance must be submitted to Revenue together with a floor area certificate issued by the Department of the Environment. Section 102 provides that these deeds need no longer be presented for stamp duty purposes if the deed itself contains a statement to the effect that a valid Department of the Environment certificate was in force for the new house at the date of transfer or conveyance. This will reduce the formalities and simplify procedures for obtaining the stamp duty exemption.</P>
    <P>Other sections provide stamp duty relief on transfers of American depositary receipts issued in the US in respect of Irish unquoted shares, and on certain international business mergers involving Irish companies.  Both these changes are to assist Irish firms in the international arena, either by way of raising capital or by forming international corporate alliances.</P>
    <P>Section 103 confirms the increase in stamp duty on ATM cards from £2 to £5 announced in the budget with effect from 1 February 1996.  Section 106, with section 34 earlier, re-enacts the tax and stamp duty exemptions contained in the Securitisation (Proceeds of Certain Mortgages) Act, 1995: and section 107 repeals a number of redundant stamp duty provisions in earlier legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> The budget and this Bill make a number of changes to the capital acquisitions tax code.  I have received a sustained level of representations to the effect that the CAT code is hindering business development and the transfer of business assets intact from one generation to the next.  My approach to these claims has been to consider action where it can be shown that there are genuine employment concerns or where a business might not be able to survive intact. Whether it is a good thing to preserve the ownership of business firms from one generation to the next, or whether we should encourage new blood and new capital, is an issue on which good arguments can be advanced on both sides.  The tax system should be neutral here but I wish to make it clear that, unlike the stated long-term goal in the UK, there is no question of abolishing CAT itself.</P>
    <P>In line with this, section 109 is an anti-avoidance one.  In certain circumstances it may be possible for shareholders in a private company to reduce CAT liabilities by increasing the number of shareholders above 50 and, thereby, escape the current private company control test.  Section 109 amends the definition of private company for CAT purposes to ensure that companies cannot escape the private company control test in this way.</P>
    <P>Sections 110, 113 and 115 give effect to the budget day proposal to increase CAT relief on the transfer of relevant business and agricultural assets from a maximum of 50 per cent to a rate of at least 75 per cent, and to extend the minimum holding period for such assets from six to ten years after transfer to qualify for the full relief of 75 per cent. Section 114 provides that where the beneficiary and his or her relatives control the company concerned, the 10 per cent minimum shareholding requirement will no longer apply for the purposes of business relief.  This removes an anomaly in the rules for qualifying for business relief.</P>
    <P>Section 111 provides exemption for gifts and inheritances used exclusively <Col N="2242" /> to discharge the medical expenses, including residential care, of a permanently incapacitated individual.  Section 112 allows a life tenant who is not a spouse of a disponer to effect a tax exempt &ldquo;section 60&rdquo; insurance policy used to pay CAT liabilities.</P>
    <P>Section 116 introduces a significant simplification measure which was the subject of an Opposition amendment last year.  At present, all applications to the Land Registry for registration of property based on squatter's title must be cleared by Revenue for capital acquisitions tax purposes before any registration can take place.  However, a considerable number of such cases involve small holdings, where a charge to CAT would not have arisen in any event or where any CAT which might possibly have arisen would be insignificant. Section 116 proposes to dispense with Revenue clearance for holdings of less than 5 hectares, and £15,000 in value, provided that solicitors are willing to certify that the holding being registered is within these limits of value and size.  The section also introduces a similar but broader relaxation for statutory authorities acquiring property on which a CAT liability may arise.</P>
    <P>Section 117 ensures that the instalment facility for business and agricultural property introduced in last year's Finance Act will continue to be available where the business or agricultural property concerned is sold or compulsorily acquired and the proceeds are reinvested within one year of the sale in other qualifying business or agricultural property.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill sets out miscellaneous pre-consolidation provisions. As the House will know, the law in relation to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax will be consolidated in a tax consolidation Act in 1997. Work on the consolidation Bill is progressing on schedule for the introduction of the Bill next spring.  In order to speed up the process and to allow early consultation on proposals, I have already published on 5 March a series of proposed amendments which are <Col N="2243" /> designed to clear the way for consolidation next year.  These sections were issued in a fully drafted form, together with an explanatory memorandum. They deal largely with technical items &mdash; repeals, revisions, standardisation of provisions, definitions, etc.  These measures are now included in sections 118 to 125 and Schedule 5 of this Bill. The provisions are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum and we can deal with them on Committee Stage if necessary.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation to the Revenue Commissioners for the expeditious and efficient way they have handled the complex and time-consuming process of consolidation, meeting all the deadlines for completion of the relevant stages of the project so far.  I extend an invitation to Deputies in both Opposition parties, should they wish to have access to the Revenue Commissioners, to meet the group engaged in this consolidation work in order to fully understand the complexity associated with it.  On present calculations, when it comes to the House next spring it will be the largest item of legislation ever to come through the House in a single format, containing approximately 1,100 sections. Advance familiarisation with the Bill would be of assistance to us all.</P>

      <P>The final sections of the Bill cover a small number of miscellaneous matters.  Section 126 is the standard provision in relation to the annual annuity to be paid into the capital services redemption account.  Section 176 of the Finance Act, 1995, provides for the setting off against income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax or capital acquisitions tax of the value of donations of heritage items made by a person to approved Irish cultural institutions. There is a cap of £0.5 million on the maximum value of donations that <Col N="2244" /> can be accepted in any one calendar year under this scheme.  This is being increased to £0.75 million in section 127.</P>
      <P>Section 128 provides for a new system for the recoupment to vehicle licensing authorities of the costs incurred by them in the operation of motor tax offices. Licensing authorities are now allowed to deduct their expenses at source instead of according to the system which operated up to 31 December 1995 whereby licensing authorities handed over the gross amount collected in motor tax and were reimbursed from the Vote of the Department of the Environment.  Section 75 of the Bill introduces an upper limit on the amount of road tax &mdash; £2,350 per annum &mdash; that will be charged on heavy goods vehicles over 20 tonnes unlaiden weight.  A limit of £800 already applies to private cars. This is being done at the request of the Minister for the Environment to simplify administrative requirements.  A very limited number of vehicles will be affected by the change which will cost less than £5,000 in revenue terms.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for listening with attention to the explanation of the main provisions of this Bill.  I am sorry it has taken the length of time it has and that it had, of necessity, to be somewhat complex in its description.  We will be able to deal in detail on Committee Stage with many of the sections which require attention.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for dealing in detail with the various sections of the Bill which we can discuss further on Committee Stage.  I suggest that there is the basis for a doctoral thesis on an analysis of spindoctoring, media coverage pre-budget and post-budget of the governmental period of Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people have now endured two offerings from this administration.  The common theme to both has been the pre-budget hype of brilliance to come and the post-budget depression of the electorate.  It is difficult to know if it is a commentary on the performance of this <Col N="2245" /> Government or on the media that both budgets have been characterised by fawning pre-budget coverage and, for about a month after budget day, uncritical analysis.  It is only when either we have a by-election which allows media persons and politicians to meet the populace, or when trade union leadership in response to their members' concerns, give voice to their frustrations, that it dawns on some that the great budget of 1995 or 1996 was not that great after all.</P>
    <P>I feel a certain sympathy for the Minister for Finance who in the past week has begun to lecture public sector unions and already started the build up to the 1997 budget in promising that this Government will actually do something next year.  Is it not wonderful what a vote of less than 4 per cent can do?</P>
    <P>At least the Minister for Finance appreciates the correlation between lower public expenditure and lower taxes.  He was reduced to pleadings in the media &mdash; usually in Monday morning's editions of the daily newpapers &mdash; in the lead up to the 1996 budget.  This unique style of Government, that of appealing to his ministerial colleagues over the airwaves to cut back on their demands for more and more spending, has not worked for the Minister in the past 16 months.  Does anyone seriously believe that this left-dominated Government will seriously curtail public spending to allow real tax reform and reductions?  Does anyone believe that a Labour Minister for Finance could politically stand the heat from Democratic Left for increased public spending in a politically and socially sensitive area, particularly in the lead up to an election? The answer is simply &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The high growth rates of the past few years are camouflaging an unprecedented growth in public expenditure. This Government has consciously decided to spend the fruits of the economic revival on increased public spending. There is a myth not totally confined to the political left that increased public spending is always good socially.  This is a nonsense because, when corrective <Col N="2246" /> measures have to be taken, it is always the poor and the weak, whom the Left pretend to be concerned about, who bear the brunt of corrective economic measures.</P>
    <P>One good thing about the Dublin West by-election is that it allowed policitians of all parties from all parts of the country to see at first hand the disengagement of a large segment of the population from the electoral process.  I have seen this in Kildare, parts of which resemble Dublin West, for some time.</P>
    <P>When Minister for Social Welfare I met groups who were trying to deal with those who have disengaged themselves from the political process.  The Dublin West by-election provided an opportunity for members of political parties to see this first-hand.  Some years ago I got into difficulties with my party for raising the concern about large segments of the population disengaging from the electorate.  Some years later, following his election to the House, Deputy Currie stated on radio that the cynicism he encountered from the electorate here was more alarming than the bomb and the bullet in Northern Ireland.  That echoed what I had said approximately five years previously and politicians on all sides should be aware that the number of people holding this view is increasing.  I hope the Dublin West by-election, which was good for Fianna Fáil's morale but discouraging for certain members of the Government, highlighted this problem because it will eventually haunt all Members.</P>
    <P>Under our present tax system more than 50 per cent of the wages of a single person, who earns less than the average industrial wage, is taken by the State in tax and PRSI.  Due to the madness of tax and social welfare policy decisions for many years, a large number of people have decided they are better off not working and do not intend taking up work.  Under our tax system an employee, depending on his or her income threshold, can be worse off financially after an increase in pay.</P>
    <P>While our tax system is complicated, it is a shining beacon compared to our <Col N="2247" /> social welfare system which contains so many anomalies that minor changes in one area can create a myriad of complications elsewhere.  Surely it is not beyond the wit of legislators to put into effect a relatively simple system that would give people an incentive to go back to work and guarantee the sick, the old and the unemployed sufficient income.</P>
    <P>The Government tends to boast about how well it provides for those on welfare.  While I am not directing this criticism at the Minister, some members of Government regard themselves as the caring people of society.  It is amusing that commentators and the middle classes &mdash; probably priveleged from birth &mdash; who belong to various organisations appear to know what is best for the unemployed and the poor.  It may surprise them that most poor people know when they are being fooled by politicians or policy makers and are well able to make decisions for themselves.</P>
    <P>Despite our best efforts over many years, our tax and social welfare systems have become mind-boggling and are not achieving the desired results.  If the two systems were integrated people would know they would be better off working. Some 95 per cent of Members are aware of what is happening but, unfortunately, many of them are afraid to state their views on the matter.</P>
    <P>God gave us the Ten Commandments but other rules and regulations were made by the people.  If we have made matters so unnecessarily complicated that some people believe they are better off not working, surely it is time to do something about it.  A worthwhile aspect of canvassing in a by-election is that one meets real people who talk about their real problems.  Many of us, particularly those in Government, tend to get out of touch with the electorate. The provision in the budget to provide tax relief on alarms for the elderly is an obvious example of how out of touch the Government is with the ordinary people.  Undoubtedly, the person who thought of the idea had good intentions. <Col N="2248" /> but does the Government not know that the majority of the elderly do not have a taxable income and that the proposed relief would not benefit them?  We were also told that the main thrust of the 1996 budget was to help the low paid.  That is nonsense because the tables issued on budget day demonstrate that they would not be better off.  To add insult to injury, the Minister abolished the £140 tax allowance for PRSI which was of some benefit to the low paid.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister for Social Welfare I am aware of the shortcomings of the live register, but it is an exact method of a calculation each week.  In recent times Ministers and commentators have said they must go by the labour force survey because the live register is not an accurate reflection of the numbers unemployed.  That may be the case, but nobody has proposed how the live register could be improved to make it an accurate reflection of the numbers unemployed.  The Department of Social Welfare's budget must be in excess of £120 million per annum.  In my last year in office it was approximately £112 million. Long before I became Minister for Social Welfare a considerable amount of money had been expended on installing in that Department one of the best computerised systems in Europe, although the Revenue Commissioners may have caught up since.  With a little political will by the Minister for Social Welfare and at the press of a few buttons, it would be possible to determine who and where people are signing on.  It has been said that it is difficult to obtain accurate information from the live register but this could be done very easily and without further expense if there was political will at the top in the Department of Social Welfare, that is on the part of the Minister.  This might be of interest to the officials in the Department of Finance who are afraid it might impose another administrative burden on them and bring further demands from the Department of Social Welfare. I urge the Department of Finance and the Minister to consider doing this.</P>
    <P>In spite of the perilous state of the <Col N="2249" /> public finances in the late 1980s, Fianna Fáil in Government from 1987-94 was able to reduce the rates of taxation and at the same time keep the finances in order.  The last two budgets have stopped the process of any semblance of tax reform stone dead.  I am often amused by the phrases used in official press releases which, perhaps unconsciously, sometimes hit the nail on the head or touch a raw nerve.  In the case of this Bill which was published by the Minister on 28 March, the press release described the text as &ldquo;running&rdquo; to 130 sections.  It is true to say that it &ldquo;runs&rdquo; and the Members of this House are running after it.  The ink was barely dry when we were given a deadline for our comments on Second Stage and the draft amendments for Committee Stage which will be taken next week.  I am sure civil servants genuinely burn midnight oil in the preparation of the explanatory memorandum for us and I thank them for this commitment which is in line with the best traditions we have come to expect of the public service.</P>
    <P>Our difficulty as legislators is that contrary to what the public believe, that is the Finance Bill merely puts the Budget Statement in a more legalistic form, the Bill contains much new material of a highly complex and technical nature hitherto unpublished.  Must we as legislators simply rubber stamp the Bill's provisions on Committee Stage without any close or professional scrutiny in the hope that the draftsperson has got it right or should we attempt to get to grips with the various technical matters which the Bill addresses?</P>
    <P>Section 120 proposes a raft of amendments described as &ldquo;pre-consolidation&rdquo; amendments.  If we pass this section on the nod all the provisions in the Fifth Schedule will have been adapted, which comes to 12 pages of detailed drafting. This series of amendments is a convenient method of preparing for the consolidation Bill.  However, when that Bill is brought before the House it will have a certificate from the Attorney General to the effect that it is purely a consolidating Bill which contains no <Col N="2250" /> new measures.  The Minister will appreciate my hesitancy in accepting section 120 without a similar assurance that the measures in the Fifth Schedule are of no material significance.  No one really expects the Dáil to be able to prevail on the Minister to change one iota of his Bill; the only changes will be those introduced by him.  Last year he presented us with a 160 section Bill and a further 90 or so amendments on Committee Stage.  One cannot legislate at this pace.  Make no mistake about it, we are running to keep up with the Minister.</P>
    <P>As a chartered accountant I welcome the proposed consolidation Bill.  The last tax consolidation Act was introduced in 1967 and 30 years is much too long to wait for consolidation.  I hope the Minister will put in train within his Department arrangements to have Finance Bills consolidated not later than every five years.  I was not surprised to learn that the consolidation Bill, which will cover all the changes introduced in the Finance Acts over the past 30 years, will run to more than 1,100 sections.  I am glad the Minister is dealing with the issue of consolidation which is important for everyone concerned.  I congratulate the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance on the speedy progress they are making in regard to consolidation.  They are also speaking to various groups to ensure that everything is in order.  If the Bill is introduced next spring or later in 1997 it will be well ahead of the time-scale envisaged by me.</P>
    <P>The man in the street is crying out for reform of the tax code, but consolidation is not reform.  If anything, it is designed to fix more firmly the bureaucratic maze in which taxpayers and their advisers find themselves.  Fianna Fáil would prefer to see the resources which are so obviously being devoted to this massive tax measure being employed in rationalising and simplifying the tax code and in starting the task of integrating the tax and social welfare systems. However, there is no evidence in the Bill of progress on that front.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2251" /> The two crunch issues facing the economy are brushed to one side by the Bill.  In my reply to the Minister's Budget Statement I criticised the Government for losing this opportunity for genuine tax reform.  All the lobby groups' submissions I have received tell the same story, that they cannot afford to pay new employees enough to entice them off the dole queue.  This is the central log jam in economic and employment policy.</P>
    <P>An equally disturbing threat to economic growth has emerged since the budget, that is the BSE problem.  I urge the Minister to use this Bill to give a strong signal to farmers and the meat and food processing sector that we recognise the seriousness of their plight and the importance of their role in the economy.  If there is to be a ministerial amendment to the Bill it should allow private enterprise a favourable tax break for intervention-type investment in beef.  A part privatisation of the intervention system would help steady market nerves.  I propose to table amendments which will steady the market with little additional cost, if any, to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I do not know if other Deputies have noticed the growing number of submissions, pre-budget and otherwise, received from groups.  I thank them for these submissions and appreciate hearing from them.  Even though the meetings are time consuming, the Minister's decision not to meet such groups prior to the 1997 budget is short sighted.  I ask him to reconsider this decision as one can learn from these submissions and pick up the odd nugget of information which can influence thinking.  The Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, of which I am a member, meets these groups and the Minister and his officials will lose out by not meeting them.  It may be possible to schedule the meetings in a better way so that meetings are held with the main groups every year and with the smaller groups every second year.  The decision to do away <Col N="2252" /> with this consultation process will be a loss to the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    <P>There are a few give away items in the Finance Bill and I wish to propose a few more.  However, we have lost sight of the overall shape of a simple, equitable tax system and we have no fixed criteria by which to judge the merits of applications for tax reliefs.  Ideas, good bad and indifferent, come and go.  Some ideas are politically expedient while others are merely cosmetic and play to the gallery.  If there is any logic to the Government's bag of reliefs it is &ldquo;fuzzy logic&rdquo;.  This is the new fangled computer-speak for a programme which adjusts the behaviour of the machine when its operator does not know what he wants.  For example, the Government did not know what it wanted when it introduced the resort areas scheme last year.  It now wants to change this scheme but it has given no thought to those who might suffer as a result of this sudden change and there is no consideration of the legitimate expectations of entrepreneurs who had a right to expect that the scheme would be allowed to run its course.  I have with me a letter from an architect who reports that the proposed changes have led to 140 holiday apartments being cancelled in his area.  He has been forced to reduce the number of staff in his office and planning fees and contract deposits which have been incurred are irrecoverable. I do not object to the Revenue Commissioners closing off sections of Finance Bills which they have found to be lax, but it is most unusual and not good policy to introduce a scheme and, within a short time, to so change the ground rules as to affect a large number of people.  There has been little time between last year's announcement and this year's Bill for anything to happen.  I know a fair bit about the scheme because, in my time as Minister, I pushed that idea.  The Minister readily acknowledged that.  It was always the intention to revitalise certain areas.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the changes he is proposing and give the scheme a chance to get off the ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2253" /> This year there is another cosmetic proposal in Chapter 6 &mdash; relief for renewal and improvements of residential accommodation on certain islands. No doubt the list of islands in section 54 will be expanded as the Bill goes through the House.  There is a write-off of 100 per cent of construction or refurbishment costs, subject to a certificate from the Minister for the Environment. How long will this scheme last &mdash; a year, 18 months?</P>
    <P>There is more tinkering with the section 35 film makers' relief.  Has anybody actually figured out whether we are getting a net gain from this relief?  It seems there is an ongoing battle between the Department of Finance which is disposed to abolishing the relief and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who wants it to continue. I am particularly concerned about the losses incurred by local suppliers and hoteliers in Cork when a film project collapsed last year.  In a real sense they, too, were investors in that film and have lost.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is concerned about the proliferation of tax relief schemes. Quite apart from the absence of a cost benefit analysis for these, they are a blunt instrument of market interference and ought to be closely monitored.  They also foster the notion that nobody, except the PAYE sector, pays a fair share of tax.  I will introduce an amendment to ensure that these reliefs and tax-reducing opportunities cannot be used to reduce any individual's tax liability to nil.  It should be clear to all taxpayers that persons benefiting from these schemes have in most cases paid at least the average PAYE payer's level of income tax and in many cases they have paid far more, but let it be so stated in the tax code.</P>
    <P>The public has a right to be concerned too about who promotes Finance Act changes.  Do they materialise out of thin air?  Very technical changes in the Act are clearly designed to benefit someone or some group.  In this age of open government, the public and the legislators are entitled to know who has <Col N="2254" /> lobbied for the amendments proposed by the Government.  For instance, in Part IV of this year's Bill we see a series of changes to stamp duty law designed to tie in with the change from paper to electronic settlement for share transfers. I assume this amendment is for the benefit of the Crest Company, the operator of the system; but why not spell this out in the explanatory memorandum?</P>
    <P>Let us know more about other such modifications and who has promoted them in, for example, section 44 &mdash; mail order type operation in Shannon to be taxed at 10 per cent; section 52 &mdash; reducing the time shares must be held to qualify for the lower 17 per cent capital gains tax rate; section 29 &mdash; rehabilitation of the site of a qualifying mine, and section 47 about Enterprise Trust Limited.</P>
    <P>Section 35 refers to a scheme &ldquo;to be established by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment&rdquo; to promote employment of the long-term unemployed.  Was not this a part of the Government's much publicised plan to tackle the long-term unemployment problem, launched just before the budget?  There was not much enthusiasm around either for the measures proposed by the Government, or for the minor changes proposed in the budget. It is clear the Minister has not been burning the midnight oil to finalise this scheme, and we are not yet to be told the details of the plan.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil published its plans to deal with this aspect of the unemployment problem, and I will table amendments to the Finance Bill to bring these ideas into play.  I challenge the Minister to accept my proposals since the Government's plans are still obviously unfinished.</P>
    <P>By contrast with this area of inactivity, we have several instances of over-activity, of over-bureaucratisation of the tax code in this year's Bill.  For example, we see the introduction of a certification system for larger business expansion schemes.  Apart from the fact that the introduction of any additional layer of paperwork involves the State in extra <Col N="2255" /> public sector expenditure, the serious risk in this instance is that certification by the State will imply some sort of State-backed guarantee of return on investment.  Undoubtedly, some disappointed investor will in due course sue the State and produce the certificate in court in support of his claim that the State investigated his scheme and gave it a gilt edge.  Let us keep State involvement in vetting these schemes to a minimum. In the long run it will save us all money.</P>
    <P>I received another letter concerning the new requirement to apply to Forbairt for certification for BES fund status.  I raised the matter in correspondence with the Minister.  Apparently the introduction of this new requirement was not anticipated by Forbairt which was not in a position to deal with applications. In this case the investment manager was unable to obtain his certificate in advance of the date by which his investors had to invest to qualify for tax relief for 1995-96.  Somebody, somewhere, had not thought this aspect of bureaucracy through to its logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>Speaking of bureaucracy, what is all this in Part III dealing with VAT?  We are told in the Explanatory Memorandum that the Minister made a regulation under the European Communities Acts last year and that it is now necessary to revoke that regulation and re-enact its contents as part of this year's Finance Act.  I do not see why. The 1995 regulation, if valid, has already made the changes which the Minister now wants us to confirm.  Perhaps he is telling us, indirectly, that the regulation is not valid or in some way exceeded the Minister's powers under the European Communities Acts.  We will be afforded an opportunity on Committee State to tease out the sections in greater detail. However, there are some to which I must refer at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has attempted to close off perceived loopholes in the patents-royalties area.  I will accept there was a need for changes here, but I disagree <Col N="2256" /> with the method employed by the Minister in the Bill to limit this anti-avoidance measure.  In a nutshell, the Bill gives to the Revenue Commissioners power to decide whether a scheme is solely for avoidance.  I do not agree with this approach to revenue law.  Furthermore, a few year ago, the High Court ruled against the Revenue Commissioners under a similar provision relating to capital gains taxes.  The UK Revenue has resorted to this type of catch-all anti-avoidance legislation, but I am opposed to it being introduced here.</P>
    <P>It was once said by an eminent judge &mdash;&ldquo;a man shall not be taxed except by the clearest words&rdquo;.  It has long been accepted by everyone, including the Revenue Commissioners, that revenue statutes are to be construed strictly against the Revenue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Revenue Commissioners, I feel compelled to make another observation based on some issues of the past couple of years.  I am aware from first hand knowledge of the dedication and professionalism of officials from the commissioners and I hold them in high regard.  Thus, I am aware from my regular contacts with them that they are concerned about leaks of taxpayers' confidential concerns to certain newspapers and, indeed, to some politicians in this House in recent years.  It is only in recent times that this has become a source of concern and it is something I would like to see stamped out.  There may have been only a small number of such leaks, but irrespective of the background of some of the persons concerned the rules have to be applied on the same basis to all citizens. Any deviation from those principles on whatever grounds is not justified. I am aware that my opinion may not be universally shared in this House, but this marker has to be laid down.</P>
    <P>In his two budgets the Minister made some concessions in the area of transfer of the family business.  However, relief has not been extended to the &ldquo;partition&rdquo; of a family company arising on restructuring. I will put forward amendments <Col N="2257" /> on Committee Stage to get over these difficulties, and I would ask the Minister to take them on board.  Earlier, I referred to openness regarding sections of the Finance Bill and therefore I place on record that I have received representations from a specific company in this regard.  I will ask the Minister to take my amendments on board and I take this opportunity to inform him that the Inland Revenue in the UK allows such concessions.</P>
    <P>I note that the Labour Party is discovering some of the concerns of its Dublin constituents.  Thus, I will not be surprised if the 1997 budget signals the end of residential property tax.  Since its introduction in the mid-1980s by a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government I have consistently described it as a &ldquo;nonsense tax&rdquo;.  Therefore, on budget day 1995 it was with great pleasure I announced Fianna Fáil's commitment to abolish that tax on its return to office, which I reiterate.</P>
    <P>In the past few days the Minister for Finance has struck the pose of pleading for one more chance to make things right.  I suspect that the glued-together rainbow Coalition Government will allow him to present another budget but I am certain that the electorate will await polling day in the next general election to give him and his colleagues their answer, which I do not think will be a ringing endorsement.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of the beef industry in Ireland and the essential national interest involved, calls on the Government to confront the deep crisis in the industry by achieving a determined practical response at European Union level to the immediate situation and <Col N="2258" /> further calls on the Government to restore customer confidence in Irish beef both at home and abroad by taking the required political action necessary to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>We are again discussing the growing crisis within our economy as agriculture accounts for 12.1 per cent of the total number of people at work in our economy and contributed £3,452 million in total output in 1994.  Cattle output accounts for 39 per cent, milk and dairy products make up 32 per cent of that output and the dry stock sector represents 70,000 farming families involved in the production of beef and sheep for the home and export markets.</P>
    <P>The average family farm income estimated at £9,063, representing a 12 per cent increase on the relevant figure for 1994 and 1993, clearly demonstrates that the family farm income of the main farming systems is indeed varied, with dairy family farm income estimated to be £17,900.  When one takes into account the two main cattle systems having an average family farm income of £4,000 per annum, sheep family farm income estimated at £6,000 and the average income of a tillage family farm recorded at £15,000, it becomes quite clear, despite the percentage increase in income, that beef farming, in real terms, still ranks as the lowest family farm income of all farming systems.  Yet that sector contributes 39 per cent of our agricultural output.</P>
    <P>This means that the largest segment of our agricultural industry, the least profitable, is on the brink of a very serious crisis indeed.  We are debating a continuing crisis within the largest economic sector in our economy.  In the weeks since the current BSE crisis hit the beef industry we have learned one hard lesson, that the bland assurances offered by the Government at the time have proved no substitute for determined political action.  Unfortunately, this is the second occasion within a few weeks that Fianna Fáil had to table a Private Members' motion on the beef <Col N="2259" /> industry in its own time.  The complacency and inadequacy of the response by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in our last debate and since underline the need for another urgent debate on the continuous governmental mishandling of the overall problem.</P>
    <P>At the outset of this crisis Fianna Fáil sought two preliminary steps to shore up the industry.  First, we called for a concerted political campaign at ministerial level in the marketplace where sales of our beef are at risk and, second, a comprehensive response to our domestic consumers, particularly from the Food Advisory Board, to address consumers' concerns.</P>
    <P>Government efforts abroad have lagged behind ministerial rhetoric at home.  The crux of the problem lies in our markets abroad where six out of every seven of our cattle must be sold. We, the biggest exporter of cattle in the northern hemisphere &mdash; almost a month after the announcement in the House of Commons on 20 March last, which rocked consumer confidence in the beef industry not merely within Europe but beyond the parameters of the European Union &mdash; await our Minister getting on his bicycle, as was said to me at a farmers' meeting last evening, to talk to those from whom we need to secure contracts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has not gone out to reassure other Governments and buyers in foreign markets, particularly those in the Middle East, which are so important to our export trade.  The media is now reporting that the Minister will leave tomorrow on a limited tour.  Unfortunately, a <i>manana</i> attitude has typified the approach of Government from the beginning of this crisis, its failure to respond effectively, in a political sense, in those export markets underlines its apathy to the beef industry.</P>
    <P>In the past Ministers of this Administration travelled worldwide, with laudable speed, to fight for jobs, properly so, <Col N="2260" /> in the case of Irish Steel, Hewlett Packard and Digital; we even witnessed the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs being prepared to lobby in Spain for the soles of shoes for Dubarry. There has been no such response forthcoming in the case of the tens of thousands of people employed in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>While the political composition of this Government has a particular bias against farming and agriculture, I remind those parties of the Left in Government that this industry employs some 6,000 in the beef sector, 9,000 in anciallary industries and, quite apart from tax payments, contributed £42.5 million in PRSI contributions last year. On this occasion, leaving aside farmers' interests, it is important for workers that we do not have to listen to Deputy Kathleen Lynch berate the Common Agricultural Policy, which safeguard, I understand, has been arranged by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as he made a career out of ballyragging this industry and is now in a position in which he is asked to defend it.  It would be a sick joke if it was not so serious.</P>
      <P>There has been no response to the tens of thousands of people involved in the beef industry, apart altogether from the 60,000 to 80,000 farm families in receipt of the average farm income of £4,000 &mdash; according to the national farm survey of 1994 &mdash; whose livelihoods are at stake.  Yet the Government has been tendentious in devising solutions, taking action or even prepared to say it will do the maximum about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that key Ministers have made a career of pillorying an industry <Col N="2261" /> it appears they are now very reluctant to support.  Fully three weeks after this crisis erupted the Minister for Health finally appeared to announce steps the Food Advisory Board might take in the future.  He expressed the view that his Department should be given charge of the food and specialist section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment in charge of consumer affairs expressed a similar view earlier.  Consumers have real concerns about beef consumption and the Government must respond to them.  The ironic thing is that we have a good story to tell but seem unable to communicate it.  To date this Government has failed to distil a clear, concerted response to those consumer concerns and procrastination within the Cabinet has inflicted untold damage on the industry.</P>
    <P>A serious question mark must be placed over the leadership of the Taoiseach with whom there is a genuine disappointment &mdash; I say this having spoken to many farming interests nationwide since this crisis blew up &mdash; at his level of participation and interest in this matter. Emanating, as he does, from a farming background, with his knowledge of the importance of this industry to our economy, there is a genuine disappointment at his failure to take a leading role in co-ordinating some type of ministerial or governmental response commensurate with the size of the problem.  One might well have expected a leadership role from him in this regard.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has studiously ignored the crisis and has been available to attend to any issue in any corner of the world except, it would seem, to bat for the beef industry.  It would appear that Dublin-Farranfore is his preferred air route.  It is ironic that those who made their political reputation by ballyragging the beef trade are not now prepared to defend the industry against unfounded accusations.  Given that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry had charted the same course <Col N="2262" /> immediately prior to this crisis, it is hardly surprising that the Government approach has veered between apathy and enmity.  It is an apt analogy that while the Government has been fiddling the beef industry has gone up in smoke.</P>
    <P>It is crucial to bear in mind that BSE is only the latest in a series of crises to hit the industry.  Winter finishers were already facing huge losses because of the debacle over export refunds. Throughout last autumn and in defiance of all independent commentators the Minister and his Department persisted in assuring farmers that prices would not be affected by cuts in export refunds.  The Minister's complacency was such that he publicly stated his priority was to get a deal for sheep farmers and only then would he turn his attention to the cattle industry.  I said then that if that was all the Minister was doing for the sheep industry we would have to wait and see what he would do for the cattle industry.  What has happened since?  The sheep farmers are still waiting to get paid what they were promised in the infamous £26 million deal negotiated last Christmas.  In the meantime the cattle industry has gone into a tailspin.</P>
    <P>Before Easter the Minister negotiated a deal for intervention in Luxembourg. That deal was heralded by his publicist as a &ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo;.  Within days the Minister was seeking a new deal.  It was apparent the scheme he had negotiated in Luxembourg was not worth the paper it was written on as far as Irish farmers and beef processors were concerned. Most Irish cattle were not eligible because of the weight restriction of 380 kilogrammes.  It is apparent that at the moment of greatest need the Minister, who is supposed to be fighting for the needs of the beef industry, had no grasp at a technical level of the industry.  The incompetence in negotiating and agreeing to the deal in Luxembourg is mind boggling.  What shred of credibility can he expect to have at European Union level if he is running back within days to say that what he has agreed is of no use whatsoever?  Clearly, the Minister <Col N="2263" /> went to Luxembourg without a clue of what he wanted.  Worse still, he left Luxembourg without realising what he had got.</P>
    <P>It would appear from talking to people in the industry that the only way to deal with this issue is by an emergency intervention scheme.  Clearly what emanated from Luxembourg was not an emergency scheme but a market support mechanism which sought to put into intervention cattle for which there was a market in the butcher trade at home.  It is the exclusion from the scheme of the thousands of heavy cattle housed in sheds throughout the country that has caused the debacle.  How could the Minister agree to a scheme that excludes 70 per cent of steer beef?  It is mind boggling, especially when one considers that at the same meeting the British, the people who had caused the problem, were getting billions of pounds in compensation through EU support to kill off the BSE infected herds.  Those who caused the problem got billions but we who were suffering because of the problem got a scheme that was totally unworkable.</P>
    <P>Historically Ireland has benefited from intervention, which was set up as a market support to deal with the crisis when markets collapsed.  There was a recognition that Ireland is the only country that depends so heavily on exports.  The French and Germans are self sufficient in beef and are exercising a national preference in their domestic market.  The price of cattle in their countries is not as low as in this country. They will probably survive this crisis and are in a far better position than we are.  Our domestic market is too small to consume what we produce.  The percentage of beef production that is export oriented is 85 per cent.  If the market to which we are supposed to be exporting collapses because of a lack of consumer confidence or is closed off because of decisions made by Governments in non-EU countries it is vital that the intervention scheme agreed is tailor-made to <Col N="2264" /> Irish needs.  That has to be a prerequisite for agreement on any scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the breakthrough when he succeeded in raising the weight requirement from 340 kilogrammes to 380 kilogrammes, but everybody who either produces or processes beef told him it would be of no use whatsoever to them.  Douglas Hogg, who knows a lot less about agriculture than the Minister, has been able to negotiate billions of pounds and he caused the problem.  Why has our Minister, Deputy Yates, not been able to negotiate a decent intervention price to take out the cattle that overhang the market?  It defies logic.  The beef industry is an essential national interest.  To assess its importance one would need to take the best alternative industry and multiply it by four to have a comparison of its economic impact on our economy. What did we end up with?  An unworkable scheme.</P>
    <P>The cattle are still in the sheds and we still do not know what price we will get for them.  Winter fatteners are not prepared to sell cattle at 90p per lb.  They were protesting on the streets three months ago that they could not accept 97p per lb because they had been told in September and October they could pay the equivalent of £1.05 and still make money in the spring.  That is what those who are supposed to know the policy were telling them.  We now have a total mess.  Worse still, we agreed to give Douglas Hogg billions to get rid of his diseased cattle and we accepted the increase in weight from 340 kilogrammes to 380 kilogrammes as the concession to Ireland.  It is like accepting the bluff of someone with two twos when one holds four aces in a poker game and losing the game.</P>
    <P>At what stage do we move beyond the technocracy that has been the hallmark of Deputy Yates's ministry and start getting political decisions in favour of our national interest?  There is no point half way through the Council negotiations feeding out to the IFA delegation, to the <i>Farmers Journal</i> and other agricultural journalists that the <Col N="2265" /> Minister has achieved a breakthrough. The cattle are in the sheds and there is no sign of them getting out unless we start rearing buffalo.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of understanding of how the beef industry works and this has extended to the rendering sector. Before Easter the rendering factories were told in Agriculture House that their problems were their own.  They came up with a good solution.  They said it might be their problem this week but it would be the Department's problem next week because they were not going to do anything with 12,500 tonnes of offal.  Suddenly we saw a flurry of activity on the morning of Easter Tuesday in an effort to find a solution.  What was the solution?  They got £2.5 million to deal with the problem for five weeks and stay quiet and they had to work out themselves what they would do with the rest.  In other words the problem was thrown back at them.  There is no indication from the Minister or anybody else in his Department what will happen on 22 May if we do not have a solution. The industry represents 6 per cent of gross national product &mdash; and that is the way we run our business.  This is how we build a modern food industry in Ireland; the people who have a difficulty are told it is their problem.  This is the type of response we have received in the face of crisis.</P>
    <P>I understand that people become panic-stricken when the plan crumbles and the cards fall out of their hands and they do not know how to pick them up. However, people in this business are entitled to a better answer than it is their problem.  It is everybody's problem and it will only be solved in the spirit of people sitting down and using their intelligence.  The idea that people cannot be dealt with next week but, if they cause enough hullabaloo about it the following week, the Department will get back to them is no way to run a business and definitely no way to run a Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the lifting of the weight restrictions in the intervention scheme, which has been negotiated.  We are <Col N="2266" /> lucky to get it but the basic question is why we did not receive it on the first day.  If it is available today, it should have been available two weeks ago. Why was it not available when Britain and others were being looked after? Why was Ireland not looked after?  The paltry tender of 950 tonnes relates only to boning.  I asked why no application was made for boneless beef and I was told it was simple; we were offered 8.1p a pound to debone the meat and the fact that the British are paying 15p a pound has nothing to do with us.  The Department was asked if we would do it for 13.2p a pound but it said it needed the consent of the Department of Finance and it would get back to those involved. However, the Department never got back to them and the Minister wonders why people will not tender for boneless beef.</P>
    <P>The people who were asked to bone it on behalf of the intervention agents in this country are not prepared to do it at a loss.  The Department has no idea of the commercial realities.  It has no idea what the new situation involves, the fact that it is based on the 1993 scheme, that it is far more bureaucratic, that one cannot debone in the same slaughtering facility, that one must wait for 48 hours before it can be sent for deboning, that it can be regarded after the deboning process and the many other bureaucratic technicalities that have been loaded into the intervention scheme as a result.  We know one thing about the new intervention scheme &mdash; it is less efficient, we will not achieve the same throughput in the same amount of time and time is of the essence to deal with the number of cattle which must go through the system if people are prepared to accept the price.  Ultimately, what has been achieved by the intervention scheme?  We have a bad price instead of no price; 91p or 92p is just not good enough.</P>

They said 97p a pound but I will wait and see.  The Minister may be elsewhere when the tender is decided, but I hope he is correct regarding that amount.  However, whether it is 97p, 96p, 95p or 98p, it is a price which will not even wash farmers' faces; it will not get them out of the difficulty.  It will help them much more than 91p or 92p, but we all recognise at this stage that there will be no profit in beef this year but rather heavy losses.</P>
      <P>As I said, only one member of the Government is going a single bat at the crease.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, is the only person in Government with any interest in this matter.  It appears the wider responsibilities of Cabinet do not come into play.  I am convinced the political composition of the Government is militating against the best agricultural interests of this country.  I listen to Government backbenchers in the House and the level of ignorance in terms of absence of knowledge about the reality of the beef industry in this country is amazing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that some Cabinet members and some Government <Col N="2268" /> backbenchers think they have the luxury of going around constantly ballyragging this industry to secure votes or in an effort to assuage their narrow political constituency when the essential national interest of thousands of PAYE workers, let alone farmers, is at stake in relation to how this matter is handled. Some Deputies on the Government benches know the business and they are equally dismissive of the type of dialogue and debate they hear from certain quarters on that side of the House in relation to agricultural matters.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he has asked the banks to go easy on farmers as they face these financial difficulties.  This is welcome but I am sure the Minister also agrees it is important farmers are paid what they are owed by the Department as soon as possible.  There is a cash crisis on Irish farms.  For example, the second round of REPS has not yet been paid, extensification payments are over a month late and many farmers are still awaiting payment of the 22 month premium. Before the Minister asks others to bail him out of his responsibilities, perhaps he will put his house in order and send those payments to farmers soon.  Farmers are saying that if they are to endure losses, which is the case, they want what is due to them from the Department as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the biggest irony in this farce is the Minister's plea to the factories. Some weeks ago I was in Brussels when the Minister excoriated the largest player in the beef business.  Now he wants the factories to do his bidding. The Minister's plea to the factory owners underlines the mistake he made in launching that cynical attack.  It was another attempt to displace political responsibility for problems he saw emerging in relation to the size of the beef fine.  The point was to find a victim and, as far as his party is concerned, who better than the person the Minister named in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are paying in spades for the Minister's reckless and opportunistic political gambit.  The solution to the series of crises which have afflicted the <Col N="2269" /> beef industry in recent times is for the Government and the Minister to take responsibility for its remit.  The valuable time lost by the Government in going to our markets must be made up.  It is not sufficient just to open up these markets; they must be fully functional.  The tragedy is that the task will be all the more difficult because that critical time was lost.  Unfavourable impressions have been allowed to settle.  A cogent response must be negotiated at EU level.  The recent belated improvement in intervention terms is not a final or adequate solution.  The underlying matter of the long-term stability of export refunds must be addressed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister embarks on his visit, a basic point must be made.  From the experience of our visit to Iran, the Government must not fall into the trap that one only talks to people when one is in trouble.  Diplomacy is a two way street.  People have items on their agenda which need to be examined sympathetically and supported where possible. It is part of what we call international relations.  There has been too much in terms of the Government going to other people to solve their difficulties when Ireland has a problem but it has not listened when others have problems.</P>
    <P>If one lesson can be learned it is that a country such as Ireland, which exports this valuable product to 80 countries some of which are not as politically stable as Ireland, must remember that agendas beyond just the farming agenda must be addressed at the same time as improvements in our export trade are sought.  This is a political reality to which the Government has not attached much importance.</P>
    <P>When a delegation of which I was a member went to Iran, word issued quickly from the usual unnamed official sources that this was a technical matter, they could handle it, there was no need for the delegation, its members were cutting across the officials and should be sent home.  It was official sources, not farmers or beef processers, who said that.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but the greatest <Col N="2270" /> respect for our veterinary and technical people who do an excellent job.  I always defend and uphold their professionalism and integrity.  I had to do so in Iran because of one unfortunate incident which caused more trouble than one would imagine.</P>
    <P>Most of us realise that the political heads of Departments in such countries make the commercial decisions and one does not deal with an organisation like An Bord Bia or An Bord Tráchtála, but with State purchasing agencies under the direct control of political people. This matter involves a question of mutual respect and proper protocol.  If we want to solve a problem which, from the point of view of those countries, involves political people, a politician should go to those countries to seek to solve it.  We need technical and veterinary people to give a detailed analysis and reassurances on veterinary and scientific aspects, but it is naive to think that alone is sufficient in some countries. <i>The Salamanca</i> and <i>The Nordland Saga</i> were able to deliver 3,000 tonnes of beef because they had sailed before the ban was imposed.  As a result of our political visit <i>The Ping Quan</i> was allowed to deliver 3,000 tonnes of beef even though it sailed after the ban was imposed.  The 4,000 tonnes of processed beef in Irish stores separated before 20 March will also be accepted.  That was a political gesture to our people.</P>
    <P>I congratulated the Taoiseach when he telephoned President Mubarak and helped to open up the Egyptian market. It ill behoves Ministers at home to seek to belittle genuine efforts being made by others abroad.  On the RTE news on Wednesday night the Minister announced that 10,000 tonnes of beef would go to Iran.  I told the media that when I returned on the previous Monday, but if the Minister wants to take the credit he can.  I am sure nobody cares, if it means opening up that market more quickly.  It will not stop us doing what we can to help, irrespective of sceptical responses from official sources who see the thunder being taken from their God.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2271" /> Farmers and I welcome the Minister's proposed trip.  For some weeks, I urged him to make it and I hope he is successful because that would be in the country's interests.  However, farmers and processors are asking why he could not have gone a little earlier.  I accept there is protocol and official advice is always prudent and proper, but there are times when politicians must make political judgments.  To date, the Minister's political judgments have not been as sure as one would have expected.</P>
    <P>Long-term solutions to these problems involve quality assurance, flexibility, technical efficiency and price stability.  In 1994 beef farmers had 40 per cent of the average farm income and depended on premia for 78 per cent of that income.  In a bad year, such as this, that dependency will have increased to 100 per cent in many cases.  A study I published two weeks ago shows that cattle farmers are getting less than half the premia intended.  That is a major issue, a hot potato that has not been tackled.  It may be suggested that CAP reform is beginning to bite in the way in which it was intended by Brussels and perhaps the 1992-93 situation was false with high prices, premiums paid and pocketed and people doing reasonably well compared to previously.  Now that prices are falling, margins will be tighter and we need a policy response from Government that will improve technical efficiencies in the industry.  The disparity between the bottom and top 25 per cent of beef producers would lead one to believe they are in a different line of business.  We need technical supports, resources and assistance to farmers to provide a product consistent with market requirements but one that is also price sensitive to farmers' needs.  If we claim to have a premium product, it is a marketing failure if Irish beef, rather than the British product which is supposed to be BSE infected, is left on shelves in Sainsburys when that store decides to mark down the price of British beef.  That indicates we are taking <Col N="2272" /> our product for granted and not communicating to our customers that it is the best product in the world.  For too long we have adopted a complacent attitude, that we know our product is the best and, therefore, people will buy it.</P>
    <P>As 60 per cent of our live cattle are exported to non-EU markets, with Egypt and Libya being crucial outlets, we need to travel to those markets to reassure those customers.  Such a visit is not merely a question of optics as sceptics would claim.  Political visits make a difference in non-European countries because of their political culture.  People in those countries believe their politicians. If the politicians tell their people our product is good, their people believe it, but the contrary is the case here.  People believe their politicians because they believe they will act in the people's interests.  In travelling to those countries the Minister will reassure farmers and processors here who are depending on him as well as customers. When non-European markets are opened up and become fully functional, our rate of success will depend on what the Iranian, the Egyptian or the Libyan thinks of our product.  The Minister in making that visit will get the type of media exposure that will help secure Irish beef as a distinct safe premium product.  Those are the long-term issues and they may be peripheral, but they are important.</P>
    <P>Is 97 pence a possible price?  Is there a prospect of the Minister obtaining additional premia to compensate the farmers involved?  Can he extend the slaughter premium?  Those are the questions farmers asked at meetings I attended last weekend.  I have been asked to put them to the Minister and I hope he will give clear answers.  Irrespective of the consequences for the Minister, I hope he will give honest answers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2273" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of the beef industry in Ireland and the essential national interest involved, commends the efforts of the Government to confront the crisis in the industry, to restore consumer confidence in Irish beef and to secure the reopening of vital export markets&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I had thought that the national interest was the motivation for this motion, but the mask of the principal Opposition party slipped somewhat this evening as we listened to some points of criticism and demands for action, but mostly to a series of political point-scoring and carping which does not add significantly to solving the enormity of the problems we face concerning the lack of marketability of Irish or other beef.  I will not indulge in that kind of debate as it would not be in the interests of our farmers and processors, but I hope to address as many as possible of the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The announcement in the House of Commons on Wednesday, 20 March 1996 will be long remembered by those who have been monitoring developments in relation to BSE and in particular all those involved in the beef industry.  Much has happened in the past four weeks.  A major scientific debate has developed about the alleged connection between BSE and CJD; a ban has been imposed by the EU on exports of British cattle, beef and beef products; a wave of consumer concern developed in regard to the safety of beef and beef products; the rendering industry virtually collapsed with a threatened closure at one stage and certain third countries have imposed bans on cattle and beef from Europe, to name but a few. Special sessions of the Council of Agriculture Ministers and the Standing Veterinary Committee have been convened.</P>
    <P>This is not a complete list of the consequences. I can think of the need to <Col N="2274" /> transpose into Irish law within 24 hours a ban on 500 beef-related food substances in the UK and to have a special co-ordinated effort by the Garda, Army and Customs service to seal off the Border in an unprecedented way and the many other ramifications in relation to our depopulation policy, all of which had to be implemented rapidly and dealt with <i>seriatim.</i></P>
    <P>The reverberations from the announcement in the House of Commons have been felt by the beef industry across the world.  Given the dominant economic position of our beef industry &mdash; it accounts for 6 per cent of GDP and 10 per cent of net foreign earnings &mdash; and its dependence on export markets, the consequences and issues at stake for our industry and overall economy are extremely important. For that reason, I fully accept the need for a debate on the issue and I am fully prepared to defend the actions and record of the Government in responding to this crisis.</P>
    <P>Official policy in regard to BSE has been explained on many occasions.  Put simply, we have extensive surveillance systems in relation to post and ante-mortems and veterinary activity on an on-farm basis.  This has shown a small number of cases, less than 20 a year, which is diminishing and a growing age profile in relation to cows which may have eaten infected meat and bonemeal before 1989.</P>
    <P>We have also provided full consumer protection based on thorough and reliable inspection systems.  Our veterinary surveillance system in meat factories is unique.  The most recent developments in regard to BSE have been reviewed by the Food Safety Advisory Board which reports to the Minister for Health and me.</P>
    <P>We have been able to provide assurances to authorities and customers in export markets in regard to the safety and reliability of Irish beef.  This message has been pushed consistently by An Bord Bia, our embassies which have been active since this crisis unfolded and the various delegations from my <Col N="2275" /> Department &mdash; which I will list later &mdash; which have been visiting countries where concerns have arisen.  It is worth remembering that Irish beef is in free circulation in Europe, most of the Middle East, Russia, Algeria and Egypt.</P>
    <P>I have had many meetings, including with Dr. Sakharov, the chief veterinary officer in Russia.  Last week I met a Saudi Arabian business delegation.  I have had countless meetings with Iranians and contact with the Algerians. The aim of these meetings was to ensure that crisis measures would not be necessary. In the case of Russia which is taking 100,000 tonnes of beef, we have maintained continuity of trade without any headlines.</P>
    <P>It is useful to recall the sequence of events since 20 March and the range of issues which have arisen in that period. The first issue was to explain and defend our own controls and provide assurances publicly to Irish consumers. This has been done successfully given that consumption has recovered quite well.  A recent survey indicated that there was a high degree of consumer confidence in Irish beef.  The figure is moving towards 80 per cent and varies from one outlet to another.</P>
    <P>The next issue was to participate in EU discussions and ensure that we would not be involved in the scope of decisions taken by the Standing Veterinary Committee, EU Commission and Council of Ministers.  In other words, the aim was to ring-fence the problem in Britain.  Despite the low, sporadic level of BSE here, there were countries which wanted a wider scope to include member states where cases of BSE had been reported.  The first thing we had to ensure was that there be an independent veterinary and scientific decision which we could market across the world.  It was essential to put the horse before the cart.</P>
    <P>The response and approach of the Government has been clear, sure and effective and the matter was discussed at its meeting on 27 March.  I heard Deputy Cowen say on many occasions <Col N="2276" /> that no decisions were taken at that meeting.  The fact is I did not announce all the decisions taken at the meeting and have been busy implementing them. They included sealing off the Border, setting up the body chaired by the Director of Consumer Affairs and the provision of an information line.  There has been constant liaison between my Department and the Department of Health, a critical issue at the time in terms of the concern about curly-wee bars in Easter eggs and the mass confusion about gelatin.  All those issues have now been forgotten, but decisions were taken at that Government meeting. Decisions were also made about who should approach whom.</P>

      <P>The extent of the conversations of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, who has been subject to much criticism, with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mr. Valyati, has not been publicised.  The Taoiseach has had numerous conversations with people from Jordan, the UAE as well as Egypt.  Just because these contacts have not been highlighted does not mean there has not been constant liaison between my Department and other Departments, they have been pulling their weight and doing their bit behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>Similarly, there has been constant liaison between my Department and the Department of Health.  The report of the Food Safety Advisory Board sets out its views with great clarity and has put the suggested link between BSE and CJD into proper context.</P>
      <P>The full weight of our diplomatic corps has been brought into play.  I pay tribute to our ambassadors, agricultural attaches and counsellors across the world who have been working intensively in all our critical markets making appropriate official and commercial links and contact during the past three weeks.  The Taoiseach has taken a direct and effective role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2277" /> In relation to Egypt and the <i>Galloway Express,</i> when the secretary of the Department and the chief veterinary officer left Cairo agreement had been reached in respect of four named boats. Ten days later there was an EU trade delegation which succeeded in making the position worse in discussions about oranges and brown rot in potatoes.  If it had not been for the efforts of the Taoiseach the Egyptian market would not be open to European beef today despite the presence in Egypt of Chirac and our contacts with French diplomats.</P>
    <P>The ban in Kuwait has been lifted and I am confident that the ban in Jordan will be lifted shortly.  In all these areas, the approach of the Government has been pro-active, co-ordinated and effective and the issues have been dealt with efficiently.</P>
    <P>My priority is to provide assistance for beef producers.  I have always acknowledged that they had a difficult winter.  On the re-opening of the intervention outlet, Deputy Cowen laid great stress on the Luxembourg meeting. When the officials in DG VI went into that meeting the doors to intervention were not alone locked, barred and bolted, but sealed.  Under no circumstances would they be reopened.  After a 40 hour meeting over two nights a political declaration was arrived at whereby 50,000 tonnes would be put into intervention. It was left to the beef management committee to work out the appropriate details.</P>
    <P>The reason it was possible, after consultations with my opposite numbers in France and Germany and, trilaterally, with Commissioner Fischler last week, to secure abolition of the weight limits and a widening of the eligible grades &mdash; I pay tribute to my officials for the role they have played during the past week &mdash; was there was a political understanding that 50,000 tonnes would be put into intervention, with a minimum figure of 10,000 tonnes, which would be honoured because it would not apply throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Because the situation was so fluid, <Col N="2278" /> under point 10, there was a clear political declaration that there would be flexibility and that issues such as premia and weight limits would be dealt with.  That was a major breakthrough.  The fact that political direction was given at that meeting made it possible for the changes to be made last week.  Some 90 per cent of Irish steers will be eligible and a suitable framework exists to enable Irish slaughtering plants to make effective use of this mechanism.  There will not be another 26A bus coming. This is a one off tender and if we do not take up the 50,000 tonnes offer, we can be assured it will be oversubscribed by the French, Germans, Austrians etc.  If suppliers are serious about getting their employees back to work and having throughput, they must put in a realistic tender for a suitable volume.</P>
    <P>I will not speculate or talk down the question of price.  A higher price can be paid than the tender of 980 tonnes.</P>

      <P>At no stage.  People have tried to put words in my mouth in that regard and the record will clearly show that.  I do not know if any future report may put all our efforts back at nought. This is an extremely fluid situation. There is currently no market in Ireland for the 50,000 cattle stuck in farmers' sheds and my primary imperative is to lift that paralysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My political commitment is to operate the Luxembourg declaration and to seek compensation by way of premia <Col N="2279" /> adjustments to deal with whatever the outcome is on price.  Similarly I cannot give an answer on deseasonalisation slaughter premia because it requires not only the Council but the Parliament to change it.  Since Ireland and a small part of Germany gets the DSP, this may not be the best way to proceed.  Maybe a European rather than a deseasonalisation slaughter premium would be the way to marshal a coalition of support. The level to be sought may only be apparent when one sees the exact fall-out in prices.  Whatever the circumstances <i>vis-à-vis</i> prices and loss, we will be making a strong case to get European Union support for compensation through premia which will also take into account the level of revival in consumption.</P>
    <P>I am slightly bemused, not to say amused &mdash; I am long enough in politics to see both sides &mdash; about the rendering industry.  The reason I did not have a solution to the rendering problem on Holy Thursday was that I had spent three days in Luxembourg.  I find it difficult to be criticised for not being at home dealing with problems and waiting for them to come back to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a limited amount of time.  A key market has been developed in Sweden with three retail groups.  The visit there was extremely successful as we are now back in business and I am surprised that Deputy Cowen is decrying that fact.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said I was throwing the rendering problems back on to the industry.  The meat processors, renderers and producers told me on Easter Tuesday morning that the meat factories had come to a complete halt because there was nowhere to put offal and that this was not their problem but that of the Minister.  I make no apology for telling them that the taxpayer will not be giving a subsidy of half a million pounds a week <i>ad infinitum</i> to solve the rendering problem.  If, through the decisions of the pigmeat or poultry sector, there is no alternative but to dump meat and bonemeal in landfill sites and if meat and bonemeal are devalued from £170 a tonne to a negative net value, there must be commercial repercussions.  That has an implication for the next quarter and is not practical.  I do not know what commitment Deputy Cowen was inferring I should give on behalf of the taxpayer, but any reports I read about public opinion on this issue give the Government conditional support for its actions on the basis that the taxpayer should not be involved other than on an emergency reactive basis to give a window of opportunity to find a solution.</P>
      <P>In that regard, we are facilitating tripartite talks of all the industry at assistant secretary level to find a workable solution.  However, if the fallout is a total downward re-evaluation of meat and bonemeal, that has commercial consequences which cannot be resolved by the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was due to go to Libya today but I had to attend this debate.  I indicated that I wanted to go to Libya a week ago, <Col N="2281" /> principally because we have a large contract for our live cattle trade there. There is currently a ban on European beef there and we first succeeded in getting a decision on that contract deferred until 4 May.  That gives us the opportunity to state our case.  It has not been possible for the Trade Board or the Libyan authorities to arrange meetings and it is now likely that I will go there from Sunday next to Tuesday.</P>
    <P>I will be conducting a major promotion with the Trade Board and the Irish Food Board in Madrid tomorrow and subsequently in Verona and Milan. I am concerned that there have been some negative reports in Italy about our beef and that confusion needs to be cleared up.  There will be a full schedule of events, involving reassurances in some cases and a direct presence in others.  Russia is also involved.</P>
    <P>The Egyptian market would not be open to us today if it were not for the discussions between the Taoiseach and President Hosni Mubarak.  The ban in Kuwait has been lifted and our position in Saudi Arabia is also strong.  I spoke to Minister Faqi for a lengthy period this morning.  We had £60 million of trade there last year, as was the case with Iran.  These countries want reassurances about the Border, reassurances about a case that was well publicised in the British <i>Sunday Times</i> about an officer in the Department, veterinary papers and independent EU, WHO and other independent guarantees on Irish food safety.  Every Minister has told me that this is not a political issue.  While I have a WTO report in front of me showing what it wants, they are at pains to say that this is not political.  It sees this as a moral issue of food safety.  Many people tell me that I should ignore the technical advice but get in the air.</P>

      <P>I know exactly how that visit was arranged.  I spoke to the Minister, Mr. Prozesh, for 50 minutes from my home on Sunday morning and the Iranian ambassador was present; this was not the first or last conversation I have had with Tehran.  I asked him whether it would be of benefit &mdash; because many problems still exist in Iran &mdash; if I travelled there myself.  They told me this was not a political issue and it was not necessary for me to go to Tehran.  They said I am always welcome but it was not necessary for me to go there.  If at any stage it had been indicated that I should be in Tehran, I would go there.</P>

      <P>Many people have travelled in every direction but our technical visit there of Mr. John Malone, Assistant Secretary at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and our veterinary representative, Mr. Albert <Col N="2283" /> Costello, was extremely successful and the Deputy will verify that.</P>

      <P>I agree, as regards the situation in Iran, there was a contract for 16,500 tonnes of beef, of which 10,000 tonnes has already been produced, it was in Foynes, on the high seas or <i>in situ</i> in the port.  The unloading has been agreed but to get the EU payment requires free circulation.  The latest word on that is that Dr. Mutelabi, the chief veterinary officer, is to send me a letter setting out the veterinary requirements and detailing the reassurances they need.  They have received letters from France and Holland.  I await Dr. Mutelabi's letter.  We have already brought some Iranian people to the Border to reassure them on that situation.</P>
      <P>The Iranians buy in the spring and autumn.  I would not overrate the Iranian market, although it has been valuable in terms of price support in recent months and we should honour our contract. However, in relation to the lifting of the ban, domestic Iranian political issues of which the Deputy would be aware, which are nothing to do with Irish beef or diplomatic presence, are also a factor.  I have been told the issue cannot be solved until those factors have been resolved &mdash; and that will happen in about one week.  I am very anxious to have deep cordial links with Iran.</P>

      <P>The British Minister for Agriculture today announced a series of measures.  I have heard farm leaders, as well as Deputy Cowen, behaving as if Britain got a bonanza from Luxembourg.  This is a total disaster for Britain.  I said publicly that two days of statements from the House of Commons have done ten years' damage not only to British beef but to European beef.  The fact is that today's announcement of £500 for an over 30 month animal, for either culled cows or for steer beef, is a disaster.  If that was being offered here as a multi-billion pound bonanza, Deputy Cowen would be the first to give me a tirade of abuse, and rightly so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our biggest single market, providing a market for 50,000 tonnes of beef worth £200 million. Because of the land border and the incentive to smuggle, it is in our interest, both from a pan-European perspective and a purely narrow domestic industry interest, to get the issue of British beef resolved.  It does not suit us to hang Britain out there with no solution. <Col N="2285" /> There will only be a permanent solution when some normality returns to British markets, and that is still some months away.  The British still have to come up with further measures in terms of identifying animals and herds at risk and introduce a slaughter policy.  They are not getting billions of pounds because this scheme will be financed out of the rebate system the then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, organised some years ago.  British producers and processors will sustain horrendous losses.  They are talking about getting less than 80p per lb. for beef and the Deputy is not happy with £1 per lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I will do all possible to ensure that departmental payments are expedited.  This is a multifaceted issue.  Issues which are resolved are forgotten; we move on to the next issue.  In this case the next issue is a sustained attempt over weeks and months to increase trade activity in Europe and to have governmental and other restrictions abroad lifted.  Some 7,000 cattle are going to Egypt this week.  Egypt and Saudi Arabia are pivotal to the markets. Some of the markets that were closed down were inconsequential but we will try to get back into business in 80 states.</P>
      <P>I ask for the patience and understanding of the entire industry.  People need to realise that, as of today, there is no market for the 20,000 cattle a week we need to kill and the 50,000 cattle which were not slaughtered because throughput for the last three weeks has been down 68 per cent on what it should be. I need no advice, encouragement or awareness about the gravity of the situation. At the outset I realised the proportions of the difficulty and I want to assure the House that this Government and all the personnel of this Government, at home or abroad, are available in a national effort to secure our industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to the French Minister for Agriculture last Wednesday and he told <Col N="2286" /> me that virtually every French meat plant was closed.  We cannot escape the effects of a crisis which has affected the world.  I spoke to the New Zealand Minister for Agriculture.  New Zealand imports have been banned in Europe because of a British decision.  This crisis has had a knock-on effect everywhere. There are no instantaneous resolutions to this issue, but in so far as dynamism and energy can and will resolve these issues, this Government is doing more than any other Government in Europe to deal with our key national interest and will continue to do so as long as the crisis persists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of considerable regret to all of us that problems in Irish farming are once again on the agenda of this House.  It needs to be said very clearly that we are at one in seeking a resolution of these problems.  I welcome the Minister's commitment as expressed in the last few sentences of his speech.  He has to realise that our role is sometimes to cajole him, sometimes to encourage him, sometimes to push him a little harder, but always to try to ensure that an industry that is so central to the economic wellbeing of this country is properly looked after.  Unfortunately, sometimes that is difficult to do because, in certain instances, matters outside our control impinge on the industry, as in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Cowen pointed out, this House recently discussed the major crisis in the sheep industry.  The crisis was partially resolved, although I understand the payments promised are still outstanding.  However, that crisis still impinges on Irish agriculture because it is unresolved.  More recently, we went through the first phase of the beef crisis.  Again, little progress was made in dealing with it; it was not the type of progress necessary to put Irish beef <Col N="2287" /> farming on a sound footing, even if what happened since then had not taken place.  We would still be in a crisis if the BSE situation had not occurred.</P>
    <P>There is a level of despondency and worry in farming circles.  It is difficult to express it but it is palpable.  I attended a meeting last night at which a number of farmers were present.  They are worried and they want to see action from the Minister and the Department.  They particularly want to see the confusion cleared up as that is the most worrying aspect of this crisis.  The level of misinformation, failure to address the problems and failure to come to terms with the need to take action are also worrying.</P>
    <P>In newspaper reports before Easter a number of commentators were critical of Fianna Fáil for having used Private Members' time to discuss the controversy surrounding the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, and Niall Stokes, rather than using the time to address this issue.  Deputy Cowen and the other Deputies who decided not to proceed with the beef issue on that occasion were right.  They gave the Minister space and time to clear up some of the confusion. However, I am disappointed at the Minister's failure to make progress on that front.  The time was poorly used.</P>
    <P>Even if we were to forget the three most recent crises in agriculture, it must be said that, overall, Irish agriculture does not know where it is going.  Some months ago the Minister was credited &mdash; although that is probably not the right word &mdash; with commenting on the future of cheques in the post.  It was seen in farming circles as a negative comment. They are a major element of every farmer's take home pay.  If they do not continue to arrive, and they probably will not, farmers must be reassured that the matter is being examined and dealt with and will not be an abyss into which Irish farmers will fall at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>Farming is not the type of industry which can be sustained or which can <Col N="2288" /> generate confidence in itself in a vacuum. It needs support and it is important that the industry is sustained. We need to know where we stand in the EU and where we are going in terms of GATT.  We also need a long-term policy that charts a future for Irish agriculture. The only worthwhile analysis of agriculture I have seen in the recent past has come from the farming organisations. It is frequently dismissed as scaremongering or self-serving publicity. I suppose it contains such an element because that is part of the farming organisations' job.  However, there is also evidence of a need for this State to decide if it is serious about agriculture. The evidence is that it is not.</P>
    <P>In fairness, part of the present crisis is outside our control.  The handling of the BSE situation by the British was truly appalling and defies all understanding. It is also a problem that the disease occurs at all.  However, the response to the crisis is our responsibility. Our response has been weak. What is fundamentally wrong with the response &mdash; and I accept the truth of everything the Minister has said about what he has done &mdash; is the fact that it has not been recognised that there are farmers in parishes throughout the country whose livelihoods are dependent on this industry at one level or another.  If farmers cannot continue to live in those communities it will mean the end of the communities.  It will not matter what fancy policies we put in place or what well-intentioned rural development programmes we produce if these people cannot live and provide an income for themselves in the communities of which they are a part.</P>
    <P>We must also acknowledge that it is very difficult for the majority of farmers to make a living and rear a family on an Irish farm.  Anybody who looks realistically at the type of struggle farming entails for 90 per cent of the people who depend on agriculture must realise that there is a constant element of worry for every farmer in ensuring that there is enough to provide for their families in terms of basic necessities.  That is the <Col N="2289" /> fundamental role of Irish agriculture in rural areas.</P>
    <P>This crisis has brought the industry as a whole, including workers and their dependants, into the centre of the picture. In the course of every debate this House has held on agriculture since the formation of the present Government, Democratic Left has produced a speaker to engage in a tirade of farmer bashing which is truly disgraceful.  I have difficulty believing that the electors of those Deputies would be sufficiently impressed to vote for them on the basis of some of the performances we have seen.  The Government parties have a responsibility to prevent such attacks which do enormous damage.  They might be laughed off in the Chamber but every bit of mud thrown has an effect, and some of it sticks.  It is destabilising, extremely unhelpful and it must be dealt with at Government level.  Failure to deal with it will lead to the inevitable conclusion that this Government is not committed to the farming community.</P>
    <P>It is fair to congratulate Deputy Cowen and the other members of the Fianna Fáil delegation who undertook the trip to Iran.  In advance of the trip they must have felt there were risks attached to themselves in addition to the grave possibility that they would not get any credit or benefit for the industry. However, the trip was beneficial.  In Ireland, more than anywhere else, we should know that where dialogue is kept alive and where people can meet and talk, progress can be made.  I welcome the Minister's response to the trip.  It was less negative than much of what has emanated heretofore from official sources.  The official response was small and mean minded; it bordered on nasty. Perhaps some people felt the visit by the Fianna Fáil delegation exposed Government inaction on the issue.  However, if we wish to confront this serious situation we must be prepared, to some extent at least, to accommodate the assistance of every element in reaching a solution.</P>
    <P>Another matter has been omitted <Col N="2290" /> from the agenda.  We have looked to agriculture to provide the indigenous raw material for a huge job sector.  It has done that reasonably successfully and, in some cases, very successfully. However, the situation we have encountered in recent weeks has shown how quickly an entire industry can be undermined and virtually grind to a standstill. We need to address that aspect as part of a policy for agriculture &mdash; which we do not have &mdash; and its industrial offshoots. We must know what direction we are taking.</P>
    <P>The role of the live cattle trade has tended to be overshadowed and, to some extent, forgotten.  However, it is very important.  Before the BSE scare it was subject to attack from animal rights activists who might have had a case. However, the case was overstated and there was no balance in how it was handled.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is necessary to ensure access to ports for the export of cattle and to ensure that those who took the risk of buying and exporting those cattle get paid.  If one is dealing with markets where monetary payments are impossible, an element of barter must be put in place.  The industry must be helped. Those charged with developing, promoting and assisting Irish trade must play a meaningful and worthwhile role in ensuring that that very important and slightly unfashionable outlet for Irish beef remains open and viable and continues to be developed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen mentioned the need to address the concerns of consumers, a sector which we have ignored, perhaps more than any other sector.  However, the day came when consumers could no longer be ignored.  The consumer started to ask questions and in answer, misinformation was placed before him or her &mdash;&ldquo;her&rdquo; is more important in this instance because women are more likely to make these purchasing choices.</P>
    <P>We have nothing to hide in regard to the Irish beef industry but we have sometimes behaved as if we had.  We have not been good at making the facts available or allowing consumers access <Col N="2291" /> to the information they demand.  The Minister might say that is not the direct responsibility of his Department, with which I would partly agree, however, it is the Government's responsibility to draw the threads together and ensure that somebody is responsible.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the downstream effect of holding huge numbers of cattle in fattening sheds, and the fact there is not an outlet for them, on calf and weanling producers.  While this situation continues everyone is a loser.  The smaller producer is ultimately the most vulnerable, will pay the high price and is the most likely to go out of business because he does not have the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Cowen in calling on the Minister to ensure immediate payment of the second round of REPS and outstanding extensification grants, 22 month premia and other grants. There are outstanding grants for buildings and so on.  The whole grants system is a mess and is extremely unsatisfactory. Field staff must be treated much better in terms of expenses and being allowed to do their work.  The Government as a whole needs to address the problem of the pay of lower paid civil servants.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced a charter of rights, which I welcome.  However, it is no good announcing a charter of rights if the groundwork has not been laid and the charter cannot be delivered on.  The charter is not working.  It is not having the effect the Minister envisaged and which we would like to support him on delivering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have also come face to face with the problems of the rendering factories.  Deputy Cowen outlined the facts and how badly this issue has been dealt with.  To be fair to the Minister, he explained he was away and could not deal with the matter until he returned.  However, somebody should <Col N="2292" /> be in charge to deal with these matters. The Minister cannot wash his hands of this.  If the taxpayer subsidy is withdrawn &mdash; and he is right to say it will be withdrawn &mdash; he cannot then tell people to do what they like.  He should take a lead and show the way.</P>
      <P>My great disappointment in regard to the ongoing difficulty in relation to the punt and sterling is that several Ministers have a responsibility for this.  I do not know if they are passing it to each other or are all ignoring it but this fundamental difficulty for the Irish beef industry is not being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Killeen, for the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  The disclosure in the newspapers of the suspected link between BSE and CJD has had a dramatic impact on the beef industry in Ireland, across Europe and further afield.  This is another food scare which has an impact on the attitudes of consumers, primary producers, processors and everybody employed in the industry. The potential of food scares to create havoc and wreak devastation on an industry is clearly illustrated by what happened in this instance.  There should have been some anticipation of what might happen when such an issue surfaced in the media, which regularly elect to go on a binge of food and other scares which set consumers in conflict with producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a dynamic for change in the dairy industry in Ireland and across Europe for many years because of the constant harping on the hazards of eating butter.  I do not subscribe to the view that eating butter is hazardous because if any product is taken in moderation &mdash; as they should be &mdash; there is no health hazard involved.  However, dramatic changes took place in the dairy industry, many of which were not in the best interests of the industry, because of a certain perception.  Consumers developed a point of view in relation to butter because a range of experts made loose remarks or remarks designed to <Col N="2293" /> catch headlines.  Subsequently, experts in the same field have differed sharply with many of those advancing such views.</P>
    <P>The Food Advisory Board said last week that no scientific link has been established to date between the incidence of BSE and that of CJD in humans. According to a recent newspaper report, a vegetarian died from CJD. This all adds to public confusion. However, it also illustrates and underlines the importance of a cohesive emergency plan to ensure the most up to date information is available.  I am realistic enough to know that scientific research is an ongoing process and new problems will emerge to which it might take time to find a solution.  However, given the importance of the food industry to our economy, the necessity of cohesion between the State agencies operating in the areas of health and food was graphically illustrated by what happened in this instance.  I hope the lessons from this will be learned quickly and that the changes which are clearly needed will be made to ensure we can respond if these problems arise again.</P>
    <P>The fine contribution by our party spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Cowen, clearly illustrated the needs and priorities of the beef industry.  He underlined the serious losses facing specialist beef fatteners.  There is a peculiar interdependency in the beef industry which has not always been recognised and which must be taken into account in a new policy position if it is to survive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the dispute in the Civil Service.  I raise the issue because it is many years since the public service has been brought to such a pitch.  I understand that matters are now being discussed, about which I am glad.  My colleague, Deputy McCreevy and I met the CPSU today and we have been in correspondence with it.  It has a strong grievance which, as the Opposition spokesperson on Enterprise and Employment and Deputy Leader of my party, I am glad to put to the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has allowed this dispute to escalate to a critical level without making a serious move to obviate it.  At least ten areas of Government have been at a standstill, including the Department of Education, with which my colleague, Deputy Martin, will deal, the Collector General's Office in Limerick, the Department of Social Welfare, the Companies Office, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the beef intervention and the TB testing sections of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Land Registry and the European Presidency section of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Indeed, the country is in a state of chassis. However the most serious threat is to the examination system with which, as I said my colleague will deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should not have allowed this dispute to spiral to such a level.  His inactivity has been breathtaking.  I noticed in <i>The Examiner</i> that a senior Democratic Left source said the Minister had dealt with it in a purely Department of Finance way, that is, in a very castigatory way.  It is interesting to get these insights into what is happening.  The Minister for Finance's intervention last Friday was laughable.  He went to Verona, with its fountains, blooming flowers and flowing wine, from where he castigated the lower paid civil servants and told them <Col N="2295" /> to shut up and be satisfied with their lot, or words to that effect.</P>
    <P>I noticed that he waited until his colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, was safely back in Dublin before he spewed this diatribe from Verona.  I thought is was inappropriate for someone who was in a place where the sun was shining and the flowers were blooming to call to account the lowest paid civil servants for the imprudent management of the public service and for the financial situation under this Government.</P>
    <P>It is a crude embargo; the only way out for many low paid civil servants is through promotion and recruitment which have stopped.  I was in Cabinet when these matters were discussed in a practical and reasonable fashion. However, these civil servants have been brought to the brink by this Minister and the haughty, assertive and arrogant way in which this Government has sought to distance itself from the concerns of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take account of what I have said and to tell us about the breathtaking discussions in which his colleague, the Minister for Finance, is engaged.  Why have ten Departments been brought to the brink and been castigated from sunnier climates?  Why are those who are not in good positions being castigated?  Why is the Government removed from what is happening? This Government must attend to the concerns and the needs of the CPSU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much confusion and even disinformation about the nature of the action taken by the Government over the past year as regards the size of the Civil Service.  Perhaps I might sketch out some of the background leading up to these events so that the position can be clarified and discussion can focus on the facts rather than the perceptions as portrayed by particular staff interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is not the first in recent years to become concerned about <Col N="2296" /> the size of the public service and its cost. Much of this growth reflects improvements or expansions in public services introduced by the various Governments. These services of their very nature tend to be labour intensive.  Each such improvement in service is inevitably seen by Government as a success.  To some extent, therefore, I suppose we are trying to cope with the human resources consequences of our many successes.</P>
    <P>The Government has felt compelled to take action to control growth in numbers in all parts of the public service. Such measures cannot be identical in all parts of the public service, given differences in their operating environments and the control mechanisms which apply to them.  Since this debate is focused on the Civil Service, I will concentrate on that sector.</P>
    <P>In the period January 1990 to January 1995 the number of non-industrial Civil Service posts, whole-time equivalent, increased from 25,628.5 to 28,370, an aggregate increase of 2,741 or by about 550 a year on average.  In the first half of 1995 it became apparent that numbers were rising more rapidly than usual.  By the end of March 1995, Civil Service numbers had increased by 241, almost half the usual annual average increase.  Moreover, it was clear that there were demands from virtually all Departments and offices for yet more staff.  In the event, the increase in the second quarter of 1995 amounted to 551 posts.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Government took a series of decisions in June and July 1995 and also in the context of the 1996 Estimates aimed at slowing the rate at which both the Civil Service and the public service generally were increasing. These measures included imposing a ban on the creation of new posts without prior Government sanction &mdash; other than for transient tasks such as the EU Presidency, the 1996 Census of Population and the payment of equal treatment arrears or decentralisation; allowing the filling of only one in three vacancies; and empowering the Minister for Finance to redeploy surplus staff, <Col N="2297" /> arising from decentralisation or otherwise, in accordance with priority needs.</P>
    <P>It is important to make it clear to all concerned that there is no embargo on recruitment.  As indicated, it can take place for the one in three fillable vacancies and for the hundreds of posts required for the transient tasks I have already mentioned.  Nor is there an embargo on promotions.  If a senior post is fillable, then the consequentials down the line are also fillable.  As a result, there have been many promotions already this year throughout the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The one in three restriction on the filling of vacancies will, of itself, save several hundred posts in the Civil Service this year.  On the other hand, the temporary increases sanctioned for the EU Presidency, the Census of Population and other transient tasks will offset this fall leaving the overall situation in broad balance.  In the circumstances, it is ironic that the Government's actions should be represented by certain staffing interests as a cutback in overall numbers and/or as some sort of a freeze on promotions.  As I have now made clear, it is neither.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service trade union which is at the forefront of the present industrial action is the Civil and Public Services Union &mdash; CPSU.  Every trade union has a legitimate interest in promotions in the interests of its members.  The bulk of the CPSU's members are in the clerical officer and clerical assistant grades and the promotional outlets of most concern to these grades are in the staff officer, executive officer and higher executive officer grades.  These grades have expanded significantly during 1995. Account must also be taken of turnover in these grades which would have further boosted promotion prospects very considerably.</P>
    <P>As to what the Government is doing about the present impasse, I can assure the House that everything possible that can be done &mdash; consistent with the Government's overall aim of containing the growth in the size of the Civil Service &mdash; is being done.  Discussions took place with the staff panel last week about possible alternatives to the one in <Col N="2298" /> three restrictions but which would have a broadly similar effect in 1996.  I might mention that the staff panel is representative of all the main trade unions in the Civil Service, including the CPSU.  My officials will have another meeting with the staff panel later this week to further explore measures which might be acceptable to it.  I would be hopeful that both sides will approach these talks in a positive and constructive way.</P>
    <P>It has been widely reported in the media &mdash; indeed it is an open secret at this stage &mdash; that the present dispute is also concerned with claims by the CPSU in relation to pay and restructuring of their grades.  I would like to say a few words on this aspect.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on public service pay can only take place within the framework of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement as it applies to the public service.  This arrangement was endorsed by all public service unions and accepted by the Government.  The pay agreement is an integral part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  Its pay provisions and costs formed a crucial part of the background against which the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> overall was negotiated and accepted by the Government.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has served the country well.  Job creation targets have been substantially exceeded, economic growth has been exceptionally high and interest rates and inflation have been kept low and stable. It is crucial that the public service pay provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and their associated costs are not exceeded.</P>
    <P>In addition to general increases in line with those agreed for the private sector, the pay agreement provides a mechanism for addressing certain long standing concerns of groups of public servants. This mechanism can take what has become known as the restructuring route aimed at mutually acceptable resolution of claims without resort to industrial action or, alternatively, processing of a straight pay claim for 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The CPSU elected to follow the <Col N="2299" /> restructuring route as the mechanism for pursuing its outstanding claims. After detailed and prolonged negotiations an offer was made to the union which was rejected in a ballot by their members.  However, informal contact has been maintained between the union and the Department of Finance with a view to establishing a basis for resumption of negotiations.  The Minister for Finance met with representatives of the CPSU today and he is hopeful that a way forward will be found.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with this development.  I feel confident with goodwill on both sides that it should be possible to achieve a peaceful resolution of the outstanding issues while at the same time maintaining the integrity of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue on the Adjournment on behalf of the thousands of students who are due to sit the leaving certificate, junior certificate and NCVA examinations shortly.  These students are under enormous stress and strain already without this unnecessary threat hanging over the examinations. In this context, and without any disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, I am disappointed the Minister for Education is not present to provide the clarification we require and to state the position as it is.  Given the sense of crisis now hanging over the examinations, the fundamental nature of the State examination system to our education system and achievements, and in recognition of the efforts that have been made by thousands of students in preparation for these examinations, we expect the Minister to be here to allay these concerns and to give a clear sense of confidence to students and parents that the examinations will go ahead as scheduled and without any undue disruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that the Minister for Education should state exactly what is <Col N="2300" /> the position, to what degree has the preparation of the examinations been damaged or delayed by the dispute, how much time has been lost and so on.  For example, I am aware that the normal degree of overtime at this time of the year is not being worked.  I am also aware that the 24 hour shift work which is part and parcel of the examination process is not yet under way in the Department and that we are within days of finding ourselves in an irretrievable position.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister state what the position is.  It is also imperative that guarantees are given that the disruption and delays to date will not result in any errors in the printing or publishing of the examination papers, in their delivery to the various schools or any other errors pertaining to the preparation process.  Last year there were unacceptable errors in the marking of the leaving certificate Art examination papers and there is an ongoing dispute regarding the marking of the higher level English papers submitted by students from Dundalk.</P>
    <P>There are indications that adequate resources are not available to the examinations personnel in Athlone.  The resourcing issue in the context of the organisation of the examinations is something which requires full ministerial review.  We do not want to see further errors due to undue pressures on staff or a rushed preparation process because of this dispute.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education's handling of the 1995 leaving certificate Art examination errors gave rise to considerable tension and anger among the staff in the examinations branch in Athlone.  Her replies to a number of parliamentary questions tabled by me clearly attempted to lay the blame for the errors on the staff in Athlone and drew a sharp distinction between herself, top management and staff there. This has caused understandable anger and has opened up a huge gulf between the Minister and her staff in Athlone which has further exacerbated the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2301" /> The Minister has lost the confidence of the staff in her Department.  It is worth noting that 88 per cent of the staff in Athlone voted in favour of industrial action.  This indicates the degree of disillusionment with the Minister's approach and with the approach of the Government to their legitimate concerns as articulated through the negotiation process under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and under the elaborate industrial machinery in place.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, disputes such as this are resolved.  I am concerned that time has been allowed to drag in relation to this dispute and, given the potential catastrophic impact on the State's examination process, one would have expected a more urgent response from the Government.  Young people and their parents are distressed about the threat to the examinations taking place as scheduled.  We must remove this additional stress and pressure from students and their parents.  Accordingly, I ask the Government to take urgent action.</P>
    <P>I wish to articulate my disappointment that today's discussions have not resulted in a successful outcome.  I ask the Minister of State and the Government to act urgently to allay the real concerns which exist in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>The preparation and administration of the certificate examinations are some of the most important and respected services provided by the Department of Education for students, parents, teachers, employers and society in general.  This is an enormous logistical exercise which has been expanding in recent years due to the growing numbers who participate in second level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These examinations now involve in excess of 130,000 pupils in 800 schools. In the case of a junior certificate candidate, the examination will represent a first exposure to external assessment. For leaving certificate candidates the examinations provide certification of <Col N="2302" /> achievement and are the basis for progression to employment and further education.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Vocational Awards, a body exercising devolved functions under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education, is aided in the administration of its important certification role by the examinations branch of the Department.  This involves that branch servicing the needs of over 14,000 participants in a range of post-leaving certificate programmes.</P>
    <P>Quality assurance, service, responsiveness to needs and equity of treatment are essential to ensure continued and enhanced public confidence in the examination system.  The examinations are not just an operational exercise. They are also a major collaborative partnership involving students, parents, teachers, school authorities and the Department.  Underlying this collaboration is a common desire to ensure that the examinations underpin good educational practice and that they are conducted in an environment which is as calm and as stress free as possible.  This is essential in order that students can demonstrate their full potential and that this potential is reflected in their results. This is the objective of all parties and students are entitled to no less.</P>
    <P>The overriding requirement to secure the wellbeing of examination candidates and to minimise any stress to them must be foremost in our thoughts in dealing with the present industrial relations difficulties. The House is aware that the industrial relations dispute involving the Civil and Public Services Union is not unique to the Department of Education. On the contrary, the central issues relating to this dispute are civil servicewide issues and must be dealt with in that context with care and sensitivity.  Given this fact, it would be inappropriate and not in the best interest of candidates to speculate on issues of contingency planning at this time.</P>
    <P>The Minister's commitment to the smooth operation of this year's examinations is well demonstrated by her recent announcement of an interim package of priority measures designed <Col N="2303" /> to improve the operation of these examinations. This package of measures includes the examination of the craftwork component of leaving certificate Art in schools by external examiners. The Department of Education is consulting with relevant interests on the detail of this measure.  In addition, the package includes computer and systems developments in the Department's examinations branch which will improve the capacity to detect and address the absence of any subject component.</P>
    <P>This year will also see the introduction of a new mechanism whereby results will be accompanied by a statement of information notifying schools of cases where a candidate's result for a subject is not based on all the required components of that subject.  This additional information will act as a failsafe mechanism and will enable schools and candidates to readily identify any result which does not contain credit for all subject components sat by the candidate. A telephone helpline will be available immediately after the issue of the 1996 results.  This helpline will provide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy gave notice that he wished to ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications if the reason for the delay in signing the GSM licence for ESAT Digifone relates to concerns expressed by other applicants about the <Col N="2304" /> circumstances surrounding the awarding of this licence.  I understand the Deputy wishes to share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with Deputy O'Rourke.  The matter I tabled for this debate continues: particularly in relation to US corporations' continued interest in investing in the Irish economy, and if he will give details of representations made in this matter by the US Government, US corporations and the IDA, and if he will make a statement on the matter.  That was the full text of my question.</P>
      <P>The awarding of Ireland's second mobile telephone licence is a bizarre affair.  At the time of the award, the Irish public and my own party welcomed the success of the seeming Irish consortium which was named as the successful tenderer.  However, it has since transpired that the entire process which resulted in this decision is being shrouded in secrecy to conceal the fact that the Government has sold the family silver at bargain basement prices in this case.  It is now commonly accepted that the market value of this licence would have been worth £50 million to £110 million had free market forces been allowed to operate.  Instead, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, announced that he is selling the licence for £15 million to Norwegian Telecom and 25 per cent to unnamed investors who have not yet disclosed the source of their funds.  Is Dermot Desmond an investor in yet another Telecom Éireann venture?  The public has a right to know the identity of the investors involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In selling the licence, the Minister placed a cap of £15 million on the price anybody could pay.  Contrary to his statements, the European Union did not require this £15 million cap.  What role did Pádraigh Ó hÚiginn, former secretary to the Taoiseach, play in the decision to impose the cap?  Is he a member of the successful consortium? The public has a right to know.  When the PR hype is put aside.  Irish taxpayers will be aghast to discover that they are being short-changed in this deal by at <Col N="2305" /> least £35 million and, had free bidding been allowed &mdash; as is in any normal sale or auction &mdash; by as much as £75 million. This is the most astonishing deal ever completed by an Irish Minister.  It is the biggest betrayal of the Irish taxpayer that I have witnessed during my time in this House and this includes the Goodman and other beef scandals.</P>
    <P>To put the value of this licence in context, the House should be aware that in a similar situation in Austria &mdash; another EU member state with a population of 7 million &mdash; the mobile telephone licence fetched the Irish equivalent, in GDP terms, of IR£110 million.  The actual price was £270 million.  The massive loss of revenue in this case to the Irish taxpayer is only one aspect of this deal.  A number of major US corporations in the telecommunications field submitted bids for this licence.  They were astonished that the Irish Government gave it away for a song and are completely mystified with regard to how the situation arose. These corporations have been refused an explanation by the Minister and no information has been forthcoming with regard to how each application was evaluated.</P>
    <P>Astonishingly, the Minister announced the award of the licence to ESAT four to five weeks ahead of the publicly stated date for such an announcement.  Why was this done? Why did the full Cabinet not get papers in good time to allow for full discussion and subsequent decision?  What stroke was being pulled by the Minister and for what reason?  How could a Minister in his position deal in such a cavalier fashion with such an important source of massive revenue to the State?  Taxpayers have good reason to be angry. They have been done out of tens of millions of pounds and have never been told how or why this was done.  The other companies which tendered are angry.</P>
    <P>My information is that there is a view among US businessmen that this affair would have been handled better in a banana republic and that they would think twice before they or those they influence would consider investing in this <Col N="2306" /> economy in future.  The Minister and the Taoiseach know that there have already been adverse effects and in one case a potential investment which would have created 400 jobs in the southern region was transferred to another country because of our Mickey Mouse carry on over this licence.</P>

We are embarked on the new adventure of the break up of monopolies and it is important domestically and for our reputation in Europe and throughout the world that this business is carried out in an open, transparent and accountable way, for those who were awarded the licence and those who were not.  We must ensure that the miasma is cleared and that questions which need to be answered are done so openly.  Any necessary disclosure should be made quickly and instantly.  The understandable disquiet which has been expressed publicly and in the media must be cleared once and for all.  It is not good enough that the Minister changes the agenda, the criteria and the facts which need to be addressed.  My party wishes to see the matter cleared up forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The GSM licence is a milestone document and it is of critical importance that it be well drafted.  The only &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;&mdash; reason for delay in issuing the licence is the time needed to draft this complex document correctly.  While an indicative draft was available at the time <Col N="2307" /> of the competition it could only be finalised and put into legal form as soon as a decision was made.  Much of its detailed content is based on the winning tender.  I am determined that the licence be issued as soon as possible.  We must not make haste at the expense of accuracy. The content of the licence is agreed between my Department and ESAT Digifone and it is now with the Attorney General's Office for legal clearance.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where there were six professional, costly and competitive applications, it is entirely understandable that there are disappointed applicants; there was only one prize. That this disappointment should manifest itself in the type of innuendo and comments we have heard from Deputy Molloy is entirely unacceptable.  I want to emphasise, one more time, that the selection process was thoroughly carried out by a team of officials and consultants without interference of any kind from me or anybody else.  They carried out their evaluation by reference to the selection criteria which were well known to all applicants in advance and they specifically respected the priority order indicated.  The departmental team and the international independent consultants separately and collectively recommended one winner and the Government approved that result.</P>

The format of such feedback, whether oral or written, is being considered and the details of this approach are being settled in discussion with the consultants and the Attorney General's Office.  There is no question of comparative feedback with the winning applicant or with other applications; the confidentiality rules would not allow it.  Please remember that somebody came last as well as first and <Col N="2308" /> they may not wish that fact to be trumpeted. Within that constraint, the intention is to be reasonably forthcoming.</P>
      <P>There have been formal requests from a number of applicants, informal approaches by the US Embassy and some contact by the IDA on the matter. This country enjoys a high reputation among US corporations for probity and honesty in its business dealings with them.  I cannot imagine that failure to win a single licence in a clean competitive process would damage that reputation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>Specific targets for growth in tourism have been set out in the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, which envisages the achievement in 1999 of foreign exchange earnings of £2.25 billion and of 120,000 tourism job equivalents.  These targets envisage average annual growth rates of 9 per cent and 5 per cent in foreign exchange and employment creation, respectively. <Col N="2091" /> The Operational Programme for Tourism also contains mid-term targets for the end of 1996.  These envisage the achievement in 1996 of foreign exchange earnings of £1.8 billion and of 105,000 tourism job equivalents.</P>
      <P>Provisional figures released recently by the Central Statistics Office indicate that foreign exchange earnings in 1995 rose by 12 per cent to £1.677 billion. Tourism related employment rose to 96,000 in 1994 and early estimates are that the figure may have exceeded 100,000 in 1995.  While there are no statistics available as yet on visitor numbers this year, I understand from Bord Fáilte that the level of inquiries received to date is encouraging and there is confidence that the mid-term targets will be reached.  In the light of the success achieved in recent years and the prospects for the year ahead every effort is being made to ensure that the tourism sector continues to expand and develop. As the House will already be aware, priorities for Irish tourism are set out in the operational programme which provides for a total investment of £125 million in marketing, £110 million in training, and £287 million in product development, over the life of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile, in line with the importance which I attach to tourism promotion, I recently decided to allocate a further £1.235 million this year to Bord Fáilte over and above its normal allocation, for further marketing and promotional activity.  In addition, the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative will in 1996, for the second successive year, undertake marketing campaigns in Britain, France, Germany and the US. In line with the Arthur D. Little consultancy review, Bord Fáilte has been divesting itself of non-core functions and refocusing its resources on international marketing with three key priorities: selling and promoting Ireland overseas; helping the less mature elements of the industry to develop <Col N="2092" /> their marketing and product development capabilities; and providing information for enhanced decision making by marketeers, investors and managers in the industry as well as Government. In the longer term, the work currently ongoing in Bord Fáilte on the development of a destination brand for Irish tourism, will help to position Ireland as a unique and high quality destination.</P>

      <P>One of the principal objectives of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 is to encourage significant growth in the shoulder and off-peak periods.  Accordingly, the thrust of the programme is towards the enhancement of tourism facilities to operate on an all year round basis, as far as is feasible, and marketing to achieve this aim. Particular priority has been given to the provision of weather independent visitor facilities; hotel conference and leisure facilities; tourism angling; golf etc. In 1995, the number of off peak tourists is estimated to have increased by 18 per cent, a full three percentage points ahead of overall tourist growth for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some £40 million of European Regional Development Fund money has been committed to the development of privately owned tourism facilities to date and it is estimated that the private sector has committed more than £70 million to match this Community assistance. Total expenditure on marketing under the operational programme to the <Col N="2093" /> end of 1995 amounted to some £35 million of which £21 million was contributed by the private sector.  These levels of investment have been achieved within the first 15 months of the life of the operational programme and I am confident the continuing upswing in tourism numbers will stimulate further investment growth.  I can also inform the Deputy that the new Tourism Council, which I chair, had its first meeting on 4 April and seasonality featured in the discussions.  The council has tabled a more in depth discussion on this subject for its next meeting in June when I look forward to hearing the views of industry.</P>

      <P>The foreign earnings committee, which I chair, and which includes representatives from the promotional State agencies and relevant Government Departments, is responsible for ensuring the effective co-ordination of our promotional activities in the main markets.  This includes the question of reviewing opportunities for the consolidation of office accommodation for the State's diplomatic, consular and economic representation so as to ensure that the most effective use is made of available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Madrid, the foreign earnings committee has agreed that the Department of Foreign Affairs should undertake a feasibility study of the possibilities for further consolidation of our representation in Madrid where, at present, some of the agencies have <Col N="2094" /> offices within the embassy building while others maintain separate offices at other locations.  The feasibility study is currently being conducted by the embassy, in conjunction with the local agency representatives, with a view to reporting back to the foreign earnings committee later this year on the various possible options.  The Government is committed to achieving the greatest possible consolidation of overseas representation in &ldquo;Ireland Houses&rdquo; wherever possible.  Since 1993 agency representation has been consolidated on this basis in New York, Tokyo, Prague, Budapest and Kuala Lumpur.  The foreign earnings committee will continue to review possibilities for the expansion of the &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo; concept to other locations where it can be justified in terms of cost-effectiveness and the enhancement of the representation of Ireland's interests.</P>

      <P>As I have stated in various fora in the past, mandatory approval of all accommodation would not be practical nor would it necessarily improve standards to any great extent.  It could reduce the accommodation bank available, particularly during the high season and at the cheaper end of the market, and it would certainly give rise to endless policing and prosecution problems. The best approach is to ensure the unapproved sector does not have advantages over the approved.  At present unapproved operators do not have access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte and the tourist information offices, nor do they have access to tax breaks or other subsidised finance <Col N="2095" /> schemes which are available to the approved sector.  The pilot tax relief scheme for the tourist resort areas and the subsidised tourism loan schemes were carefully designed so that only approved operators would be eligible.</P>
      <P>Unapproved operators, on the other hand, are obliged to comply in the same way as the approved sector with requirements, for example, in the areas of taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene.  My Department has been impressing on the relevant enforcement agencies the need for constant vigilance to ensure that their policing or inspection practices do not discriminate as between approved and unapproved sectors. The ideal solution would be for the unapproved sector to become approved. I am hopeful that following the restructuring of Bord Fáilte, the associations which have been recognised by Bord Fáilte for the purpose of approving the B &amp; B sector will be successful in increasing their membership.</P>

      <P>The current annual levels of remuneration of the non-executive directors of boards, companies or agencies under the aegis of my Department are as follows. Five of six non-executive board members of ACC Bank plc receive remuneration of £4,000 per annum.  The sixth, a civil servant, receives no remuneration in his capacity as a board member.  Eight of the ten directors of the Central Bank receive remuneration of £5,000 per annum.  Neither of the others, one of whom is a civil servant and the other the Governor, receives any remuneration in their capacities as board members.  There are no non-executive members of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  No payments are made by the institute to (non-staff) members of the ESRI Council or Executive Committee for their service. Six of the eight non-executive directors of ICC Bank plc receive remuneration of £4,000 per annum.  One, a civil servant, receives no remuneration and the chairman receives remuneration of £6,000 per annum.  Members of the Board of Directors of the Institute of Public Administration comprise staff of the IPA, and outside members, including public servants and trade union officials, none of whom are paid any remuneration for such membership.  Six non-executive directors of the national lottery receive remuneration of £4,000 per annum.  A further two directors do not receive any remuneration in their capacity as board members, since they hold board or executive positions within An Post.  There are no non-executive directors in the National Treasury Management Agency.  There is an advisory committee, the chairman of which <Col N="2104" /> receives £10,000 per annum and five of the six members each receive £5,000 per annum.

      <P>Earlier this year, the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development presented its report to the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  Following their findings, I introduced a new tax incentive scheme for certain offshore islands in this year's Finance Bill. The islands concerned are those 21 offshore islands listed in the recently published report.  The purpose of this tax relief is to encourage the construction and refurbishment of residential accommodation for permanent residency on those offshore islands.  The reliefs will apply to qualifying expenditure in the three year period from 1 August 1996.</P>
      <P>In selecting the 21 offshore islands listed in the Finance Bill specific reference was drawn to those offshore islands having the following characteristics: no connection to the mainland and accessible only by sea or air; and the island community has been resident on the island for at least one generation. As the Deputy is aware Achill is linked to the mainland by roadway.  Furthermore, Achill is one of the 15 designated seaside resort areas for the purpose of the pilot renewable scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  Consequently, given that Achill does not qualify as an offshore island and is already a designated seaside resort area.  I do not intend including Achill in the offshore islands scheme.</P>

These measures have been notified to the public by way of newspaper advertisements.</P>
      <P>Each of the private hospitals concerned will ask patients to sign a document assigning their VHI benefit to it with a view to claiming it directly from VHI.  Patients who opt to sign this form will not be required to settle their accounts at the time of discharge.  It is a matter for the individual patient to decide whether or not to sign such a form.  The VHI has indicated that it will pay directly to the member any eligible hospital account within three weeks of receipt of the completed claim form and relevant invoices.  The VHI is not imposing any obligation on members to settle hospital accounts before benefit is paid at the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously in the House, I cannot intervene in this dispute as it would not be appropriate for me to do so in view of my role as the regulatory authority for the health insurance market generally.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The subvention scheme which accompanied the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 was implemented on 1 September 1993 and ensures that those most in need of care in a nursing home, and without the means to pay for it, receive assistance towards the cost. With regard to the question about the assessment of adult children of an applicant for subvention, a health board may only assess a son or daughter's ability to contribute towards the cost of the nursing home fees of a parent if the son or daughter is aged 21 years and over, is residing in the jurisdiction and possesses sufficient personal income according to the procedures laid out in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993. Of the 8,015 subventions approved to the end of February 1996 health boards had made a reduction as a result of the son or daughter's ability to pay in 1,458 cases, or one in six of the subventions approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> Sons and daughters who are in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees should do so.  The State recognises this contribution in the tax relief it gives on such payments.  However, following the receipt of the report of the review group on the operation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, I am currently considering a number of recommendations made by the group, one of which relates to the assessment of the circumstances of adult children of applicants for subvention.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to answer Questions Nos. 73 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>Care of the elderly is an essential theoretical and clinical component of the existing pre-registration training programmes for general, mental handicap and psychiatric nurses in accordance with the rules and syllabi of An Bord Altranais.  The revised diploma based model of general nursing pre-registration education and training, which was introduced in the Western Health Board in 1994, extended to further schools of nursing in 1995 and to be extended again this year, increased and strengthened the clinical experience component related to the care of the elderly.  I am satisfied that this area of nursing care is adequately covered in the pre-registration training of nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to post-registration specialisation in geriatric nursing, An <Col N="2113" /> Bord Altranais has approved the following courses: a gerontological nursing course in James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown; a Diploma in Gerontological Nursing in St. James's Hospital/Trinity College; and a Master of Science in Gerontological Nursing in St. James's Hospital/Trinity College. The involvement of the third level sector in specialised gerontology nursing courses is very recent and welcome.</P>
    <P>These courses are optional and are not a prerequisite for nurses who wish to specialise in geriatric nursing.  Again, I am satisfied with the content of such courses and the qualifications awarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>In interpreting the data it should be noted that the number of community based staff in these categories is relatively small, and consequently a minor variation in the number of whole-time equivalent staff can substantially alter the rate per 100,000 of the population. The centralisation of some services is also a contributory factor in the rate variations.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated publicly on a number of previous occasions, I am committed to putting the resources in place to support the development of enhanced maternity services in Cork, both in the short-term and as a long-term solution to current difficulties.</P>
      <P>The centralisation of maternity services on a single site at Cork University Hospital is a major capital project which will require detailed planning work by the Southern Health Board, in close consultation with the Department.  This process is already under way with the full co-operation of my officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to interim arrangements for improving the existing maternity services at the Erinville and St. Finbarr's <Col N="2121" /> Hospitals, in February 1996, the Southern Health Board endorsed proposals from the general manager in this regard. These proposals, aimed at addressing immediate staffing and safety concerns, were formally submitted to my Department recently.  I understand that, in line with these proposals, the board has now moved to put in place additional staff for neonatal services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>Health boards may refer patients for treatment outside the State where certain criteria have been met, including urgent medical necessity and the non-availability of the treatment within the State.  It is a matter for the health board to examine the circumstances of each individual case and to decide on whether the criteria have been met; the approval of the Department of Health is required only where the anticipated cost of treatment exceeds £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the health boards that five couples received funding to travel abroad for infertility treatment in 1995.  Given the small number of cases involved, patient confidentiality would be jeopardised if further details were given of the nature of the treatment <Col N="2122" /> received.  One person received funding to travel abroad for sex change treatment in 1995.</P>
    <P>During 1995, a number of health boards sought advice from the Department of Health as to whether fertility treatment was appropriate for referral abroad.  Arising from this request, all health boards were advised in November 1995 that, in the Department's opinion, fertility treatment does not comply with the criterion of urgent medical necessity.</P>

      <Quest>if a safety barrier could be erected at the water-edge at the Canal Bank between Portobello Bridge and Ranelagh, Dublin, in view of the number of fatal accidents that have occurred there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy in relation to canals is to open them up for use by the public as an amenity to the maximum extent possible.  The erection of barriers at the water-edge would not be consistent with this approach and could even pose safety problems for people using the canals themselves. Public safety is, of course, of paramount importance and, where this requires restrictions on public access, whether by the provision of water-edge barriers or otherwise, the necessary measures can and will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Waterways Service that they have examined the area referred to by the Deputy and do not consider the erection of a barrier at the water-edge necessary in this location. There is a tarmacadam pathway approximately one metre wide along the canal bank and the path is no nearer than 0.75 metres to the edge of the canal.  The stretch also benefits to some <Col N="2124" /> extent from the adjacent public lighting. There is a public footpath along the stretch on the opposite bank of the canal which is separated from the water-edge by a low wall.  The canal towpath is not, therefore, the only walking route along the canal at this location and people who use it do so by choice rather than of necessity.  Some low-hanging tree branches were cut recently to improve walking conditions on the towpath.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that an application has been submitted to my Department for funding under the cultural development incentives scheme 1994-99, which I am administering under the operational programme for tourism, by the Cluain Tarbh branch of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in respect of the development of a cultural centre in Clontarf.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have approved in principle the funding of eight projects submitted to me under the cultural development incentives scheme 1994-99.  The advisory committee which I have established for this purpose is considering, with a view to making recommendations to me, the other applications received.  I expect this process will take approximately another month to complete and I hope to be in a position to approve in principle the funding of further projects and to announce details of these projects in May.  A decision will be made on the application submitted by the Cluain Tarbh branch of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in respect of the cultural centre in Clontarf during this process.</P>

      <P>I have now made regulations which substantially reduce the current threshold of 200 hectares at which planning permission and environmental impact assessment are required for afforestation projects.  A new threshold of 70 hectares for initial afforestation will apply to all planting commencing on or after 1 October 1996.  In addition, planning permission and environmental impact assessment will be required for cumulative afforestration (i.e. within 500 metres) by, or on behalf of, a single developer over a three-year period, where the afforestation would result in a total area planted exceeding 70 hectares. In considering environmental impact statements, planning authorities will have regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to the impact of proposed projects on dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a wider package of measures to address concerns about the environmental impact of forestry development, I have made arrangements with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, that the Forest Service will introduce additional procedures for grant-aided afforestation.  From 1 May 1996, the service will notify local authorities of all projects exceeding 25 hectares in respect of which grant applications are <Col N="2131" /> received.  Additionally, local authorities are being asked to designate areas which they consider to be sensitive to forestry development for reasons such as the need to protect views and scenic areas, protection of the natural and archaeological heritage and the avoidance of rural isolation.  Local authorities will be notified by the Forest Service of all proposals for afforestation in these designated areas.  Where a local authority is notified of a forestry grant application, the views of the authority will be taken into account by the Forest Service, which will remain responsible for the final decision on the application.</P>
    <P>It is also the intention of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to clarify and tighten the operation, and ensure enforcement of the forestry guidelines which contain provisions on the appropriate distance of forestry from houses.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls at all <Col N="2139" /> schools which do not already have these facilities.  However, because of limited capital resources, this will have to be done on a phased basis over several years.  The question of providing a PE hall at Palmerstown community school can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demand for additional classroom accomodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to say when a PE hall will be provided in this particular case. However, should financial circumstances permit, the school will be given every consideration.</P>

      <P>A new scheme to devolve authority to national schools to undertake minor improvement works to their buildings, grounds, services and <Col N="2140" /> furnishings will come into effect in January 1997.  Under the scheme, approximately £11 million will be transferred from my Department to the national schools.  Each school will receive a basic grant of £2,000, plus £9 per pupil, to undertake improvement works and will not have to apply to the Department for approval to carry out such works.  A circular outlining the details of the new scheme will be issued to schools very shortly.  The new developed scheme is a practical example of the implementation of the White Paper and I believe it will be of great benefit to schools.</P>

School authorities are authorised to grant exemptions from the study of Irish in accordance with prescribed procedures.  These include a written application made by a parent or guardian to the principal of the school, the preparation of a written report on the student by the school authorities in consultation with relevant teachers and, in the case of an application for exemption on the grounds of specific learning disability, the provision of a report from a qualified psychologist carried out not more than two years prior to the application for exemption.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, for internal operational reasons, transfers of offenders take place on a regular basis between all our prison institutions.  For sound management reasons, including prison security and confidentiality, it has not been the practice to give detailed reasons for such transfers.  I do not propose to depart from this practice in the case of the person referred to in the question.  It is a matter of record that <Col N="2151" /> this person is serving a three year sentence since November 1994 and since committal on his current sentence he has been imprisoned at various times in each of the institutions mentioned and also spent some time in the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum.</P>
      <P>As implied by the Deputy, the offender has made allegations against prison staff in different institutions.  All these allegations have been investigated and proved to be unfounded.</P>
      <P>I have given the offender's case every consideration but am not prepared to authorise a transfer to Portlaoise for him at this stage of his sentence.  I will, however, continue to keep his case under review.</P>

Prior to this allocation of additional personnel, patrolling of Dunboyne and Dunshaughlin Garda sub-districts after 1 a.m. was performed by the district patrol car based at Trim.

      <P>The person concerned was refused payment of carer's allowance as <Col N="2156" /> she was engaged in part-time employment and did not, therefore, satisfy one of the conditions for entitlements to this allowance.  She subsequently notified the Department that she had ceased employment and she has been awarded carer's allowance with effect from 22 February 1996.  Her appeal against the original decision to refuse her allowance claim has been withdrawn as a result.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was a major success again last year and proved to be of significant benefit to local communities and voluntary groups.  Many valuable projects have been undertaken by students over the past three years which would otherwise not have been carried out.  The students also gained valuable work experience and are generally pleased <Col N="2157" /> with the scheme.  The underlying purpose of the scheme is to provide income support for the less well off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and are unable to obtain summer work. Student nurses attending third level institutions are pursuing three year diploma courses as part of their training with designated hospitals.  During the summer months they are required to continue their training in the hospital to which they have been assigned.  They are not, therefore, available to participate in the scheme.</P>

      <P>Research has shown that the role of the environment in consumer buying decisions is growing in importance and is already very significant in more sophisticated and wealthy markets. For example, in Germany, only <Col N="2158" /> quality and price are rated more highly; in the UK, it is rated ahead of UK origin as a factor.  In the key German market, Ireland's largest in continental Europe, Ireland rates second after Germany itself as the &ldquo;greenest&rdquo; country in buyers' eyes.  In our largest market, the UK, we are in fourth position</P>
      <P>The main beneficiaries of Ireland's &ldquo;Green&rdquo; image are food and drink products, the promotion of which is now dealt with by An Bord Bia, operating under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Irish companies have also been developing particular expertise in areas such as water and waste treatment, recycling and laboratory testing, leaving Ireland well poised to benefit, for example, from the large amount of EU funding that is available to implement EU environmental regulations.  In Ireland alone, £655 million will be channelled into environmental services under the present Community Support Framework.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála is involved in many activities to identify markets and promote Irish exports in the area of environmental technology and has established an environmental unit to help identify opportunities for Irish companies.  This month, ABT has launched CONNECT, a new computer database with information on more than 500 companies who provide environmental products and services from the Republic and Northern Ireland.  This database will provide potential customers with a comprehensive register of Irish supply capability.</P>

      <P>The three main outbound <Col N="2159" /> travel markets consisting of the US, Germany and Japan clearly dominate international travel demand, collectively constituting over $110 billion, of the $300 billion spent.  Thereafter, the UK, France, Italy, Canada and the Netherlands account for a further $67 billion. These top eight countries together account for over 50 per cent of international expenditure.</P>
      <P>Our dependence on seven of these &mdash; Japan being the exception &mdash; for over 80 per cent of business is not, in my view, an undue dependence on a limited set of markets.  It is important to remember that where holiday income is concerned, Ireland has a very healthy spread with just over 40 per cent from mainland Europe and just under 30 per cent each from North America and Britain.  In marketing terms this represents a good mix and I would not wish to see a situation of overdependence on any one single market emerge.</P>

      <i>The Marketing Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99</i> does however recognise that <Col N="2160" /> opportunities will arise to develop new business from markets such as Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and Scandinavia in the short-term and from markets such as Australia, Canada, India, Japan, South America, South Africa and South East Asia in the longer term.  To this end the marketing sub-programme envisages providing support for marketing programmes which are aimed at diversifying into new markets in Europe and further afield and the sub-programme allows for higher maximum aid rates for such new market activity.</P>

      <P>There are no official trade statistics available yet for any part of 1996; the latest monthly figures published by the CSO are for November 1995.</P>
      <P>However, the Central Bank, in its spring bulletin, has predicted export volume growth of 11.5 per cent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the link between exports and jobs has been addressed by many commentators in recent years and it is recognised that multi-national firms, who tend to operate in high-productivity, capital-intensive sectors, have made a significant contribution to our outstanding national export performance. This is why An Bord Tráchtála's focus is now clearly on improving the export performance of the indigenous sector.  That sector has also performed well on export markets, in growth rate terms, but, as I stated recently, I wish to see a more broadly-based performance. This, in turn, should translate more immediately into further job creation since indigenous firms tend to operate in more labour-intensive areas.  In fact, the quarterly survey of indigenous exporters, carried out for An Bord <Col N="2162" /> Tráchtála by the ESRI, shows a jobs gain of nearly 3,500 in these firms by the fourth quarter of 1995, compared to the same quarter in 1994.</P>

      <P>Under the <i>Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99,</i> EU aid has been made available towards the provision of conference and leisure facilitites, specialist visitor accommodation and a selective hotel accommodation <Col N="2163" /> improvement scheme, in an effort to further raise standards in the accommodation product.</P>
      <P>ERDF assistance is available to hotels of more than 30 bedrooms for the provision of conference facilities to international standards while assistance may also be given to hotels to upgrade existing conference facilities.  The programme provides support for weather independent leisure facilities in accommodation with a minimum of 20 bedrooms. Assistance is available for the development of accommodation linked to special interest venues while hotels graded up to three star and located in tourist areas can benefit from European Regional Development Fund assistance to upgrade their facilities in certain circumstances. Full details of eligible activities are outlined in the <i>Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99,</i> as part of the Product Development Sub-Programme, under the heading, Specialist Accommodation-Related Developments Measure, which is available from the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note some amendments by the national monitoring committee for the programme to the criteria for the selective hotel accommodation improvement scheme, whereby the required investment has been reduced to a minimum of £150,000, while the maximum grant aid rate available has been increased from 25 per cent to 33.33 per cent for hotels with 30 bedrooms or less.</P>
      <P>However, such has been the level of interest in the Measure of the Operational Programme covering Specialist Accommodation Related Developments that available funding has been substantially committed and the question of additional funding for this measure will ultimately depend on progress under the other measures provided for in the operational programme which runs up to the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>The interiors of these buildings are typical of this type of building in Dublin.  The high level of decorative plasterwork, carving on marble fireplaces and the stone staircases, particularly at ground and first floor levels, are also to be found in the majority of Georgian buildings.  Nonetheless, they are excellent examples of the craftsmanship and skill which created such a distinctive part of our built heritage.</P>

    <P>These buildings are maintained by the Office of Public Works and that office undertakes a biennial survey of the houses to assess their condition and plan any maintenance and remedial works which are considered necessary to ensure their preservation, particularly any measures which are necessary to protect the fabric of the building and keep it in good and substantial repair.  Routine <Col N="2166" /> maintenance and decoration is carried out on a regular basis as necessary.</P>
    <P>This Department does not have available any plans, drawings or pictures of these buildings.  Such material may be available in the Irish Archtectural Archive or the National Archive.</P>

      <P>The percentage breakdown of cattle breeds used for artificial insemination for each of the last three years is set out in the following table.  As the figures indicate, the Friesian breed represents the largest usage in A.I.  In 1995, the Friesian breed represented 45.8 per cent of the total usage with continental breeds (including <Col N="2167" /> Charolais, Simmental, Limousin and Belgian Blue) representing 33.8 per cent.  Traditional breeds of Hereford and Angus accounted for 18.5 per cent.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider a new policy within his Department whereby inspections for sheep headage will take place outside the lambing season, either well in advance of lambing or after all ewes have lambed in view of the fact that inspections during the lambing season cause considerable inconvenience and high lamb losses.</Quest>

      <P>Applications under the EU ewe premium scheme and the EU sheep headage scheme are accepted on a composite application form.  The application period for the 1996 schemes ran from 13 December 1995 until 9 January 1996.  This application period was agreed following discussions with the farming organisations and is influenced by such factors as the seasonal lamb production pattern.</P>
      <P>Both schemes are governed by EU regulations which provide that the sheep applied on must be retained by the applicant for a specified period.  In the case of the ewe premium scheme the retention period runs for 100 days from the closing date for receipt of applications while the retention period for the sheep headage scheme runs for a minimum period of two months from the day following receipt of the applications. My Department is obliged to carry out inspection of flocks in order to verify the authenticity of claims and the eligibility of sheep on which premium or headage is claimed.  Such inspections must be carried out within the retention period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is made to carry out <Col N="2176" /> inspections at a time which will cause minimum disruption to lambing flocks. In many cases staff of my Department liaise with local farming groups in order to ensure that the inspections are carried out at the most suitable time. Inspections are carried out by experienced personnel and every effort is made to minimise distress or hardship to the sheep.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland continuously monitors radiation levels at a number of locations in Ireland.  The institute has advised me that there is no evidence of new or continuing contamination of our environment as a consequence of the major accident at the Chernobyl No. 4 reactor in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the institute is continuing to monitor the residual effects of the contamination which occurred directly after the Chernobyl accident.  This <Col N="2181" /> includes the monitoring of sheep grazing in a limited number of upland peaty areas where the transfer of declining levels of radioactivity to grasses is continuing. The results show that in the years following the Chernobyl accident radioactive contamination of these upland sheep has decreased by a factor of three or four.  This show decrease is expected to continue during the coming years.  In addition there is monitoring of the live sheep at slaughterhouses and the Radiological Protection Institute has advised that the results of this confirm that the regular consumption of sheep meat does not constitute a health hazard.</P>
    <P>The institute is satisfied that there is no need to take any further action in respect of the contamination which occurred at the time of the Chernobyl accident.  The situation is being and will continue to be monitored by the institute.</P>

      <Quest>if he has compared the cost effectiveness of large scale energy conservation measures with the capital costs of building another new generating station at an unidentified location in the midlands; and if so, the results of such a comparative study.</Quest>

      <P>The new peat generating station planned for the midlands area will be a state of the art facility.  It will be the most efficient plant of its kind in the country.  It is being built to sustain economic activity in the east midlands region which is dependent on the peat industry.  Many of the existing peat power stations are now too old to provide a long-term future for peat production.  The station will also make maximum use of a major indigenous energy resource at a time when our natural gas reserves are nearing exhaustion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons, the question of <Col N="2182" /> large scale conservation measures, as an alternative to this project, did not arise.</P>
    <P>The building of the new peat generating station in the midlands is one of an integrated and mutually reinforcing set of energy related measures being funded under the economic infrastructure operational programme, one of which is a well resourced energy conservation programme.</P>
    <P>Under that operational programme, £21 million has been provided for series of energy efficiency and conservation measures, including a number of grant schemes, a technical advice programme, educational initiatives, regional energy efficiency offices and promotional initiatives.  The end objective of these measures, which are co-ordinated by the recently established Irish Energy Centre, is an annual sustainable energy savings rate of £50 million by the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 180, 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, keenly aware of the importance of tourism, not only for County Mayo, but for the nation as a whole.  In the event of the companies discovering commercial quantities of minerals, and obtaining planning permission for their extraction, and the necessary licences from the Environmental Protection Agency, I can see no reason for not granting a State mining facility.</P>
      <P>I am of course aware of the opposition to mining in County Mayo and the investments made there in developing the tourist industry. However, there can be no question of an outright mining ban.  Equally there can be no question of mining being allowed unless the strictest environmental safeguards are in place.</P>

Before the expiry of the five year term, a limited number of personnel who fulfil certain criteria and who are specially selected will be given the option of a further period of service in the PDF.  In every other respect the conditions of service are the same as apply to personal enlisted prior to 1994.

      <P>Primary responsibility for coastal erosion lies with the property owner, whether that is a private individual or a local authority.  The Department of the Marine's primary responsibility is the management of the coastal zone rather than specific sites.</P>
      <P>A limited amount of funding under the operational programme for environmental services is available to my Department to assist in the undertaking of protection works.  However, this funding will only be made available through local authorities for the protection of public property, including beach and dune systems.  No funding is available for works designed solely to protect private property.</P>
      <P>However, if the Deputy contacts me directly in relation to this particular case I am prepared to ask my Department's engineers to visit the location and advise on possible remedial works.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware of erosion difficulties arising at these locations.  Our engineers advise that a significant cause of erosion of the dunes is over grazing by cattle.  Should Donegal County Council feel it appropriate, in the context of protecting the dunes and reducing erosion, they should apply for <Col N="2191" /> appropriate prohibitory orders for these locations.  Should such an application be received I will consider the matter further.</P>

      <P>Some 60 fishing vessel owners applied for decommissioning premia under the national scheme established last year. <Col N="2194" /> The closing date for receipt of applications was 31 October 1995.  The applications represent a total capacity of nearly 3,000 tonnes, widely spread around the coastal regions, and a good take up will assist in the achievement of our mandatory EU fleet targets by end 1996.</P>
      <P>The differential tonnage premia set under the scheme are in line with EU regulation 3699/93 which requires member states to apply <i>pro rata</i> scales and rates of assistance by age category up to a maximum level of premium.  The national rates were determined also by reference to available funding as well as the relative market value of vessels in the various age categories.  Even allowing for the relatively buoyant market for privately sold tonnage at present, it is expected that actual take up by approved applicants under the scheme will be largely in line with targets. The position will continue to be kept under close review by the Department and BIM up to the 31 May deadline for actual decommissioning of boats and payment of premia.</P>
      <P>The case by case impact of taxation on payments will depend on the financial circumstances of individual beneficiaries. In reviewing taxation issues at the time of drawing up the scheme, and with a view to assisting and encouraging potential applicants, a concession was negotiated which allows for the spreading of tax liability, if any, over a three year period.</P>
      <P>While the scheme allows for consideration of a dumping at sea permit in very exceptional circumstances the technical advice was and remains that the scuttling of decommissioned fishing boats could pose significant risks to the marine environment and to maritime safety and should not be encouraged.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 some £5.1 million is being made available to help address the serious erosion problem around our coast.  All coastal local authorities have submitted details of their protection priorities.  Indeed, only recently Louth County Council submitted proposals specifically defined and prioritised for consideration by my Department.  These proposals will be considered along with the proposals from the other local authorities.</P>
      <P>The total cost of all the proposals submitted by the various local authorities far exceeds the funding available. Therefore, it will not be possible to undertake all the proposals submitted.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the moneys available for protection works in 1996 has been committed. The possible undertaking of any other works will be considered when it is clear what residue remains after placing contracts for 1996.</P>
      <P>I would, however, like to point out that the protection of private property including dwellings is a matter for the private property owner.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the wild salmon support group has made a submission to the salmon management task force which had invited the views of interested individuals and organisations.  The submission incorporated analyses of particular issues relevant to salmon management, as follows: (1) Biological management for salmon stocks by Dr. Ken Whelan.  (Salmon Research Agency); (2) Economic assessment of the earnings of commercial salmon fisheries in Ireland since 1960 and the estimation of their residual value by F.S. O'Muircheartaigh.  (ESRI).</P>
      <P>(3) Economics of recreational versus commercial exploitation of wild salmon by Professor Brendan Whelan.  (ESRI).</P>
      <P>(4) Possible alternative sources of livelihood for salmon fishermen (BIM).</P>
      <P>(5) <i>The Irish Times</i> articles 1995 (Dr. K. Whitaker).</P>
      <P>It was a matter for all those making submissions to the task force to adduce available data and assessments by authoritative sources in support of their contributions. Informed contributions, from all the many perspectives, to the debate on the future management of wild salmon stocks are to be welcomed.</P>
