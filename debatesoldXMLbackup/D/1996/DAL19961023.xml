      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8, a motion concerning the referral of the Report of the Salmon Management Task Force to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy; No. 1, the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, Second Stage (Resumed); and No. 2, the Universities Bill, 1996, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, that No. 8 be decided without debate and that Private Members' Business shall be No. 34, a motion concerning the beef industry (resumed), and that shall conclude by 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there is growing concern following yesterday's labour force survey?  It shows the number of unemployed is not only static, despite low interest rates, low inflation, high economic growth and structural funds, but that the number of new jobs in the figures to April 1996 fell by 22 per cent compared to April 1995.</P>

      <P>In the light of the Government's decision not to hold a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality, what are the Taoiseach's views on the undertakings in the programme for Government on reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and on bringing in a new Bill on freedom of information.  Where does this legislation stand or is it part of the growing list of matters that are too complex to be dealt with in the lifetime of this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we would not have a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality this year.  We are not ready to put any proposals to amend the Constitution on that matter.  On the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the heads of that Bill were cleared recently and drafting is proceeding.  We intend to introduce it within the foreseeable future.  I expect the Freedom of Information Bill to be published before Christmas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Cabinet confidentiality, I have outlined extensively in the House that I am not certain it may be possible to draft wording that we can stand over.  We will endeavour to do so but the difficulties, with regard to collective responsibility, have been set out in <Col N="963" /> detail.  This has operated in all Cabinets since 1921 and it may be under threat in any proposed change.  The matter, therefore, has to be the subject of further consideration, and I am not setting a date on whether or when such a referendum will be introduced.  On the other hand, no decision has been taken other than we are not in a position to introduce an amendment to the Constitution on that matter this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach has considered this matter in detail and was so emphatic about doing it when he was on this side of the House, will he publish the documents and the options that have been looked at and perhaps lay them in the Library of the House so that we can see what the Government has rejected or is still considering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be careful in quoting what I said when in Opposition.  As the record will show, I have always shown myself to be concerned about collective responsibility in Cabinet, in Opposition and in Government. Deputy O'Rourke was correct in reminding me of this recently.</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach on 4 July if he would move the Electoral (Amendment) Bill to Committee so that people with disabilities will be able to vote in the next referendum.  What is the position with regard to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This refers to a Private Members' Bill promoted by the Deputy's party. The Deputy's party has not nominated it for Second Stage at Private Members' Business yet. This has to happen before the Third Stage can take place.  It is important that the party which has promoted this Bill should recognise that requirement of procedure and ensure that it is taken at Second Stage.  However, the Government has indicated that when that is done it will take a positive approach to the legislation.  It requires substantial amendment.  I understand from the Minister for the Environment that there will be approximately 50 amendments to this Bill to put it in a condition the Government could stand over as a basis for electoral law.  I would be very pleased if the Opposition party would ensure that this Bill reaches Committee Stage by nominating it first for Second Stage.  We will be happy to facilitate them in regard to Private Members' Business in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was taken in Private Members' Business at Second Stage.  It went to Committee and there was all-party agreement at Committee.  Now it has come back to the House. We do not control Committee Stages of Bills in this House by all-party agreement.  It is a matter for the Government.  The question I asked is whether the Taoiseach will agree that this Bill can be taken in formal Committee Stage.  Otherwise people with disabilities cannot vote.  We do not need a lecture from the Taoiseach.  The Bill was dealt with here, went to Committee, got all-party agreement and should be taken by the House in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that, because of what has happened, the matter needs to be taken at Second Stage before Committee Stage can be proceeded with.  I will be happy to facilitate that in any way I can to allow the matter to be moved forward.  I will arrange for the Government Whip to discuss this matter with the Fianna Fáil Whip to see how we can facilitate moving the matter to Committee Stage.  Extensive amendments are needed.  This cannot necessarily be processed overnight or even very fast.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House that this legislation will be in place in time for the referendum so that people with disabilities can cast their vote by post as promised by the Government in July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not possible.  We have provided extensive official briefings for the Deputy as to the reasons what she is seeking is <Col N="965" /> not possible.  She understands fully why it is not possible.  Her question is disingenuous.  I have indicated, nonetheless, that we will try to advance the matter further by agreeing for, perhaps, a formal taking of the Second Stage without absorbing a large amount of time so that the Bill can be processed further in Committee.  It will not be ready in time for the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Government gave me a commitment last June that this would be done.  I tried to have the Bill put into Committee Stage during the summer and I was told that there was no problem with it, that the Government would agree to it and that it would be in place in time for the referendum.  I am saying the same thing now as I said last June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  What I said last June was that I would see if it would be possible to have it ready for November.  It is not possible at this stage to do it and this has been explained extensively to the Deputy through official briefing.  She understands this fully.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Fine Gael on working as a team in Government.  I suppose it is easy when one gives way to the other parties all the time.  Yesterday I raised the question of safety at indoor rock concerts and I received the Taoiseach's reply last night, for which I thank him. Does the Government intend to implement the recommendations of the Hamilton committee on safety at indoor rock concerts and, if so, when?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals regarding outdoor events are being processed at present.  The only regulations currently governing indoor events are the fire and safety requirements which apply to the safety of buildings and do not specifically apply to the holding of events where large crowds are in attendance.  There is a lacuna in the legal position where indoor events are concerned and that is a matter of concern which requires attention.</P>
      <P>Lessons must be learned from the recent tragic events in the Point Theatre upon which findings have recently been issued.  We again extend our sympathy to the family concerned on the tragic and unexpected loss they suffered.  We must do everything we can to avoid a recurrence of the event in this jurisdiction.  There is a need for regulations in this area.  In the meantime, however, there is a need for a voluntary code of practice which can be agreed between the relevant authorities and promoters to provide for safety at indoor events where large crowds congregate.  I invite those concerned to agree a voluntary code of practice as a short-term measure pending the introduction of comprehensive and compulsory standards backed by the criminal law.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot and will not say when in advance of making the necessary arrangements. The priority is to agree a voluntary code of practice by which all promoters will abide.  In the meantime we will work on legislation.  I urge those who have influence in this matter, including the Deputy, to urge promoters of indoor events to agree a voluntary code of practice and to display clearly at the entrance to events the fact that they adhere to such a code with regard to crowd control, extensive security, numbers to be allowed into a given space and other factors that are necessary for the protection and safety of people at such events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 20 years since the Employment Equality Act, 1977, was passed by the Oireachtas.  Since then a raft of legislation has been passed, much of it to prevent discrimination against women.  The work environment has changed a great deal since 1977 &mdash; according to figures in this morning's newspapers 37 per cent of the workforce are women &mdash; and in many respects has changed for the better.  Some jobs held by women are part-time but more of them are full-time positions.  Women have full equality and that is reflected in the increasing number of women moving up the promotion ladder into senior positions.  It is a good trend because a great deal of talent was wasted when women could not pursue their careers.  Now, however, an increasing number of women are the sole breadwinners in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> While we have solved the problem of discrimination against women, I am concerned that we have created other discriminations.  In many respects we have created a two tier society, the haves and the have nots.  In some suburbs of Dublin, for example, there are two jobs per family while in other suburbs there are none.  In solving one type of discrimination we have, perhaps, created another.</P>
    <P>This is a complex Bill but some issues have been omitted.  The Bill refers to discrimination based on gender, marital and family status, age, race and so forth.  However, the greatest form of discrimination in Dublin is what I call geographic discrimination.  The city is riddled with it.  The other forms of discrimination outlined in the Bill are real but they affect small numbers of people. Geographic discrimination is a major problem and affects more people that other forms of discrimination. I hold clinics four days each week and I encounter cases of such discrimination every week, yet it is ignored in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many of the benefits some people have gained in the last 20 years have been on the backs of the new unemployed.  We have created a new category of socially excluded people who live in the newer suburbs of Dublin.  People who live in certain suburbs cannot get a job because employers believe their postal address is bad.  People are thus obliged to use the addresses of their friends and relations when applying for jobs.  They hope somebody in the family has an address that is deemed respectable so they can use it as a first step to employment.  I hope this issue can be dealt with by amendments on Committee Stage.  I do not understand how it could have been ignored.</P>
    <P>The Bill is appropriate if it is just an attempt to address EU directives.  However, it should attempt to address real forms of discrimination. If gender and disability quotas apply on State boards and in various other areas of employment, we should have similar quotas for people who live in certain parts of Dublin where our policy of human set aside has had its greatest impact.  The State should tackle this problem.  I do not know how it could be defined.  Perhaps it could be based on area partnership addresses.  The State should take the first step by allocating a certain number of positions to people who live in certain parts of the city, after which it should try to apply the system in private sector employment.  It should not just apply to low grade jobs.  The saddest cases are where families have struggled to educate their children and put them through college. On qualifying, however, and having made the effort their children cannot break into their chosen careers simply because they do not have the right address, contacts or school tie and their father is not in the right golf club.  That is a big problem which I would like addressed.</P>
    <P>On the overall situation of women we have made progress, but much still remains to be done. The system seems to work against women who stayed at home, reared their families and are trying to come back into the workforce.  They are not eligible for some of the community employment schemes and work options which are available to other people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> Women in single sex or segregated employments find it difficult to compare themselves with other workforces.  A real problem area for women is the lack of crèche facilities.  Until we provide proper crèche facilities women will not be on a level playing pitch.  In the next budget I hope there will be some move to provide tax relief towards the cost of crèche facilities for parents who have children up to the age of four or five.  This would be a tangible sign of our commitment in that direction.</P>
    <P>In his contribution last evening Deputy Eric Byrne complained specifically about section 37 which allows certain religious educational and medical bodies to be excluded from parts of the Bill if they can show their decisions were essential to maintain the religious ethos of the institution concerned.  I agree fully with section 37 and congratulate the Minister on it.  Deputy Byrne may have difficulty in understanding some people's desire to maintain tradition.  That his party has changed its name three or four times in the past ten or 15 years shows he has difficulty finding an identity for himself.  It must be remembered that the ordinary members of educational, medical or religious institutions helped to pay for the facilities provided.  As taxpayers they are enabling the State to put more money back into the education or medical facility.  If I want to send my children to a Catholic or a Buddhist school because I want them to benefit from that ethos, I do not consider it a luxury or a privilege.  It is something that as a taxpayer I have a right to do and since I am paying the State through my taxes, the State has a duty to assist me.  Equally, no matter what my religion, the State should not discriminate against me or put any obstacle in my way if I want to send my children to a school which caters for my religion.  The vast number of religious institutions are tolerant and respect people's private lives. Generally they are more interested in their employees' willingness to uphold the principles of the institution.</P>
    <P>Employers make judgments all the time when giving jobs.  As legislators our job is to try to set up fair principles.  If I was the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, and was sending somebody to France to sell beef, as an employer I might deem it an asset or even essential that that person be able to speak French.  Equally, if I am a principal of a Buddhist school I might consider it essential that a teacher be a Buddhist.  That is understandable and the principle is reflected in the Bill.  It is common sense and I go along with it.  This applies even more in the case of the medical institution.  Any hospital has a right to expect an ethical outlook from its employees that conforms to the ethos of the hospital.  Ethics is at the root of medical attitudes. We must accept that various religious groups have a right to do their own thing and the State should not put obstacles in their way. Objections such as those raised by Deputy Byrne indicate unreasonable political correctness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> This Bill is trying to outlaw discrimination against minorities.  In doing that we must not go overboard.  Deputy Byrne probably felt as usual that this was an opportunity to have a crack at the Catholic Church.  The minority churches will be much more interested in this Bill because they are more likely to be discriminated against than the Catholic Church which is bigger here.  The Tallaght hospital case was at the root of Deputy Byrne's intolerant comments, which I hope others will not repeat.  I respect people regardless of their religious views.  We should not all try to be agnostics or to find only one common denominator so that we are afraid to enshrine sections such as this in a Bill.  In some of the Eastern bloc countries where there was no religion some denominations are now flourishing.</P>
    <P>I notice that trade union membership or political affiliation is excluded.  I experienced harassment because of my political leanings and because I was also a shop steward.  This type of thing affects a number of people and it should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Discrimination on age grounds is a big issue. The Minister referred to it in his speech but section 34 seems to backtrack from the principles he enunciated.  He is giving excuses to the people who want to discriminate.  The section should be reconsidered.  One of the points in that section is that it should be unlawful to relate wages to age. In many respects that was one of the few ways in which seniority was acknowledged.  A 40 year old would get more than the person who was 30.  It was a positive discrimination.  The Minister seems to suggest that one person cannot be paid more than another on age grounds.  That section, as I read it, is pulling back from what the Minister has said.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that people with disabilities have been discriminated against.  I listened to Deputy Woods speak about the medical definition of disability.  I agree with his assertion that we should concentrate on ability to do the job rather than on the medical certificate.</P>
    <P>Sexual harassment is a growing problem and is being addressed in this legislation.  All rights bring responsibilities.  I wrote to the Minister about a case where a supervisor felt there was an unfair charge of sexual harassment against him. As we put more protections into legislation we have to ensure they are not abused.  People such as supervisors who may be accused of discrimination also need to be protected.  I support the protection of people's rights but we must equally ensure that these rights are not abused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which provides for the promotion of equality between employed persons and outlaws direct and indirect discrimination in employment.  It also endorses many of the provisions in earlier Acts which deal with unlawful discrimination in employment on the grounds of sex, marital or family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and <Col N="971" /> membership of the travelling community.  I agree with some of the reservations expressed and we must make whatever amendments to the Bill are necessary to further improve equality.  All Members are united in support of the main thrust of the Bill which is employment equality, and we must ensure that there are no gaps or exclusions which would prevent this.</P>
      <P>The progress made in employment equality in recent years has been due mainly, if not entirely, to directives imposed on us by the EU.  There is a host of European equality legislation measures but the Commission chose directives as the primary method of instituting equality legislation. The main equality directives introduced to date have dealt with issues such as equal pay, equal treatment, statutory social security, occupational social security, the self-employed and pregnancy. In some cases recommendations were used when unfortunately there was a lack of political will to implement a directive while in other cases they were used as a preliminary step before the introduction of a directive.  In this respect the most effective recommendation was on the protection of the dignity of women and men at work.  I am glad EU directives are binding as there would probably be delays or deferrals if this was not the case.</P>
      <P>The Commission was wise to leave the choice of forum and method of implementation of these directives to national authorities.  Protection is provided for individuals in that they can rely on the provisions of a directive in legal proceedings before a national court or tribunal, even if a directive has not been implemented by the national parliament within the permitted time or has not been properly or fully implemented. Ireland has a good record in the implementation of European equality directives.  The 1973 Equal Pay Directive was implemented by the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, while the 1976 Equal Treatment Directive was implemented by the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  Ireland has occasionally been subjected to proceedings in the European Court for the non-implementation of directives but equality officers and the Labour Court have been imaginative and reactive in their approach to European developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there the glory ends.  The progress made in employment equality over the past 20 years or so has been due entirely to directives imposed on us by the EU.  We must be honest and admit that no equality legislation was introduced as a result of our initiative.  Where would women be without EU directives?  Women in particular must thank the EU for the improvement, protection and enhancement of their employment opportunities and status of their work.  We should be ashamed of our failure to take the initiative in this area.  It is a pity some Government did not, of its own accord, decide to provide equality of opportunity or to provide for equality in areas where there was blatant inequality.  The benefits or otherwise of EU membership can be debated <Col N="972" /> but there can be no denying that employment equality has been bred, nurtured and imposed on us by the EU.  The equality dimension has gradually become part of politics.  Gender balancing and gender proofing must continue and positive discrimination must be applied if we as a society are not willing of our own accord to recognise the rights of women and minorities.</P>
    <P>While welcoming equality legislation it is important to look at the progress women have really made.  Have they made the progress they are worthy of and are entitled to on the basis of merit and ability?  We can change our laws but the real question is how we can change attitudes which are still firmly entrenched in the Irish mind.  I welcome the labour force survey results published yesterday which show a massive increase in the number of women in the workforce. While they account for 37 per cent of the workforce, no doubt the majority of them are employed in low paid or part-time work.  How many women, even with the support of equality legislation, have succeeded in climbing the promotion ladder to the top?  A study on women in management in local administration undertaken by the Joint Committee on Women's Rights makes interesting and compelling reading.  All Members should read, study and digest the results of this study.  While legislation has opened the gate to the workplace for many women, there are still huge barriers to their promotion.  The results of this comprehensive study are a revelation in terms of what is happening not only in local administration but in many other areas.</P>
    <P>The study makes interesting but depressing reading.  It confirms that even though more women than men are employed in local administration there is not one woman in the senior grades.  There is no female city or county manager out of a total of 37 and no female assistant city manager or assistant county manager out of a total of 27.  There are two female county secretaries out of a total of 26 and one female finance officer out of a total of 27.  There is one female administrative officer out of a total of 23 and no female principal officer.  It is a justified conclusion that men occupy the top positions in local administration. I remind the House that this report was published in 1996, when we still had a massive amount of equality legislation.  What progress has this equality legislation achieved?  There is still a serious barrier within the system which prevents women from climbing the promotional ladder.</P>
    <P>This report showed that the absence of women on interview boards was a crucial issue.  Vertical promotion within our local authorities starts with interview boards drawn up by them and progresses to the Local Appointments Commission. The report showed that none of the interviewing boards included women from middle management. Interviewing boards must comprise people at the level of the position advertised.  Women are not reaching the higher positions and, therefore, are not qualified to be on the interviewing board. It can be concluded from this study that the Local <Col N="973" /> Appointments Commission has a serious problem. Women are not reaching the levels of county secretary, finance officer, assistant manager and county manager and cannot represent these positions on interviewing boards.</P>
    <P>This study was a revelation.  Another report carried out by the Mid-Western Health Board investigated the progress of women in the promotional stakes and showed once again a dismal and depressing account.  Women continue to fail to obtain promotion within the higher levels of local authorities.  Female members of local authorities sit at meetings looking at the top table where all seats are taken up by male personnel. I accept there is an absence of women seeking promotion to the higher levels, which is not the fault of the women involved.  They cannot make it through middle management to be qualified or to have a decent chance of success at senior management level.  We presented the committee's report to the Minister and I hope there will be an improvement in the promotion stakes for women within our local authorities.</P>
    <P>We can legislate to provide for equality of opportunity but how do we provide equality of outcome?  There will not be true equality unless equality of opportunity is matched with equality of outcome.  Under equality of opportunity, women are given the same starting opportunities as men.  They are expected to participate as men in society, working within a system based on male norms.  We must accept women are not the same as men in many respects, most fundamentally in the area of childbirth and family responsibility. Equality of outcome will be provided only when we can ensure men and women are equal despite their fundamental differences.  While I am glad there is equality of opportunity, I am disappointed it is not permeating throughout the careers of women.  There is no equality of outcome.</P>
    <P>We do not have to look beyond this House to see the problems facing women in achieving promotion. The maximum number of women in Cabinet in any previous Government was two.  Is there a hidden understanding that two is sufficient and will prevent any justified complaints that women are not getting their place at the Cabinet table?  Why can it not be three or four? It is amazing that only two women have ever sat around the Cabinet table, irrespective of the welcome increase of female Deputies.  Perhaps the reason Ireland did not take initiatives in introducing equality legislation of its own accord, without waiting for a directive from Europe, is in many ways due to the fact that there is not a sufficient number of female voices in this House.  They do not have a say on decisions taken in relation to legislation.  It would be a great day for Ireland if we could say we took steps of our own accord and were to the forefront in employment equality.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many problems in ensuring women have equality of opportunity.  The main areas in which Irish law does not provide <Col N="974" /> for equality is in social welfare and maternity leave for self-employed women.  As a rural Deputy, I speak on behalf of farmers' wives, who cannot make voluntary contributions to a social insurance fund.  They are completely reliant on the self-employed worker's contribution, which means they are not entitled to a maternity allowance, nor do they have access to a replacement scheme during pregnancy.  It is regrettable that no effort was made in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, to bring these women within the scope of that legislation.</P>
    <P>Providing equality of pay for equal work is not enough.  We must break down the barriers which prevent women from participating in certain types of employment.  We must accept that discrimination in education and vocational training was a barrier to women's participation in the labour market and a reason for a disproportionate level of female long-term unemployed.  To break down these barriers, we must ensure women have better access to vocational training, better childcare facilities and better participation in the decision making process.</P>
    <P>The only tangible decision made to ensure women are represented in the decision making process has been the gender quota introduced on State boards.  Ministers making appointments to such boards are required to achieve a minimum representation of not less than 40 per cent of either sex.  In 1991, 81 per cent of these boards consisted of men.  The few women employed in the boards were in the lower levels.  Much work remains to be done in ensuring we have equality of outcome.  Women, while having equality of opportunity in employment, must ensure that equality does not end the day they get a job.</P>
    <P>Many changes have been introduced.  The FÁS action programme for women has been a tremendous help but there is still progress to be made in the area of childcare, a fundamental responsibility of women.  Many women would make far better progress within their chosen career but for the lack of childcare facilities.  I welcome the legislation.  It is a precious opportunity to make further necessary changes in this area and to ensure that we have not only equality in employment legislation but in reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has had a long gestation period and many of its provisions are laudable. The Minister's role in equality and law reform is removed from other Departments and the Government within which he works.  I am concerned about a number of issues that relate to other Departments which signal discrimination and inequality in the State sector.  The Minister should be aware that while the Bill is laudable, the public will perceive it as the State putting in place legislation while other arms of it do not comply with the objectives of the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods ably referred to the section on women and discrimination.  He said that women face man-made barriers in recruitment, promotion, <Col N="975" /> admission to training which leads to advancement and, more importantly, that they are locked out of State training schemes and work options, especially if they are homemakers.  Many of these women are currently up in arms because of the discrimination and obstacles that prevent them from returning to the workforce, particularly under community employment schemes.  In the past few months many of them have told me that when they applied for a place on community employment schemes they were informed that because they were not in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or a lone parent's allowance they were barred from participating in such schemes.  In opting to stay at home and rear their children rather than go out to work these women have done an excellent job for the State, but when an opportunity arises for them to return to the workplace the State places obstacles in their way.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Dáil question, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment indicated that the community employment scheme is geared towards the long-term unemployed and I accept that it is laudable to give persons who have been out of work for 12 months an opportunity to return to the workplace.  However, as lone parents are allowed participate in the scheme, married persons wonder why they are barred, especially having made commitment to the State in rearing their children.  The Minister must examine the barriers placed in the way of married women who want to contribute to the economy by participating in work schemes and training programmes.</P>
    <P>We should cherish all our people equally.  The lone parent's scheme introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, particularly the scheme he proposes to introduce in the 1997 budget, is inequitable in terms of married persons. Does the Minister consider it equitable that a lone parent working with a married person, whose husband is unemployed, should receive an extra tax free allowance of £6,000 per annum and continue to receive lone parent, rent, back-to-school and fuel allowances and a medical card? Does he accept that in such circumstances the married person would receive a much smaller wage than the lone parent?  If the married person's husband received unemployment assistance it would be means tested and probably reduced and tax would be assessed on the combined income.  Does the Minister accept that in such circumstances the married couple would automatically lose the right to a rent allowance, their medical card would be reviewed and the back-to-school and fuel allowances would be removed?  I acknowledge that the Minister for Social Welfare is trying to get one parent families back into the workforce and out of the dependency trap, but does the Minister accept that we cannot discriminate against a particular sector in this manner? Surely the onus is on the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to ensure that if such allowances <Col N="976" /> are extended to lone parents, married persons receive similar benefits.  It would be interesting if a constitutional issue were made of this case.  It is ironic that the Minister for Social Welfare readily admits that some married persons are disadvantaged but nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members welcome a Bill that proposes to remove barriers placed in the way of people with disabilities entering the workforce. The Minister's objective is laudable.  However, the practicalities of the issue are such that the State itself is letting down the disabled.  I would like to give a few examples.  According to public service statistics regarding the employment of disabled people in various health board areas, the notional 3 per cent employment figure is being met only in the case of specialist agencies.  The figure is not met by any health boards, barring the Southern Health Board of which I am a member. That did not happen by chance but as a result of our pursuing vigorously with the health board all matters relating to the employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The percentage of staff with disabilities in various areas are as follows: 0.49 per cent, Mid-Western Health Board; 0.41 per cent, South-Eastern Health Board; 0.092 per cent, voluntary hospitals; and 0.76 per cent, North-Eastern Health Board. As for the State sector itself, the figure is 0 per cent in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach while in other Departments the number of disabled people employed is extremely low.</P>
    <P>Some figures for local authorities include: 0.027 per cent, Westmeath County Council; 0 per cent, Longford County Council; 0.5 per cent, Kildare County Council; and 0.42 per cent, Carlow County Council.</P>
    <P>Listening to this debate the disabled will be aware that the Minister is introducing legislation to ease discrimination that applies to them in obtaining employment.  However, 80 per cent of people with disabilities are unemployed.  It is an extraordinary figure about which we have done nothing for years and past Governments must also share the blame.  The Minister cannot introduce legislation with an objective which other Ministers and Departments do not share.  The Minister must ensure far more interaction between what he hopes to achieve and the reality of what his Cabinet colleagues and their Departments are doing.</P>
    <P>Why are the Defence Forces exempt from the legislative provisions?  Of all groupings within the State sector one would have thought that Defence Force personnel need and deserve protection against discrimination.  In the overall context of the Bill it is ridiculous to omit them.  By the very nature of the Defence Force regime's regimentation, autocracy and authority, regulations to ensure its members are protected would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Earlier, the word &ldquo;paternalism&rdquo;, which is synonymous with autocracy, was mentioned.  Do those who look after our Defence Forces, including <Col N="977" /> the Naval Service, as well as the Garda Síochána and prison officers, still think they know what is best for those who work under them?  If the Minister is asking the private sector to ensure the legislation is taken on board, it is extraordinary that a major arm of the State is being excluded from the Bill's provisions.  It must sound ludicrous to them and ironic that it is allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>It is also ironic that the Bill outlaws sexual harassment but fails to outlaw homosexual harassment. There is a total imbalance there which should be re-examined by the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Indirect discrimination, which was touched on by Deputy Woods, concerns employers who often place requirements in a job advertisement which may appear innocuous but which make it far harder for certain sections of the population to obtain employment in such enterprises.  The age old example is the height requirement for applicants to the Garda Síochána.  This presupposed that if someone was not of a certain height they would not make a good garda.  It caused severe difficulties, particularly for female applicants.  We have all seen examples of such people who came through the interview system but were turned down on grounds of insufficient height at a medical examination.  Similar problems still exist in the private sector and the Minister should examine them.</P>
    <P>The undue hardship clause needs to be reviewed and facilities for people with disabilities need to be provided.  Health boards and local authorities are often remiss in providing proper access for the disabled to various offices.  The Minister is allowing a total-cop out for private sector employers who will be able to continue discrimination in the workplace against the very group the Minister is trying to protect.  It would be more appropriate for the Minister to accept the reasonable accommodation arrangements suggested in the NESF report on equality proofing.</P>
    <P>The medical model of disability is one of major controversy, and rightly so.  The provision in the Bill defeats its own purpose and will effectively outlaw a person who, for example, has had a nervous breakdown but who has completely recovered. During the week I was approached by someone who had suffered a nervous breakdown six years ago.  He had been open and honest about it but was convinced that the disclosure of his illness would prevent him from obtaining full-time employment.  The Minister should look at the section which allows a health witch-hunt in such cases.  Those provisions are extreme, unfair, unprogressive and should be reviewed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation. I support Deputy O'Keeffe's remarks about women in the home participating in community employment schemes.  While we determine access to those schemes in regard to the <Col N="978" /> long-term unemployed returning to work, I hope that under the terms of this legislation, various sections of which emphasise positive discrimination, it will be easy to provide flexibility to encourage and provide the necessary resources and back-up services to allow women in the home enter the workforce to a greater degree. However, one must be encouraged by the Labour Force Survey results published yesterday which reveal a new cohort of workers in the labour force.  The number employed has increased by 45,000 of which 33,000 are women and 12,000 are men.  There is almost a 4:1 ratio in the increase in employment in a gender specific area and that is welcome.  The existing measures are bringing women into the workforce.  However, most of the jobs created are in the service industry, a sector notorious for low pay and non-organisation in terms of trade unions.  That area must be carefully examined.</P>
      <P>This is fundamental legislation which has been a long time in gestation.  I regret that Deputy O'Keeffe's party did not see fit to introduce such legislation before now and that it took the Minister, Deputy Taylor, to put this Bill before the House.  I am glad there is all-party support for it. It has been long-standing policy, a key feature in our 1992 manifesto.  Our party leader, Deputy Spring, introduced a Private Members' Bill on this subject in 1990.  I regret it did not receive the support of Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats at that time.  While not wishing to harp on that, it is a telling point in view of the attacking remarks made by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, Dr. Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great number of positive aspects to the Bill.  It describes discrimination as the treatment of one person in a less favourable way than another.  It is simple and straightforward.  Nine distinct areas of discrimination are listed.  They include gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community. Those are broad areas where discrimination can occur and has been known to occur in the past.  The Minister should consider adding a further area to the list.  He indicated he will be happy to revisit sections on Committee Stage and I am sure he will welcome amendments.  The category of refugee should also be added to the list. In the past there has been considerable discrimination against refugees seeking asylum and once achieving refugee status many of them have found it difficult to get employment.  We have covered this area recently under the refugee legislation and there are specific measures dealing with employment in it.  However, as this is a type of consolidation legislation, I would welcome the inclusion of that category as one that is at risk and where discrimination has been known to occur in the past and could occur in the future, particularly as guidelines have been drawn up and there are statutory provisions dealing with granting asylum in terms of refugee status to people from other countries.  As more people in that category <Col N="979" /> will be coming into the country, we should ensure this fundamental legislation includes that category.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill is broad.  It outlaws discrimination by employers in regard to access to and conditions of employment, training and promotion and discrimination in relation to any collective agreement with regard to access to and conditions of employment and equal pay for equal work.</P>
    <P>It deals with the important aspect of advertising where any intention to discriminate could be adjudged.  It also deals with discrimination by an employment agency against any person seeking employment under its service.  It deals with discrimination in the provision of vocational training or instruction.  It also deals with discrimination by a vocational body whether a trade union, professional body or trade association.</P>
    <P>The provisions in regard to equality between men and women have been harped on widely during the debate.  They will bring us into line with European Union equal pay and equal treatment directives as well as strengthening and protecting the Employment Equality Act, 1977 which, contrary to what Deputy Woods said earlier, is not being weakened or undermined by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Equal pay for work of equal value must be a fundamental guiding principle, irrespective of sex or any other factor that acted as a discriminating measure in the past.  It must be a term of every employment contract and if it is excluded in any such contract it is deemed to be included.  The Bill codifies for the first time in Irish law indirect discrimination in terms of remuneration &mdash; a welcome first.  This is also the first time sexual harassment is defined in a Bill and incorporated into Irish law.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows an employer to put in place positive action measures to promote equal opportunities. This will be welcome in removing existing equalities which might affect women's access to employment opportunities or training.</P>
    <P>This is the first time in Irish law that a Bill extends protection to the Defence Forces.  Considering the extent of the controversy in Britain and the United States in this arena, it is welcome that protection is included.</P>
    <P>The Bill also allows for positive action in the non-gender sector through specifically providing for the integration into employment of those over 50, people with disabilities and members of the travelling community.  It outlaws harassment in the workforce on discriminatory grounds and in the course of employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill is broad-ranging, fundamental, has cross party support and is implementing and fulfilling the best international practice.  It will put us ahead in most areas.  We will be ahead of the United Kingdom and up to par with, if not ahead of, our European partners.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with savings and exclusions.  It provides that a person &ldquo;who engages in or has a <Col N="980" /> propensity to engage in any form of sexual behaviour to which an employer or any of the employer's employees, clients, customers or other business contacts might be at risk of exposure or might reasonably object will not be protected from discrimination in this legislation&rdquo;.  Perhaps this wording could be improved.  I am particularly concerned about the words &ldquo;any form of sexual behaviour to which an employer or any of the employer's employees&rdquo;.  An employer could employ thousands of people and any employee could object to the sexual behaviour of another employee.  Such behaviour would be difficult to monitor and the section could, therefore, be open to abuse.  This section refers to unwanted sexual behaviour but perhaps we should consider what is already deemed to be legal behaviour.  Perhaps the Minister could define the type of behaviour which would be exempt from the protection of the legislation.</P>
    <P>As a former secondary school teacher, I am concerned about section 37 which needs to be examined thoroughly.  The provisions in this section are subject to constitutional requirements which must be adhered to.  Section 37 refers to employment by &ldquo;religious, educational and medical institutions run by religious bodies where discrimination is essential to maintain the religious ethos of the institution or is reasonable to avoid offending members&rdquo;.  It is difficult to draft legislation for individual members.  If I am a member of a religious community, I could be offended by the behaviour of someone looking for employment and whose sexual behaviour might be deemed to be a sin under my religious teaching.  Such a person could lose the job, irrespective of their ability to do it, because they offended a member.  It is another matter as to whether that person is entitled to be employed in other circumstances. The phrase, &ldquo;to avoid offending members&rdquo;, is too wide and it will make this provision difficult to implement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's suggestion that he will consider amendments on Committee Stage.  The teachers' organisations are concerned about the religious ethos because the vast majority of people employed in education are from one denomination.  It would, therefore, limit the scope for employment in terms of equal opportunities if the net is cast too widely in section 37.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about employment in the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána or prison service in so far as discrimination on grounds of age or disability are concerned.  I am glad that discrimination on grounds of gender or sexual orientation, which has occurred in other countries, is not included.  That puts us ahead of other countries which are experiencing difficulties in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is important to provide resources and support to eliminate discrimination.  One of the major obstacles facing women who want to rejoin the workforce, for example, is the absence of créches.  If there are no places where children can <Col N="981" /> be looked after, it will be a huge obstacle for women who want to go back to work.  Although it may not be the Minister's responsibility, he should discuss it with the relevant Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which will benefit the workforce and other people who should not be discriminated against.  When this legislation is passed, it will not only bring us into line with the rest of Europe and the United States, it will fulfil our international requirements and pave the way for good practice in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  We have come a long way in the past quarter of a century in relation to anti-discrimination legislation.  Many people, particularly women, could legitimately claim we have not come far enough or quickly enough and that their feeling of second class citizenship is still not without foundation.  The events of the last few weeks, particularly the recent performance of the Minister for Health in this House, must once more cause women to question how much they are valued by the Government and society as a whole.  Such events cast a shadow over the view women have of themselves and their value to society.  I do not propose to rehash all the events leading up to the appointment of a tribunal of inquiry or indeed the disgraceful comments of the Minister for Health, but how can people have confidence in the Government to deliver equality when individual Ministers seem to have no concept of the principle?</P>
      <P>The Minister has defined nine areas of discrimination in the Bill.  I do not propose to repeat them, but I note he has left out the most important and widespread category discriminated against, people who, having returned to the workforce through economic necessity, are made pawns of in the most cynical fashion and used as cheap labour because they cannot afford to complain. There is nothing in the Bill to relieve their distress.  Is the Minister aware where the real discrimination lies in society?  There are thousands of workers, mainly women, who daily suffer the most humiliating experience, surrendering their labour for a pittance, knowing that their economic necessity is being exploited.  The aspirations of the Bill are acceptable.  Its deficiency lies not in what is included but in what is omitted.  Without the will and the means to take positive action, its provisions are simply waffle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is sufficient legislation to ensure that women, including married women returning to work, are given a fair deal and are not subjected to blatant economic discrimination.  It is obvious that there is lack of will to take action and of resources to ensure that is done.  The Minister may not know what I am talking about and may not be prepared to accept what is going on, but low paid workers who depend on their supplementary income will readily identify with what I am saying.  They do not enjoy security of employment, are denied access to unions and when they are dismissed for questioning their <Col N="982" /> treatment they continue to be harassed and intimidated by employers in a manner which is almost impossible to prove.  Their miserable wage keeps the home fires burning so they grit their teeth and get on with life.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker, Deputy Costello, alluded to low pay for women, particularly in the service sector and the tourism industry.  It is no surprise that when there are, supposedly, many more people working, a large number of them are women.  Many of the jobs created in the service sector and the tourism industry are notoriously low paid jobs and, unfortunately, there is a huge turnover of staff in those areas.  There is nothing in the Bill to outlaw the practice of paying women approximately £120 per week and in many cases much less.  Theoretically, they can refuse to be part of such a system, but with dependent families they have few choices.  There is a long queue of women waiting to take over, whose only employment prospect is low paid work.  It is all right to talk about lofty principles, but if there is discrimination against women all the legislation in the world will not help unless it is properly implemented.</P>
    <P>I would be a hypocrite if I did not welcome this and any other equality legislation that comes before the House.  This measure is, however, typical of much of the legislation the Government has introduced.  It suffers from what I would describe as the 3D syndrome: it is defective, delayed and deficient.  I am prepared to give the Bill a cautious welcome on the grounds that some of its provisions are beneficial.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with the provision under section 9 to outlaw the practice of discrimination in the matter of remuneration where two people do exactly the same work but receive a different financial reward.  I hope the Minister gave a copy of this Bill to his party and Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Education, who presides over a position where school secretaries who are jobsharing, for which they waited years, are paired with substitutes who are paid substantially less than their permanent colleagues.  Worse still, the wrong is perpetrated under the guise of training by State agencies.  That practice brings the Minister and her Department into disrepute. It is blatant discrimination.  I raised this matter with the Minister for Education earlier this year and her lame reply was that if the school was interested in equality in the case of these employees, who are mainly women, it could make up the difference in remuneration, which she is not prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>That is not a great commitment to equality.  It rings very hollow against the background of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, which, if I remember correctly, was introduced by a previous Labour Minister who was subsequently leader of that party.  The day of the yellow-pack job in the Department of Education has apparently arrived and, according to the Minister, is here to stay.  Perhaps the Minister for Equality and Law Reform will take up this matter with his <Col N="983" /> colleague, the Minister for Education, to see if the practice over which she presides is legal.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that an employer may not be required to promote an individual who is not fully competent to undertake the duties attached to a particular position.  It does not, however, specify how an individual may be deemed not to be fully competent to do a job for which he or she presents themselves.  It may be difficult to prove.</P>
    <P>I welcome the definition in section 23 of sexual harassment.  In the present climate, with the large number of claims of harassment and the possibility that there are many cases yet uncovered, it is necessary to define sexual harassment and address the subject generally.  Without getting bogged down in the details, I wonder if the Minister has his As and Bs in proper order in terms of this section.  This is a matter which may be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 26 excludes pregnancy and maternity from the grounds on which discrimination may not be practised.  That is not only reasonable but necessary.  I would ask the Minister to consider going further by giving the same status to a proposal by an employer to grant paternity leave. While I realise this is not yet a common feature of the social fabric, there are employers who may wish to grant such a right to those who have just become fathers.  It would be unacceptable, however, for the remaining employees to demand similar leave entitlements without qualifying as parents.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for redress in discrimination cases in that it envisages the appointment of a statutory officer of equality investigations.  The appointment of equality mediation officers is a very important part of the process and will be a welcome addition to the provisions already in place.  In the case of previous appointments to agencies, the necessary resources were not made available even to start the work, let alone make a genuine contribution to the process.  I trust the Minister will properly resource the new agency and that the director will not have to type reports because of lack of staff.  If this new measure is to achieve worthwhile goals it must be given every opportunity to work.  I welcome the provision for independent officers of the State to police the new measure, thereby creating a reasonable possibility of prosecuting cases under the legislation. I look forward to seeing how the legislation will be implemented in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate and compliment the Minister on bringing the Bill forward. This is an important discussion in which there have been some good contributions and out of which many new ideas will come.  I have no doubt that the Minister will be amenable to accepting whatever amendments backbenchers feel should be made, although many will not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is &mdash; and has been &mdash; extremely concerned for a long time about equality in the <Col N="984" /> workplace, an issue about which I have often spoken to him.  I have no doubt that he will receive the full support of the Cabinet, the Minister for Health in particular.  From experience, there has been no more caring Minister for Health since I entered public life.  He has visited my constituency on a number of occasions to give his time to the less fortunate, for whom he has shown consideration.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the three sections in Part IV dealing with the rights of women, people with disabilities and workers.  On the rights of women in the workplace, according to reports in today's newspapers at the time of the last census there were 488,000 women in the workforce, an all-time record.  I am delighted with this.  Approximately 37,000 of these entered the workplace in the 12 months up to April this year, a tribute to the efforts of the Government.</P>
    <P>Women have proven themselves in many fields. The President is a shining light and carries the torch for women worldwide for which she is to be commended and respected.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday I attended the women's All-Ireland football final between Monaghan and Laois in Croke Park.  I also attended the drawn game.  It was an excellent game of the highest standard, unlike the two games played between the men of Meath and Mayo who could learn much from the women concerned.  It was first class entertainment and highly skilful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Monaghan ladies on their great victory and hope they had a celebration. Five years ago, perhaps less, there would not have been more than 100 people present.  Last Sunday there were over 17,000 in attendance, most of them men, who were there to pay tribute to the skill and sportsmanship of the ladies concerned.</P>
      <P>If a woman wants to stay at home to mind her family she should not be looked upon as someone who has failed and, likewise, the woman in the workplace should not be looked upon as someone who does not want to mind her family in the home.  Both have a role to play in society.  If a family is fortunate enough to be able to support the home without the woman having to enter the workplace, she is extremely lucky.</P>
      <P>There is a case to be made for granting recognition to the woman in the home whose work in tending the family is never seen.  It was Garret FitzGerald who came up with the idea of a weekly payment of £9.50 but this never materialised. Many women were happy with this proposal, it would have been useful pocket money for the women concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be sufficient flexibility to allow the woman in the workplace to spend as much time as possible with her family.  The last thing I want to do is hurt women in the workplace but the role of the mother in the upbringing of children <Col N="985" /> cannot be overstated, it is more important now than ever.  A system should be put in place &mdash; flexitime or special leave &mdash; to allow this to happen provided it is not abused.  While it has to be recognised that there is a need for continuity from the point of view of the employer, this aspect must be looked at to ensure that the woman in the workplace will have an opportunity to spend as much time as possible with her family, especially her young children during the years when the influence of the mother is so important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the need to provide crèche facilities.  While I accept that those who care for the children of working mothers do an excellent job, a mother cannot be replaced. This should be borne in mind if our society is to develop with the family at its centre.</P>
    <P>The reason many women feel they have to work is that the cost of providing a home is spiralling. In many instances it is not possible to meet the cost of a mortgage with only one bread-winner. More than any other race, Irish people like to own their own property.  I am totally opposed to residential property tax.  It is outrageous that those who aspire to owning their own home should be penalised in this way, rather they should be encouraged and compensated.  In many instances a second income is necessary.  I have no objection to a wife who is either career-minded or feels she has to work being in the workplace but the role of the woman in the home is equally important.</P>
    <P>All the voluntary organisations dealing with people with disabilities or a mental handicap will accept that tremendous progress has been made. The regulations state that 3 per cent of places in the public sector must be reserved for people with disabilities.  By and large, local authorities and semi-State bodies have complied with this regulation. I am not sure whether there is a similar regulation governing the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector.  While more and more people with disabilities are entering the workplace, problems are still being encountered. If the person with the disability experiences difficulty in gaining access to the workplace, the job will not be available to him or her.  Much work needs to be done in providing convenient parking areas, ramps, lifts and suitable toilet facilities for people with disabilities.  Such measures would not be costly but they are extremely important.  In many cases these facilities are not available simply through an oversight.</P>
    <P>Another important point concerns the floor covering in the workplace.  Many outer door entrances and exits are extremely dangerous for people with disabilities.  The design may look attractive with perhaps marble around the doorway but that can become extremely slippery and pose a great danger to people on crutches or in wheelchairs.  Floor coverings with a certain amount of grip, such as carpeting, should be used so that people with disabilities can feel confident and maintain their integrity in the workplace.  I know the Minister will take note of these points.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> On the question of the rights of workers, a prolonged strike over a number of small issues occurred in my county recently in an industry which offered good employment and excellent wages.  The business concerned employs approximately 500 people; I do not intend to name it because the strike was settled and the business was saved.  Those workers did picket duty despite being reasonably happy with their employment and conditions of work.  The strike came about because the workers were not fully involved with their union.  Shop stewards in the factory decided to call a strike.  Approximately 30 members of the workforce dictated to the other 500 how they should act.  The workers went out on strike against their will and continued for almost three months.  It may be difficult to believe that could be the case but it happened.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the role of the media in strikes. Reporting by the local media in my county on the strike I mentioned was balanced and constructive. After several pleas to the workers to be courageous and defy the people who were dictating to them, the industry was saved.</P>
    <P>Workers must be fully informed of what is happening in the workplace.  The majority of them want to work and if the working conditions and wages are reasonable, they will be satisfied. Unfortunately other people want to pursue their own agenda and become known as persons who can force the pace.  A lesson was learned in the case I have mentioned and an industry was saved.</P>
    <P>Workers can become too complacent.  They elect somebody to represent them and leave it to that individual to do their business for them.  That is not good enough.  In every walk of life people must ensure the representation they are getting is what they want.  They must not allow themselves be dictated to by a handful of individuals with an interest in climbing the union ladder at the expense of workers who may be cast aside.</P>
    <P>The points I have made are important to me.  I have every confidence the Bill will be of major benefit and will ensure that people get fair entitlement to jobs they are seeking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Since passing the Employment Equality Act, 1977 Ireland has taken great steps forward in the provision of equality legislation. The Employment Equality Agency has been efficient and effective in the way it has realised the law and superintended its implementation. The Employment Equality Bill is to be welcomed in that it has the best of intentions and contains some welcome provisions.  However, it fails to address the key employment issues of concern to people with disabilities.  This area has been raised by many speakers in the debate.  The Bill does not contain any adequate measures to help people with disabilities overcome exclusion from employment opportunities which has led to the unemployment rate of 80 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers raised the issue of the 3 per cent quota of people with disabilities in the public service.  Deputy Batt O'Keeffe pointed out this <Col N="987" /> morning that the Departments of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste do not employ any people with disabilities.  There is a general requirement to have a 3 per cent quota, and some Departments have an excellent record in this regard, but Departments are not obliged to adhere to it.  The Government seems to hold the view that if there is a general 3 per cent quota it does not matter that the Departments of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste do not employ any people with disabilities. That is wrong.  It behoves the Minister to ensure that every Department employs a minimum of 3 per cent of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the health boards and the local authorities.  Health boards and local authorities are not obliged to implement the 3 per cent quota.  That is wrong when one considers that the health boards provide many of the medical treatment services to people with disabilities. Each local authority and health board should be obliged to employ 3 per cent of people with disabilities. I agree with other Members who stated that the private sector should employ a minimum of 3 per cent of people with disabilities.  That would ensure true equality in employment.</P>
    <P>The consolidation and extension of equality law is welcome but following a delay of three and a half years the Government should have produced a Bill which would deal effectively with the obvious problems confronting people with disabilities. It is intended that the Bill will introduce a ban on discrimination on the basis of disability. That is commendable but there is no specific provision to help this to become a practical reality.</P>
    <P>Many of the proposals in the Bill are fine in theory but what will the Government do to ensure they are implemented?  It is not good enough to pass a law saying that all people must have access to employment if one has no way of getting into or around the workplace itself.  The savings and exclusions section of the Bill is symptomatic of this misguided attitude.  In section 16 (1) (b) the Bill states that there is no employment obligation if the individual concerned is unable to carry out the duties attached to the position.  The section says: &ldquo;having regard to the conditions under which those duties are, or may be required to be, performed&rdquo;.  In other words, if facilities are not there to accommodate a person with a disability, the employer is off the hook.  The individual is then condemned to an existence on welfare. That is not good enough and the elements of the Bill dealing with this are not strong enough.  This element will have to be approached again because people were hoping to see some type of positive action and reality in the Bill in regard to accessing the workplace.</P>
    <P>A total of 80 per cent of disabled people are unemployed because of the inaccessibility of the workplace, not because of their disability.  This Bill does nothing to ensure that will change in practice.  All international experience shows that one must include a framework of positive action if disability legislation is to be effective.  This <Col N="988" /> would deal with adapting buildings, provision of accessible transport and a balance between public and private responsibility.  The Minister cannot simply wave a legislative wand and hope the Bill will magically eradicate the gross inequity that has left a huge proportion of people with disabilities unemployed.  In itself, the legislation is not enough.</P>
    <P>The same objection arises in relation to section 16 (3) which states that a person who has a disability shall be considered fully competent to undertake any duties &ldquo;if, with the assistance of special treatment or facilities, that person would be so fully competent or capable&rdquo;.  Is there any chance of this provision being effective in the absence of a framework for positive action?</P>
    <P>The Minister can promise the earth, moon and stars to these people but without funding and enforcement the Bill is likely to exist in theory but to be of no great value in practice to people who want something to happen.  Perhaps the Minister would consider a straightforward tax incentive for employers to assist them in the provision of the special facilities mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 35 (4) (b) provides, <i>inter alia</i> that the Bill does not apply to discrimination on the disability ground if special facilities would be needed to undertake employment, the cost of which &ldquo;would give rise to undue hardship to the employer&rdquo;.  This was mentioned by other speakers but clearly &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo; runs contrary to the concept of reasonable accommodation.  It is open to the widest possible interpretation and offers a handy opt out clause to employers lacking the will to accommodate people with disabilities. It also absolves the Government of any responsibility for the provision of meaningful funding in this area, as other speakers mentioned. If the Bill was to provide for positive action in access to buildings, transport and education there would be far less discrimination for the Equality Authority to deal with.  We are not giving enough teeth to the Bill when we establish the Equality Authority and as a result there will be numerous cases before it.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate here on the social versus the medical aspect of definition and it is very important.  The definition in section 2 of the Bill gives considerable offence to people with disabilities. For many it is not just offensive but far too complicated.  The addition of disability as a new area of competence within employment equality legislation is welcome but it is crucial that it is brought into that remit in a sensitive way.  The social model of disability envisages the removal of disability as a description for many people by the proper provision in workplaces of facilities such as ramps.  A person is only disabled, in many instances, because there may be stairs in the way or a lack of pedestrian crossings or transport facilities.  The social model of disability is aimed at preventing thousands of people from being described as disabled in relation to employment. Unfortunately, the Bill uses the medical <Col N="989" /> model of disability.  It is an insensitive and unfortunate misconception which further marginalises the issue and reinforces prejudices among employers and members of the public.</P>
    <P>I also seek the Minister's commitment to reassess the working of the legislation relating to section 37 (6), which concerns the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and the prison services. This has also been mentioned by other speakers. There is no conceivable reason that a host of administrative and other duties carried on in these services should not be scrutinised as other employers might be.  With a little more imagination, these services could take a lead in accommodating people with disabilities within their staffs.</P>
    <P>Another concern with the Bill is how it affects women.  There are ongoing barriers to recruitment and to State-run training schemes faced by women in the home as well as continuing low rates of pay.  Deputy Kenneally spoke on the issue of low pay for women.  Those in the private sector face low pay but there are also examples of low pay for women working for the State. Women in the home help service are paid £1.45 per hour.</P>
    <P>These issues must be addressed with positive action.  The Employment Equality Agency has done an excellent job to date on the gender element of employment equality.  We are changeing it to the State's Equality Authority.  It must cover all equality issues and has new responsibilities concerning people with disabilities, of different ethnic origins, etc.  However, the Authority has not been given advance funding for this and there is no recognition of the need for additional staffing and research.  There is one very basic problem with the Equality Authority taking over the area of disability in that the existing building is inaccessible.  The minute the legislation is passed and people with disabilities attempt to contact the new Authority, they will be unable to access the existing building.  The Minister said we must wait until the legislation passes before providing funds but as soon as the legislation is passed people with disabilities will telephone the Employment Equality Agency and expect it to understand what they are talking about.  They will want to access that building. These are immediate practical problems.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights is researching the existing position of the Employment Equality Agency, its future role as the Equality Authority and how it addresses equality for women.  The committee contacted the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, suggesting research be carried out by his Department on areas outside the committee's remit.  It is essential that this takes place now as this Bill will pass, even though it needs a lot of work.  We need to identify how adequate funding and resources can be provided to the agency for the transition period before the legislation comes into operation.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this again.  If there is a lack of funding and commitment from <Col N="990" /> the Government on implementation of elements of the Bill, then we are talking about what may be good in theory for women, people with disabilities and other groups, but we may be going nowhere.  We need positive action and practical reality instead of theory that is no good in reality.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is passed, the Employment Equality Agency will be responsible for implementing it.  I want the Minister to announce today that he intends to allocate a certain amount of money to the agency to enable it to research its new role and begin its work.  It is necessary also that the agency should move to a new building. We cannot support a position where the equality authority of the State continues to operate in an inaccessible building when it has to deal with people with disabilities.  All of this needs to be addressed now.  It will be a bit late when the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>It has taken three and a half years to produce the Bill and the process is not over yet.  We will be bringing forward amendments, especially with regard to the element of positive action as opposed to what we might like to see in theory.</P>

      <P>It is customary in this House to begin one's contribution with the phrase &ldquo;I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate&rdquo;.  This phrase is as much a courtesy as it is a useful entry into a speech, but not on this occasion.  I am delighted to speak on this Bill.  I am delighted it is before this House, and I am delighted but not surprised that it has been introduced by a member of my own party, Deputy Taylor, Minister for Equality and Law Reform. This Department is only a new one, but in its short life it has done more to update our civil laws than any other body in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>There are those who say that Bills like this are not important, that the public do not get excited about them.  Perhaps that is so.  However, Bills like this are essential to confirm our standing in the wider world.  After the implementation of this Bill and the Equal Status Bill Irish men and women will be able to hold their heads up high in the best of foreign company.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the passing of this Bill will place Ireland among the most open and pluralist states in Europe.  With the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the correct decision by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn regarding the age of consent for gay people, this Bill will do more for Ireland's international reputation on human rights than any Bill before it.  By making it illegal to discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation in the military, the Minister will succeed in going one step further than a President of the United States who is about to be re-elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people suggest that Bills like these represent a victory for liberals over traditional Catholic values.  This is not the case.  They represent a victory for tolerance over authoritarianism, for inclusion over divisiveness.  In his speech the Minister outlined a brief history of equality legislation. <Col N="991" /> Those involved were no mere liberals. They have been socially concerned people, if not socialists, and their concern has not only been for individual freedoms but the welfare of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>We have made huge progress since another Labour Minister introduced the first Employment Equality Act over two decades ago but we still have a long way to go.  The Minister outlined a number of instances in which discrimination continues to take place.  While reports like the EU Labour Force Survey of 1989 are welcome, they only confirm what we already know.  The Minister has led the way in addressing the issues of gender equality.  His establishment of a gender quota on State boards is a purposeful attempt to address the absence of women at decision-making levels. I welcome the improvement of 11 per cent in terms of representation by women on State boards from 15 per cent to 26 per cent, but I urge the Minister to press ahead to achieve the stated goal of 40 per cent.  He is right to suggest that there are few people who can justify active discrimination. That does not mean these measures are not being put into practice.  On the contrary, the evidence suggests that they are, and as more and more women come into the labour market the effect of this distorting practice increases and the problems it causes grow all the more.</P>
    <P>I welcome too the emphasis the Minister has placed on addressing discrimination by age.  This is an important issue which has become considerably greater following the decline in employment opportunities in the 1980s.  Although we have thankfully turned that particular corner, I suspect that the continued young profile of our labour force continues to facilitate discrimination against those of more mature years.  Nobody should underestimate the impact on an individual who is told that she or he can no longer contribute actively to the welfare of their own families or society at large.  The Minister is correct to point out that the real losers from this kind of discrimination are employers.  By overlooking somebody of mature years, somebody who is a traveller or somebody who is disabled they often overlook somebody who could make a huge contribution to their enterprise.  This kind of employment practice which has increased of late is a further indication of the short-term perspective of many employers today and reflects a problem which goes beyond a just discrimination.  Traditionally, we have had difficulties in implementing our equality and labour legislation.  I welcome the establishment of a Director of Equality Investigations to ensure that people who suffer discrimination have as simple a recourse to law as possible.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the contribution of Deputy Michael Woods to this debate and I welcome his party's conversion to the equality cause. Deputy Woods raised a number of points.  In effect, his contribution represented a piecing together of various press statements by interest <Col N="992" /> groups.  There is, of course, nothing wrong with that if one understands the purpose of the Bill.  I listened to Deputy Woods's criticism of section 37.  I have my reservations about it too, but I am honest enough to recognise that we are bound by the Constitution.  Are Deputies Woods and Ahern prepared to sponsor an amendment to the Constitution to remove the constitutional protection for denominational education?  Is this what they will do if returned to office?  Could this be why so many of their rural Deputies are no longer keen to carry the Fianna Fáil flag in the forthcoming election?</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods objected to the definition of equality in the Bill.  This says more about his lack of understanding of the Bill than anything else. The Minister has already apologised for the delay in publishing the explanatory memorandum.  It would appear that Deputy Woods has suffered substantially for its absence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods complains that the definition used by the Minister applies to everybody.  Why should it not?  Surely that is the purpose of the Bill.  Who would Deputy Woods exclude if ever Fianna Fáil got round to producing an Equality Bill of any kind?  As Deputy Costello has already stated, if Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were so interested in legislation of this kind, why did they vote down my party's Private Member's Bill almost seven years ago?</P>
    <P>Similarly, Deputy Woods states that we are changing the legal definition of discrimination under the 1977 Employment Equality Act.  From my reading of Deputy Woods's contribution, it seems that what we are doing is confirming in statute what is already the position in common law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods raises concerns about section 64.  Here he is on firmer ground.  I recognise the necessity for the section.  There are forms of sexual behaviour to which this Act should not apply. I do not need to spell them out here.  However, this section would be considerably strengthened if the Minister were to accept an amendment which differentiated between legal and illegal sexual activity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh said her party will support the legislation.  No doubt it will do so grudgingly, as it has grudgingly supported any regulatory measures in the labour market. Deputy Keogh would do well to enunciate more strongly at meetings of her parliamentary party, her concern for groups who find themselves on the margins of society.  The Progressive Democrats cannot have it both ways; they cannot ask for measures to protect people with disabilities or the less well off while seeking to cut the guts out of the social support system. As the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, said in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, if we are serious about these issues there is a case for more and not less social spending.  The Progressive Democrats are against such an option and that is their choice.  Deputy Keogh should spare us the crocodile tears.  They are wasted on Deputy <Col N="993" /> McDowell and Deputy Harney so she has no business shedding them here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is complex legislation and no doubt there is room for improvement.  To that end I welcome the Minister's commitment to view amendments with an open mind.  He has done so in the past and it has led to improved legislation.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím go ginearálta roimh an Bille seo ach caithfidh mé cúpla ceist a chur.  An mbainfidh mórán daoine tairbhe as?  Cén fiúntas atá ann do dhaoine nach bhfuil ag fáil cothrom na féinne in a gcuid fostaíochta i láthair na huaire?  An bhfuil Achtanna Oireachtais ann cheana nach bhfuil ag obair go maith?  Cén difríocht a dhéanfaidh an Bille seo?</P>
      <P>There is widespread acceptance, which has existed for some time, of the need for this legislation. A number of speakers have complained that despite such acceptance the legislation has not been introduced until now.  Nobody knows better than the Minister how difficult it is to frame legislation which successfully addresses the issues at hand which is constitutional, workable and manageable.  It is generally accepted that the Minister has made a decent attempt to fulfil those criteria in this Bill.  The Minister appreciates the views of Members who have referred to possible difficulties with the Bill.  In my experience he has been willing to accommodate, if possible, the views expressed on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>One reason for introducing the Bill is the need to ratify EU and UN conventions and agreements. I sometimes take a jaundiced view of their interventions in State affairs.  Sometimes they are positive but sometimes they are daft.  Their effect can be to undermine rather than support and in many instances they are unsuccessful and do not work for the good of society.  On this occasion, in so far as they have spurred us to take action, they are welcome and the outcome will be positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having conceded that the Minister had a difficult job in framing this legislation, we must ask if it will work.  Will it do the enormously difficult job for which it is drafted?  Is legislation the best way to do that job?  The need to introduce this type of legislation is sadly well established.  It has been the experience of every Member of the House, as has been clearly enunciated by several speakers, that there are appalling examples of mistreatment of employees and inequality in the treatment of employees in certain sectors of employment.  We must attempt to address the problem.  However, we must also ask if legislation will be the most effective means of doing so.  We have conceded that it must be part of the means. It is only reasonable and proper that the parameters regarding equality and other issues addressed by the Bill should be clearly set out. However, it would be a great mistake to believe that just because that has been done, even if it is in the most effective way possible, it will be enough.  We will discover that it is not.  We will <Col N="994" /> have to be prepared to invest substantial State resources in supporting the legislation.  Previous speakers have referred to that.</P>
    <P>Members of the House have often made the mistake of thinking that because we have enshrined certain principles in legislation and established them as targets to be achieved, they will be achieved automatically.  It will most assuredly not happen on this occasion.  While it is agreed that the aims of the legislation are worthy, people who have encountered practicalities in this regard will have a nagging doubt that legislating for such principles will be enough.  Resources and more than just bodies must be put in place. The Minister proposes as much and intends to create new positions.  I have sympathy for the people who will fill those positions.  Their work will be extremely important and we must concede that we have been slow to recognise the need for that work.  Despite the fact that each Member is aware of issues which ought to have been and could have been dealt with, we were not able to do it.  It was not always simply because the legislation was inadequate.  More frequently it was because the resources were not available.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the forthcoming report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  We look forward to it with considerable interest.  I have no difficulty in confessing that had I not been approached by people working in that area and by people with disabilities, I would not be as well informed about the difficulties they encounter in their daily lives. I would also not be as willing to come to the House and declare that their difficulties ought to be addressed.  Indeed, I would not be sufficiently informed to do so.  That is probably common to all Members of the House although perhaps not every Member would admit as much.</P>
    <P>The Minister has great commitment in that area and is probably somewhat embarrassed when Members of the Opposition press him for the publication of the report.  However, both in this House and in society there is greater understanding and commitment to doing something worthwhile and far reaching for people with disabilities. There is also a slow realisation that many people with disabilities have as much, and perhaps more, to contribute than those who are fortunate to be able bodied.  I am glad my job has given me the opportunity to meet people with disabilities and to appreciate what they have to contribute.  I look forward to the publication of the report.  In so far as this legislation addresses problems encountered by people with disabilities, I welcome it, despite my doubts about it necessarily being successful.</P>
    <P>Tourism is one of my areas of responsibility in Fianna Fáil.  A number of speakers have referred to the appalling pay and conditions in some areas of the services sector and the tourism industry.  It is a fact and a scandal.  The people who suffer as a result of such conditions and appallingly low wages are, by and large, women.  Sadly, almost all <Col N="995" /> of them are working in such jobs not from choice but because they must support their families.</P>
    <P>It is notoriously difficult for the State to intervene in this area and to enact legislation which effectively deals with the problem.  The more I have raised the matter by way of parliamentary question the more I have become aware of the inadequacies of the system.  As late as yesterday a question I had put down to the Minister for Tourism and Trade was transferred to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton.  The answer sets out how poorly equipped we are to deal with the difficulties in that area.  He said among other things that where disputes arise the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are available to the parties.  It is very fine for all of us in the House to know that but for the people who have difficulties that is virtually of no advantage. Under various industrial relations Acts from 1946 to 1990 he informs me that trade unions or other organisations claiming to represent a category of workers may make application to the Labour Court for the establishment of a joint labour committee, known as a JLC.  That is in place and it ought to be able to address the problems.  The essential point I am making is that many strong provisions already exist of which people are aware but they are not working.</P>
    <P>The function of the JLC is to draw up proposals for fixing the minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for the workers involved.  The proposals are submitted to the Labour Court and are confirmed through the making of an employment regulation order which governs the statutory minimum pay and conditions of employment for the workers concerned. That is a good start and it has established the benchmark but in practice this procedure is not readily open to workers in individual premises. I was surprised to learn there are three JLCs in operation which impact on tourism related employment, two cover the catering area and the third covers hotels.  In the case of the hotel JLC Cork city, Dublin city and Dun Laoghaire are not included.  I do not represent those areas but I am surprised they are not included in something which is important to their pay and conditions.  A labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise and Employment enforces these requirements.  The Minister said: &ldquo;In the final analysis any decision to set up a JLC or to extend the remit of a committee would rest with the Labour Court&rdquo;.  While the system in place appears to be a good one we all know it is not working particularly well.</P>
    <P>I hope the enactment of this legislation will go some way towards addressing the problem but I am not confident.  When the legislation is in place I hope that will not be the end of it, that there will be an active pursuit of its aims and objectives and that the resources will be in place to ensure it is enforced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> A matter which has come to my attention is the type of accommodation which is made available, particularly to young people who work away from home in the hotel sector.  In some instances the accommodation is truly appalling.  I do not know how exactly that should be addressed, under what legislation or under the aegis of what Minister. Certainly it is an area where equality is not extended to a particular element of the workforce, be they male or female, but generally they are female.  They are vulnerable people and in some cases are working appallingly long hours. Part of the excuse is that accommodation is provided. Surely some minimum standards in relation to accommodation should be in place. Regular inspection is an absolute prerequisite. This matter is of grave concern since I have become aware of its extent.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the difficulties married women encounter when they try to return to the workforce.  It is an area which is difficult for the women involved and there are many reasons for this.  Besides the lack of opportunity many married women say that having been out of the workforce for eight, ten or 12 years they have a difficulty in terms of their own confidence about returning to employment.  Virtually all of them feel the Houses of the Oireachtas and people in power pay no more than lip service to their position. I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to do much more than is proposed in the Bill but he will have been impressed by the number of people on all sides who have been prepared to draw attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>On the issue of women working and the conditions under which they work, we need to realise that a substantial number of women in the workforce would prefer to be in the home at a particular time in their lives but they do not have that opportunity because of the economic reality for their family.  Likewise many women who would like to have the opportunity to work part time or full time are confined to the home because the conditions of employment which might be available to them are simply unacceptable.  There are two sides to the issue: those who are working and those who are not working, both of whom are at an equal disadvantage and equally dissatisfied with their situation.  It would be a great boost to them and the country in a great many ways if the matter could be addressed.  I accept the Minister has not much leeway to go further than he has gone on this occasion.  More than anyone else on the Government side I look to him with confidence to address this issue.  However difficult it may be and however impossible one may consider the obstacles it is a difficulty for a large number of people and one which could hardly be beyond the ingenuity of the State to address over a period.</P>
    <P>I am interested in an EU statute of 1980, SI No. 306 dealing with the protection of employment and the transfer of undertakings legislation. I think it was subsequently enacted here.  Under this legislation people who are employed by a <Col N="997" /> company which is carrying out a contract have a right to transfer to a new company which is successful in gaining that contract when it comes up for renewal.  It appears that the statutory instruments and the legislation are in place but there are examples where it has not worked.  A recent example in my area involved the air, sea and rescue service where a UK company was successful in winning the contract previously held by Irish Helicopters.  In that example the end result was favourable and the workers who are specialist people were taken on by the new company.</P>
    <P>There was one previous occasion in regard to the contract in the Celtic fields where people who were equally specialised were not taken on by the new company.  When they sought the protection of the legislation of this country they found either that it was not adequate, that it did not do what it was required to do or that an employer could with impunity ignore it.  At the end of their period of employment these people are hardly in a position to pursue a big multinational company through the courts.  When I raised the matter earlier in the year by means of a parliamentary question that is what I was told.  Despite the fact that this legislation is in place and that these workers have certain rights in relation to the new contract &mdash; which in this instance happens to be a State contract &mdash; the only way they could ensure they have that right is by going through the courts through a very expensive and long drawn out process which they could not afford.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, on the last occasion the company opted to take on these people.  In future more people with specialised knowledge will be employed on a contract basis over a period of three-five years.  Many people will have to move to different areas and acquire accommodation, thereby incurring substantial expenses.  If the company is unsuccessful at the end of the contract period these people will have much less protection than I have been led to believe or the legislation would lead one to believe.  This relates to my earlier comments about the real protection offered by legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at this area.  He may say he cannot accommodate it in this Bill but he will have future opportunities to deal with it.  I wish him well with the equal status legislation.  I am sure that, like me, he has received conflicting recommendations from different groups, but he will find a way of dealing with all these concerns. I have also received representations on the Unfair Dismissals Act and I might take these up directly with the Minister.  While the judgments in the vast majority of cases are sensible and justified, there are undoubtedly some vexatious ones. Many employers believe employees who take cases are guaranteed some payout as otherwise the legal team will go without.  This perception may be unfair but it needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is a huge number of women in the teaching profession, yet there are very few female school principals.  I do not have time to deal with this issue as the Chair wishes me to conclude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have been waiting a long time for the introduction of this Bill which was always &ldquo;just about&rdquo; to be published. I congratulate the Minister and his officials for introducing legislation which is an important marker on the road to ensuring equal opportunities. The equal status legislation is another important aspect in our attempts and work over a long time to ensure that equal opportunities become part of the mainstream of life.</P>
      <P>I welcome the vision shown in extending protection in employment to many different groups and, in particular, to minority groups.  Many people believe minority groups are well protected but their experience is hidden and it is very difficult for their members to articulate what is happening to them.  There have been some changes and these experiences are coming into the open to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes a clear statement on the Government's approach to discrimination.  It states that employers cannot discriminate on the grounds of sex, marital or family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  These incredibly important provisions affect a huge number of people in many ways.  The Bill sets a standard for the treatment of all people in employment and clearly states that discrimination will not be tolerated.  The introduction of this legislation is the mark of a developed democracy.</P>
      <P>This long awaited Bill puts us to the forefront in Europe in terms of equality legislation.  We must ensure it takes us forward in all the areas it addresses.  I hope the Minister will be open to considering the concerns expressed about the legislation.  Some groups have expressed concern about ambiguities in the Bill and these must be teased out on Committee Stage so that the intention of the legislation is absolutely clear.  If the legislation needs to be amended this can be done.</P>
      <P>The difficulties experienced by employees can sometimes be hidden or overlooked in a booming economy.  This is another reason the legislation is very important.  It is difficult to believe women are still congregated in huge numbers in segregated low paid employment in certain sectors of the market.  Much of the work done by women, for example, caring, continues to be very poorly rewarded and in most cases is unwaged.  We must look at ways of making progress in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill breaks new ground in our law.  In the past 20 years the debate on equality has broadened beyond the scope of existing law which is confined to sex and marital status.  However, these issues will remain central concerns in any equality legislation.  Last week a conference was held in Dublin Castle on &ldquo;mainstreaming equality&rdquo;.  This means asking all Government Departments to outline the impact of their policies on women and men and to look in detail at these.  For example, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will be asked the effects of his policy on rural women while the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will be <Col N="999" /> asked the effects of transport policy on women and whether these take into account special needs.</P>
    <P>While mainstreaming equality is very important, at the same time we must continue to build on specific legislation, as has been done in the Bill.  The two issues go hand in hand and it should not be about one issue to the exclusion of the other.  It is important to continue developing the law.  In this context I am delighted with the inclusion in the Bill of a provision on positive action.</P>
    <P>The Bill radically extends the scope of existing law, bans discrimination by employers, employment agencies and vocational bodies.  I am very pleased it deals also with the issue of training. People can be very vulnerable while undergoing training and they need the supports and protections provided by the Bill.  Discrimination in collective agreements and vocational trainings as well as discriminatory advertising and indirect pay discrimination will be banned.  There will also be a prohibition on sexual, racial and other harassment at work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the equality law to the Defence Forces but it should be extended also to the Naval Service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the European Council in Dublin on 13 and 14 December next has not yet been decided.  As is customary, as President in Office of the European Council I will be writing to my colleagues on the European Council as to the agenda prior to the meeting.  At this stage, I anticipate that the main items on the Council agenda will be the Intergovernmental Conference, Economic and Monetary Union, Employment Policy, the fight against Drug Trafficking and Organised Crime and the External Relations of the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate I cannot preempt the outcome of the European Council.  I am, however, very hopeful that the Council will <Col N="1000" /> record substantial progress on Economic and Monetary Union, the Intergovernmental Conference and the Europe wide fight against drugs and organised crime.  I also intend to seek the agreement of the European Council to a declaration on employment which will chart the future direction of EU employment strategy.</P>

      <P>Will the Intergovernmental Conference achieve a stated position on a comprehensive draft by the December summit?  What is his view as President of the EU and his colleagues' view of the possibilities of completing the Intergovernmental Conference by the Amsterdam Summit?  There is concern about the difficulties within the Intergovernmental Conference and where it is going.</P>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's position on the Swiss suggestion that there will be a financial crisis within the European Community if the European Monetary Union target system for non-EU countries is not resolved?  This is a growing issue of discontent between EU and non-EU countries. We cannot achieve anything in European Monetary Union until the issue of the target system is resolved.  Since the Taoiseach stated we will make major progress on European Monetary Union, what solutions or compromises is the Irish Presidency putting forward to resolve this?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Swiss have their own interests to pursue in this matter.  They are not a member of the EU and not privy to the discussions taking place on European Monetary Union within the Union.  A satisfactory outcome from the point of view of EU members will be reached on all these questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Swiss are not the only ones concerned about European Monetary Union, which is a crucial part of moving forward in European integration.  They have decisions, arguments and their national interest but there are also arguments within the EU.  If the Taoiseach does not want to get into discussion on the Swiss, what is his view on the target system regarding the ins and the outs?  Is the Irish Presidency developing an understanding on how the target system and financial mechanism will work under a single currency? What relationship will we have with the British and will it operate if they are outside European Monetary Union?  Are we linking the British into the system in a way that would be satisfactory to our economy in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Presidency is a glorious opportunity to influence the debate.  I am not the only one <Col N="1001" /> predicting a financial crisis on this issue.  The international financial press are also saying it.  It is in the national interest to focus this debate on resolving the issues of our EU and non-EU partners. What are we doing to resolve this matter during the Irish Presidency?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Presidency is required to work on the relationship between the countries in the Euro zone and those EU members who remain outside.  This matter is engaging substantial attention at the moment and is one on which progress was made at the informal meeting of Finance Ministers in Dublin.  It is one of a number of European Monetary Union related issues, including the stability pact and the legal arrangements of the issuance of the new currency, and has not been finally resolved.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;financial crisis&rdquo; is one that should not be used in this context.  As we proceed towards the creation of a single European currency we will, by simplifying global currency relationships, reduce the risks of the type of mismatch that leads to crisis on the currency markets by a considerable degree.  The Euro will be a major player on the world market.  It will replace a number of competing and occasionally diverging currencies, simplify inter-currency relationships and render them more predictable.  There will be transitional difficulties, as with all change. The overall effect in this instance will be to promote financial stability.</P>
      <P>It is important that the creation of a zone of monetary stability in Europe now exists.  It may not exist in the future and it did not exist in the past.  It has been created due to the Maastricht Treaty, which was agreed without any exemption being sought for Ireland by my predecessor, Mr. Haughey.  I agreed with this and gave him my full support at the time, publicly and privately.  We should avoid any attempt to criticise, or adopt the criticisms of others, regarding this project, which will be a success.</P>

      <P>If we do not have a policy on the matter we should be told that.  What are the Taoiseach's views on the proposals launched by the EU, and supported by the Commission, on an EU wide tax regime for all European Union countries?  I assume we do not agree with it but I would like to hear his view on the matter.  What is his view on the Franco-German proposals put forward in recent days for a multi-speed Europe allowing for enlargement to 27 countries and greater integration and allowing countries to join <Col N="1002" /> at different times and levels and progress in different ways?  Does he believe it is helpful to launch such proposals weeks before we hope to finalise a fairly final draft?  It is creating confusion. Lest the Taoiseach accuse me of criticising the Irish Presidency, Sarah Helm, one of the better known writers on the Intergovernmental Conference in European journalism, stated that privately, German officials predict that the Dublin summit in December, when an EU draft treaty is to be presented, will achieve virtually nothing.</P>

I compliment him on finding criticism from persons who would not give their names.  He referred to &ldquo;private&rdquo; criticism.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have achieved a great deal on the issue of drugs and crime.  I am particularly pleased we have achieved the extension of EUROPOL's mandate to include crimes against children, which has been a major scandal in European society in recent times.  I am pleased as a result of the work of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, we have been able to extend EUROPOL's mandate in that area.  I am also pleased at our progress in the fight against drug abuse, in particular the agreements emerging on higher penalties for those involved in trafficking drugs and more co-ordination between European <Col N="1003" /> authorities on detection of drug trafficking.  Furthermore, a strong agenda has been set for Europe participating in an international arrangement with the United States, Japan and other major players in the fight against crime generally, including the abuse of the Internet and other benefits conferred on society by modern technology. Substantial progress has been made on agreeing the details necessary for the introduction of a single currency.  This is not a comprehensive summary because, although I am not complaining, the Deputy asked the question without giving notice of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We attach great importance to the good relationship between the United States and Europe during our Presidency.  Whenever Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Union there usually exists an uncomplicated and supportive relationship between Ireland and the United States which we can use to the benefit of EU relations generally.  While there were many inherited difficulties in that area, including Helms-Burton, D'Amato-Kennedy and other legislation, the work we are doing in that area will be particularly helpful to the long-term relationship between the EU and the United States.  I look forward to meeting the President of the United States on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union.</P>

I am pleased the establishment of EUROPOL was agreed finally at the Council in June.  The way is now clear for the necessary legislation to ratify it.  I am also pleased the Minister for Justice has worked with great effect on achieving agreement from all member governments and that the relevant legislation will be passed within a reasonably short timeframe so that EUROPOL can be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that crime is an international matter.  As the capacity to import and export criminal activity is increasing exponentially, we must put in place sophisticated instruments at European and international levels, <Col N="1004" /> through EUROPOL and other such agencies, for dealing with international crime.  The forces of law must have at least as good, if not substantially better, resources and competence than those they must combat.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach appears to believe it is unpatriotic to question the single currency deal.  We want him as President of Europe to take the lead in ensuring there is a link between the UK currency and the new Euro.  The matter was not on the agenda of the last Council meeting, but I am glad to note it is on the agenda for its next meeting.  To avoid turbulence, will the Minister take a direct interest in ensuring there is a link between the two currencies?  The Taoiseach has given the impression that the matter is being fixed up between Finance Ministers, but that is not the case.  Deputy Ahern asked him when he will outline the financial payments system.  Perhaps he will answer that question?  This needs more discussion.  Is the Taoiseach aware that in Kenmare last weekend 75 per cent of 120 Irish economists &mdash; and I am aware of the jokes about it &mdash; said the Government is making no preparation for the single currency.  According to an opinion poll of those economists some 45 per cent said we should stay out of the currency unless Britain joins.  I do not agree with that.  The least the Taoiseach can do is to use the Irish Presidency to bring the UK on board.  The UK should, at least, join the ERM.  Has the Taoiseach asked the UK to rejoin the ERM?  Has the Taoiseach put proposals on the table to get Britain on board in some band arrangement within the Ecu?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, few jobs in Ireland are dependent on arms manufacture. This is not the case in a number of other European countries where substantial employment is generated by arms manufacture.  Personally, I feel a sense of revulsion <i>vis-à-vis</i> the arms trade but, equally, I am realistic enough to know that some families in other EU countries derive their income from their involvement with arms manufacturing companies.  We should understand the position of others and not simply be morally superior from the advantageous position that we may have.  It is important to recognise that before we begin to discuss the subject but the Government will do everything it can to restrict the arms trade as well as restricting the forces that generate the arms trade.  The efforts of the Tánaiste in attempting to bring peace to the Middle East are important in this regard.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain his views on an area on which he has undertaken to make progress during the Irish Presidency, namely crimes against children including child pornography on the Internet?  In a recently published discussion document on the matter the European Commission advocates co-operation on a European wide approach.  This is what the Taoiseach said at the Strasbourg meeting.  The Commission, however, also said that the issue of illegal content was one for member states.  This is a hugely complex issue.  If it is a matter for member states, has the Taoiseach considered how we will deal with it, for example, by amending our censorship laws?  I welcome any efforts being made by the Government but it should use the opportunity of the Presidency to get our European colleagues to focus on the issue.  We cannot do much about it on our own.  What can the Taoiseach do to move this matter on during the Presidency? Will he set up a working group here including outside interests?  The issue is so complex that Government agencies alone do not have the personnel to deal with it.  The Taoiseach should establish a working body to involve people in an open debate to see how we can deal with it.</P>

      <P>It is as a direct result of pressure from the Irish Presidency that the Commission's initiative came about concerning the abuse of modern technology and, in particular, the use of the Internet to disseminate pornography and other damaging material.  The Deputy made a valid point concerning the different standards that apply in various countries as to what is or is not acceptable.  At the founding of the European Union member states placed a reserve on their need to be able to make what may be described as moral judgments individually as nation states rather than have them made for them.  That is something on which we have had occasion to rely upon in certain instances.</P>
      <P>The difficulty the Deputy has highlighted is real and should not be underestimated by anyone who is looking for instant results in this area.  I am glad the matter is being faced which is as a result of the initiative of the Irish Presidency.  The Deputy has made a good suggestion about having this matter studied further not only by the Government but by others and I undertake to pursue that suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government established the interdepartmental Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment, SGEU, in October 1995.  The purpose of the group is to prepare for Government approval and oversee the implementation of a comprehensive strategy with clearly defined objectives to deal with key aspects of the unemployment problem.  The group consists of officials from the relevant Departments. Since October 1995 the group has met 14 times and has submitted four progress reports to the Government during that period.</P>
      <P>The work of the group contributed to the framing of the employment and training measures included in the 1996 budget.  The group is also involved in reviewing the implementation of those measures.</P>
      <P>The work of the SGEU provided a context for the work of the CSO in the undertaking of the recent exercise comparing the Labour Force Survey and live register figures.  In view of the results of that exercise the strategy group has been instructed to identify ways to enhance the flow of information to support the operation of labour market support and income maintenance policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the work of this group?  Can he suggest how we might improve the position?  After five or six years of high economic growth in ideal circumstances of low inflation and low interest rates and while employment has increased its effect on the live register has been almost nil.  I raised this matter on the Order of Business this morning and the Taoiseach tried to claim credit for the Labour Force Survey results for the past two years.  The figures up to April 1995 reveal an increase in employment of 57,000 jobs.  Apart from the fact that only three months of that period coincides with the Taoiseach's time in office, according to the Government's sponsored Labour Force Survery results announced yesterday the number of new jobs created has fallen by 22 per cent.  Is the working group on employment bringing forward real strategies in various sectors?  If it is, what are they?  I have seen the proposals on local employment initiatives, but what was provided in the budget has created little or no jobs.  The condition the economy is in should create jobs.  While jobs are being created, the number is not anywhere near what it should be.  The Labour Force Survey results published yesterday for the year up to last April reveal that the number of new jobs created had fallen to 45,000 and there is no reason to believe that pattern did not continue during the past six months.  Is the group working on strategies <Col N="1009" /> in particular areas and what proposals can we expect to emanate from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy this morning, approximately 100,000 more people, men and women, are working than when I became Taoiseach. I would be the last to make the claim that this is exclusively due to any individual initiative, person or political party, but it is an important fact that bears testimony to the success of our economy and people.  Of course, problems remain, one of which is long-term unemployment at the core of which is the problem of distribution. There is the problems of inequality of opportunity.  The employment rate for those who have a leaving certificate or lower qualification. is very low, while it is lower for those who have a leaving certificate or lower qualification.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that work is something other people pay for.  They pay for it because they want the service that is to be provided. In an increasingly sophisticated marketplace each individual must improve the quality of the service he or she can provide in return for the income he or she hopes to achieve and receive. That requires investment not only by the State but by individuals and families in improving educational qualification.  While we have moved from a position of 30 years ago where somewhere in the region of 30 per cent of our people sat the leaving certificate successfully to a point where 80 per cent sit it successfully now &mdash; we can congratulate ourselves on that &mdash; nevertheless 20 per cent still do not sit it successfully.  They are the people about whom we should be most worried because they have the least prospect.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes, I could list from my brief a number of initiatives the Government is taking in this area to improve the functioning of the labour market, but the cardinal fact is that, as a society, individuals and families, we need to recognise the importance of attaining better skills and education throughout life.  One should never believe one's job is safe and should always recognise that one must constantly upgrade one's skills. Those are the factors that are essential to success in this area.</P>

I asked the Taoiseach to outline the strategy the Government is following.  We have told our people for a decade that if we had low inflation and low interest rates, balanced our budget and had a current budget surplus we would be able to generate jobs, but practically 200,000 people are unemployed.  What strategy has this group, which calls itself a strategy group, put forward?  What are its proposals?  I should not have to ask about them, we should know what they are.  A document has not been published by the group and its proposals are not in the public domain.  Why is that so?  Why do we not know <Col N="1010" /> the strategy the Government is following in this area?  Why should I have to table a parliamentary question to find out about this strategy?  Is it hidden? Does the Taoiseach not want anybody to to know about it?  Would it be a bad idea if employers or trade unions knew that the Government had a strategy?</P>

      <P>It is also the case that substantial numbers of people have not found employment and I have identified key issues that need to be addressed, education and training.  However, there are many for whom a disincentive to take up employment exists because of social welfare requirements.  That is why the child dependant allowance has been extended for 13 weeks after people take up employment and leave social welfare so they do not have a sudden reduction in income.  That is why the back-to-work allowance was introduced, which has resulted in 13,000 additional people at work.  It is also the reason we reduced employers' PRSI and introduced allowances and bands so that employers will have a greater incentive to employ more people.  That is also why we introduced the whole time jobs option for those who have been two or more years unemployed so that they can continue to achieve benefit while in full-time employment because they are particularly disadvantaged.</P>

The Government has also introduced a series of other labour market measures designed to tilt the balance in favour of employment and against unemployment and in favour of taking on additional workers rather than reducing the workforce.  We will continue to initiate such measures, but it is important to make the point that employment depends on the demand for the services provided by the person seeking employment.

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to increase the participation of full-time farmers in forestry; and if so, if he will give details of such plans.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18512/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers already account for the largest population of afforestation undertaken &mdash; 62 per cent of the total in 1995 and 85 per cent of private sector afforestation.  Their participation in forestry is already supported by generous afforestation grants and premiums, the latter particularly favouring farmers through higher rates and a longer period of payment.  Farmers have seen the value in forestry as an alternative agricultural activity and an income and asset option and in many cases have reflected this by including forestry as one of their farm activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distinction in the forest premium is between farmers and others and does not distinguish <Col N="1013" /> between full and part-time farmers once the criteria defining &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; are met.</P>
    <P>It is the target in the Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland, approved by the Government and published in July, that 70 per cent of all afforestation will be undertaken by the private sector and that there will be a particular emphasis on farmer participation. In this regard, the provisions of the strategic plan include a commitment to maintain the relativity of forestry supports to other farm supports; improvements in the farm forestry advisory services, including a greater role for Teagasc&mdash; we have appointed some extra staff in that regard; improved and re-directed training courses to improve farmers' forestry skills and to improve forest management over the full rotation; the development of suitable co-operative farm forestry strcutures and amendments to REPS to ensure complementary application of both it and forestry schemes.</P>
    <P>This strategic plan is in place and it shows a clear positive discrimination in relation to farmers in forestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister might think it shows positive discrimination, many people would not agree.  Many small portions of land may be more suited to forestry than to any other purpose.  Will the Minister allow premiums to be paid on small portions of land because area aid has become a major problem as far as maintaining land for agricultural production is concerned? In many cases small portions of land could be used more productively if forests were planted, but because extensification premiums will be lost, farmers are not prepared to do that. Will the Minister examine this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that but I should point out that this is defined by EU rules.  The stocking density is a key element of the controls for livestock production.  However, this would cause problems because the forestry premium structure is part of the accompanying measures. There are two separate channels and I envisage a difficulty in overlapping but I will consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's commitment to consider the matter will be welcomed by many farmers who see this as a possible way of creating, in the Minister's words, a small pension fund for their future.  Is the Minister prepared to examine the possibility of increasing the rate of assistance to full-time farmers?  I am not talking about those who qualify in terms of taking 25 per cent of their income from farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give the impression, because it can have the effect of negativing planting, that there will be radical changes in forestry grants and afforestation premia.  The existing structure is very generous.  There was a problem with REPS and that has been resolved.  People <Col N="1014" /> would refrain from planting if they thought that more generous grants would be forthcoming.  I am very anxious to do everything possible to assist in planting.  Much has been in done in regard to Teagasc and implementing a forestry forum report. Farm forestry is part of my plan in terms of the one million acres of land that would be more viable under plantation than agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why he allowed Coillte, a timber sales agency, to remain the main planting agency of public lands rather than allow the private sector to deal totally with planting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The proportionate share of planting by Coillte is dropping rapidly.  For example, in 1986 farmer planting was only 20 per cent of total planting whereas it is now almost 75 per cent. Coillte must maintain the forest estate and increase its business but proportionately the increase in planting is in farmer forestry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Commission is obliged to provide a report on the operation of the sheepmeat quota regime to the Council of Agriculture Ministers in 1996.  I have proposed to the Commission that preparation of the report should be availed of to examine the wider aspects of the sheepmeat regime.  The report, which is now available, is confined to the issue of the operation of the quota regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that in the past five or six years more than 5,000 flock owners have been forced out of production, will the Minister commit himself to a review of the sheepmeat sector, as he promised last year, before the end of the Irish Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year was a very bad year for sheepmeat and exceptional measures were approved in December.  I looked on the review as a window of opportunity, but circumstances in the beef sector have changed the picture.  One of the silver linings on the cloud of the BSE crisis is the upturn in sheep prices which are at an historically high level.  Despite my pleadings and urgings, the Commission has declined to put forward favourable proposals to remove the stabiliser and deal with other factors.  It proposed a minimalist review which basically endorses the <i>status quo.</i> Now is not the right time to press the matter. When the beef issue has settled down we will agree reforms and seek one thing at a time, whether the DSP, the sheep issue or whatever, rather than focus on a series of matters.  There are so many key issues in regard to beef at <Col N="1015" /> present that it would be better to have a nil all draw, as it were, on sheep and defer the matter to the future.  I will be raising the matter with the French authorities, but the Commission has not favoured a generous review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that by not fulfilling his promise to sheep producers he is in effect abandoning them?  The Netherlands will take over the Presidency after Ireland, followed by Luxembourg, and there is no commitment on the part of those countries to the sheepmeat sector. The Minister reneged on his commitment in this regard, giving as his reason the beef problem. Is that the reason the sheep premium was cut? On the question of New Zealand imports, sheep farmers relied on the Minister to have this matter reviewed during the Irish Presidency, but he is now saying that will not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>To amend the sheepmeat regime would require a Council majority and no member state other than Ireland would support such a proposal.  France would support a change in the stabiliser, which would give a 4 per cent increase in premium.  All the Commission's resources are going towards supporting the beef sector at present and since we have a greater dependence on beef than anyone else that suits our interests. I do not believe the Commission will entertain a seriously beneficial proposal for sheep in the prevailing circumstances.  Rather than have the sheepmeat regime determined negatively for Ireland, it is better to defer the matter.  The difficulties that existed in 1995 have been resolved. Prices fell as low as 80p per lb. during the worst period in 1995 while the prevailing price is more than £1.10 per lb.  The Commission will not accept a technical case at present and it is better to leave the option open than to get a bad result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past five to six years lamb prices have fallen by 15 per cent.  The Minister has effectively abandoned the sheepmeat producer by reneging on his commitment to review the sector during the Irish Presidency.  Sheep producers now know exactly where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I secured an exclusive arrangement for Ireland whereby the rural world premium, which was not paid in any other member state, was payable in advantaged areas.  There is a time and place to seek changes to the sheepmeat sector.  It is a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the Presidency proposes and disposes of business.  The Commission must propose alterations to the sheepmeat regime and the proposal must be adopted by 58 votes.  No other member state would support such a proposal at present, nor is the Commission prepared to put it forward.  It is unrealistic to think that this can be done at present.  It would be better to see what will be the effect on sheep meat post-BSE and if more difficulties arise for the sheep sector that <Col N="1016" /> would be the optimum time to proceed on the matter.</P>

A further report on the implementation of the group's recommendations is now being prepared by my Department and the Department of Health.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no clear-cut responsibility. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment has responsibility for consumer affairs, the Minister for Health and the health boards are responsible for food safety, which includes checking for salmonella in supermarkets, while my Department is responsible for animal health, slaughtering arrangements and so on.  These do not make up a single homogeneous group.  Veterinarians will continue to do animal health-related work.</P>
      <P>It is a source of concern &mdash; this was highlighted at a veterinary conference over the weekend &mdash; that there is no uniformity in terms of local authority supervision of abattoirs.

Is the Minister aware that consumers at home and abroad have expressed concern about the quality of certain aspects of Irish food, that there is no uniformity in the way these are <Col N="1017" /> inspected, that while there is a high level of inspection and confidence in some products, this is not true in the case of others?

It is the same people who will oversee veterinary inspections of carcasses and certification for export purposes.  Work on the animal health aspects will continue to be done by AOs.  It would not be appropriate to retrain people, there are different contracts of employment.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall objective of the clawback recently put in place is to bias the operation of the quota system in favour of active milk producers. It will achieve this by promoting temporary leasing as an alternative to land-quota leasing as well as quota restructuring, both of which schemes make quota available to producers in priority categories.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate how much quota will be transferred to these schemes or to the national reserve as a result of this measure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a figure.  Milk quotas are being purchased or leased by cheque book purchasers in the private sector who can afford to give more than the 30p offered by co-operatives. I am not saying this claw back will provide an instantaneous answer for those who are desperate to acquire a quota this year.  We are facing a super levy liability of £40 million.  It is however an important sea change which will be reviewed.  The arrangements may be used to a greater extent in the future to try to have milk transferred to the temporary leasing scheme.  If the present trend continues producers will soon disappear.  Flexi-milk quotas have virtually evaporated.  This has caused problems this year given that the number of farmers who have applied under the scheme has risen from 2,500 to 8,000.</P>

      <P>When the announcement was made it was suggested it would alleviate current problems.  The Minister has now said it will not.  I agree with him.

      <P>It was felt it would be unfair if the new arrangements applied to existing leases, many of which are held by small farmers who would be penalised excessively.  It was also felt that, because it was such a fundamental change which may be subject to a legal challenge, it would be better if the new arrangements came into operation from 12 October.  I am not saying I received legal advice to that effect but that was deemed to be fairer.  Existing leases will not be affected.  If more milk is transferred to the temporary leasing scheme &mdash; there are three tranches &mdash; as the Deputy knows, priority will be given to smaller producers.  In the second and third tranches almost all of the milk available will be offered to producers with quotas of less than 30,000 gallons.</P>

People believe it is interfering with assets of farmers and the right to sell land, and I have taken all that flak.  I am not sure whether the Deputy is saying I should go further but my priority is that the milk of inactive milk producers, of which there are approximately 9,000, should go to priority categories which are set out under the temporary leasing scheme.  That is the best avenue to follow and the way I intend to proceed.</P>

      <Quest>the number and percentage of dairy farms who do not come up to EU standards; and the steps, if any, he will take to ensure quality in the industry in view of the closure of the dairy hygiene scheme.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>All Irish dairy farms have been registered from the initial date of application of EU Directive 92/46, which is implemented in Ireland by means of SI 9/96.  Under the directive these farms are subject to ongoing inspection.  To <Col N="1020" /> date, almost 3,000 farms have been formally certified as having reached the required standards.</P>
      <P>Under the dairy hygiene scheme, a total of 4,800 producers have either received grant aid or have had approval to proceed with the necessary work under the scheme resulting in a total commitment of £25 million.  A further 3,000 applications have been received and will be dealt with in due course.  While the scheme has had to be suspended due to shortage of funds, I have already made it clear that if moneys become available, I will consider the reintroduction of grant aid for upgrading dairy farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the time span involved for the 3,000 applicants waiting for dairy hygiene grants?  He said they will be paid in due course but many applicants require the money now.  Will the Minister include an allocation in his own Estimate to deal with this matter? Also, will he indicate the way the Department's policy can be pursued regarding more competitive agriculture if we are facing the prospect of not having an on-farm investment grant programme for the first time in 40 or 50 years? Will the Minister confirm he does not have any plans to reintroduce this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The net point is contained in the last question.  The position is that the money has run out.  While the scheme was in operation a total of 7,800 applications were received, of which 5,300 have been fully processed and approval to commence the work has issued.  With the money allocated in the Structural Funds programme to 1999 we will be hard-pressed to cover the remaining cases but I am considering, within the overall programme, reintroducing the scheme, although I cannot give a commitment in that regard now. We are examining it in terms of the overall food sub-programme and, if the scheme is reintroduced, it will be at a lower rate of grant.  There simply was not enough money in any of these schemes to meet the demand.  Under the agricultural envelope it is not possible to get more money at this time unless the mid-term review yields something but there is no indication of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that farmers applying for grants under these schemes are trying to maintain a future in farming?  Will he agree also that if such investments are not made, the whole question of selling our produce as environmentally friendly does not have the credibility it would otherwise have if the schemes were in place?  Will the Minister agree he is handicapped in trying to persuade consumers, domestic and foreign, that we are committed to more environmentally friendly farming if we are not prepared to invest in these schemes?  Given the increased demands made on milk producers by co-ops, how does the Minister expect small producers to stay in business if these schemes, which assist in maintaining farm families in rural communities, <Col N="1021" /> are not available?  Also, will the Minister confirm these schemes were suspended by fax informing the local offices they were being suspended from closing time that day?  Is that a precedent?  Has any similar scheme been stopped so precipitously on a previous occasion?  I have had several queries in this regard and I ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to the inclusion of those farmers whose applications had reached the offices prior to the suspension of the scheme.  Is the Minister prepared to allow those applications be processed?  I am aware of a number of hardship cases, one of which is in relation to the alternative enterprises scheme, which I want to bring to the Minister's attention.  Will the Minister ensure that person will not be penalised because of the way the scheme was suspended?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter point, I will consider the matter.  Applications had to be received by the close of business on that Friday. If there is a problem with regard to applications not being properly recorded I will examine that in a sympathetic manner.  The total amount of money provided as part of the overall Structural Funds was £31 million.  The grant approval commitment to date is £25 million.  I cannot invite applications if there is no money to meet them.  I regret these funds have been exhausted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The £6 million in respect of unapproved applications will go towards those which have yet to be processed.  It was also the case in the previous tranche of Structural Funds which terminated in 1993 that much of the money for these schemes had run out before we had reached the end of the five year tranche.  The position is not without precedent.  We support dairy hygiene but of all the schemes, I do not see any prospect of the alternative enterprise scheme being reintroduced. I will do my best, however, to give this matter priority for the reasons stated by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>There are no plans at this stage to reintroduce the control of farm pollution scheme or the dairy hygiene scheme.  However, as regards the dairy hygiene scheme, if additional funds become available as a result of the mid-term review of the Structural Funds, consideration will be given to its reintroduction in a modified form.</P>
      <P>The farm improvement programme which was launched in 1986 continues to apply for those farmers who took out farm plans before 8 December 1994, when the scheme was suspended by the previous Administration.  Farmers who had planned investments may apply to carry out these works in accordance with their farm plan.  Due to a shortage of funds provided in the operational programme it was necessary to limit the relaunched farm improvement programme to investments in horticulture.  This scheme, which was launched in 1995, has not been suspended.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister, as I have done before, to give special consideration to the reintroduction of the control of farm pollution scheme in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  There are severe problems with the disposal of effluent due to the drumlin terrain in those counties.  The Minister is well aware of ongoing representations all Deputies make on behalf of farmers who are under severe pressure from local authorities and fisheries boards in relation to pollution incidents. Those same farmers are very anxious to put in the necessary investment but they need grant assistance to carry out the required works.  The Minister should consider further the proposal I have put to his Department on a number of occasions.</P>

The original national plan had £245 million but that was cut by £50 million for reasons we all know.  However, even the £245 million would not have been enough because the demand was so strong.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is time for his Department to have an overview of all those schemes and to try to facilitate people?  It is an impossible situation for many farmers, given the way these schemes stop and start.

Those schemes should be examined closely to see how people with development plans might be facilitated.</P>

      <P>If there is no money, all the reviews in the world will not change that.  The mid-term review is in two parts.  One is to see if there is unspent money in other Objective 1 regions in Europe and the other is to see if the overall Structural Funds can be spread around.  That is the only prospect of more funding.</P>
      <P>I did not make the original decision, but in hindsight it would have been fairer to have a lower rate of grant and give money to more people rather than give a 60 per cent grant to some people.  Thousands of people get nothing. This should be considered if we have a future round of Structural Funds after 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The control of pollution grants are an important area of continuing controversy.  The Minister has consistently referred to the lack of resources to meet the demand for these grants. Could he try, as I have tried on two Finance Bills, to look at farmers with taxable income getting a tax credit equivalent to what they would get in a direct grant payment?  That would pay that category of farmer and release the grant money for those farmers who do not have tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister not agree that there are ways around the resource problem if the political will is there?  One could use the tax system to pay people who have a taxable income and that would immediately release the grant aid resources to far more farmers who are not taxed.  It is agreed by every Member with an interest in agricultural matters or who represents a rural community that the control of farmyard pollution scheme is the <Col N="1024" /> first opportunity farmers have been given to obtain assistance to ensure they work in environmentally friendly workplaces.  All Members would agree that farmers have been unfairly regarded as the polluters of our environment when there is huge interest in the farming community in taking up this scheme.  Rather than examining the reduction in the level of the percentage of grant aid under the scheme, the reason for it being so generous was the recognition of its importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>People who have already received grants may or may not have a taxable income.  I understand the Deputy's point.  To be positive, now that there is no grant available to a farmer who wishes to proceed along these lines, there is a need to consider carefully some form of tax relief for pollution-related expenditure.  At the start today of the general public talks with the social partners on a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, a number of them requested this be looked at as a negotiating condition. There are a number of ways to approach it and the Deputy has suggested one.  Given collective Cabinet responsibility, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Government in the consideration of the budget but I would support a favourable outcome for such a proposal.  It can now be pursued more legitimately than ever because of the absence of grant aid.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has not as yet come forward with proposals in relation to the future of milk quotas after expiry of the present regime in the year 2000.  Discussions on the future of EU dairy policy are scheduled to begin next year and in that context the role of quotas in that policy will be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is possible to speculate on the nature of certain external pressures and developments <Col N="1025" /> likely to be in evidence in the early part of the next decade, it is too early to predict the precise effect of these on the CAP, including the milk quota system.  The focus of any discussions on this issue will be determined by the nature of proposals put forward by the EU Commission.  It is expected that under the Dutch Presidency, provided the beef reforms go through under our Presidency, the dairy sector will be the next area of reform.  Commissioner Fischler had no proposals for reform in this year's price package on the dairy sector because of that expectation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this question is to start a much-needed public debate on what is in our best interests regarding the reform of the milk sector and whether quotes, which have served their purpose in stabilising the market, should become a permanent feature or be scrapped.  Would the Minister agree that from an administrative point of view at Commission level, there may be a tendency to retain them for the administrative convenience to policy makers? They could monitor production levels throughout the Community.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister also agree that Ireland must address the serious question of whether we wish to retain milk quotas?  Does he agree with the independent scientific advice from agricultural economists which suggests Ireland could double its milk output in a post-quota milk regime?  We can produce milk from our grassland-based agriculture industry far more efficiently than practically any other part of Europe and it can be produced as efficiently on smallholdings as on larger holdings.  Given the age profile of farmers generally and that dairy farming is five times more profitable than any other farming enterprise, does this not present a golden opportunity for Irish agriculture to get out of the straitjacket imposed by the quota regime since 1984 and to give a real opportunity to young farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>For Members' information, I have set up a small expert group of some of the best people in the milk producing and processing sectors. They are due to report shortly on the best options.  The Commission has not formed a view yet.  The quotas will be there until the year 2000.  We have to look at this in the context of the next GATT round.  Some of the options are: maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, letting the price come down and having a dairy cow premium as was done in relation to beef; having an A quota and a B quota; having <Col N="1026" /> no quota.  The big advantage is that we could produce unlimited quantities, but it would be at the expense of price.  It is reckoned the European subsidies on milk work out at about 40p a gallon. If we dismantle the structure and allow the cheapest dairy producers to produce unlimited amounts of milk, as happened in New Zealand and Australia, we have to weigh up whether we can produce milk cheaper than anyone else and how our markets would be affected.  Given that people are paying such large sums to purchase or lease quotas, they should know what is going to happen well before the year 2000.  My instinct is that there will probably be a transitional phase which the provision of A and B quotas would allow for. However, if there is a B quota the A quota price would drop.</P>
      <P>I hope I have given the House a flavour of the permutations.  We have not finalised our own position.  However, I am getting the very best advice on it and hope to have a report within a matter of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's response.  Could he inform the House when he expects the expert group to report?  Is there any prospect of making expert group reports public when they become available so that everybody can get involved in the debate?  There is a tendency, once an expert group's report reaches the Minister, for a veil of secrecy to be thrown over its contents so that we cannot have the sort of informed debate that would educate us all on the best options.  When will the report be brought forward to enable us to join in the debate?</P>
      <P>On the question of A and B quotas, would the Minister agree there are serious questions regarding the acceptance by us of a B quota, since there is a strong body of opinion which suggests that the A quota for us would be in terms of what we can produce nationally and the B quota, given that we are more export oriented, would create a serious imbalance in terms of price <i>vis-à-vis</i> the present position.  I accept that the Minister is awaiting the expert review report.  I hope the review group will report shortly and that we will have access to the report so that we can continue this discussion on a future date.</P>

      <P>The report will be available within a matter of weeks, certainly before Christmas. Regarding publication, I have no difficulty with publishing anything in so far as it is a matter of public debate and interaction.  However, some of the people involved are prominent in large organisations and join expert groups because of their expertise in certain areas.  Their opinions are given in their private, not their representational, capacity.  It would be known in the industry who the members of such groups are.  The groups could include representatives from IFA, ICMSA or ICOS who are there because of their personal expertise, and they might oppose the publication of the report.  I would be prepared to publish a discussion paper setting out the facts and, in that <Col N="1027" /> regard, Mr. Brendan Carney has been doing a study in conjunction with Teagasc.</P>

      <P>A procedure consisting of prepayment spot checks is in operation for participants in the REP scheme.  In addition, compliance checks are carried out prior to second year payment.  Of the 2,774 participants who have so far received second year payments 266 have had penalties imposed.  This represents 9.5 per cent of participants and the penalties imposed were approximately 10 per cent of the total payments made to second year applicants.  In each case the participant has been penalised for failing to carry out specific works or fulfil undertakings made in the preceding year of the scheme.  Penalties range from 5 per cent to 100 per cent of payment, depending on the significance of the infringement.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied this control system is ensuring compliance with the regulations.  This is evident from the results to date of the compliance checks, the level of which I will keep under review.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Byrne could not be here to deal with this question.  The information is specific.  I am glad the Minister is taking such an intensive interest in the REPS area.  The works being carried out under REPS is essential not just to farming but to the quality of our rivers and environment generally.  It is essential that works be carried out to ensure that farming does not impinge on our environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to second year payments and spot checks during the second year.  Were these checks carried out only in the second year, and was this because of concerns raised by advertisements in the paper advising farmers that they could draw down money from the REP scheme and not carry out the works?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the valuation process there was a 5 per cent inspection rate during the first year in the course of which a high level of non compliance, over 40 per cent was discovered. As a result we decided to have 100 per cent checking for second year payments.  We discovered subsequently that the level of non-compliance was reduced to such an extent that we are now reducing second year spot checks by 50 per cent.  Farmers and planners now realise it is <Col N="1028" /> important that there be full compliance under this scheme.  It will be EU policy in the future to encourage more extensification and environmentally friendly schemes.  I am confident of the success of the REPS scheme and of its effectiveness in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Previously we paid 100 per cent up front but now we pay 50 per cent up front and the remaining 50 per cent after six months.  That gives the farmer time to put a plan in place and for spot checks to take place.  The second payment is an incentive to farmers to comply with the plan, and it is badly needed by them because of the challenges they face.  We have been looking carefully at the question of compliance with the specification by the planners.  Planners have been informed if their plans do not fully comply with the original specification.  They, in addition to farmers, now realise that the scheme is being carefully monitored, that it is in their interest to comply with the specification and to ensure their clients comply with their plans.</P>

      <P>There are a number of cases in my constituency where farmers have been penalised for doing too much of the work in the first year, for example, mistakenly cutting too much of the hedgerows.

      <P>The system has been set up and farmers can appeal decisions.  There is a scale of penalties for pollution &mdash; 100 per cent for pollution of watercourses or interference with wildlife habitats or where a national monument is located on the land to which REPS applies.  When the inspector visits farms he will offer advice to farmers about what they should do to rectify their plan.  We have been balanced and fair in the application of REPS.  However, if we are subject to EU evaluation, which we are from time to time, when auditors visit REPS farms it is important for the credibility of this scheme that it is complied with properly.  The penny has dropped that this is a serious scheme and a scheme for the future.  It will be continued into the future if it has the desired effect, if people comply with it and respect the philosophy behind it.</P>

I can present him with a case in which verbal approval was given by the inspector.  Subsequent amendments to the scheme were made by the <Col N="1029" /> Department and a further inspection was made under the new regime.  The farmer was found to be ineligible and was charged a penalty rather than receiving the full grant.  Does the Minister of State agree it is wrong that changes made in the scheme should have a retrospective effect?  Will he ensure that if people were in compliance on the date of the first inspection they will get their full grant, as should have been the case in this instance?  Will the Minister of State deal with the case I mentioned?</P>

Will the Minister give an undertaking that anybody who undertook that work at considerable cost under the original specifications will not have to adjust it to the new specifications?  Under measure 10 in the specifications, the Minister reserves the right to insist that all farmers undertake a REPS course.  Does the Minister of State intend to operate that regulation?  Will he insist that all farmers who participate in REPS undertake the 40 hour course on the operation of the scheme?</P>

      <P>We are endeavouring to make payments as quickly as possible.  It is important that payments are sent to rural communities expeditiously.  On the other hand, we are ensuring there is maximum compliance.  We have set up a special prototype in the payments section to ensure payments are made as speedily as possible. It took some time to establish and might have delayed payments initially.  Now, however, payments are being paid at a rapid rate and that will continue.  There should be no undue delay in any case, even where there are some difficulties.</P>

Farmers can visit those farms and learn from the owner how to comply with the REPS specifications.  That has been one of the most successful aspects of initiating farmers into REPS.  Visits to demonstration farms give farmers an opportunity to see how the scheme is operating and the benefits farmers can derive from the scheme.  It is separate from the green certificate.  There will be specific courses for farmers in addition to the demonstration farms.  The demonstration farms are being established throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward. It is complex legislation but it does not roll back the progress made in the past 20 years.  I have some concerns about the Bill which I would like to address and ask the Minister to consider them on Committee Stage.  I hope, as indicated, he will be able to accept some amendments.  My comments on the sections are in the context of welcoming the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to employment and vocational training and has an effect on up to 150,000 non-employed persons seeking training or enrolling with recruitment agencies.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at how sexual harassment is dealt with in the Bill.  I urge the Minister and his team to look again at how this section has been drafted.  The Bill introduces new tests to sexual harassment despite well established juris prudence and practice by employers and unions in the workplace with good codes of practice.  It introduces new tests in relation to the intention of the alleged perpetrator.  It has been suggested &mdash; again I would welcome the Minister's views on this &mdash; that the new tests will make it harder to pursue sexual harassment in the workplace because of a fear arising out of questioning of the complainant's lifestyle to demonstrate that the accused had reasonable grounds to believe she would not take offence.  It is important to look again at section 23 because it may contravene the European Council of Ministers' recommendation on sexual harassment and the directive currently under discussion which we are supporting under our Presidency.  It would be unfortunate if we inserted something into this Bill which contravened that recommendation.  This section may need to be reworded and the intention made clear.  It would be unfortunate if it meant we were to roll back on progress already made in this area. The Employment Equality Agency continues to have cases of sexual harassment referred to it.  It is important that what we are doing in the legislation is in accordance with what we support at European level.  That is an area on which I would like some further discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister whether there should be a section dealing with political opinion, for example in Northern Ireland and South Africa.  We want to ensure people are not discriminated against because of a political opinion they may hold.  Perhaps a section should be included providing there would be no discrimination because of a political opinion.  That would go some way towards committing Ireland to ratify the ILO Convention III <Col N="1033" /> on non-discrimination.  Luxembourg, the UK and Ireland are the only countries which have not ratified this convention.  This is another issue we need to deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A section on religious institutions raises very interesting questions which will have to be teased out on Committee Stage.  Under this section religious, educational or medical institutions are entitled to discriminate where this is said to be essential for the maintenance of the religious ethos of the institution or is reasonable to avoid offending the religious sensitivities of its members or clients.  The opt-out clause does not apply where the discrimination is on the basis of gender, age or disability grounds but it applies to discrimination on the grounds of family status, marital status, race, membership of the travelling community, religious belief and sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>The Bill refuses to allow discrimination on certain grounds but not on others.  It is clear this provision permits any religious school or religious run hospital to discriminate on the religious ethos or sensitivities ground on the basis of a teacher or health worker's marital status, family status, race, sexual orientation or other characteristics. I question why this needs to be included in the legislation.  I can understand when one is recruiting somebody to teach religion that this would apply or in certain institutes set up for particular religious aims or religious bodies but why should it apply to all hospitals or other institutions? I would like to hear the thinking behind this.  There are many people working in Ireland who would not have protection on these grounds. This Bill updates the Employment Equality Act, 1977, to a huge extent.  Thirty-five of the 56 sections are being changed as well as the terms of reference and the scope of the 1977 Act.  The 1977 system of the way in which equality works has changed.  Should this Act be completely repealed and the two put together to become one Bill? Otherwise the two Acts will have to be read together.  It makes sense to consider this point.</P>
    <P>The Bill is only one of a number of measures aimed at ensuring equality in the workplace and we must continue to pay attention to many other issues.  One of these is the Fourth Action Programme of the EU which will run from 1996 to 2000.  It talks about promoting changes in attitude through education, training, culture and the media, desegregating the labour market and promoting the value of women at work.  We have a long way to go in this regard.  It also talks about encouraging women's entrepreneurship.  Many men and women who own small businesses still refer to the difficulties they encountered in setting them up.  Last year in the budget the Government went a long way to remove some of the barriers which prevent people from becoming entrepreneurs.  Obviously the growth in jobs in the future will take place in the services areas. Women are particularly active in this area and it is important to look at the supports provided for the people who create the jobs.  There is much <Col N="1034" /> more we can do in terms of providing information, creating local networks and supporting more creative links between Government structures. I am continually surprised when people say they do not know whether to approach the local employment initiatives or local boards for help.</P>
    <P>The way in which Structural Funds are spent is very important in the context of how equal opportunities affect women and the other groups referred to in the Bill.  These funds should be targeted at those groups which are in danger of being excluded from society.  The concept of equality proofing has been accepted but we have yet to see many examples of it in practice.  I would like to know how the budget is equality proofed and how the concept of equality proofing has worked in Departments in terms of how Structural Funds are spent.  While the acceptance of principles is important, we must ensure that they are applied in practice.  This is being done in other countries.  For example, Australia equality proofs its budget.  There is nothing strange about this; it is part and parcel of the way social policy should emerge and develop.</P>
    <P>Another important issue is how men and women combine work and family life.  We must create a society which is more supportive of people who combine work and family life.  In the future more people will avail of job sharing and flexitime arrangements or will be employed on a contract basis.  These developments are being driven not by any political ideology but by the demands of the workplace and the changing nature of work.  This will require us to look in a more comprehensive way at issues such as child care, care of the elderly and community needs.  It is necessary for people who look after elderly members of their family or children to feel fully supported.</P>
    <P>It is important to make available a high quality information leaflet on the Bill.  It will be difficult for people to understand some of the complicated provisions and we must provide as much information as possible on them in an easy to read form.  The delay in publishing the explanatory memorandum shows the difficulty of explaining the Bill in simple terms, but we must do so in an information leaflet.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency will require more resources to carry out its work.  We must consider the research facilities available to it and how it will cope with the extra demands placed on it by the Bill.  It is important to put the necessary supports in place so that the agency can carry out its functions under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the publication of this long awaited Bill.  Careful consideration must be given to those provisions which might have a slightly different impact from the one intended and may make it easier to discriminate in a number of areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald in her excellent contribution suggested that an information leaflet on the Bill should be published.  However, <Col N="1035" /> from my reading of this complicated Bill at least 50 leaflets would be needed to explain it.  I am not saying that the subject with which it deals is simple but I do not understand why the Bill is so complex.  People will need to be educated on the provisions of the Bill if it is enacted in its present form.  The Minister indicated that he would be willing to consider Opposition amendments and suggestions.  Hopefully the Bill can be amended on Committee and Report Stages so that it will be less complicated.</P>
      <P>Deputies usually begin their contributions by welcoming Bills.  It would be great if we were in a position to say that this Bill was unnecessary but unfortunately we are not in a position to do so.  All Deputies welcome the principle of the Bill, notwithstanding any reservations they may have about it.  However, we should address our minds to its complicated nature and any bureaucracy it may give rise to.</P>
      <P>The necessity for this Bill should lead us to hang our heads in shame.  We all subscribe to the principles of equality, equal treatment, anti-discrimination, etc. but many of us merely pay lip service to them in the workplace and other areas. If we were genuine about these principles we would not need the legislation.  This Bill also appears to be paying lip service to that concept. It aims to eliminate discrimination on grounds of marital and family status, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, age, disability, race or membership of the travelling community.  Will it achieve this?  Having examined the Bill, the answer is a simple &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  This Bill will, in some cases, make it easier to discriminate or make it harder to prove that there is discrimination.</P>
      <P>The section on sexual harassment in the workplace seems to have turned a well-tried principle, accepted by the Labour Court since 1985, on its head.  A different test as to what constitutes sexual harassment will now apply.  This is a retrograde step and an example of where the Bill will make it more difficult for a person to prove there was discrimination or sexual harassment in the workplace.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes a virtue of the fact that we are legislating to prevent discrimination.  However, it seems to legislate completely for the private sector and adds another layer of regulations, rules and bureaucracy aimed directly at it.  There are few exemptions in the Bill for the private sector. This Bill is remarkable for the exemptions applied.  Various Departments get exemptions from the Bill and are allowed do things other Departments will not do.  One of these is the Department of Justice, which seems to call on the national interest and security as an excuse.  They seem to want to be exempt from many Bills because of their remarkable attitude on national security.  They want to be exempt from tendering procedures, the provisions of this Bill, and practically every Bill that comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not alone in this aspect.  The Department of Equality and Law Reform and the <Col N="1036" /> Department of Defence have successfully included exemptions applying to themselves in the Bill.  I note from information received from bodies outside this House that the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise and Employment also have their finger in the pie and have watered down this Bill to ensure it is less effective.  Local authorities and health boards are also specifically excluded from certain provisions. We talk about discrimination and wanting everyone to be treated equally, in employment or outside it.  Yet we pass legislation that exempts a whole range of public bodies, who should be giving the lead in this matter, from the provisions of the Bill.  Who is going to take us seriously if we continue to do this?  The public, industry and those affected by the exemptions in this Bill will not.</P>
    <P>The Departments, the State and the Civil Service should be giving the lead to ensure that nobody points a finger at the public sector, politicians and the Government and says they have one set of rules for themselves and another for the rest.  The time has gone when we passed legislation like this for everybody else and exempted ourselves.  It does not just apply to equality. Legislation is passed in other areas such as my brief, the environment, where different standards apply to local authorities and State Departments. This has to stop because we are bringing ourselves and the civil and public service into disrepute.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, more regulation, rules and onerous responsibilities are placed on the private sector.  I am not saying this should not be placed on the private sector, but it should be placed on the public sector also.  If we do not start doing that rapidly, we cannot blame people who say we are paying lip service by exempting the areas over which we have control.</P>
    <P>I fear this Bill may have the opposite effect to that intended and will encourage people to use age, disability or sickness as an excuse for discrimination. Age will be used to discriminate against people, especially the under 18s and the over 65s.  There are regular advertisements in the newspapers which often exclude even those in the 18 to 65 age group from applying for jobs in the public service and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Discrimination on the grounds of gender will not be improved by this Bill, but rather could be disimproved.  My party leader has already adverted to the original proposal he had in 1987 for a comparator to be used in relation to discrimination in the workplace and deciding on the level of wages paid.  It is amazing that this concept has been dropped, whether it is a real comparator or a hypothetical one.  In a so-called left wing dominated Government &mdash; according to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, we are all on the left &mdash; it is strange that this particular notion has been dropped.  If anything I would have expected the two parties on the left to have championed this measure and ensured it was agreed by Government.  It would mean that <Col N="1037" /> women, in particular, would not be discriminated against in the pay stakes.  We are all aware that what is considered women's work is paid at a low rate.  It is no accident that cleaning, domestic chores and a variety of other jobs are regarded as women's work and the women who carry out such work are paid less than the subsistence rate of pay.  I am disappointed that the idea of the comparator or using an industry basis for deciding wage levels was deleted from the original draft of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made enormous strides in relation to the physically and mentally handicapped. Will he consider introducing a quota for the private sector in terms of employing people with disabilities?  As the public sector has met its 3 per cent obligation in this regard &mdash; I am not saying that should not be increased further &mdash; we should set a time limit for the private sector to reach a certain quota.  What are the Minister's plans in that regard?</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider his proposals to exempt the Defence Forces from the provisions of the Bill.  The exemption is based on the old notion that the Defence Forces have a separate structure of discipline and that they deal with matters within their military structure.  I am sure the Minister has received all those arguments in memoranda from the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>It would not make sense to exclude the Army from this legislation.  It should applies to the military structure in the same way it applies to the public sector.  I accept it may be necessary to treat the military structure in a slightly different manner, but the provisions of the Bill should apply to them in the same way as they will apply to civilians.  The Minister should re-examine this matter in detail before Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill defines disability in strict medical terms and Deputy Woods dealt with this in great detail.  Will the Minister ensure this definition is changed before the Bill is enacted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Theresa Ahearn talked about the number of female county managers, county secretaries and so on.  We can pass all the legislation we like, but if we do not change the Local Appointments Commission system the gender of the top people in that commission will not change significantly. People complain vociferously about politicians or Ministers being in charge of appointments, but if a Minister were responsible for the appointment of county managers, county secretaries, town clerks and others in the local government system, the force of public opinion would have ensured many years ago that there were more top class women in top positions in local authorities.  Women have not been able to come through the system because of the way it is structured.  This could be the best legislation ever enacted, but we must do more that merely pass <Col N="1038" /> it.  We must put in place systems that will ensure everybody is treated equally and that an old boys' network does not operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not hear my positive comments on the Bill.  In general, I welcome its principles. It is slightly complex but I hope that can be amended before it is enacted.  The Minister will have my support in improving it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is interesting that it is almost 20 years since the Dáil considered major legislation on equality.  At that time I was a young student in UCD and during the latter part of the then Government I started my teaching career.  One of my strongest motivations for getting involved in politics was the untimely and unseemly end in 1977 to an outstandingly good Government, particularly in terms of reforming legislation.  Many have come to repent the errors of 1977, it has become part of folk memory.  With that Government went a significant group of people who enthusiastically embraced the new expectations of European law and applied them to a society that was unwilling to receive them.  The matter of equality legislation was then postponed for many decades.</P>
      <P>Women inside and outside the House are conscious of how much Europe has done for them in terms of choice, moving forward our position and fundamental legal changes.  It is no accident that what is being inserted in law today is another European directive which encompasses and updates the provisions of earlier legislation.  This is stronger legislation and it must be welcomed.  It is interesting that we are discussing it on a day the labour force figures are being analysed.  They show a fascinating growth in employment yet the numbers of unemployed remain static.  The largest group that make up that section are women entering the workforce, not always in full-time employment but employment nonetheless of value to households where older men find it hard to obtain work.  Because of their caring abilities women tend to find work in the fast growing area of caring for children and the elderly, home duties and services generally.</P>
      <P>Given the transformation in society, many of us do not know where we will end up or how we will achieve the desired balance.  Even after 20 years of legislation to ensure equal pay, women are still getting only 80 per cent of a man's average income.  The Minister identified some of the issues relating to that, including the fact that men achieve higher salaries related to their skills and to overtime worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women have not solved the problem of how to combine family life with work but have moved from doing one defined task to trying to do two totally separate tasks.  The suggestion is that flexible working hours may solve the problem and, to a degree, politicians have flexible working hours. This means, for example, that I could see my children to school this morning and spend an hour at home with my baby.  I nipped out at lunchtime <Col N="1039" /> during the sos, saw the children in from school and sorted things out for the afternoon.  I then did some other magic act for an hour which enables me to continue working until 11 p.m.  When I come home at night I can think about tomorrow's lunches.  I have a supportive husband who works an eight hour day and can fill the gaps in the evenings.  There is no doubt, however, that women still carry the bulk of the burden in rearing their families and it will take an enormous societal change to alter that.</P>
    <P>An attempt is being made to bring about such changes in northern Europe by going further than the minimum we agreed in the EU Maternity and Employment Directive, which was a compromise. The Danes did not want to join the EU because they said it would lower their standards, whereas it had the opposite effect on us, dragging us forward. Some European countries have moved much further and in place of having optional parental leave they have led the way by introducing compulsory leave for fathers.  In some countries paternity leave comprises a couple of months in the first five years of a child's life and that is the direction for the future.</P>
    <P>So many issues are raised by an analysis of what has happened after 20 years of legislation that should have achieved certain things but did not.  The critical aspects are childcare and family responsibility yet this country has the worst childcare provisions.  Regular analyses produced by various European organisations show that we give the lowest financial support for children, with a total absence of tax relief and no State provision for childcare other than minimal support in deprived urban areas.  In such areas it is used as a family support mechanism for those in greatest difficulty to avoid taking children into care.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to give shape to the intent of the Bill, I hope he will also press for the kind of positive action that is needed.  One of the most critical decisions in the next three months will be whether something will be done for families and for childcare in the budget.  Having spent months analysing this and having rightly devoted a major section of the Bill, and huge sections of his speech, to the continuing problems of gender inequality, the Minister's voice should now be heard at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>An improvement in the forthcoming budget would be the single biggest thing the State could provide to ensure women will be able to take up more employment opportunities and that families will be supported by men and women being able to exercise a full range of choices.</P>
    <P>Overtime is important for women and is a key to success in putting an extra effort into work even it means staying for a few jars with the people who matter.  Being willing to take on the extra task is important.  I worked in schools where the priority of most of the female workforce was to get home and sort out their domestic arrangements. To provide childcare their precious salaries <Col N="1040" /> went either in being taxed again through PRSI or by hiring a child minder in the black economy. I welcome the section that exempts all kinds of positive action but a range of such actions is required to change the balance in favour of supporting women who are trying to work and rear their families.  That job should be made easier financially as well as in terms of time management to reduce stress.</P>
    <P>A wider package of education and other incentives should be developed including obligations on men to participate more as parents.  Rearing a family is more than a job for one person and one would almost need three people to perform all the functions involved in having a challenging career as well as a family.</P>
    <P>In addition to gender, the legislation deals with the handicapped, travellers and the issue of age. In his reply to this Second Stage debate I would like the Minister to deal with how the section on age discrimination will work.  The last speaker said that one will not be able to discriminate within the age group from 18 to 65 years, so what will still be allowed?  The Minister should spell out clearly how the section will work.  There is enormous discrimination and the Minister identified the group comprising men aged over 45 who find it impossible even to get a job interview. Does the Minister anticipate that many of the exemptions will apply in the context of age?</P>
    <P>The disabled and handicapped face huge difficulties. Many Deputies recently received correspondence from a group involved in developing employment opportunities for the disabled.  It has identified how far we are behind other countries where in many workplaces there is not only a 3 per cent employment target for the disabled but also a growing practice of making large sections of employment available to the handicapped as well as supports.  The Minister said there would be an obligation to provide that where possible. Will that sort of practice, which is a feature of the workplace in other countries, be encouraged more here?  Does the Minister see a role for his Department in some of these positive action programmes?</P>
    <P>Travellers await this legislation with interest, as they awaited the provision of the Equal Status Bill, but for them equality in employment is a dream which is a generation or two further on than it was for women.  Travellers, in their study groups and through representatives of the Irish Traveller Movement and Pavee Point at meetings with members of the Select Committee on Social Affairs, have identified specific initial steps taken by local authorities and other Government bodies to employ travellers in services.  While many of the exemptions may be controversial I welcome the exemption which allows for positive action in areas of traditional discrimination where there is a lack of representation of certain groups, whether at different levels or in the workforce in the case of the disabled and travellers.  Inevitably this Bill will need to be revised many times because, as changes occur over time, many of the <Col N="1041" /> exemptions that are appropriate now will not, I hope, be appropriate in the future.</P>
    <P>I was interested in a point raised by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe this morning about illness, in particular mental illness, and how a person suffering from it can be burdened and tagged.  It is an interesting issue to which I would like the Minister to respond.  We are only now modernising our thinking from our traditional attitude towards people suffering from any form of mental or psychiatric illness and it is worth considering whether that category should be included in the Bill.  Those suffering from mental illness can experience real problems at work.  If people feel they cannot be open about the problem of mental illness, it may lead to secrecy that is bad for the health of society and has further negative effects on the workforce.  The more openness there is about it, the more people will become used to it. The Bill can be helpful only if it provides for positive action in dealing with discrimination against travellers, the disabled and the handicapped.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to hear on today's Order of Business that the equal status Bill will see the light of day before Christmas.  It is very much part and parcel of the same body of legislation as this Bill.  We look forward to its introduction and to enthusiastic support for its important provisions from all sides of the House. It deals with a wider area than employment, where there is extreme direct discrimination against people who are deprived of equal opportunities not only by default or indirect means but specifically on the grounds of sex or being members of the travelling community.  Occasionally disabilities are excluded from normal areas of recreation in terms of finance and other factors.  In welcoming this Bill, we will help to begin to address such discrimination.  We look forward to the next debate on equality legislation which I hope will be early in the New Year.  I hope the Minister will confirm that these interconnected Bills will be on the Statute Book in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Bill.  Like other Deputies, I have received representations from individuals concerned about the exclusion provisions and how they will work, particularly in the area of education.  As they have been thrashed out by a number of speakers, I will not go into them in detail, but I will listen with interest to the Minister's response to them.  I am sure those difficulties which will not be easy to resolve will be tasted out on Committee Stage.  The desire of some institutions to maintain a certain kind of ethos is understandable, but squaring it with the rights of people to their individual freedom is difficult. The Solomons in the House will be bending their minds to it during the next few weeks and it is an area that will be discussed actively on Committee Stage.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to the initial questions raised.  I welcome the Bill, look forward to it passing into law and to our moving on rapidly to deal with the equal status Bill.</P>

      <P>I join Members in welcoming this legislation.  Having listened to my party leader speak when he was dealing with this matter in the initial stages in 1987, I am aware that this is a long awaited Bill.  However, I hope the wait has been worthwhile and that improvements have been made in the legislation down through the years. As Deputy Bertie Ahern said, consideration was given to the inclusion of a comparator clause, particularly in regard to differentiation in pay between men and women and conditions of employment.  Like other Deputies, I would like to know why that clause, which was included in the original provision for legislation which dates back to 1987, has not been retained.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the Bill and our spokesperson, Deputy Woods, for his contribution. We will be able to have a more productive debate on Committee Stage because while all Deputies generally welcome the Bill there are many issues we will want to discuss.  I admire the Minister for many of the initiatives he has taken in areas in the past in addressing discrimination and dealing with inequalities in our society, whether in the area of occupational injury, the disabled, travellers or other similar issues.  I hope he will deal with amending the electoral Acts which was discussed on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>The Department of Equality and Law Reform can integrate a good deal of the work undertaken by other Departments and can be a great catalyst for change.  If the Minister introduces welcome legislation, that is good, but in some instances other Departments seek changes in legislation which may chip away at the legislation the Minister wants to bring before us.  Some semi-State bodies are not availing of opportunities for equality, whether in the area of employment or within regions of the country.  For example, industrial policy is not equal and as highlighted by the Western Development Partnership Board, which deals with the area from Donegal to County Clare, including the province of Connacht, there is a particular neglect of the western region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a great supporter of the Industrial Development Authority but I, as I am sure most Deputies, consider that it would like the most effective distribution of development across the country.  We are dealing with employment equality legislation, but we have a serious unemployment problems.  The chairman of the IDA stated in its 1995 report that there are large projects which, by their nature, need the scale and range of people's skills and the support services and infrastructure of large urban areas.  He also stated that as the infrastructure and support levels required to operate such industries arise and as the diversity of skills required increase, such investments gravitate towards the larger population centres.  That type of statement is worrying because the chairman stated that we must provide jobs in the larger urban areas which have big populations.  I am not trying to start an east versus west debate this evening but if 20 per cent of the population lives in the western region, we should <Col N="1043" /> seek to locate at least 20 per cent of all IDA Ireland jobs there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures from the Western Development Partnership Board show that we are not getting the type of investment necessary for the population of the region.  Some 57 major investments were announced by IDA Ireland in 1995, excluding the financial services in Dublin. However, only eight were located in the Western region from Donegal to Clare.  There is a major growth in Galway, Letterkenny and Castlebar, but we must look at the rural areas if we want equality of opportunity.  In fact, only two projects were located in the Western region if we take Galway city out of the equation.  I support the Minister's statement about access to employment and equality of opportunity, but the first thing we need is investment.</P>
      <P>I make the same point about our road structure. Two major roads, the N17 from Galway to Sligo and the N16 from Sligo to Blacklion, are not included in the roads programme up to 1999. We should not forget our national routes when planning a national roads programme.  The Minister has a difficult job because he must deal with other Departments and agencies in the public sector which have a different type of policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the difficulties in trying to get work faced by people over 45 years of age and who have been over two years unemployed. They have a chance of one in ten of being re-employed.  This legislation is trying to tackle that area.  In addition, people with disabilities find it even more difficult to get works.  I hope a quota system can be put in place in the private sector to help these people.</P>
      <P>Harassment at work was mentioned by many Ministers in the past and I am glad this Bill refers to it.  Harassment or bullying often starts in schools.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to women's status in the workplace.  Deputy Bertie Ahern mentioned the difference between men's and women's earnings. It is scandalous that women receive only 80 per cent of men's earnings.  There are few women in management positions in local organisations and finboards, public and private organisations and financial institutions.  I was a member of a Galway local authority where there were no women in the management structure.  There has never been a woman chief executive officer, programme manager or hospital manager in the Western Health Board.  Every hospital matron in the Western Health Board region is a woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> Is the Local Appointments Commission preventing well qualified women from getting good positions?  For 21 years the Western Health Board was unable to get an orthodontist for Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  Eventually, after 21 years, a woman was appointed to that position.  I blame structures such as the Local Appointments Commission or, in the case of consultant staff, Comhairle na nOspideal for this because it delays appointments.  Many people feel these organisations should be abolished but others think that if a decision is made locally, the best qualified people will not get the jobs.  I do not agree with that view.  It is disgraceful that there are delays in making appointments.  The Local Appointments Commission must change its procedures if we want well qualified women to get good positions, particularly in local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the difficulty of reconciling work and family life, which has been discussed over the years.  The question of providing childcare facilities for working parents needs to be taken more seriously than it has been up to now.  Some Minister or Department must provide funding for childcare facilities to help working parents if we want it to be a success.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the number of women on State boards, which stands at 26 per cent but which he hopes to increase to 40 per cent.  He also referred to European Union requirements.  I do not want to be branded a Euro sceptic, but I hope we do not change things because of EU law.  It would be nice to think we made changes ahead of Europe.</P>
    <P>I support all measures in relation to equality. However, there is some concern that when we try to tackle these problems we will introduce more regulations which will lead to inequalities.  That point was brought home to me by Army representatives. PDFORRA feels it is totally excluded from the Bill.  The Minister should not exclude certain groups.  I know there are security concerns but this legislation should apply to the Army, the Garda Síochána, the prison service and religious, educational and medical institutions, which are excluded.  I do not see why, except for security reasons, they are omitted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Department of Enterprise and Employment and IDA policy and the Minister raised the issue of access to employment. I refer to this matter particularly as it relates to the tourism industry.  There are many jobs in tourism and as we move towards the end of this century there will be even further jobs in that area.  Public transport is very important in terms of tourism as well as access to work.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that it costs more to travel from Galway to Dublin than from Dublin to Galway.  I am sure the Chair is aware of that because the position relating to southern and south western areas is probably similar. Those involved in public transport are not as <Col N="1045" /> keen to transport people to the west or south as they are to transport them to Dublin.</P>

These issues have been taken up in the past by Deputies, particularly those from the west, and I hope the Minister, who is the catalyst for change in many areas of equality, will communicate with the other Ministers in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the position of people with physical and mental illness.  I hope the Minister for Social Welfare will bring in legislation to deal with inequality in pensions, which is not covered in this Bill and which is of great importance, particularly to the self-employed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Employment Equality Bill, another major milestone in the remarkable career of the Minister, Deputy Taylor.  In the last four years key elements of equality have been brought into law by this outstanding Minister whom I congratulate.  There has been a long struggle for this type of legislation. Down the years the Labour Party tried to move forward on aspects of equality but was held back by more conservative parties.  In 1974 our former Leader, Michael O'Leary, introduced the first Bill dealing with equality.  In the last quarter of a century we have moved away from an unequal, patriarchal, authoritarian society and the Labour Party played a fundamental role in that regard. This legislation is another outstanding achievement in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to introduce the legislation at this time.  A recent labour force survey shows that up to 37 per cent of the workforce is occupied by women.  With the number of women going into the workforce increasing by 20 per cent in recent years, women now represent almost 500,000 of the 1.3 million people at work, the largest number in the history of the State.  In many cases however there is still discrimination against women.  As the Minister said, women working in the manufacturing industry receive only 70 per cent of the earnings of their male counterparts.  A recent ESRI study showed that overall women's earnings are only 80 per cent of those of men.  The difference <Col N="1046" /> was attributed to discrimination and inequality. On behalf of all women, this is a historic day.</P>
    <P>The world of work is changing dramatically, with different work structures, such as job sharing, part-time work and so on.  I agree with the Minister that we have come to a fundamental crossroads in terms of gender equality.  Constant vigilance is required because there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of widespread discrimination on pay and conditions, particularly in low paid jobs.  The Minister has been responsible for much legislation in this area such as the Maternity Protection Act and the Adoptive Leave Act and he supported the EU directive on parental leave.  He took the initiative in terms of getting women into key decision-making positions on State boards and as a result of his efforts the role of women has increased to 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>The question could be raised &mdash; this is a matter for which all of us have responsibility &mdash; of why women make up only 13 per cent of the membership of this House, a much lower percentage than in countries such as Denmark, Finland and Sweden where about 45 per cent of members are women.  This legislation is a further step in bringing about greater equality.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of the provisions of the Bill, particularly section 10 dealing with advertising. Two years ago Dublin Corporation published an advertisement in the press stating that the competition for firefighters was restricted to men. An initiative taken by the Labour Party at the time resulted in that practice being ended.  This legislation is very clear in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 11, which deals with training, is closely associated with the introduction by the Minister for Education of the programme, Breaking the Cycle.  Under that programme, introduced in Darndale and Belcamp in my constituency last week, an attempt will be made to bring children from deprived backgrounds, girls and travellers in particular, into mainstream education, for which the Minister deserves to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is wide-ranging will outlaw discrimination on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race or membership of the travelling community.  It deals with such issues as access, conditions, training, promotion, advertisements and collective agreements in the public and private sectors.  It also deals with the issue of membership of professional bodies and trade unions.  This is an indication that the Minister has tried to resolve some of the major problems.</P>
    <P>The National Women's Council has criticised certain aspects of the Bill.  It has complained that no reference to pensions has been included.  As others have indicated, remuneration covers both pay and pensions.  This is a matter which will be addressed by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    <P>The council has expressed the view that section 23 which deals with sexual harassment in the workplace should be extended to include sexual harassment outside it, which may involve people <Col N="1047" /> of the same sex.  The Minister deserves to be congratulated as this is the first time such a comprehensive definition has been included in legislation. This can only be described as the most despicable form of discrimination and has to be stamped out.  Strong measures are being provided for which will be enforced by the director and new Authority.  I, therefore, ask Noreen Byrne and her colleagues on the council to look at the Bill more carefully.  It is a triumph for the women's movement in the cause of gender equality.</P>
    <P>I welcome the detailed and precise way in which the Minister defines indirect discrimination on the gender ground in section 22.  If a person in any of the categories mentioned in the Bill is discriminated against, the matter can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to three categories in particular on whose behalf we can take positive action.  I welcome the attempts made in programmes such as the jobs initiative to discriminate in favour of the over 50s who are unemployed.  Is it possible in legislation outlawing discrimination to specify particular age groups?  There is an old saying in sport that if somebody is good enough they are old enough.  In Norway, to address the pensions problems retirement age has been extended to 67. A number of our colleagues, particularly in the Fianna Fail Party, have announced that they will retire from politics at the next election &mdash; this is a specialised and unique job &mdash; but in the longer term should there be a blanket retirement age? Is ageism another form of discrimination?</P>
    <P>On the employment of people with disabilities in the public service, the 3 per cent rule has not been adhered to.  Are the Houses of the Oireachtas a microcosm of the public service in that one will not see many disabled service attendants, ushers or general workers?  When they appeared recently before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs representatives of the Rehabilitation Institute and the Centre for Independent Living made a strong case for proper access to jobs throughout the public service.  While I welcome the measures provided for in the Bill we need to look at the matter more carefully.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Travellers, under the chairmanship of my colleague, Senator Mary Kelly, has produced a fine report.  I come from an area in which there is a large number of traveller families who are being housed and integrated slowly into local communities while retaining their own culture.  I welcome the measures provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>My own trade union, the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, has expressed reservations about the Bill.  In a lengthy response the Minister indicated it is not true that Church-run first and second level schools are exempt under the provisions of equality law; they are subject to constitutional restraints.  There is a fear that young teachers in particular will find it difficult <Col N="1048" /> to make a start in their chosen career and may be discriminated against.  The Minister has tried to reach a reasonable accommodation in a sensitive area where there are competing rights.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the new Authority and the clear definition of victimisation.  If it can be demonstrated that a worker was dismissed or penalised for taking action he or she will have the right of redress.  The decision to create the new position of director of equality investigations is reasonable.  In conjunction with the Labour Court and the Circuit Court, the person appointed will attempt to resolve issues as they arise.  Provision has also been made for the appointment of an equality mediation officer.  If both parties to a dispute are willing, it can be resolved quietly and privately with assistance.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for collective agreements which may have an adverse effect on the grounds of gender.  This is a valuable part of the legislation.  The Minister has given a proactive role to the Employment Equality Agency.  It will be valuable to have the agency examine current practice in industries and identify low pay industries where there seems to be widespread gender discrimination in terms of pay and conditions.  It should be possible to draft codes of practice and insist on equality reviews, audits and action plans.</P>
    <P>A colleague on Dublin Corporation, Councillor Mary Freehill, has pursued this issue.  Our equality sub-committee examines on an ongoing basis the advancement of the 6,500 female staff in Dublin Corporation.  An equality audit was carried out recently which noted the progress women are making to senior positions in our local authority.  I recognise the value of this and I welcome it in the legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a comment about cost in the briefing documentation on the new legislation but cost benefit analyses can be done in regard to any development.  Many of the more egalitarian societies, particularly some of the Scandinavian countries, do not discriminate on the basis of gender, disability or ethnic origin.  That is the type of society to which we must aspire.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this excellent legislation which adds lustre to an outstanding ministerial career.</P>

      <P>I welcome this measure and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  I was somewhat sceptical of some of the rhetoric at the beginning of the Minister's contribution when he talked about the open, pluralist and European society in which we now live in contrast to the closed and homogeneous society over which I presume our party had the honour of presiding in previous decades.  With all Members of the House I recognise that life today is made up of very diverse elements and measures such as this are essential to establish for the population a standard of citizenship, particularly in an increasingly secular age.  When traditional, moral and religious assumptions have changed so much it is of vital importance that measures like this are put forward in this House to establish a standard of citizenship, mutual respect and tolerance that will allow Ireland to evolve as a stable political entity.</P>
      <P>When I heard Deputy Broughan talking about conservative parties and patriarchal societies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I wondered to whom he was referring because the founder of my party, when he brought in the Constitution of this State in 1937, listed the fundamental rights of the citizen. The first clause inserted was an express declaration and recognition that all citizens as human persons are equal before the law.  There has been a considerable gloss of judicial interpretation on that clause through the years but it is clear from our experience with that provision that judicial enforcement of equality guarantees is not the most satisfactory method of addressing this particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1950s the United States Supreme Court sought to establish, correctly, the principle of racial equality and equal racial access to schools in the famous decision of Brown and the Board of Education.  There was a huge reaction against the United States Supreme Court among certain sections of American opinion.  One view is that the legitimacy and authority of the court was damaged, although I would have welcomed that <Col N="1050" /> decision.  The measures which had to be adopted to implement it were far reaching and caused great difficulties for the Executive.</P>
    <P>If we are to provide for equality by installments it is preferable that we do so through a practical thought out measure such as this which spells out in details for employers, workers, trade union organisers and other persons concerned with access to the workplace the precise rights and duties of persons in this context.  The practical enforcement measures the Minister has provided for in the Bill and which build upon the measures already in place in the Employment Equality Act, 1977, afford an easier method of access for the aggrieved individual than recourse to the courts. I welcome that aspect of the measures without reservation.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister the reason we must have an employment equality Bill this year, which I assume will become an Act in due course, and refer to a previous Act of 1977.  Why was the opportunity not taken on this occasion to consolidate the two measures?  In our computerised age the consolidation of legislation must be a far easier task than in former times.  Whenever a measure comes before us which is substantial in character, as this measure is, consideration should be given to consolidating the measures on the topic.  That ensures ease of access to the legislation for the individual citizen who wishes to study it.  It means also that legislation becomes less and less the happy hunting ground for lawyers and more and more information which is intelligible and understandable to the individual citizen.</P>
    <P>In regard to this legislation I presume it is too late at this stage, given the procedures of the House, to recast the measure in that form but it is important to consolidate legislation so that the code of rights and duties in any particular branch of the law is easily available to the citizen.</P>
    <P>In regard to discrimination on the grounds of gender and marital status, the Minister is building on the work already done in the 1977 Act.  I note he has taken into account various comments and suggestions that have been made about the operation of that Act through the years.  This debate affords us an opportunity to review progress made in that area.</P>
    <P>There has been a movement towards the greater participation of females in the workforce and towards more flexible patterns of employment at the workplace but much work remains to be done if we are to secure real and substantial equality in this area.  Substantial inequalities remain in relation to patterns of pay, conditions of employment and promotional opportunities. Much of that ground has been covered already in the debate and I do not want to go over it in any great detail other than to say if we are to make progress in this area it is important to encourage the greatest possible participation by the female population in the workforce, whether on a part-time or full-time basis or whatever basis is most convenient.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> I want to refer to the operation of the FÁS schemes in relation to community employment and their impact on the question of female participation in the workforce. All of us agree that the community employment schemes have been marvellous, encouraging greater participation in the workforce.  They correspond to that third sector which economic commentators have recently argued must exist in modern society, where the public sector &mdash; as we in Fianna Fáil know too well after the 1977 election manifesto &mdash; is unable to absorb the demand for full employment, while there is a paucity of employment in the private sector because of increasing technology.</P>
    <P>I object to the existing discrimination against married women and widows regarding community employment schemes.  The present arrangement means that a married woman who wishes to return to the workforce, having cared for her children for a number of years, has to be in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit before she qualifies for such a scheme.  That is highly discriminatory.  If that requirement was abolished and a requirement put in place that such a person should sign on, it would be equally discriminatory.  The honest person signing on is doing so with the intention of making him or herself available for employment.  That may not be the case in regard to a married woman whose option is to care for her children at home for a period of years but more should be done to ease the path of married women who wish to resume employment in the workplace and community employment schemes are a vital bridge in achieving it.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill purports to extend the prohibition on discrimination to vocational training. Does FÁS fall within the scope of that section?  The Minister may not wish to incite dispute or litigation or foment dispute through an interpretation of the measure but does this bind FÁS?  It is an important issue in relation to female participation in the workforce.  It may seem somewhat removed from the more abstract point of comparators and their use in this legislation.</P>
    <P>As an aside, I was fascinated by the style of statutory draftsmanship and the use of alphabetical descriptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy would like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving towards a very abstract style of legislation.  If Deputy Broughan were still here I would point out that it is a first for the Labour Party which is introducing novel forms of parliamentary draftsmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disability is another topic that naturally arises under this measure.  I dealt with gender and marital status and now turn to where the Bill breaks radical new ground on disability.  A number of Members raised the issue of participation of disabled <Col N="1052" /> persons in the workforce.  I share the concern that while a measure has been adopted for the public sector, none has yet been proposed for the private sector.  I appreciate it does not strictly arise on this Bill but it appears to be the Government's declared intent to attempt the renegotiation of a programme between the trade unions, employers and the Government on pay, conditions and work.  There should be a definite commitment from the private sector to introduce a quota or guaranteed section of private sector employment for persons with a disability in that programme.  It would be disappointing if the anxiety of the present Government parties to introduce measures of reduction in taxation for all taxpayers obscured this vital need to reserve a definite allocation of job opportunities in the private sector for disabled persons.  This is an issue all Members meet every day in their daily work and a great deal of progress could be made on it.  This is another group, like the married women I mentioned earlier, who need practical measures to ensure their participation.</P>
    <P>Discrimination on the grounds of age is another area raised in this Bill and the Minister's selection of the ages 18 to 65 as the basis for the group to be protected.  Our school attendance requirement ends at 16 and there a great number of persons in the workplace over that age.  The Minister should look at that before Committee Stage.  One does not have full citizenship rights until the age of 18 but the Bill is concerned with the workplace.  In that context the Minister should look at the younger age definition in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also look at those over the age of 65 because many of them are fully fit and capable of employment.  Why should discrimination against them not be dealt with in this measure?  Is it necessary to the Bill?  There may be practical problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I might have to declare my interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We would never believe that of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not realised we had moved to the era of gerontocratic statesmanship.</P>
      <P>Religion is another aspect of this Bill.  I am disappointed Deputy Broughan is not here because this was presented as a very radical, reforming, socialist measure.  However, one of the great features of Irish life is the traditional respect for and place of religion.  The Labour Party has drawn a line in the sand with which I do not disagree.  It is understandable but strange to hear the Labour Party describe it as a radical reforming measure when it recognises certain realities.  The Minister might also look at a code of practice for the regulation of denominational bodies in consultation with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 contains the definition of discrimination and the discriminatory grounds.  Religious belief is expressly stated as a discriminatory <Col N="1053" /> ground.  I welcome that.  In recent years, as Ireland becomes more diverse, we have seen new religious sects with laudable objects and spiritual purposes, not just those with which we are familiar from the public press.  At times they can be discriminated against because of their novelty. This Bill contains valuable protection for these groups but why does the definition of religion not extend to conscientious belief?  Discrimination against a person on religious grounds must necessarily extend to discriminating against a person on conscientious grounds.  I find it difficult to draw that distinction.  In addition, without elevating ourselves too much, the Minister might examine the associated issue of discrimination against a person on the grounds of political belief.  Again, I would like to hear the Minister's views on whether that issue might also be looked at.  I appreciate that in drawing up a measure of this type a Minister must proceed with great care, and entertain the views of a great range of persons, associations and organisations.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the points I have made.  I welcome the measure, if not some of the exaggerated rhetoric associated with it, and I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Laoighis-Offaly</i>): I will not be exuberant or outrageous in anything I say.  My contribution will, in many respects, be in the same vein as that of Deputy Lenihan.  I welcome this measure but seek to tease out a number of the issues contained in it.</P>
      <P>This legislation comes from a Department of Equality and Law Reform which was set up by my party in Government.  The fact it has taken almost two decades to make advances on the legislation introduced in the 1970s shows that the establishment of that Department was very much needed.  There would not have been any great degree of political dissent in the House on any of these issues.  At the same time, there was no great political priority being given to them.  The types of measures which my colleague, Deputy Broughan, listed would not have been introduced without expressly establishing a Department to deal with them.  When they were introduced they received a large measure of political consensus and agreement which is reflective of the fact that our society is becoming much more open, much more pluralist in practice, and much more at ease with itself in dealing with a range of opinions.</P>
      <P>I am glad this legislation, which relates to employment, forbids discrimination on nine specified grounds &mdash; gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  In principle none of us would disagree with that but in practice we can see clear cases of discrimination in our constituencies on all those grounds on which this Bill, when it becomes law, will give people some method to redress discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding setting up the Employment Authority, as I said in debates on similar legislation, it <Col N="1054" /> is an easy matter to pass legislation but quite another to make the members of the public aware of it and ensure there is back-up, resources, support and access points to allow people to enforce the rights we confer on them through legislation. It is important to address that as much as the terms of the legislation.  I welcome that the Employment Authority is being set up and ask the Minister to ensure that when this Bill becomes law the positive message regarding rights of employment which is contained in it is disseminated widely and quickly to people through local trade union offices, citizens' information centres, unemployment resource centres and the many different community information and community service organisations.  I hope access to the Authority and to forms of redress will be available on a local basis without people necessarily having to go to Dublin, Cork, Galway or any of the other larger cities to avail of it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension in this Bill of the scope of the legislation.  Not alone are we increasing the grounds on which discrimination will be forbidden, we are also increasing the range of areas which are covered by it.  We are including in the Bill employers, collective agreements and advertisements in relation to employment.  Very importantly, in this day and age, we are including employment agencies and vocational training, an area I worked in for a number of years before coming to this House.  Although many training courses are set up with funds from Europe or from the National Exchequer to address specific forms of discrimination and disadvantage in our society, in many respects it is important to look at them to ensure that they are achieving what they are intended to achieve and that they are not having unintended side effects in other areas.  It is important that the various courses run by FÁS, Rehab, the NRB and other agencies are subjected to a fair amount of scrutiny as are the areas of employment that are covered in it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the widening of the scope of comparison for equal pay compared with the 1974 Act.  Like existing legislation, we are talking here about equal pay for work of equal value.  I am glad it is being made expressly a term of every employment contract.  In the 1974 Act comparison had to be made now with a person in employment at the same place.  This Bill extends that.  The comparison will be made now with the person who is employed to do like work by the same employers or by an associated employer.  Criticisms have been levelled at this Bill that it does not extend the basis for comparison widely enough. However, in practice in other countries one finds that, while in theory many of them aim to extend the basis of comparison, in practice that has not happened.  What is proposed here is a practical step.  I hope it will be implemented and if it is, can be examined to see if it can be widened further.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill includes a definition of sexual harassment in Irish law for the first time.  I am aware of criticisms that this only extends the protection beyond the workplace to employment in <Col N="1055" /> its broader sense.  We are, after all, talking here about a Bill which relates to employment.  I am confident, now that the Minister has defined sexual harassment in relation to employment, that this or a similar definition can be taken up in other areas of law and in Bills produced by the Department of Justice and other Departments. The Bill outlaws sexual harassment in the workplace and in the course of employment.  That is very important.  The definition of sexual harassment is broad.  It includes all sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating actions involving acts of physical intimacy, spoken words gestures or the production, display or circulation of written material or pictures, or requests for sexual favours. I ask the Minister to look at the concern raised in relation to the definition in section 18 (1).  It appears that what is covered is sexual harassment by a person of the opposite sex.  I ask the Minister to re-examine it to ensure that the small but equally objectionable number of cases of same sex sexual harassment are also outlawed.</P>
    <P>Those of us who had the opportunity to visit the <i>JFK</i> when it was moored off Deputy Keogh's constituency in July will have seen that an organisation such as the US Navy has no problem with this, and I would like to see the Minister give a time commitment for the removal of that exclusion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the specific provision which allows for special beneficial treatment of women connected with pregnancy and maternity.  There has been some misunderstanding of this provision in some of the criticisms I have read of the Bill.  I do not believe the Minister is saying here that men should not get adoptive or parental leave.  His record shows quite the opposite.  It is allowing that women who are having children or adopting children have special needs and it should not be against the law to provide for this.  It is a simple and sensible provision.  The Minister has already put an Adoptive Leave Bill through this House. I welcome his commitment regarding the EU directive on parental leave.  As somebody who would have liked to avail of such leave in the past number of weeks, I hope that measure will be forthcoming and that it will apply also to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is a most significant development. I compliment the Minister on stating specifically and clearly the wide range of grounds on which discrimination in employment will be forbidden.  I am also glad it provides for positive measures to be taken.  When equality legislation is introduced its interpretation can sometimes prohibit the positive actions which must be taken to promote equality in society.  I welcome the express provision for proactive measures to promote equal opportunities between men and women and to integrate into employment people over 50 years of age, people with disabilities and members of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>It is important, in the context of prohibition of discrimination on grounds of race, membership of <Col N="1056" /> the travelling community and family status, that harassment in the workplace is outlawed.  I hope this provision will be included in other legislation. We have all heard of cases where people were harassed or subjected to bullying in the workplace because, for example, they were born outside the marital relationship.  Where travellers have been lucky enough to secure employment it has not been easy for them to sustain it because of the remarks and behaviour sometimes directed at them.  The small number of people whose skin colour is different from the majority of the population have been subjected to harassment in education, employment and society.  This is an important measure and the protections for these people in employment should be extended to them in all other aspects of their activity in society.</P>
    <P>Obviously, exclusions are necessary in areas such as personal health or social services.  We must be open to people's sensitivities in those areas and provide for them.  However, I am aware of a person who was refused entry to the Garda Síochána as a result of the differential height requirement for men as opposed to women. There is no reason that differential should be continued. It is a relic of the past.  It is accepted that male and female members of the Garda Síochána are equal in all respects and it is unwise to continue that discrimination.  The Minister should consult again the Minister for Justice and the Garda authorities in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have reservations &mdash; but few helpful suggestions &mdash; about the exceptions on religious grounds.  The Bill makes provision for discrimination by religious, educational and medical institutions run by religious bodies where discrimination is essential to maintain the religious ethos of the institution or where it is reasonable to avoid offending religious sensitivities of members or clients.  Religious bodies and institutions play an important role in society.  Historically, they have been important in education and medicine and currently they play an important role in social awareness and community activity.</P>
    <P>This House should make proper provision in legislation for members of religious organisations and people with religious beliefs to exercise their beliefs as freely as possible.  However, &ldquo;religious ethos&rdquo; should be better defined.  The word &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; is comparable to a piece of elastic and I am concerned that the Bill's provision in this regard will be a means for lawyers to make plenty of money in endeavouring to decide what is covered by the term.  Attention to this section on Committee State could avoid problems in the future.</P>
    <P>To complicate matters further, according to my inexpert reading of the Bill, discrimination by religious bodies will not be permissible in the cases of gender, age or disability but will be allowed on the grounds of marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, race and membership of the travelling community.  It is hard to understand how a religious body might <Col N="1057" /> wish to discriminate on most of those grounds. The provisions, although well intentioned, are wide and could be open to abuse.  There have been cases in the spheres of education and medicine where religious institutions have overstepped the mark.</P>
    <P>The provision should be clarified and that can only be done by basing the exception on grounds of religious belief because the other criteria on which discrimination is permissible involve some sort of judgment of external appearances by others.  Religion is about one's belief and spiritual outlook on life.  They are internal but expressed in various external ways.  To make judgments on the basis of whether a person is married, their family status, whether they are gay or straight, black or white, a member of the travelling community or a settled person will prove extremely difficult in practice.  That provision should be teased out on Committee Stage and something more specific should be brought before the House on later stages.  It should, on the one hand, recognise religious freedoms and the importance of religious institutions and, on the other hand, balance individual rights against it and ensure that genuine exceptions on religious grounds are not used improperly or stretched to the point where people's individual liberties are not protected to the extent they should.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important legislation.  The tenor of the debate so far indicates that it will have a constructive passage through the Oireachtas.  The Minister must ensure that when the Bill is law it will be made widely known and that the forms of redress available will be inexpensive, accessible and effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill although I express reservations about certain provisions, particularly section 37 which deals with exclusions.  The Bill is an improvement on earlier equality legislation.  Fianna Fáil has always been anxious to promote equality in employment legislation and other areas of life and in ensuring social progression and equality of opportunity for people in all sectors of society, irrespective of religious belief or marital status.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers have spoken about women participating in the workforce.  There is still considerable concern about the lack of progress in that area, particularly with regard to equal pay.  The Bill does not adequately deal with that issue and does not strengthen obligatory conditions to ensure that employers pay proper wages and so forth.  More importantly, we do not yet have the infrastructure to facilitate the increased participation of women in the workforce. Denmark, for example, has a sophisticated and comprehensive early childhood education infrastructure.  The provision of childcare is at a sophisticated level and well resourced.  There is a correlation between that and a high participation by women in the workforce.  The two are directly related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> Early education and childcare in this country is still at an embryonic stage.  There have been State initiatives through Early Start but the great momentum in early education has come from women in communities through the IPPA and community pre-school playgroups, of which there are over 1,800.  They receive little State support in the shape of meagre funds from the health boards.  The figures for 1994, which were the latest available, show that only £2.5 million was provided for the 1,800 community playgroups throughout the country.  That does not take into account the number of Montessori schools, private or otherwise, naonraí and other such facilities.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about increasing participation of women in the workforce we need a radical and dynamic national policy on early education and child care.  There is no co-ordination between Government Departments and no harmony between the voluntary community sectors and the early start programme.  We all know the history of the conflict that developed between the early start programme and the community playschools. There could have been proper facilitation of both programmes had there been proper consultation in advance and if people had not felt threatened by the imposition of the early start programme. It is important that we adequately resource early childhood education and bring all strands under the one umbrella under a definitive co-ordinated State policy.  The Denmark model is worth looking at.  That country has a high percentage of women in the workforce and operates an effective child care system.</P>
    <P>I endorse the comments of my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, about the difficulty experienced by many women in accessing community employment projects and other FÁS programmes. Access to a course or to a place of employment at FÁS is dependent on social welfare record, the length of time one has been unemployed and the length of time on the live register.  For historic reasons many women would not have a long record.  It is important that people are trained but many women find it difficult to re-enter the workplace through a training process. We need to broaden the FÁS provision to facilitate the involvement of women.  Widows who do not draw lone parent allowance find it extremely difficult to access FÁS courses and community employment programmes.  There are specific courses but they are not adequate to cater for the numbers who apply.  We have all had representations from women who are anxious to participate in courses but there were no places.</P>
    <P>In regard to age discrimination I echo the earlier sentiments expressed by my colleagues.  It is important that we make this statement so I welcome the provision in the Bill.  In the past 20 years there has been an appalling age discrimination. As the economy developed with the decline of smoke stack industries and traditional large manufacturing concerns, many people aged 40 and 50 were made redundant.  Their depression <Col N="1059" /> was exacerbated considerably by the reality that they need not apply for any more jobs simply because of their age.  Society and employers generally were foolish in that regard.</P>
    <P>Age and experienced still counts for much. Before I entered the House I worked in a secondary school.  The principal fought a long battle to retain his position but eventually he had to give way at the age of 70.  This gave me an insight into the value of age.  That man's life was his school and his contribution was outstanding.  When he passed away the school lost its dynamism and its spirit and closed a short time after.  Modern society tends to write people off after a certain age.</P>
    <P>A former leader, Mr. Charles Haughey, mentioned the Chinese who have a totally different perception of age.  It is dangerous to dwell on the Chinese in terms of political leadership.  Some people were worried when he stated that Chinese leaders go on and on.  It is important that we reevaluate age profile and the contribution older people can make in the workplace.  New industrial concerns can benefit from experienced older people.  They can help set up industry and get it off the ground.</P>
    <P>The section on disability is disappointing.  We have received considerable representations from many people complaining about the medical definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; and should scrap it.  The provisions outlined here could reinforce inequality and lead to abuse and unnecessary harassment of workers generally.  The definition needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>The public sector should lead the way in terms of equality and opening up more opportunities for people with disabilities.  It has failed to do that in a number of areas.  The success rate of some local authorities varies in terms of meeting the 3 per cent quota.  It is a disgrace after all these years that we still have not achieved that target in the public sector.  I support our spokesperson's amendment to the effect that we should extend that 3 per cent target to the private sector, but it would have to be discussed in the context of the social partnership.  If we are serious about the issue this is a laudable way to proceed.</P>
    <P>There is much concern about the section dealing with disabilities and access to the workplace. While there is talk about integrating disabled children into schools and enabling teachers with disabilities to teach in schools it is pathetic that some schools do not have basic access ramps.  I have heard the most appalling stories, as has Deputy Keogh who is the education spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, about children being unable to go to school because of lack of basic facilities to enable them to get into the school building and to be comfortable in the classroom.  I do not understand why the Government does not fund the installation of the most basic facilities in schools and other public buildings such as hospitals to allow people with disabilities proper access.  Unless a clear commitment <Col N="1060" /> is reflected in the provision of adequate resources we stand indicted and our sincerity on this issue is open to question.  As with all legislation, we must provide the resources to ensure its objectives are realised.</P>
    <P>Section 37 excludes certain religious, educational or medical bodies from the provisions of the Bill.  In education there is considerable concern about this section.  If an employer can show discrimination is essential or reasonable in the maintenance of the religious ethos the employer can discriminate on the grounds of religion, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, race and the travelling community.  It is difficult to understand how such a wide-ranging provision is included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister would do well to inform the House what negotiations or consultations took place which led to this provision.  What representation did he receive, from whom and what was the content of those representations?  We need that type of transparency to understand the arguments and see whether we can arrive at a reasonable model that protects the rights and concerns of all involved.  In education we have come a long way from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s in terms of a religious bar on people entering the workplace. People are concerned that this provision could be open to abuse and that ethos could be used to debar someone from a job.  Many religious bodies who control schools have a much broader approach to the issue than the one proposed in the Bill.  Some of the provisions on marital status, etc. are extraordinary and we need to know more about them.  The INTO and the ASTI are extremely concerned about the implications of this provision for teachers in the primary school sector.  Will it lead to a moral witch-hunt to ensure that only people who behave in a certain way, have a satisfactory status, etc. are employed? I do not want to be alarmist but much concern has been expressed about this provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with equality but this provision could lead to inequality and practices not envisaged by the Minister.  We must tease out the matter further on Committee Stage and consider the various arguments.  I have no difficulty with the maintenance of a religious ethos.  The position of the INTO &mdash; the general secretary has made this clear on a number of occasions &mdash; is that people who accepts a job in an establishment should respect its ethos.  In the case of schools, parents may be involved in determining the ethos.  A school's ethos is precious to it and nobody would wish to undermine it, but we are fooling ourselves if we think we can maintain the ethos or moral order of a school, etc. by way of legislation.  These can only be retained and fostered in a collegiate way by the management and staff of schools, parents and pupils.</P>
    <P>Serious reservations have been expressed about this provision and it needs to be teased out further on Committee Stage so that we can understand why it was drafted in its present form. The key issue is that institutions can maintain a <Col N="1061" /> particular ethos which can be used to discriminate against people, perhaps for the wrong reasons. We all know people who have not been offered jobs for a given reason which may not have been the real reason.  We do not want this provision to be used as a cover for the practice of wholesale discrimination and abuse.  This is a major concern in the education and medical worlds.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill which hopefully can be amended on Committee Stage to improve the level of equality in the workplace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for the introduction of this Bill.  Fianna Fáil is firmly committed to the elimination of inequality in our society.  This is a complex Bill and I hope on later stages the Minister will further clarify some of its provisions.  The Minister said he envisaged it would be a simple task to implement the Bill but, having looked at some of its provisions, I believe it will be more difficult than he thinks.  What consultations has the Minister had and what submissions has he received since the publication of the Bill?  These matters must be thrashed out on Committee Stage so that there is clarity on the implementation of the Bill.  While much welcome employment legislation has been introduced it is important to consider the practicalities of implementing it.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be aware of the concern expressed about the proposed legislation on the maximum number of working hours per week.  It is important to acknowledge that it is not possible to legislate for all areas of employment.  We must also take into account the challenges facing the economy and, in particular, those facing employers and employees.  The factors which impinge on competitiveness for employers are the cost of implementing the legislation, the tax wedge, the levels of PRSI and VAT and other direct and indirect taxes.  In the case of employees, consideration must be given to issues such as Sunday trading and the effects on the future prospects of employees who decide not to work on a Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While endeavouring to remove the obstacles to equality in employment we must ensure that we do not inadvertently put other obstacles in place. Many companies require flexibility in their working arrangements, for example, the use of short-term contracts, part-time work and other arrangements. This flexibility is required to enable companies to respond as effectively as possible to changing market circumstances and to match increased demand with additional employees. Labour legislation does not always allow for such flexibility.  I accept the Minister is making a genuine attempt to improve equality in the workplace but there are many issues which have not been addressed to date.  I hope I have the opportunity to discuss the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.  I look forward with interest to the Minister's contribution.  I ask the Minister to respond to all the areas covered, particularly disability. There are huge shortfalls in areas of <Col N="1062" /> physical or mental disabilities, especially in obtaining employment.  There are also serious obstacles to continuing in employment.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a case in my constituency where people took someone, who was not given any hope by the institutions caring for them, under their wing.  They guided that person through an educational programme and a physical development and training programme. Regrettably, there is no provision in place to ensure that person can travel to and from their place of residence to their place of training.  This person would not have been able to achieve this if not for the encouragement of these two people who loved this individual so much.  They have gone so far and find there is no transportation or support system in place to encourage that person to continue in employment or training.  These are areas which are not covered in the employment equality legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of voluntary organisations and transport systems who are not receiving adequate funds to ensure they can provide a service for those with a disability, who require it if they are to be given equal opportunity.  I know there are different options and avenues available to those who wish to avail of such services, such as special arrangements with employers and using supplementary welfare to avail of taxis.  I have seen the great work done by the health boards in the special hospital care programmes, sheltered workshops and training programmes.  People given this opportunity have progressed from such a sheltered workshop into the workplace, which they would not have had the opportunity to do in the past.  We are putting work and effort into such development and then we witness the collapse of the individual.  This warrants our special attention.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take account of the sentiments expressed by Members.  I look forward to improving the Bill, perhaps by toning down sections and making it more simple.  I welcome its development and look forward to participating on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who have contributed and assure them I will review what they have said in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the debate, I feel some Deputies may have lost sight of the ground breaking nature of this Bill.  This Government, in striving to provide protection from discrimination on a very wide range of grounds, must address many complex legal, social and economic considerations. This Bill balances these various considerations and I make no apology in seeking to bring forward a measure which is sensitive to the many issues involved.  In doing so, the Government has adopted a sophisticated rights based model which has been tried and tested in the gender area over the past 20 years, both in Ireland and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been shaped in response to a wide consultation process.  I know some, among them <Col N="1063" /> Deputies in the House, consider the Bill might have been developed further in some directions. Other groups regard the Bill as over generous in some of its provisions.  It is a matter of judgement to strike the balance necessary to ensure viable legislation.  I am always pleased to consider alternative proposals geared to refine that balance.  I look forward to examining in detail any such proposals for amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage.  In view of the time constraint, I confine myself to thanking Deputies.  I will reply in detail to the points raised on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Last evening I spelt out my understanding of the disastrous position that has befallen the beef industry in Cork due to the Minister's actions.  It is necessary to restore Irish and international customer confidence in beef.  To do that we must establish a national co-ordinating committee with representatives from Government agencies, retailers, processors and producers. The EU Commission must clearly define a strategy for the management of the beef industry over the next five to ten years and the newly established national co-ordinating committee would have an input into that process.  Existing markets must be strengthened and new markets developed.</P>
      <P>The quality of the product must be continuously improved.  We must develop a national strategy for research and development which would be co-ordinated with the requirements of the industry's markets.  We must remove excess capacity and improve customer service, with the national co-ordinating committee centrally monitoring these improvements.  We must also develop a national strategy for the education and training of industry staff.  Those are the steps that must be taken to bring back confidence in our beef industry. The position in counties Cork, Monaghan and Tipperary has deteriorated because of the Minister's actions in the past week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to restore confidence in our beef industry, appropriate action must be taken to lift the ban on exports to Russia.  I am a medical doctor and I have no difficulty about eating beef.  Quality assurance measures must be put in place.  Animals must be easily identified and traceable.  We should eventually introduce a system whereby a bar code would be given to an animal at ten days old and still be in existence when the beef from that animal is placed on the shelves of supermarkets.  The Taoiseach should get involved in this matter.  I am disappointed he has not travelled to some of the markets concerned, particularly to Russia, to undo the damage done by the Minister.  The Tánaiste should also travel to some of our markets.  This is too serious a matter for the Minister to speak over the telephone to his counterparts in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a monumental blunder and it discriminates against County Monaghan.  There was no scientific reason for the ban.  National and <Col N="1065" /> European Union policy was set aside.  The Minister was supposed to have had a gun to his head. I do not know if that is true, but he knifed the farmers of Monaghan in the back.  There are 187,000 livestock in County Monaghan and 4,500 farmers have a herd number.  Up to 46 per cent of those farmers are involved in specialist beef production.  The seriousness of the position for County Monaghan farmers is evident.</P>
    <P>Why was there no consultation with the IFA on the matter?  Why did the Minister run to the press before notifying farmers in the three counties concerned?  Was it a Government decision? Why is the Taoiseach not directly involved? Under the Irish Presidency of the European Union we could use our influence to undo the damage done by the Minister's disastrous decision.  Why has the Tánaiste not travelled to markets abroad to resolve this matter?  It would be beneficial if he visited countries in the Gulf and the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I have always been concerned about the policies of the two left wing parties.  I have frequently stated that the Labour Party has nothing to offer the people of rural Ireland.  Neither has Democratic Left, and that is evident from the throwaway remark about farmers made by its leader, Deputy De Rossa, last Sunday.  That gave us an indication of what he thinks of the farming community. We should not be surprised that the Government made a blunder on this issue.  In the light of its different ideologies, we should expect it to make such blunders.  Because of its different ideologies, in cases involving the national interest would it not be more appropriate for the Minister to place a motion before the House and let it decide whether he should make such agreements.</P>
    <P>The Minister tabled an amendment to the motion and anybody who votes for it is supporting the Minister's action.  Last week three backbenchers on the Government side influenced the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, to accept an amendment in the name of the Opposition.  I ask the Government backbenchers from the constituencies of Monaghan, Cork and Tipperary to use their influence to get the Minister to withdraw his amendment and support the Fianna Fáil motion.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this motion.  Last Wednesday was an historic day for this country when an announcement was made about regionalisation and placing a ban on beef exports to Russia from Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.  We had Fine Gael backbenchers, the Minister, Deputy Lowry, and Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, running to the Russian Embassy to make their case.  They had no confidence in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who had let them down badly in this case.  I have before me a photograph from a newspaper of the Russian Ambassador trying to get into his car and make a fast getaway from them.  Those Deputies and Ministers were frightened. The Minister, Deputy Lowry, has been <Col N="1066" /> frightened in the past, but he showed real fright at the Russian Embassy.</P>
      <P>More damage has been done to the Irish beef industry by this Minister than was done to the entire European beef industry by Douglas Hogg on 20 March 1996.  The Tories wrecked the beef industry of Europe in the way they behaved. Without any foundation or backup, the Minister identified three counties to the Russians.  There are seven meat plants in Cork and we have the largest agricultural processing industry.  We also have the highest level of employment in agriculture production.  Since this Minister took office finished beef cattle have lost £200 per head.  Following the Minister's visit to Russia in May 1996 he promised £20 million for promotion in the autumn of 1996.  What happened?  He put £500,000 into a Mickey Mouse campaign to be ripped off by the media.</P>

      <P>I am a Cork Deputy and I wholeheartedly support what the Minister has done. While we disagree with the Russian authorities because this decision has no scientific basis, the national interest dictated that a market which takes a quarter of our sales, or £300 million a year, had to be kept open.  Otherwise the consequences would have been a drop of 5p or 6p in the lb for every producer, which would be unacceptable.</P>
      <P>My colleagues on the Government backbenches know that six weeks ago when the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, was in Russia this issue was flagged and the market was being closed.  Much has been said about why the Minister or the Taoiseach did not do something about it but the message conveyed to the Department was that the market would be closed.  That would have been the reality if it had not been for the strong intervention of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, their Cabinet colleagues and the State's diplomatic and technical staff.</P>
      <P>Deputies from Cork, Monaghan and Tipperary will agree it is regrettable that we are victims but the decision was taken in the national interests even though there was no scientific basis for it. Those are the parameters within which the decision was made but we are being led to believe that if the Opposition was faced with the same decision, it would have forsaken £300 million worth of trade for some sort of political figleaf. The Minister acted correctly in the national interest.  Not a single constructive suggestion has come from the Fianna Fáil benches in this debate as to how this issue can be resolved.  Many voices outside the House have been equally destructive in their cant.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to take on board three suggestions and I am glad he was associated with one of them in today's newspapers. First, there is a need for traceability so that consumers here or elsewhere can identify the sirloin steak on their plate back to its farm of origin. Second, compound feeds should be labelled so that we know exactly what they contain.  Legislation was introduced in 1990 banning meat and bonemeal but these products continued to be fed to cattle.  Third, in the light of allegations raised about compensation payments for BSE outbreaks to individual farmers, it is time that, rather than huge cash compensation payments, there should be some system of compensation whereby a farmer's income could be paid to him over a period of years similar to what he had earned from his farm in the previous tax year.  As an interim step this should be considered as an alternative to the immediate attraction of a huge cash injection which is something akin to getting six numbers in the lottery.</P>

      <P>Earlier this month, the Minister, Deputy Yates, acted in the national interest when he forestalled a blanket ban on Irish beef imports by the Russians.  In return he had no option but to accept a three county ban.  I am confident the ban can be lifted in the near future provided we are rational in the debate and that sanity prevails.  We have not see that from the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I come from one of the counties included in the ban and it worries me that this should happen. Those are the facts behind this motion but the problems facing the beef industry go far beyond the Russian ban on beef imports from counties Cork, Monaghan and Tipperary.  Consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the safety of beef in particular and foodstuffs in general. Their concerns are not allayed by recent proven cases of farmers using illegal growth promoters or by the so far unconfirmed reports of some farmers introducing BSE into their herds to draw down fat compensation cheques funded by the very EU consumers that will eventually pay them again.</P>
      <P>My party had in the past, and still has, every sympathy for the vast majority of honest farmers who are trying to cope with the effects of a crisis that is not of their own making.  There can be few worse experiences for a cattle farmer than to discover that his herd, through no fault of his own, has been infected with BSE.  Those farmers are entitled to all our support whether as legislators, the State or as a society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a large extent the Irish beef industry is paying the price of UK deregulation and mismanagement of the British national herd.  They are also paying the price for the activities of a small rogue element in Irish farming.  I welcome the recent convictions which have been secured in respect of illegal growth promoters.  The IFA's relative silence following those convictions has been in <Col N="1070" /> marked contrast to its vociferous condemnation of the Minister.  I wonder why.  I do not know how many of those convicted of using illegal growth promoters were members of the IFA but I know that the IFA has had an ambivalent attitude to such activities in the past.  I have proof of that.  In 1991 the IFA blamed a 1988 ban on certain growth promoters for what it called a dramatic fall in farm incomes.  In 1993 the IFA beef committee's chairperson, Mr. Richard Booth, called for an end to the EU wide ban on illegal growth promoters saying there was no scientific reason for it &mdash; other than the health of our children of course.</P>
    <P>In November 1994 in a policy document on the future of the Common Agriculture Policy the IFA called for the reintroduction of certain illegal cattle hormones.  By arguing for their reintroduction and tacitly condoning their illegal use the IFA has done far more to undermine the beef industry than the Russian ban on imports ever could.  I would welcome a clear sharp statement from Mr. John Donnelly condemning the activities of the rogue farmer element who persist in undermining the beef industry, pledging that the IFA will do all in its power to weed out such sharp operators and that such individuals will not be welcome in the IFA.  I hope that statement will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Russian ban is justified by the scientific evidence available.  While the incidence of BSE in the three counties involved is slightly higher than the national average&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is true.  However, the Russian ban did not arise out of a vacuum.  It arose because Russian consumers were concerned about the safety of food they placed on their tables and in that respect they are no different from Irish consumers.  If the position were reversed and Irish consumers were concerned about the safety of beef imports from Russia, what would Fianna Fáil do?  Would it not be its bounden duty to protect our consumers?  Is it saying that it would not protect them?</P>
      <P>Russian concerns regarding the quality of Irish beef have been exacerbated by what was learned during the beef tribunal regarding the quality of beef processed at, for example, Larry Goodman's plant in Rathkeale.</P>

      <P>All EU compensation packages are vulnerable to fraud and the bigger the package the greater the vulnerability.  The various agricultural schemes which comprise CAP and other associated programmes have long been a goldmine for a small minority of farmers.  The abuse of those funds has been highlighted time and again by the EU Court of Auditors.  Compensation schemes are especially vulnerable to sharp practice.  As long ago as 1992 there was a major investigation into the sharp rise in brucellosis in Limerick, Cork and Meath amidst fear that the disease was being deliberately introduced to claim compensation payments.  On foot of that investigation it was found that some farmers were injecting their cows with a brucellosis vaccine which confused the blood tests and gave a positive reaction &mdash; and we are supposed to trust them.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Foxe.</P>
      <P>This debate is taking place as consumers are becoming increasingly worried about the health and safety of the foods they consume.  Food scares are a regular event and in truth I suppose we have no real plans to deal with them.  Acceptance of the concept of risk and the need to understand it are central to a proper response to this crisis.  The public want a healthy food supply obtained from plants and animals produced in acceptable conditions.  It follows that feeding offal to ruminants is not acceptable.  The public are not prepared to tolerate the use of hormones or growth promoters such as angel dust.  Anyone who considers the consumer a central player in the food chain must accept those issues.</P>
      <P>At this stage BSE is not a major problem in this country.  The first case occurred a relatively short time ago in the late 1980s and we have had a total of approximately 150 cases to date. However, there is a need to be honest and frank with the public about BSE.  Absolute assurances given in relation to BSE cannot be sustained.  If people continue to give such assurances they will erode public confidence.  We have been less than frank with the public in regard to BSE and, inevitably, that causes problems and confusion when more incidents of the disease occurs.</P>
      <P>There is a well established pattern of response to a BSE scare.  Initially following a scare an assurance is given along the lines that there is nothing to worry about, that food is perfectly safe and there is no evidence of BSE being transmissible to humans.  Nonetheless, despite that absolute type of assurance some extra measures are taken.  A new slaughter policy is introduced; if it does not work a more extensive slaughter policy is introduced.  If that does not satisfy people we have a system for tracing food from the consumer's table back to the many farmyards through which farm animals make their way before they are finally slaughtered.</P>
      <P>Such absolute assurances given on phase 1 of our policy to deal with a BSE crisis erode confidence. We must accept that the BSE crisis will not go away and we must adopt an effective response.  We need to understand that there is some element of risk.  It is not very great and I do not have any problem eating beef, but it is not realistic to give absolute assurances which are not consistent with the facts.  We must put risk into perspective.  Life is full of risks and nobody can have a life free of risk.  This motion is about as unrealistic as those who expect to have a risk free existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Urban voters consider the behaviour of the IFA and Fianna Fáil in response to this crisis surreal. They are flabbergasted at the way Fianna Fáil and the IFA have conducted themselves since the crisis developed.  They have been left bewildered at the effrontery of members of the IFA who when it suits them are pillars of free enterprise.  That is how they operate most of the <Col N="1074" /> time, but in cases such as this they behave like obsolete Stalinists from Eastern Europe.  They cannot have it both ways and it is time we knew which element of the IFA is for real.  It should know that the consumer is king.  That is the way it should be and the way it will be.  That is the way the world has gone.</P>

      <P>There is no purpose in blaming the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry when the Russians say not to Irish beef from three counties. They are entitled to say so and we must accept that.  We must recognise that the Minister for Agriculture does not have the power to force Russians to eat Irish beef.  It is as simple as that and we must accept it.</P>
      <P>Dublin consumers are turned off by the antics of farmers and their behaviour.  They are particularly turned off by the antics of farmers in Killarney. They are likewise appalled by the abuse of angel dust by some farmers who are prominent members of the IFA and are now before the courts.  Fianna Fáil and the IFA should realise that the more of a song and dance they make about BSE and the Russians, the more they are ensuring that consumers are turned off eating beef while they are being reminded incessantly about the connections that exist between BSE, CJD and beef.  Farmers who make ridiculous calls on Ministers should realise that consumers are not impressed by these demands.  This Minister did not cause BSE and he does not abuse angel dust.  Given the response to angel dust abuse by some farmers and farming organisations, can anyone feel confident that farmers have ceased to use banned meat and bonemeal?</P>
      <P>If I were a farmer I would expect more from Fianna Fáil.  Its behaviour during this crisis is designed to appeal to rural dinosaurs only.  It is antagonising the rest of the population.  More importantly, it is working against the interests of sensible and reasonable modern farmers.  These farmers know they must clean up their act and produce a product which is healthy and wholesome and which consumers want.  The shenanigans which have surrounded this debate and the latest BSE incident do no favours to anybody, certainly not to the beef industry.  It is some consolation to people on this side of the House because the more Fianna Fáil does this, the more likely it is to stop people, who would normally vote for it, from doing so.</P>

      <P>The Minister is condemned for signing the Protocol.  However, what would the consequences have been if he had not signed?  We would have lost a market for 360,000 cattle worth £300 million.  What were the consequences of signing it?  We retain our market for 360,000 cattle and we have a good chance of expanding our market in Russia.  It is easier to expand an existing market than to get into a new market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> The downside to signing the Protocol is that there is a ban on beef sales from three counties &mdash; Cork.  Tipperary and Monaghan &mdash; to Russia. However, we have more markets than Russia.  We have a 200,000 tonne market in Europe which has no regionalisation policy; it accepts beef from the 26 counties.  We have other markets in the Middle East which has no regionalisation policy and which accepts beef and cattle from the 26 counties. It has been stated that some Middle Eastern countries will look for a ban on beef from certain counties.  However, they already looked for that before the Protocol with Russia was signed.  The Minister rightly refused to agree to that.  If he had agreed, he would be criticised more for doing so than for signing the Protocol.</P>
    <P>This situation reminds me of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921.  The last thing any of the men who negotiated that Treaty wanted was partition.  However, before the negotiations were over they realised the best deal they could get was to sign the document to partition the country. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry found himself in a similar situation in recent days. I might not give the Minister ten out of ten for his work in this regard, but if he had told us he lost the Russian market for 360,000 cattle because he was too pig headed to negotiate, he would have got less marks than nine out of ten.</P>
    <P>There has been much scaremongering over the past week which causes consumers to lose confidence in our beef.  If we are afraid to eat beef, how do we expect customers in other countries to eat it?  Many notable sections of the community were involved in this scaremongering.  There were many debates on television and on radio involving Members of this House.  Farming organisations, which one would expect to be more responsible in their approach, were anything but helpful.  We cannot forget the extremely bad press we got a few years ago during the beef tribunal when all types of muck, literally and metaphorically, was thrown up.  That did not do our beef trade any good.  I am satisfied that when this issue dies down the farmers of Monaghan, Tipperary and Cork will not receive one penny less for their beef than the farmers in the other 23 counties. Russia is not our only market, although it is important, so there is no reason beef from those counties should be sold for anything less than the going rate in the neighbouring counties.</P>
    <P>The governments of countries which have diplomatic relations with Ireland are kept fully informed about our beef industry.  If we continue to criticise what the Minister has done and to decry the effects of BSE, then we had better be prepared to accept the consequences.  We must bear in mind that BSE is not an indigenous disease. It has been imported and all BSE cases in Ireland since 1988 can be traced back to imported animals or imported meat and bonemeal.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry must be complimented on its approach to the BSE problem.  Once an animal is infected, not <Col N="1076" /> only is it slaughtered but the remaining animals in the herd are also slaughtered and disposed of. That approach was not taken by Britain which was responsible for the disease.</P>
    <P>The Minister had little choice, but he made a decision in the best interests of Irish farming and the economy.  Within a few months these three counties will be free to export their beef to Russia in the same way they are free to export it to Europe and the Middle East at present.</P>

      <P>We are all aware of the serious concern in the farming community, particularly the beef sector, since the start of the BSE crisis following the statement in the House of Commons on 20 March last.  In the immediate aftermath of that statement, Fianna Fáil called for the necessary political offensive by this Government to safeguard our markets.  Unfortunately, those appeals by our party leader, our party spokesman and numerous Fianna Fáil Deputies were not heeded by the Government.  In debates in this House on this issue, which were initiated by Fianna Fáil, we asked the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to mobilise all the political and diplomatic resources available to get the message to the markets that our beef product is of the highest quality, that it is grassland based production and that the strictest disease prevention measures are in place.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately for this country, particularly for livestock farmers, Government leadership and the concerted political effort needed to protect the biggest sector of the largest industry was not forthcoming.  The debacle at Dublin Airport, from which the Minister was absent, could have been avoided if the Government had carried out the necessary and appropriate political footwork since last March.  The farming community would like to know if the outrageous remarks by the Minister for Social Welfare on RTE last Sunday night reflect the collective view of the Government. The comments by Deputies from Mr. De Rossa's party in every debate on agriculture issues show complete hostility to the farming community.</P>

We have listened time and again to Government members speaking in glowing terms of the value and prestige of the Presidency of the European Union.  What use has the Presidency been to livestock farmers?  Why was the Government unable to build on the stated desires of Russia to improve relations with the European Union and hold on <i>in toto</i> to our largest beef market outside the European Union? What contribution has the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, made in his capacity as President of the Council of Foreign Ministers?  Unfortunately, the answer is in the negative.  Will the people's only recollection of our 1996 Presidency of the European Union be an irate group of farmers chasing across a field in Killarney towards the European Commissioner and Ministers for Agriculture? Sadly, the recollection will not be of the Taoiseach coming home from foreign markets with beef orders.</P>

      <P>An extremely serious matter has arisen because on 12 October the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, acquiesced to pressure from the Russian veterinary authorities to allow a ban on three countries, namely, Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, to come into effect on 1 November.  Even at this late stage I ask the Minister to use the good offices of the Presidency of the European Union &mdash; the Taoiseach is President of the Intergovernmental Conference and the Tánaiste is President of the Council of Foreign Ministers &mdash; to resolve the problem.  If there are any privileges in being a member of the European Union, in the Presidency year they should be availed of, particularly since Russia wishes to have good relations with the European Union.  I do not agree with the suggestion that a gun was put to the Minister's head &mdash; we learned more about that in the House today.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should go to Moscow to try to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>There is a serious downside to this matter.  For the past 25 to 30 years we promoted not only Irish beef but Irish food which had a standard of excellence that was established worldwide, but unfortunately that is no longer the case.  In light of recent developments, beef emanating from Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan is to be avoided.  It is second rate and cannot be promoted with a national degree of excellence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Martin.  There is no doubt but that the BSE crisis is the single most worrying development to affect the agricultural sector since Ireland joined the EEC in the early 1970s.  It is worrying on a number of fronts.  First, the problem was greatly increased by the appalling mismanagement of the matter by the British Government. Rather than tackling the problem head on with determination and resources, there was a long period of relative inactivity on the part of the UK, <Col N="1079" /> with the result that its BSE levels reached epidemic proportions.  It could be argued that the EU should have intervened much earlier and in a much more effective manner to force the British Government to act in a responsible way to bring the crisis under rapid control.  Following what seemed a very questionable scientific report the British Government seemed to panic and one of its Ministers even talked about destroying the total British national herd of approximately 11 million animals.</P>
      <P>While this disaster was unfolding in Britain, fortunately we had a relatively excellent record as regards BSE, with extremely low annual rates by international standards.  That position was in no small way due to the vision and leadership of former Ministers for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>It gives me no pleasure to comment on the disaster which has unfolded since this matter became an issue of the utmost public concern, particularly throughout the EU and indeed further afield.  The Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, has managed to turn what was a clear victory for the quality of health care in the cattle industry into what has all the makings of a disaster of the highest proportions.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on the gross mismanagement of our vital beef trade with Russia I wish to refer to one aspect of the problem which bothers me very much.  Everybody has taken it for granted that the diagnosis of a case of BSE on any Irish farm must result in the immediate depopulation of the farm without question or delay.  It seems, however, that this has not been the case in recent months.  If so, it is a scandal which far exceeds the issues investigated by the beef tribunal.  The Minister should inform the House of the exact date of diagnosis and farm clearance in respect of each outbreak of the disease since he took office.</P>
      <P>On the partial Russian ban on Irish beef, the Minister should inform the House of the basis on which he decided to accept the ban given that there is not a shred of scientific evidence to support such action and outline the role played by the Taoiseach and other Cabinet Ministers in this sorry mess.</P>

It is extraordinary that Cork, Monaghan and Tipperary Deputies are being asked by the Government side of the House to endorse the Minister's actions which have resulted in these counties being placed at a serious disadvantage in terms of their capacity to market beef in the future.  As Deputy Joe Walsh <Col N="1080" /> said, the Minister has undermined the efforts made to achieve a national quality standard.</P>
      <P>There has been political mismanagement of this issue.  As Deputy Brendan Smith outlined, the Minister had political options but this issue did not receive the degree of priority it deserved, despite repeated requests from this side of the House.  There should have been a major political initiative extending to the Taoiseach's office to prevent this happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In this frenetic debate it is necessary to stand back from the heat and some of the emotion which dominates the public and media debate.  This is not a crisis which affects farmers and a few others only, as one is inclined to think listening to some of the impassioned contributions. Above all, it affects consumers.  In particular, it is more than just a serious economic or commercial crisis.</P>
      <P>There are three important aspects to this problem. They are separate and as follows in order of importance: a public health problem, an animal health problem and a commercial problem.</P>
      <P>There has been a failure to recognise the primacy of public human health in this affair.  This is all the more surprising given that, parallel with this debate, we have had an equally impassioned public debate, inside and outside this House, on the activities of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the huge public health problem that has arisen from its use of contaminated anti-D.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If BSE was some obscure bovine disease and nothing more, this country and its farmers would <Col N="1081" /> not have become remotely as agitated as they are. The real damage and the real danger arise from the fact that it is perceived, in medical as well as in lay circles, that there is a grave danger that this brain disease in cattle can be transmitted to humans and exhibit itself in a form known as CJD which is, almost invariably, fatal for humans.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that it has not been conclusively proven beyond all doubt that this transmission to humans can take place.  Whether it has or has not been so proven is less important than the fact that some medical opinion at least has expressed that view and there is a general perception among the public that there can be such transmission.</P>
    <P>We know for certain that BSE can be transferred between species.  In laboratory conditions it has been passed on to other species of animals. Naturally, nobody wants to test this on humans. No human should be subjected to the risk involved.  Thus it can be claimed that it is not conclusively proven it is transmissible to humans. Because of the inability of science directly to test it on humans, it may be many years before it can be conclusively proven, one way or the other, if it is transmissible to humans.</P>
    <P>If there is a perceived danger of the possibility of transmission to humans of a highly unpleasant and, usually, fatal disease, there is a major public health problem and inevitable consumer resistance on a wide scale to consumption of the product which is seen as the potential source of such a human disease.  Not to recognise this is foolish. To deny everything in the hope it will go away will not work and is not good enough.  To engage in a kind of official conspiracy of silence about the disease, its likely consequences and inevitable effect on the consumer and consumer attitudes and preferences, as happened here, is the height of foolishness.  Trying to sweep things under the carpet in the hope they will disappear did not work for this country before.  The consequences of concealment or denial are, in the long run, far more serious than the short-term effects of transparency. The Government has not yet learned that lesson in spite of the experiences of the Minister for Health in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The fact that this is primarily a public health issue and problem is underlined by the fact that it was the British Minister for Health who disclosed this matter in the House of Commons last March, not the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Health here has sought to wash his hands of the whole affair.  That is hardly good enough.</P>
    <P>Animal health should be a matter of great importance to us, although it is secondary to human health.  Ireland is a small island and the Republic of Ireland has a land boundary only with Northern Ireland.  Therefore, as an island, all of Ireland should be able to protect itself from a wide variety of animal diseases that are often endemic in the remainder of the world but, increasingly, we seem to be failing to do that.</P>
    <P>The responsibility lies with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry whose approach <Col N="1082" /> to the whole question of animal health, certainly in more recent years, is cavalier to say the least. Forgery of official documents, not always by private individuals, is becoming an increasing feature in this field.  The sale of blank official Irish animal health certificates to people in the trade at home and abroad should be a matter of huge concern.  The credibility of our supervisory and certification system as administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been seriously called into question.  That being so, we can hardly be surprised at the results if some countries do not wish to buy our produce. Have we anyone to blame but ourselves?</P>
    <P>My third point, the commercial and economic consequences of the danger to human health and the lack of credibility of our animal health regime, is obvious.  Farmers and processors and all those dependent upon them are now paying the price for short-term greed and official negligence, or worse.  This can hardly be surprising.</P>
    <P>The failure to slaughter cattle believed by veterinary surgeons and farmers to be suffering from BSE is a serious error.  This has been happening recently here.  The failure to cull or depopulate herds in which BSE occurred, even after periods as long as ten or 12 weeks, is a serious error and makes our criticism of the British reluctance to cull on a wide scale appear rather hypocritical.  I am aware of one case where there has been prolonged official indifference to the existence of BSE in a herd and where no action was taken until a veterinary surgeon sent a fax to the headquarters of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in Kildare Street informing it that he had to carry out a private post mortem.  The Department's reaction now is to blame the farmer concerned for allegedly deliberately introducing BSE into his herd.  I am not aware there is any proof of such an allegation and to make it in the absence of proof is a monstrous injustice.  It is being done as part of an official cover-up for official lethargy and negligence.</P>
    <P>Even if it were the case that a farmer deliberately bought an infected animal &mdash; a scenario I regard as unlikely &mdash; the Department should nonetheless depopulate the herd without any delay.  Failure to do so, after a prolonged period in several cases, only adds to consumers' doubts about our beef.</P>
    <P>Some people think the customer has no right to have doubts, that the customer has some divinely imposed obligation to buy our beef regardless of whether he or she wants to or is happy with it. This mentality, which is dangerous in the modern world and lacks an appreciation of the reality of the market place, arises from the fact that for a great many years we could easily get paid for beef at prices way above the world level, thanks to the intervention and export refund policies of the European Union.  In a sense we were not really selling the beef, we were simply producing it and getting paid for it at a very high rate by world <Col N="1083" /> standards.  Its quality did not greatly matter as long as it was taken into intervention or some third country accepted it so that we could draw down the export refunds.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Russian trade lies not so much in what the Russians pay us, which is very little, but in that they will take beef thereby enabling us to draw down the refunds.  It is not possible for me to quantify precisely what the Russians pay but it probably lies somewhere between 10 per cent and 30 per cent of the total price obtained by the Irish processor.  The rest is paid by the European Union by way of subsidy in an export refund.  There have been cases in the past where Irish beef was exported to third countries in effect for nothing but primarily to draw down the refund.  In these circumstances beef is no more than a commodity that is internationally traded.  In spite of what we tell ourselves, its Irish origin is not really of any significance.</P>
    <P>The real value in our exports of beef lies in what we can sell to supermarket chains in countries like Britain and Germany where there is a retail customer with preferences.  The customer is entitled to demand a high quality because she is paying a full and high price for a product.  It is in those markets that the real return to the Irish producer and processor lies in the long-term, by building up a reliable relationship with the ultimate consumer.  For too long many of our processors ignored the development of that relationship and were happy to take the quick buck wherever they could find it and however they could make it.  It will be recognised in future years that this is and was short-sighted.  We still have time to put our mistakes behind us if we establish a proper food inspection board which inspects all beef leaving the country, and all beef consumed here, and operates independently of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry whose credibility is now so severely dented.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment to this motion calls on the Dáil to endorse &ldquo;the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to facilitate and ensure the continued export of Irish beef to Russia&rdquo; and commends the actions of the Minister in protecting export markets for Irish beef.  This amendment constitutes the height of cheek.  How dare a Minister ask that we commend his efforts in the Russian markets when he refused to attend the meeting at which his Department agreed to exclude three Irish counties from the market concerned even though two of those counties had a very low incidence, even by Irish standards, of BSE?</P>
    <P>It was only here this afternoon that I prised out of the Minister that he was not at the meeting last Saturday week.  That fact was successfully concealed by him for more than 11 days up to then. What explanation has he for his absence and will he now withdraw the amendment in his name in view of the fact that its terms are particularly inopportune and inaccurate?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> The Minister has some neck to put down an amendment in these terms and to describe himself as having had a gun put to his head is hardly correct when he had abandoned the negotiations. Any gun to his head was a very long range weapon. I rather think the Russians must have been using one of their intercontinental ballistic missiles.</P>

      <P>I do not recall the Minister saying he was at the airport on that occasion but I am sure he will clarify the position.</P>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is not necessary for me to repeat the details of the events leading to the signing of the Protocol.  The correct decision was made.  It was not an easy decision and we would all prefer if we were not faced with such a stark choice.  We must face the reality, that BSE has generated a high degree of suspicion and concern among consumers. Veterinary and public health authorities are naturally on their guard and we have to accept that third countries which import a product will only do so on the basis of detailed Protocols and in circumstances where they are fully satisfied as to the safety of the product.</P>
      <P>In the case of Russia, the alternative to the Protocol was a total ban.  In a newspaper article Deputy Cowen accused me of making matters worse in Russia and in this House.  I will clarify the position for him.  I visited Russia on 16 and 17 September and encountered at first hand the concern and the strong views of the Russian authorities about BSE in that country.  A ban was threatened but because of my direct intervention with the Deputy Prime Minister the threat was averted.  If I had not directly intervened the ban would have been implemented.  I did not come back to Ireland and gloat about my efforts because I did not want to create panic selling in the cattle industry.  When I returned the market was still open for Irish beef.  That is what I set out to do and I achieved that.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has outlined a series of political contacts were made at the highest level following that culminating in the visit of Dr. Avilov and the technical discussion which followed.  It was inevitable, therefore, that this issue would have to be brought to a head at a technical level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the concern and emotion in the counties involved.  The three counties have a strong and proud tradition in agriculture and nobody is denying that.  Comments about partition and segregation are over the top and are not justified.  The three counties were selected by the Russian delegation and its decision seemed to relate to the level of BSE cases in 1996.  When I <Col N="1085" /> faced Dr. Avilov in Russia he had all the statistics before him.  It was not necessary for the Minister to mention them in the Seanad.  He had a map of Ireland with every case indicated on it.  He had all the statistics and a dossier with press releases, many of them from the Deputy's party spokespersons.</P>

      <P>It is the level of BSE that has got us into this predicament.  The only answer is to ensure we have the best possible control system. I have no doubt this is the case and it will be improved upon.  I agree with most of Deputy O'Malley's comments on the credibility of our product.  The real test of any control system is attention to detail and therefore we need all elements of the industry to play their part in ensuring full compliance with all requirements. Despite all the criticism and controversy, there has been an absence of alternative suggestions.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not, we must accept that matters like this are dealt with on a technical basis and this is in the best overall interests of our industry.  Those who criticise the decision are therefore arguing that it would be better to accept a total ban without facing up to what a ban means.</P>
      <P>Russia has a very large imported beef requirement. It is a growing and increasingly sophisticated market.  Is the Opposition saying we should have accepted a ban and allowed the whole country to be excluded because of a temporary ban on three counties?  The Opposition may not like to admit it but that is the logic of their argument.</P>
      <P>There have been almost two weeks of recrimination on this matter.  To what effect?</P>

It is time for positive action and the necessary political action to reopen the Iranian and Libyan markets. If it were not for the attempts of the Iranian Ambassador and others, the Iranian delegation would not have visited this country three weeks ago.  What efforts have been made by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry over the last three months to get back the markets we lost on 20 March?  A blank sheet would cover their efforts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>The Government should take account of the serious concerns not just of Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan but of everyone involved in the agricultural industry at this debacle.  The position has been deteriorating for some time, particularly in the light of the Government's handling of it in the past week.  The Opposition has adopted a responsible approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the light of our knowledge of the problems the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has faced since last July.  I ask any Member of the Government side to show any public pronouncement on our part which undermines his attempt to ensure our Russian markets, which he described as pivotal.</P>
      <P>Having made his decisions, we must seek public and political accountability by the Minister.  His approach since making those decisions has been worrying.  There is a burden on him and the Cabinet to ensure that the harm done by those decisions is not emphasised further by continuing irresponsible and speculative statements such as those made here and in the Seanad in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received phone calls not just from producers but from people in the processing industry asking if there is any chance the Minister will stop digging when he is in a hole.  This Government remains oblivious to the damage this spiralling crisis is causing to the economy.  The contribution <Col N="1088" /> of Government Ministers in recent days has been depressing.  The analysis by the Government of the crisis has not advanced one iota since 20 March.  The Government, in so far as it has any view, holds that BSE is an exclusively technical issue.</P>
    <P>The political composition of the Government is a major reason for our not coming to terms with this situation.  One would have expected, after seven weeks of consistent briefing and representation by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in Cabinet that we would not hear the type of ignorant prejudicial statement by the Minister for Social Welfare last Sunday.  In fairness, this House would have expected that it would not hear the type of dismissive throw away remark in relation to farmers, &ldquo;they are rolling in it&rdquo;.  As many as 75,000 farmers obtain less than £3,000 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has become a tactic in this House when I rise in debate to send in a certain element from the Government benches to distract me, but I will not be distracted.  What the Minister for Social Welfare said last Sunday harmed the Government.  People who have no interest in farming are prepared to go on national radio and describe farmers as a privileged class, but 75,000 farmers do not get more than £60 a week in direct payments, and it is not a top up; the direct payment system has become the net income of farmers over the past few years.  No one knows that better than the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Member of this House I am entitled to speak.  We had to listen to Deputy Lynch but assumed hers was a voice in the wilderness. However, it is clear that right in the inner Cabinet that sort of ignorance predominates, and the Minister is expected to come forward with solutions while the political composition of the Cabinet is as it is.  Deputy Spring, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, refuses, on principle it would seem, to go out and bat for our most important industry because it is a technical issue.  Let me say for the umpteenth time since 20 March that it has been the analysis of this party that this is not simply a technical issue.  It is a matter that requires a major political initiative at all levels.  We have said consistently that it has been the absence of that sort of political imprimatur that has brought us to a situation where we are being dictated to, despite the statement of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that we have as good an animal disease eradication programme for BSE as for any other disease.  We have taken the initiative in Europe to assure a &ldquo;slaughter out&rdquo; policy, but we are being dictated to all along the line because nowhere during the past seven months have we seen a co-ordinated or coherent <Col N="1089" /> approach that addresses the problems of perception domestically and abroad.</P>
      <P>The Government seems to see no role for itself in tackling the biggest ever crisis in our biggest industry.  In the Dáil this afternoon the Minister said in answer to questions &ldquo;I have never said I was in Dublin Airport on Saturday morning&rdquo;. Asked about the infamous gun that was held to his head, the Minister described it as being &ldquo;metaphorically&rdquo; held only.  The Minister's denial in the Dáil today that he was at Dublin Airport or that he ever said he was at Dublin Airport is totally contrary to what he said and sought to have believed.  Last Saturday, 19 October on the programme &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; the Minister stated explicitly that he did the deal personally in Dublin Airport.  In the course of answering a question the Minister said &ldquo;on Tuesday week before I did a deal with the Russians last Saturday at 1 p.m. in the VIP lounge in Dublin Airport ...&rdquo;.  If, as the Minister now says, he was not at the airport, he made no effort to correct himself either on the programme or in the 11 days since the programme was broadcast.  The foundations for this illusion of a Minister battling it out at the steps of an aeroplane with a gun to his head was already well laid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Seanad yesterday the Minister said &ldquo;I will not sign Protocols with any other markets&rdquo;.  The fact is that the Minister did not sign Protocols with any foreign market.  He was not on the job when Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, producing 30 per cent of the national steer herd, were sold out.  Speaking last Thursday in the Dáil during Government time the Minister said in relation to the events of that day &ldquo;we continued to oppose the measure and it was only following further consultations at high level that a decision was taken reluctantly to sign the Protocol&rdquo;. Who are the &ldquo;we&rdquo; to whom the Minister refers?  The clear implication was that the Minister was on the job.  The previous night in the Dáil on Wednesday 16 October the Minister said &ldquo;following further consultations with me and discussions at the highest level in the Department, a practical decision was taken to sign the Protocol, and this was done just before the head of the Russian delegation boarded the plane to return to Moscow on Saturday 12 October&rdquo;.  The definite impression that the Minister was on the spot was sponsored.  Earlier that day the Minister's party colleague, Deputy Seymour Crawford, referred to the Minister's signing of the infamous Protocol on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I demand that the Minister unequivocally withdraw this and apologise for having deliberately misled the public.  The Minister has been shameless in the way he has twisted and turned the truth to suit himself.  A public image was created that was totally at variance with the facts.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today, the Tánaiste made his first <Col N="1090" /> contribution to the public debate on BSE.  He refused outright to visit Iran in the present circumstances. Additionally he placed a question mark over the status of the national herd.  What technical issues pertaining to the national herd are so serious that they preclude the Tánaiste making political representations to the Iranian Government?  I am aware of none.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised he would retrieve the Russian situation.  It is extraordinary the Minister launched his onslaught on Russian confidence by speculating in the Seanad yesterday that the incidence of BSE could treble between now and the end of the year.  Such speculation was outrageously irresponsible and has no scientific basis. Before going to Russia to, in his own words, retrieve the situation, the Minister has cut the ground from under himself.  What are the consumers to make of this example of crystal ball gazing?</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of Rab Butler's wise advice to politicians in trouble, &ldquo;when you are in a hole, stop digging&rdquo;.  I and my colleagues have had calls all day from farmers asking two things.  They want to know what the Minister is playing at.  They want to know if we can go easy on him before this industry goes into a total tailspin. Government Deputies, in an attempt to deflect attention from their own responsibilities, have accused Fianna Fáil of national sabotage. Like many others I was aware for some time of problems in our beef trade with Russia.  I said nothing.  During the debate on BSE on 25 September, I simply asked the Minister for his prognosis on the Russian trade.  I wanted to give the Minister the opportunity to address the issue, a chance to way what the situation was.  He refused to do so.  Instead at the Ploughing Championship in Carlow he vehemently denied a press report that there was a problem in the Russian market.</P>
    <P>It was not Fianna Fáil or the farm organisations but the Minister who called a press conference yesterday week to announce details of a ban on 30 per cent of the national steer herd before he had worked out the details of how this ban could be operated.  It was the Minister who last weekend brought a group of farmers to Paris to the second largest food fair in the world and announced to the world press that he was &ldquo;absolutely convinced&rdquo; that the increased number of BSE cases this year is directly related to animals fed on bonemeal since it was banned in 1990.</P>

      <P>While the Minister is engaged with a spasm of foot in mouth disease the interests of this industry are being sold down the river.  It is unbelievable that a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry could engage in such a political suicide mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in a rare and belated intervention in this crisis, called today for a cooling off in the national interest.  I agree with him.  If he wants an end to speculative hype he should tell <Col N="1091" /> the Minister, who has engaged in speculative hype, that it is time for him to stop talking without producing scientific evidence for the assertion he made yesterday in the Seanad that the incidence of BSE would treble.  If the Taoiseach seeks <Col N="1092" /> an end to damaging speculation he should put a gagging order on the Minister, Deputy Yates. With friends like him the Irish beef industry will never need enemies.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Refugees in Zaire.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I wish to raise the serious plight of thousands of Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi who are in Eastern Zaire.  Over 2,000 refugees have left their camps around Uvira, near the border with Burundi.  They are afraid of getting caught in fighting between troops from Zaire and the ethnic Tutsis.  According to the UN, these clashes have already made relief operations impossible.  Each side is blaming the other.  Zairean officials have accused the Rwandan and Burundian Governments of backing armed groups of ethnic Tutsis and they want these and the Hutu refugees to leave the country.</P>
      <P>Relief workers say that five civilians were killed in overnight clashes between Zairean soldiers, employed to guard refugee camps, and local people in the Uvira region.  Fifty four aid workers have been in the Uvira compound of the UNHCR for refugees for the past three days, sleeping in their cars.  Relief workers have reported gunfire inside the town of Uvira in the last few days.  Schools and markets were closed on Monday.  A spokesman for UNHCR has warned that the situation has now deteriorated to such an extent that we are almost back to an emergency like that in 1994. He was referring to the flow to Zaire of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans during their country's civil war.  The 220,000 refugees have little or no assistance while aid workers have no access to them, no mobility and supply lines have been cut off.  UN teams are preparing camps in the Bukavu region for refugees who could arrive there.  Both Bukavu and Goma are already housing more than a million refugees, mainly Rwandan.</P>
      <P>In Uvira, a road was to be opened to allow aid workers to get to Kalima and make the 18 minute flight to Bukavu.  According to the relief staff, the fighting has claimed at least 83 lives since late last week.  This has a destabilising effect on the region and unfortunately there is a danger of escalation. I strongly urge the Minister and the Government to act on this issue.  As we hold the Presidency of the EU, we should get more involved in conflict prevention.  We must also influence the African leaders in the regions in countries like Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya.</P>
      <P>More emphasis must be placed on care and maintenance in the refugee camps.  We should try to build confidence in the justice system in Rwanda before we can expect more refugees to return.  I would like to hear whether the Minister has met NGOs and if she can give the House the Government's response to a situation causing major fears of a new humanitarian disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members share my deep concern at the humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Eastern Zaire.  The present violence has erupted because hundreds of thousands of Tutsis living in Zaire for many years have felt themselves under threat of violence or expulsion.  This in turn has created a growing spiral of violence and instability that now threatens to exacerbate conflict throughout the region.</P>
      <P>Our latest information, based on reports of agencies operating in the region and from Geneva, is that as a result of fighting between Zairean troops in Southern Kivu and local people of Tutsi origin, as well as attacks on refugee camps, 220,000 refugees who previously lived in the camps around Uvira and tens of thousands of Zairean local people are displaced and heading for Uvira town.  It is understood this movement is taking place mainly because the refugees fear war between Rwanda and Zaire.</P>
      <P>Fifty-four workers from UNHCR and other agencies were held hostage by Zairean troops for some time and released late yesterday.  They have now been evacuated temporarily from the area. Irish aid agencies in the area are also preparing to evacuate the majority of their workers until the situation becomes less volatile.</P>
      <P>The UNHCR has continuing arrangements in place for dealing with an expected influx of refugees in the Bukavu area and the world food programme has supplies for the next 14-16 days.  If fighting continues they intend to airlift supplies. Four new campsites have been identified which could accommodate up to 80,000 people.  Concern have informed us they also have a sufficient stock of non-food materials in the area to meet needs for the moment.  We are staying in close contact with the humanitarian agencies and will do all in our power to assist where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Kitt is aware, the EU has appointed a Special Envoy, Mr. Ajello.  The Presidency and partners were fully briefed on developments in the area by him in Brussels this morning.  He had returned both from a visit to Zaire, where he met Mr. Kengo Wa Donda, the Prime Minister and from Kigali where he met the Rwandan President <Col N="1097" /> and Government.  In the light of this briefing and to take full advantage of the opportunity offered by the positive disposition of Zaire and Rwanda, the Irish Presidency and our EU partners have today mandated Mr. Ajello to return to the region as soon as possible to facilitate early dialogue between the authorities of both countries. Mr. Ajello is to be supported in his efforts by the Troika of EU Heads of Mission in Kinshasa and preparations for his departure are already under way.</P>
    <P>The EU remains gravely concerned about the volatile situation in South Kivu and the very real threat which it poses to any prospect for long-term stability in the Great Lakes Region.  As President of the EU, Ireland is deeply committed to the search for a solution to the crisis in South Kivu and will continue to work closely with partners and the EU Special Envoy in supporting the efforts of the international community to prevent it leading to a further humanitarian catastrophe in the Great Lakes region.</P>
    <P>The UN High Commissioner for Refugees yesterday stated that &ldquo;unless all parties to this conflict step back we are heading towards a humanitarian catastrophe&rdquo;.  I fully share this view.  We are in a situation of the gravest danger and Ireland as President of the EU will do everything in its power to help avert such a situation.  In my visits to the region and in my continuous contact with Governments there, I have met Government leaders, NGOs, people in refugee camps, women's groups and victims of violence.  As I stated to the European Parliament some weeks ago, there is a sense on all sides of the palpable need for a cohesive regional approach to the problems facing Rwanda, Burundi and neighbouring states.  In that context, we have particularly supported the efforts of the African Heads of State in the region, particularly the efforts of their mediator, the former President of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere.</P>
    <P>An important issue in resolving the problems of the Great Lakes region continues to be the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons.  The militarisation of many refugee camps is bolstered by arms trafficking and military training and remains a grave threat to the success of efforts towards achieving lasting peace and stability in the region.  This trend poses a clear potential risk of widening the conflict, causing further displacement of people and undermining the confidence necessary for refugee return.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, total Government assistance to the Great Lakes region has been over £9.5 million, by far the largest sum ever allocated by Ireland for humanitarian assistance in one region.  The Government is examining the current situation very closely from a humanitarian perspective. Further aid to the region, and specifically to Eastern Zaire, will be considered in the light of these developments and any appeals for funding from the UNHCR and NGOs will be given sympathetic consideration.  I have remained in continuous <Col N="1098" /> contact with the Irish NGOs in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>The genocide in Rwanda was an affront to the conscience of the world.  The situation now developing in Eastern Zaire holds the threat of deeply destabilising the entire region and causing a humanitarian disaster of the greatest magnitude. In the face of this, the international community must assume its responsibilities.  I have outlined the response of the Irish Presidency and I assure the House we will continue to work unceasingly to do everything open to us to help resolve this grave situation.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Mutton Island (Galway) Sewage Treatment Plant.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has come into the House to reply to my question.  Is he aware the proposal before Galway Corporation to consider the option of a sewage treatment plant based on alternative technology, that would allow the facilities to be built underground on Mutton Island, has been estimated by P.H. McCarthy &amp; Partners, consulting engineers, to have a true stage one scheme cost of £25,459,500 at current prices, a 28 per cent increase on the approved scheme's capital cost?  Is he aware that plant operation costs of the underground proposal are estimated by McCarthy's to have a true stage one annual operating cost of £770,300 at current prices, an increase of 150 per cent on the approved scheme's annual operating costs?  In view of this does he still consider the underground proposal to be a viable option for Galway Corporation?</P>
      <P>The Dáil Official Reports show I have raised the need for a proper sewage treatment plant and a new sea outfall for the Galway main drainage system with successive Ministers for the Environment since 1982.  Even though the need was recognised that long ago, in 1996 we are no nearer a decision on the matter than we were in the early eighties.  The scheme was then estimated to cost approximately £5 million and its capitalised costs since have increased by a factor of seven.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, announced he would not provide funds for the construction of a causeway to Mutton Island to facilitate the construction of the treatment plant and sea outfall on the island, as previously approved by him, and that Galway Corporation should consider seeking tenders for the design, construction and operation of an underground plant located on Mutton Island. This decision was a reversal of the Minister's earlier announcement and naturally caused great confusion in Galway, particularly as he gave no indication of the likely capital and operating cost differences or from where the moneys would come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the basis for the Minister's decision? Did he have a separate examination carried out by experts that led to his change of mind?  If so, <Col N="1099" /> who are the experts and is their report on the technical and financial aspects of the underground scheme on Mutton Island without a causeway available?  Will he submit a copy of it to Galway Corporation?  Has the Minister confirmation that the European Commission will approve funding for an underground plant on Mutton Island and, if not, will he indicate if he proposes to provide funding from the Exchequer towards the capital costs and an annual subsidy towards the running costs?</P>
    <P>At the time the Minister made his announcement, did he know the Segher's proposal for an underground waste water treatment plant at Mutton Island on a capitalised costs basis would cost £35 million compared to £23.7 million for the scheme he approved and announced earlier this year?  Is he telling Galway Corporation that he will approve an underground scheme for the island costing £11.3 million more than the scheme he approved earlier this year?  Furthermore, will he indicate if he intends to make an annual subsidy available to Galway Corporation to meet the huge annual operating costs of the Mutton Island underground scheme, calculated by McCarthy consulting engineers to cost £770,000 per annum? Does the Minister know this level of annual cost would require an increase of £77 per annum per household in Galway Corporation's service charges, an increase of more than 100 per cent on current domestic service charge levels or, alternatively, an increase of up to £13 in the pound in the commercial rates?</P>
    <P>In making his second announcement, contradicting his first, the Minister landed Galway in a major dilemma.  Did he know the financial consequences of putting the plant underground on the island?  Is he prepared to provide the initial capital and annual funding to enable that to be done?  I appeal to the Minister to shed realistic light on this matter in the hope that the continued widespread pollution of Galway Bay can be addressed and the quality of our bathing waters restored to blue flag status at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to explain to the House my position in regard to the provision of a new waste water treatment facility in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced of the urgent need for a modern facility to treat waste water from Galway city and its environs and, furthermore, I am committed to finding an environmentally sound solution in the shortest possible time.  There are few matters that could be more important to the continued prosperity and development of Galway than a proper sewerage system.  That is the view of every sector I have spoken to in Galway.  The rapid development of the city in the past 20 years cannot continue in a sustainable way without such facilities and the present highly unsatisfactory situation is adversely affecting tourism, the local environment and the priceless amenity of Galway <Col N="1100" /> Bay.  We must also remember that the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive requires that appropriate secondary treatment be in place in Galway by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I had become increasingly worried about the difficulties which have beset Galway Corporation's existing proposals for a treatment plant which would involve a permanent causeway to Mutton Island based on a conventional design.  These difficulties have, as the Deputy knows, culminated in a legal challenge to the proposals, with all the uncertainty and delays that entails.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I felt there was a responsibility on everybody involved to examine the possibility of other solutions which would address the difficulties associated with the proposals and deliver a modern facility in the shortest possible time.  These difficulties centre around the causeway and the visual impact of a conventional plant on Mutton Island.  An alternative approach, based on different technology, would offer an opportunity of meeting these concerns and it was in this context that I wrote to the Mayor of Galway on 3 October suggesting that Galway Corporation should consider such an approach.</P>
    <P>My view that, for environmental and practical reasons, Mutton Island remains the best overall location for the treatment works is known and my letter to the mayor repeated it.  When explaining my commitment to the Mutton Island location in the House on 9 May, I indicated that I would continue to consider ways in which the visual impact of the project could be minimised.  The suggestion I have put to the corporation is consistent with that position.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the alternative technology now available has permitted plants to be located underground in other cities where particular circumstances point to such a solution.  There appears to be no reason such a project would not be technically feasible on the Mutton Island site. Furthermore, the use of different technology in the handling of sludge, which can substantially reduce the weight and volume to be moved, could obviate the need for a permanent causeway.  The fact that projects incorporating these technologies have been developed and installed elsewhere would suggest that whatever additional costs may be entailed were not found to be prohibitive when weighed against the environmental benefits involved.</P>
    <P>I am aware the corporation's engineering consultants and the city engineer have both prepared reports on a proposal submitted by a Belgian company, but this is only one of a number of possible designs, based on alternative technologies, that might have relevance in the case of Galway.  Furthermore, that proposal, and the costings, can be considered at this point as only preliminary.  Not until consultants are appointed, and submissions made by prospective contractors will it be known, with certainty, what the capital <Col N="1101" /> and operating costs of a modern underground plant would be.</P>
    <P>As regards operating costs, it is a known fact that the current major programme of water and sewerage infrastructure investment will give rise to additional operating costs for local authorities generally, not just in Galway, and these were among the factors taken into account in the context of the review of local authority finance which I commissioned from consultants KPMG.</P>
    <P>I feel there are very good grounds for examining alternative technological solutions in the case of Galway.  If there is agreement in principle to the approach that I have proposed, my Department will co-operate in every way in the preparation of the necessary documentation and the speeding up of the revised proposals.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Soccer Facilities.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent publication by Dublin Chamber of Commerce carried the headline &ldquo;Dublin scores with sport&rdquo;.  Dublin could well score also with premiership football if there is a willingness and collective support from the Minister and various other interested groups.  Many years ago I recommended to those concerned that the strategically placed satellite region of Clondalkin/Lucan was the most logical place to situate an international soccer stadium.  I did not foresee the possibility or potential for premiership football being played here.  Owing to difficulties with staging international soccer games at Lansdowne Road, because of the playing surface as well as the safety requirements of FIFA, I feel the facilities are inadequate.  If we are to grow as a nation and provide the facilities necessary for international soccer than a national soccer stadium should be provided.</P>
      <P>At one stage I thought this would be a landmark project for the national lottery.  With such funding phased in over 20 or 25 years it could have been provided by the sporting sector and the Minister of State with responsibility for sport. However, as a result of planning permission having been granted for the project, other consortia have entered the equation and they should be encouraged and supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Dublin-based premiership team competing with teams like Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur would boost gates which are currently low.  Huge numbers of soccer fans here travelled to the World Cup in Italy and the United States.  It is <Col N="1102" /> obvious that if premiership football is provided in the greater Dublin region it would amount to the equivalent of an international soccer match being played in the city every second Saturday.</P>
    <P>The begrudging, petty and ridiculous attitude of the FAI is absolutely baffling.  Apart from some exceptions, they have been negative.  People involved in youth soccer are encouraged by the potential of bringing this standard of football to Dublin.  Surely the FAI could switch to summer soccer and with a bit of ingenuity could get their act together to co-operate with this move.</P>
    <P>Clubs like Stella Maris and other nurseries of Irish soccer consistently send young boys from 14 years of age upwards to UK clubs for trials.  If we have a premiership league team playing in Dublin, young players like Roy Keane and other excellent young Irishmen who have made the grade at the top level could play with a Dublin-based club.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should take a number of initiatives.  First, he might let it be known to the decision makers in this matter &mdash; the chairmen of the UK premiership clubs and to the FA premier league &mdash; that there is a welcome and support for the concept of this project in Dublin.  I cannot understand UEFA, and to a lesser extent FIFA, because it is generally perceived that a European super league is currently under consideration. Steps like this could begin to make it a reality.</P>
    <P>North Clondalkin is a strategic location for such a facility.  The national rail line passes by the site, which is just off the ring road motorway and other road networks.  The proposed 40,000 seater stadium has a tremendous economic spin off potential.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce strongly supports the relocation of Wimbledon football club to Dublin, citing the enormous economic impact such a move would have.  It estimates the Dublin Dons could be worth £20 million per year to the capital as well as creating in the region of 200 new jobs.  I urge the Minister of State to take a leading role and in an all-party spirit let it be known that we in this House are supportive of doing whatever we can to ensure this project comes to fruition and that international soccer is made available to Irish spectators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  There is no application before my Department seeking financial assistance for the provision of the facility mentioned by him.  Over the years there has been talk about a number of such facilities being developed in the Dublin area. The development of an outdoor football stadium at the Phoenix Park and in Neilstown was mentioned at different stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a facility such as that mentioned by Deputy Lawlor would be extremely costly and would require very careful consideration. There is already a huge demand on my sports budget for all types of facilities for all sports throughout the country and from soccer in <Col N="1103" /> particular.  Already there are 1,500 applications in my Department seeking grant assistance amounting to over £60 million in respect of sports facilities valued at £500 million.  Given the limited annual budget available to me, great care has to be taken to ensure that funds are used to the best possible effect.  I must have due regard to the legitimate demands of a variety of sports and the needs of the different areas.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for sport, I am particularly aware of the need to provide modern, adequate and attractive facilities for soccer clubs all over the country.  I am also conscious of my responsibility to ensure that the game of soccer develops and prospers at all levels and for all age groups, especially our young players.</P>
    <P>The explosion in the growth of soccer has been extraordinary in recent years.  As a consequence, this has generated an ever increasing demand for the necessary standard of facilities for schoolboy, junior and national league soccer.  I have been doing the best I can to assist all levels of soccer through grant aid for the provision and upgrading of pitches.  In the recent past, substantial grants have been given to many clubs, including in the Dublin area premier league clubs Bohemians, St. Patrick's Athletic, Shelbourne and the Athletic Union League (AUL) in Clonshaugh, for the development of soccer grounds in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This has been done with the co-operation of the FAI.  I regret the implied attack on the FAI. They have had their problems but I find the FAI is a body which has the development of the game at heart.  The FAI also has the responsibility of protecting the interests of all levels of soccer.</P>
    <P>It is open to the promoters of the project mentioned by the Deputy to submit a formal application for assistance under my Department's capital programme for the provision of sports facilities, but I stress that no application or approach has been made in the past 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no mention of financial support.  Is the Minister of State for or against it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to approaches from any source and I will listen to any proposals. However, any such application could only be considered in the context of available resources, the demand for assistance from other projects, the overall needs of soccer in Ireland and the many other sporting organisations seeking funds from my Department.  In that regard the working group which I appointed to develop an overall national strategy for sport is due to report before the end of the year.  In the course of its work the strategy group is reviewing aspects of sport, including future needs, provision and funding of facilities as well as reviewing existing facilities and the alarming under usage of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any project, such as a national outdoor stadium, could only be considered in the light of the strategy group's overall recommendations and the level of resources available.  I have not been <Col N="1104" /> approached in regard to the issue raised tonight, but my office and I are available at any time to meet anybody concerned with this project.  I would classify it as a business decision by a group of business people who are operating a business in London and who, for business reasons, wish to transfer to Dublin.  My mind and my office doors are open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Dan Wallace.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this matter which impinges on the human, social and economic rights of members of the Defence Forces. Last August Army and Navy personnel were told money was not available for a voluntary early retirement scheme and it would not be available up to the end of the year.  The Minister gave those personnel the option of taking unpaid pre-retirement leave.  They were asked to sign up for it before 1 September and many of them did.</P>
      <P>It is a very difficult decision to take voluntary retirement and having made that decision it is difficult to go back on it.  Many of the personnel concerned consider that they availed of the unpaid pre-retirement leave on a false premise.  Many of them were unaware that they would not be entitled to receive social welfare payments from 1 September to the end of December because their contract of service remained in place.</P>
      <P>Additional money became available in October.  To say that they were bewildered, disappointed and felt let down when they discovered that in excess of 40 of their colleagues were in a position to receive voluntary early retirement is an understatement.  Those who had signed on for unpaid prevoluntary retirement leave were overlooked. They felt their colleagues who received voluntary early retirement who did not accept the unpaid pre-retirement leave had a right to first choice on the voluntary early retirement as it came onstream, but that it had not been made available to them.</P>
      <P>The Department owes those people a debt of gratitude as well as a debt for military service at home and abroad.  Many of them served with great distinction.  The percentage who have not had any work or pay since 1 September is significant and many of them are on their uppers.  They view with amazement the fact that mainly officers were given voluntary early retirement when it became available in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interim payments will not suffice.  Those members are seeking full payment and consider that the Minister and the Department owe them at least voluntary early retirement from 1 September. I hold the Minister in high esteem and regard him as having a heart, being gracious and magnanimous.  In the circumstances under which those members accepted unpaid pre-retirement leave I exhort him to give a commitment that if all the money is not available in 1996 he will <Col N="1105" /> ensure back pay is made available to those members from the 1997 Estimate.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for allowing me the opportunity to make a brief contribution. This treatment is typical of the Government's attitude to the ordinary citizen as has been shown in other matters.  However, the people involved were no ordinary citizens, but defenders of this State who served their country well.  It is unacceptable that they should be treated in such a slipshod manner and be left without their well earned pensions.</P>
      <P>Collins Barracks, one of the largest military installations in Munster, is in my constituency. There are hundreds of Defence Forces personnel living on the north side of Cork and none of them would feel remotely inspired by the shoddy events concerning those soldiers' pensions.  They could not feel confident that the Minister is doing all he can for them, as befits his office.</P>
      <P>The ordinary citizen has suffered under the Government and now those charged with the nation's safety are also being insulted.  A recent statement indicated it was believed that those members who had taken pre-retirement leave were all getting jobs.  I know of one member of the Defence Forces in Cork who for the best part of two or three weeks could not make up his mind about whether to take the offer.  He did not know where he stood and was not getting any advice from the Army.  He was left high and dry and did not have any income.  That is unsatisfactory and to crown it 40 of those members who refused the offer can now say that because they stayed on money has been provided to allow them leave the Defence Forces with their pensions.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to rectify this position.  Like Deputy O'Keeffe, I know the Minister and I am sure he is concerned.  This is an unsatisfactory position for the members concerned who have given their lives to the Defence Forces, many of them having not worked anywhere else.  They are entitled to more from this State and it is up to the Minister to ensure the necessary resources are provided to correct this unsatisfactory position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will tell the Deputies the truth and I want them to listen carefully.  I want to make it absolutely clear that no member of the Defence Forces was persuaded to take voluntary early retirement <Col N="1106" /> against his wishes, as suggested in media reports. Neither did any member get incorrect information. I went to great lengths to ensure that all were fully informed of the implications of their decisions.  The allegations that anybody was cajoled or conned into taking voluntary early retirement or the pre-retirement support leave is completely inaccurate and untrue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The voluntary early retirement scheme is one element of the implementation plan which covers the first phase of the ten year programme for the reorganisation and restructuring of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise once again that the voluntary early retirement scheme is completely voluntary and no member of the Defence Forces will be required to leave compulsorily.  The terms of the scheme are very attractive and this is borne out by the number of personnel who applied.  This year the number of applications received was more than twice the number of places available.</P>
      <P>The terms of the voluntary early retirement scheme apply equally across the rank structure of the Defence Forces.  In the case of personnel who qualify for a pension and a retirement gratuity, the additional sum is calculated on the basis of four weeks' pay for each complete year of potential service remaining to age 60 years.  The maximum payment is 78 weeks pay.  In the case of personnel who qualify for a retirement gratuity only, the additional lump sum is calculated on the basis of five weeks' pay for each complete year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum payment of 100 weeks' pay in the case of NCOs and privates and 55 weeks' pay in the case of officers. The additional lump sums are fully exempt from income tax.  Apart from the financial package, I have provided a wide range of support services, including the provision of outplacement consultants to assist personnel leaving the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Dan Wallace's point, it is extraordinary that any individual could say to a Deputy that they left the Defence Forces without anyone being available to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; to advise them in advance. Some £0.5 million is being spent to employ consultants to advise people well in advance of taking the voluntary early retirement scheme and to assist them in getting alternative employment.  I wanted to ensure that members of the Defence Forces were as fully informed as possible on the implications of their decisions and I arranged for advisory teams to be available in each command area.  Furthermore, successful applicants were given two weeks to either accept or reject an offer of voluntary early retirement.  In other words, <Col N="1107" /> after their application was received and considered by the independent board, they then had a further two weeks after the offer was made to make up their minds.  They could also avail of the above services to help them to make an important decision.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance announced in this year's budget that £13 million was being provided for the operation of the scheme this year.  On that basis it was estimated that approximately 450 personnel in certain categories would be offered voluntary early retirement.  All the applications were evaluated by the Voluntary Early Retirement Board.  This board included commissioned and non-commissioned military personnel, departmental officials and an independent civilian.</P>
      <P>When it became apparent that not everyone who applied this year could be offered voluntary early retirement, the representative associations made approaches on behalf of some of their members who, they represented, had offers of alternative employment in civilian life and who wished to avail of voluntary early retirement.  It was represented that these job offers would not hold good for a long time.  To facilitate these people, they were allowed to avail of unpaid pre-retirement support leave until January next, when they will receive both their voluntary early retirement and pension gratuity.  I must emphasise that this concession was intended primarily, at the request of the representative associations, to facilitate the small number of personnel who, it had been represented, were in a position to take up alternative employment immediately.  It was not thought that this concession would be of interest or of benefit to the majority of those personnel who could not be accommodated by this year's scheme.  Personnel who did not avail of this concession did not prejudice their right to apply or be considered for next year's voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>Some 450 places were available at a cost of £13 million.  We were asked if we would allow some personnel, who would qualify next year but who had a job offer immediately and were not included in the 450 places, to go now to enable them to accept the job offer and take their voluntary early retirement on 1 January next year with their pension.  We agreed out of the goodness of our heart to help people who had jobs and who, perhaps, might lose them on 1 January next year.</P>

As a result of what happened, I am seriously considering whether such a concession should be offered next year.  It is disheartening when one tries to help people, who are represented as having employment but who do not qualify this year, by telling them they can <Col N="1108" /> avail of a job and guaranteeing their voluntary early retirement on 1 January and then to discover that people left on unpaid leave voluntarily with no employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am disappointed that a small number have availed of those services to date.  I ask the Deputies to encourage people they know to use the services available to get advice and, I hope, alternative employment.</P>
      <P>Some time after granting this concession, it was found possible to offer approximately 50 additional voluntary early retirement places this year.  I emphasise that, as in the case of the original 450 personnel granted voluntary early retirement, the additional places were awarded in a strict order of priority which had been established by the Voluntary Early Retirement Board.</P>

That leave was purely voluntary and regardless of whether a person opted for it, they did not suffer.</P>
      <P>It is now apparent that some members of the Defence Forces who availed of the unpaid pre-retirement support leave have not taken up civilian employment, for which the scheme was primarily designed, and now find themselves with no income.  Some people who opted out on a voluntary basis have no job and no income and we are now faced with a very difficult position.  To ensure that no individual suffers hardship as a result of such a decision I have made arrangements that an advance from their voluntary early retirement gratuity should be made to personnel who are in genuine need.  Applications have been invited from personnel who wish to avail of the advance.  The first portion of the advance, which will amount to £1,500, will issue shortly to eligible applicants.  The second portion of £1,500 will be issued early in December.</P>

People who did not qualify in the first group approached their representative associations, who in turn approached the Department, to say that they had a chance of a job.  They recognised that they would not qualify this year but, given that the scheme will continue next year, they would qualify then.  Having considered the matter and being conscious of the need for people taking voluntary early retirement to switch to civilian life, I did not think they should be deprived of a job if it was offered to them.  It was on that basis they were given pre-retirement leave.  Nobody was asked or forced to leave.  If those people had remained until 1 January when the list would be opened again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The National Development Strategy for the Food Industry provides a framework for growth in the industry and a blueprint for its development to the year 2000.  Following my launch of the strategy in February 1995, the implementing agencies published their five year development plans.  These plans are consistent with the strategy and detail the arrangements for implementation of the various measures contained in it.</P>
      <P>There has been good progress to date under the strategy.  Up to the end of June 1996 713 projects involving total grant assistance of £78.4 million were approved.  These projects cover investments in fixed assets, research and development, marketing and promotion and human resources. While the time lag between approval of projects and their completion prevents definitive conclusions at this stage, I am satisfied that these investments will contribute to the overall aim of maximising the industry's potential to create national wealth and employment.  One particular welcome development is the emphasis being put by project promoters on innovation and added value.  This will enable further expansion in high value sectors such as the prepared consumer foods one which witnessed a 17 per cent growth in exports in 1995.</P>
      <P>The development strategy cannot afford to be and is not a static one.  The mechanisms are in place to allow for its review and to take account of changing circumstances.  A committee, which includes representatives of the European Commission and the social partners, monitors the strategy's progress.  Based on its assessment, the committee may highlight issues of concern and recommend appropriate action.  As a result of such recommendations, some changes in detail to the strategy have been effected.  For instance, an additional £7.5 million in public expenditure was allocated to marketing and promotion for 1996 to cater for the high level of interest in the initiatives taken by An Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>Allied to the above monitoring procedures, the development strategy is subject to independent evaluation.  Such an evaluation is currently in progress and will form the basis for a mid-term review of the strategy in 1997.  The evaluation will be comprehensive covering implementation to date, the factors that will influence future developments and the possible changes that need to be made.</P>
      <P>The events in the beef sector this year have had an adverse effect on the food industry.  The development strategy, with its in-built monitoring and review procedures, will take these into account and will have an important role to play in resolving the current problems.  I am satisfied that the strategy's fundamental principles of competitiveness, innovation, added value and quality remain valid and must continue to be the foundation of the industry's future development.</P>

      <P>Part of Ireland's forestry policy is to increase the planting of temperate hardwoods or broadleaves, which can substitute for tropical imports.  Broadleaves currently account for about 16 per cent of the forest estate and broadleaf planting has increased significantly from 3 to 4 per cent some years ago to 20 per cent in 1995. This target level is maintained in the Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector, under which an afforestation programme will continue up to the year 2030.  I am obviously anxious to promote, wherever possible, import substitution in this area in the interests of employment and wealth creation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Trade in tropical timber is a complex matter. Tropical timber is the developing countries' third most important commodity after petroleum and coffee; trade is not the major cause of damage to tropical forests; and the sustainable management of all such forests is not something which can be achieved overnight, even with countries' best efforts.  Trade is also subject to WTO rules and a ban or restriction imposed unilaterally by a contry or by the European Union on imports of tropical timber as suggested would be inconsistent with them.</P>

My Department will play its role as appropriate in a support role to the Department of the Environment, both at EU and national level to ensure that such livestock are regulated in a manner that <Col N="1113" /> will protect human health and the environment as well as caring for the welfare needs of such livestock.</P>

      <P>Environmental designations in relation to natural habitats and wildlife are a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Undoubtedly, however, such designations will have an impact on farming practices. My Department has been involved closely with the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, farm organisations and others in agreeing farming conditions for the Burren and other proposed natural heritage areas.  My Department's involvement arose primarily through a supplementary measure to the rural environment protection scheme.  Under REPS, farmers who have some or all of their lands in a proposed NHA must comply with conditions for the conservation of the proposed NHA as prescribed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. Farmers who join REPS and farm in accordance with the conservation conditions obtain an additional £30 per hectare, subject to a maximum of 40 hectares.  Farming conditions for these areas were agreed on 4 October 1996.</P>
      <P>I understand that the designation of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas will be effected by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in its implementation of the provisions of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive respectively into national legislation.  Recently preliminary discussions took place at official level between my Department and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in relation to proposed legislation on SAC.  It is my understanding that further discussions in this regard will be taking place in the near future.  No discussions have taken place between our two Departments in relation to special protection areas.</P>
      <P>The principal area of common interest between my Department and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on these issues is on how they impact on REPS participants and how REPS can enhance such areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The possibilities of recovering EU disallowances which related to breaches of EU regulations in the beef sector were examined by a group of senior officials from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General, assisted by an independent legal adviser.  The group furnished its report to the Minister for Finance and to me in March 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal advice obtained by the group, and endorsed by it, was that the disallowance levied on Ireland did not of itself give any entitlement to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to recover any part of the disallowance from companies who may have featured in the case made against Ireland by the Commission.  Any proceedings brought against companies must be based upon a recognised cause of action in Irish <Col N="1115" /> law and be proven in accordance with the applicable rules of evidence in civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Department sought a legal opinion as to whether proceedings could be instituted to recoup any sums lost through abuse of the intervention scheme against companies named in the report of the beef tribunal.  This opinion has only recently come to hand and is at present under consideration.</P>

    <P>I am arranging to send the Deputy a breakdown by county.</P>
    <P>No applicant claimed more than £50,000 for set aside in 1995 or 1996.  The number of farmers in receipt of set aside payments for amounts up to £7,000 was 3,525 in 1995 and a somewhat similar figure is estimated for 1996.  The reduction in the total number of arable area aid applicants likely to qualify for set aside payments of more than £7,000 in 1996 is due largely to the reduction to 15 per cent of the maximum set aside area for this year.</P>
    <P>The total amount of money paid out in set aside since its implementation is as follows: 1993, £6.8 million; 1994, £12.3 million; 1995, £11.5 million; total, £30.6 million.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies I gave on 27 June last to a series of questions on animal traceability.  I indicated then that my short-term aim was to centralise certain animal location information onto one computer file.  Progress has been made in that regard and the resulting computer file, known as ALF &mdash; animal location file &mdash; should be available for use by the Department's veterinary certification service around the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I also indicated my aim of developing a comprehensive animal history or traceability system using a wide range of location information sources including disease scheme records, premium and headage scheme records, calf birth registration, movements off farm, movements into and out of marts and disposal for slaughter or export.  Such a system, which will go beyond the computer file already referred to, will require considerable investment and development effort. It will be put in place as speedily as possible but it will be some time before this fully comprehensive system becomes operational.</P>
      <P>About £1 million will be spent in 1996 in developing the animal location file which involves extending the Department's computer network to district veterinary offices, slaughter plants, assembly points and export ports.  This is in addition to the approximate £3 million already spent over 1994 and 1995 in developing the networking system between the Department's local livestock offices and headquarters.  The amount to be included in my Department's 1997 expenditure allocation to enable further development of the computer system will be finalised in the Estimates context.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is already aware of the arrangements which I have now put in place for the application of a 10 per cent clawback to quota transferred by way of private land leasing and sales.  The objective, as I have already stated to the House, is to bias the operation of the quota system in favour of active milk producers by redirecting available quota to temporary leasing and restructuring schemes.  Both these schemes give priority to the smaller and medium scale producers and therefore the new arrangements will be to the benefit of these categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the future operation of these and <Col N="1117" /> other schemes within the quota system is concerned, it is my intention to keep them under ongoing review.  I have asked the quota review group to consider the schemes in the light of the results they achieved this year so that recommendations can be made regarding any change deemed necessary before the commencement of the next quota year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 33 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>At the end of September 1996 milk deliveries exceeded our national quota when calculated over the same period by 4.8 per cent.  If milk deliveries for the remainder of this quota year were to remain even at the same level as last year, dairy farmers would face a super levy liability in the region of £40 million.</P>
      <P>In this context, therefore, irrespective of what measures are put in place, there is no possibility of meeting the quota requirements of producers who are seriously over-quota irrespective of their location within the country.  It is the producers themselves who must act responsibly and in accordance with expert direction from their Teagasc and co-operative advisers on how to minimise their liability.</P>
      <P>The objective of the recently introduced clawback measure on land-quota leases and sales is to promote the temporary leasing scheme as an alternative to land-quota leasing, and to favour quota restructuring over land-quota sales.  Under these schemes, priority is afforded to smaller scale producers and so the measure will primarily benefit these.  While there will be some positive effect this year, the main benefit of the clawback will not be felt until the beginning of the next quota year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently announced details of the third stage of temporary leasing under which I have <Col N="1119" /> given total priority to smaller scale producers including those who have relied on temporary leasing in the past.</P>

      <Quest>the current situation in relation to the £30 million in securities held by his Department, some or all of which must be forfeit due to breaches of export refund regulations, in view of the revelations in the most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that there were further EU disallowances against Ireland for unsatisfactory control over securities and inadequate proofs of arrival relative to his Department's administration of beef export refunds.</Quest>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy's party colleague, Deputy O'Malley, during the Adjournment debate on 2 October last, £30 million of export refund securities relating to the trade of one company in the late 1980s is the subject of a confidential investigation.  The specific disallowances to which the Deputy refers is a different issue.  They were imposed as part of the clearance of the 1991 EAGGF account.</P>
      <P>Since 1991 additional resources, both staff, systems and computerisation, have been devoted to the beef export refund area resulting in significant upgrading of administrative and technical control exercised both by my Department and Customs.  This investment has shown positive results.  Disallowances on the 1992 account amounted to just £76,000 out of an expenditure of £124 million &mdash; 0.06 per cent of the total.  Furthermore, following a more recent intensive systems audit of prefinancing beef export refund expenditure amounting to £428 million, indications from the European Commission are that no disallowances are to be proposed.</P>

The court found that the proper legislative procedures had not been adhered to in the adoption of the uniform principles.</P>

      <P>I understand that the practice in question is associated with fox hunting.  As I indicated in a previous reply to the House, it is generally recognised that field sports like fox hunting are part of the traditional fabric of rural life and have the support and participation of a broad cross-section of people in rural communities.  This is strongly reflected in the many representations made to me by organisations and individuals in this matter.  Nevertheless, as I indicated to the Deputy on a previous occasion, there are aspects of fox hunting which require consideration from the standpoint of animal welfare.  The Deputy is aware that I have afforded the many parties with an interest in this issue an opportunity to let me have their views, by way of meetings or written submissions.  This is a most complex and emotive issue and I wish to have the benefit of hearing the full range of views before taking decisions.  This consultative process is well advanced but not yet complete.  When it is, I will take account of the balance of the views received in any decisions to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the remarks referred to by the Deputy.  The importation of cattle and other livestock from other EU member states or third countries is governed by a number of EU measures which set out strict conditions for such imports, including requirements that the animals have tested negative for certain diseases and that they are accompanied by a health certificate issued by an authorised veterinarian in the country of dispatch.  The requirements of the EU single market, however, preclude me from establishing animal health conditions over and above those set out at EU level.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a number of farming, breeding and veterinary organisations, under the auspices of the RDS, produced an invaluable code of practice on the safer importation of cattle, sheep and goats in September 1995 while the National Pig Health Council has been operating successfully a similar code of practice in the pig sector for some time.  I have on many previous occasions urged importers to follow closely the terms of these codes when importing livestock.</P>

      <P>I have already advised the House, most recently in the course of the Adjournment debate on 10 October 1996, of my two meetings with Burmese Foreign Minister, Mr. Ohn Gyaw, in Jakarta on 22 July 1996 and in New York on 26 September 1996.  There are no immediate plans for a mission by the EU Troika to Burma and the border regions.  Diplomatic representatives of EU member states accredited to Burma are in regular contact with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy and a wide spectrum of information regarding the situation in Burma is being provided to the EU on a continuing basis.</P>
      <P>In the resolution adopted at last year's United Nations General Assembly which Ireland supported, the Burmese authorities were urged to give particular attention to conditions in the country's jails and to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to communicate freely and confidentially with prisoners.</P>
      <P>I have raised with Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw, on both occasions when I met him, the serious matter of the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the death of Mr. James Leander Nichols in Insein Prison on 22 June 1996.  I am still awaiting a satisfactory explanation from the Burmese authorities.  I also informed Mr. Ohn Gyaw that the EU Presidency has requested the United Nations Working Party on Arbitrary Detention and Imprisonment to visit Burma to examine, <i>inter alia</i>, the manner whereby those who have been detained or imprisoned are being treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any plans for members of the State Law and Order Restoration Council to visit Ireland during the current EU Presidency.  I am, of course, aware of the recent action which was taken by the United States of America regarding the imposition of visa restrictions and the subsequent reciprocal action which has been taken by the Burmese authorities.  A number of restrictive measures have already been adopted by the European Union, including expulsion of all military personnel attached to the diplomatic representations of Burma in member states of the European Union, and withdrawal of all military personnel attached to diplomatic representations of the member states of the European Union in Burma; an embargo on arms, munitions and military equipment; and suspension of development co-operation with Burma, with the exception of humanitarian assistance.  Exceptions may be made for projects and programmes in support of human rights and democracy as well as those concentrating on poverty alleviation and, in particular, the provision of basic needs for the poorest section of the population, in the context of decentralised co-operation through local civilian <Col N="1126" /> authorities and non-governmental organisations. The European Union is actively considering the adoption of further possible restrictive measures.</P>
    <P>The question of the investigation of bank accounts is a matter for individual EU member states and is governed by the respective legislation relating to this matter in the individual jurisdictions.  As regards Ireland's criminal law, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides for the confiscation, on conviction of a drug trafficking offence or other indictable offence, of property judged to represent the benefits of that offence. Provision is also made for the initial freezing of property as part of this process.  In addition, the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, provides for a separate procedure whereby the High Court may, on application, order the freezing and ultimate disposal of the proceeds of crime.</P>
    <P>The concerns of the EU with regard to the situation in Burma were expressed in its memorandum to the 51st UN General Assembly, which accompanied the address I delivered on behalf of the Union to the General Assembly last month. A copy of the memorandum has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The question of human rights in Burma will also be addressed in the near future in the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, currently under way in New York.  It is expected that a draft resolution will be considered.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation will, of course, support a satisfactory draft resolution which reflects our concerns.  It will seek to ensure the widest possible support for such a resolution.  We hope that this resolution will express grave concern that the Government of Burma has still not implemented its commitment to take all necessary steps towards democracy in the light of the results of the elections held in 1990 and voice concern at the reports by the UN Special Rapporteur at the continued violations of human rights in Burma, including killings of civilians, arbitrary arrest and detention, restrictions on freedom of expression and association, torture, forced labour, abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed at ethnic and religious minorities.</P>
    <P>I would be interested in examining any specific cases with regard to the provision of assistance to Burmese students whose full-time education has been interrupted.</P>
    <P>I have already informed the House that the EU has requested the Special Rapporteur on Myannmar to investigate the death of Mr. Nichols and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights to take action on Burma.  I will continue to seek the free and unhindered access to Burma for independent human rights and humanitarian non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>In 1995 Burma is estimated to have produced 2,340 tonnes of opium which, potentially, would form the basis for 195 tonnes of heroin.  Burma is the world's largest opium producer and the regime has little authority over the opium producing <Col N="1127" /> areas largely in the Shan State which are dominated by ethnic insurgent groups.  The nature of the regime in Burma and its bad record in the field of human rights as well as serious doubts about its commitment to the eradication of opium production and trafficking have not permitted the EU to engage directly with the Burmese authorities in the drugs area.  The United Nations International Drug Control Programme, UNDCP, is the main body engaged in the drug problem in this region.  It is involved in pilot projects in alternative development in Burma and in efforts to establish precise production figures.</P>
    <P>In January 1996, one of the principal producers of opium, Khun Sa, surrendered with several thousand of his Mong Tai Army troops following secret negotiations with the Burmese authorities. Khun Sa was believed to control most of the heroin laboratories in the Burma-Thai border area and was held responsible for handling 50 per cent of all heroin produced in the region.  It is still too soon to say what impact this surrender will have on the export of heroin from Burma.  The EU is engaged with the ASEAN countries in efforts to deal with the drug problem in the region.</P>
    <P>The arms embargo already introduced by the European Union covers weapons designed to kill and their ammunition, weapon platforms, non-weapon platforms and ancillary equipment.  Also covered are spare parts, repairs, maintenance and transfer of military technology.  Contracts entered into prior to the date of entry into force of the embargo are not affected by this EU Common Position.  I am not aware that the United Kingdom is in breach of this arms embargo.</P>
    <P>As regards commercial relations with Burma involving companies in the semi-State sector this would be governed by, <i>inter alia</i>, the current export control regulations.</P>
    <P>Irish citizens seeking travel information on Burma from the Department of Foreign Affairs are advised that they are required to keep to officially designated tourist areas and that travelling within the country other than by train, road, river or air is not recommended, nor is cycling, ballooning or hiking in remote areas.  We also advise them that visitors may face unwelcome attention from the authorities in areas recently opened to foreigners and that it is not permitted to photograph military installations or personnel.</P>
    <P>Irish visitors to Burma are advised not to attempt to enter the country by road from Thailand and that overland entry from China may be permitted at several border points, but is not guaranteed.  Advice about entry from China should be sought in advance from the Burmese authorities.  People travelling should seek medical advice beforehand and obtain any inoculations that may be recommended.  They should also have travel insurance, including evacuation by air.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to enter into dialogue or to offer material assistance to the National Coalition Government of Burma in <Col N="1128" /> exile.  However, I am prepared to examine any proposals which might be made in this regard.</P>
    <P>In January of this year, the European Commission initiated an investigation into allegations of the use of forced labour in Burma.  The investigation was initiated following complaints by the European Trade Union Conference and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and it is being carried out in the context of the EU's Generalised System of Preferences.</P>
    <P>Ireland was represented at recent hearings which formed part of the investigation.  The Commission report on the investigation is expected early in 1997.  The Council of Ministers can be expected to take an early decision on any recommendations contained in that report regarding the continued application of the benefits of the Generalised System of Preferences to Burma.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Government of Burma to comply with its obligations under the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 29, prohibiting the practice of forced labour and forced portering.  In this connection, the Burmese authorities should urgently take the appropriate measures to repeal the offending legal provisions under the Villages Act and the Towns Act to prevent the continuation of the practice of forced labour.  In this regard, I would encourage the Government of Burma to co-operate with the ILO to that end.</P>
    <P>I do not have any current plans to request the EU Council of Ministers to provide assistance to the National Coalition Government in exile of Burma.</P>
    <P>In relation to an EU trade and investment boycott I refer to my reply to Question No. 103 of 25 September 1996.</P>

      <P>The Government, with its EU partners, remains deeply concerned about deteriorating human rights in Burma and the resulting flow of refugees into Bangladesh and Thailand.  The European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has provided more than £720,000 in humanitarian relief to refugees on the Thai-Burmese border.  The provision of further aid to Burmese <Col N="1129" /> refugees is under consideration in the light of evolving circumstances.</P>
      <P>In the event of any further deterioration in the situation, Ireland, in consultation with the other EU member states and the Commission, will take appropriate steps with a view to ensuring that the humanitarian interests of the refugees will be protected to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to remove VAT from incontinence pads, which are currently taxed at the standard rate of 21 per cent.</P>
      <P>The position is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish law must comply.  EU rules prohibit the introduction of new zero rates.  Accordingly, it is not open to me to remove VAT from incontinence pads.  Existing zero rates, including that applying to children's clothing, which includes nappies, may be retained on a transitional basis.</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that the health boards provide incontinence pads to persons with a mental or physical disability who hold medical cards or long-term illness cards where a medical condition causes a requirement for such items.  Thus, the State provides incontinence pads free of charge to those most in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The acute hospital service in Dublin has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services, particularly over the winter period in the past number of years. The causes of the problems which arise have been well documented.  Many elderly patients require acute hospital care initially but much of their recovery period could be spent in step-down sub-acute accommodation.  For a number of years now there has been a shortage of sub-acute beds, particularly in Dublin.  This has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1991 there have been a number of reviews into the accident and emergency services provided by the six major hospitals in Dublin.  In 1990 the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group which was chaired by Professor David Kennedy examined these issues and made wide-ranging recommendations regarding the more efficient use of all acute hospital services in the Dublin area.  These recommendations covered aspects which were common to all of the Dublin accident and emergency <Col N="1131" /> hospitals, such as the interaction between the accident and emergency department and other departments within the acute hospitals; admission, bed management and discharge policies; and the need for step down facilities for elderly inpatients no longer requiring acute hospital services.  Following the publication in September 1991 of the reports of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, a second group, the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group, which was also chaired by Professor David Kennedy, monitored and reviewed progress in relation to the implementation of these reports &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; recommendations. This group found that the implementation of the recommendations was broadly satisfactory, although it was recognised that to put them fully into effect would take some time.  Earlier this year a study was carried out under the auspices of the Eastern Health Board which analysed bed utilisation within the six major accident and emergency hospitals.  This report has been the basis of a review of internal work practices, not only within the six Dublin accident and emergency hospitals but also on a national level.</P>
    <P>I have already provided details to the House of the significant improvements which I have put in place to improve the acute and sub-acute sectors since I came into office &mdash; see extract from Official Report of 1 May, 1996, vol. 464, cols. 1853-1856 &mdash; and I hope to put additional facilities in place for the winter of 1996-97.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> At present an opportunistic cervical screening service is available to all women through their general practitioner, family planning clinics, maternity hospitals and special clinics organised by health boards.  There is no charge for the laboratory test, provided it is carried out in a publicly funded laboratory, but women must pay for the taking of the smear itself.  However, under the general medical services, women having a smear for diagnostic purposes are entitled to free services from their general practitioner.</P>
      <P>An expert group has reviewed all of the aspects of cervical screening and made recommendations on how the present system could be improved. One of its recommendations called for the introduction of an organised national screening programme. The report forms a major component of a national cancer strategy, which deals with cancer services, which I have submitted to other Government Departments for their views.  When these views have been received, I intend to forward the cancer strategy to Government for its consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The matter raised is primarily for the attention of the North-Western Health Board as the employer of the person concerned.  The information available to me in relation to this case is as follows: the person to whom the question relates has been on continuous sick leave for over three and a half years now.  The health board is dealing with the case in accordance with the board's approved sick leave policy and procedures.</P>
      <P>The Department has been aware of this case as the individual in question has been paid at pension rate for 18 months.  Pension rate of pay is normally only sanctioned when there is a reasonable expectation that the employee will return to work and a date of return has been ascertained. Only in exceptional cases should pension rate be sanctioned for more than six months.  Because of the sensitivities of the case this sanction has been continued.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is processing a claim of having sustained an injury at work.  An appeal has been lodged with the Minister for the Environment regarding the payment of injury grant under section 52 of the local government superannuation scheme which provides for the payment of 5/6ths of pension on a continuous basis to employees injured in the course of their duties. In addition legal proceedings have been instituted against the board and her case is set for hearing.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 71, 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of dental services in County Donegal and the filling of dental posts is the statutory responsibility of the North-Western Health Board.  I understand that the board has made repeated efforts to recruit dentists for the Inishowen area.  In June the Local Appointments Commission recommended a dentist for appointment to the board and it is the board's intention to deploy this dentist in the Inishowen area as soon as she is available to take up the appointment. The board has requested the Local Appointments Commission to readvertise existing vacancies.</P>
      <P>The board has on two occasions over recent months advertised for the temporary appointment of dentists to fill vacant posts in the region. The board held interviews as a result of these competitions but were unable to make appointments to the vacancies in the Inishowen area. However, the board, through the principal dental surgeon for the Donegal area, is at present in contact with a number of dentists who may be interested in taking up employment with the board in the Inishowen area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to assist the board in its recruitment difficulties my Department has allowed the board to grant incremental credit to dentists recruited on a temporary basis.  In addition the board offers part-time work to dentists where that is more <Col N="1134" /> suitable for the dentists considering employment. There is no question of a crisis developing in the Inishowen area.  The board is continuing to provide a reduced service in Inishowen by redeploying a dentist from the Letterkenny clinic and the practice will continue to be reviewed. There is currently a full complement of dentists in the Sligo/Leitrim area.  The dentist/patient ratio varies in all of the board's areas from time to time.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently in discussion with the staff associations on the restructuring of the health board dental services.  One of the benefits to flow from agreement in this area would be to provide a more attractive career structure for health board dentists which would assist health boards in appointing dentists to areas which experience recruitment difficulties.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The North-Eastern Health Board's policy document, <i>A New Direction for Acute Hospital Services</i>, which was adopted by the board in 1993, recommended the establishment of two hospital groupings, the Cavan/Monaghan group and the Louth/Meath group.</P>
      <P>The Louth/Meath group, which consists of the three acute hospitals at Drogheda, Dundalk and Navan, operates as a co-ordinated, complementary grouping, which provides an extensive range of services to the region.</P>
      <P>When the board's policy for acute hospitals was adopted, it was decided that paediatric services would be developed at the International Missionary Training Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda to cover the Louth/Meath catchment area.  My Department has fully endorsed the board's policy in this regard, and in 1995 I approved a consultant neonatologist and a consultant paediatrician post for the Louth/Meath region.  My Department has also provided substantial funding, over the past two years, for the necessary infrastructural support for these posts.</P>
      <P>Sick children are admitted to the paediatric unit at the International Missionary Training Hospital, Drogheda, which has a complement of three paediatricians, one of whom is a neonatologist. Paediatric outreach services, including day services and out-patient clinics are provided at Louth County Hospital, Dundalk, which includes the examination of newborn babies.  Outreach services to County Meath will commence in December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> The Louth/Meath grouping has resulted in an improved service to the population of the region as a whole, and has provided equity and better access for patients.</P>

Copies are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Guidelines on forestry development, high amenity landscapes and the scope and content of development plans are now being prepared.  Priorities for further land use planning guidelines are being considered in the context of the national sustainable development strategy which is currently in its final stage of preparation in the Department. <Col N="1137" /> The strategy will address the implications of the principles and objectives of sustainable development for land use planning, while the guidelines contain greater detail on the practical implementation of these principles.

      <P>The criteria applied in the selection of schools for inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage initiative and the selection process itself were devised and carried out by the Education Research Centre following close consultation with the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach adopted was based on the outcome of detailed studies of educational disadvantage <Col N="1139" /> which I had commissioned from the two bodies in question.</P>
    <P>Among the key issues raised in these studies was a concern that the criteria previously used in selecting schools for support did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage.  It was recommended that the selection criteria be amended to better reflect educational disadvantage as manifested in rural as well as urban settings.</P>
    <P>The studies also recommended a more targeted approach, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  It was considered that supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the above findings, the Education Research Centre considered that the rural phase of the scheme should be targeted on schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly schools in rural areas which serve dispersed populations and which have concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the school system.</P>
    <P>All eligible schools, including Belmullet junior school, were invited by the Education Research Centre to apply for inclusion in the scheme.  As the Deputy is aware, the school in question was successful in its application.</P>
    <P>However, the senior school in question was not eligible for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of its enrolments and staffing which exceeded the limitations deemed appropriate by the Education Research Centre.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to consider the inclusion of a school which did not qualify on the basis of criteria which have been applied to all schools.</P>

      <P>With regard to the age cohort taking examinations, the position is that the junior certificate examination is taken by pupils at the age of 14, 15 or 16 years and the leaving certificate examination is taken by pupils at the age of 17, 18, 19 or 20 years.  Candidates may repeat the leaving certificate examination but may not repeat the junior certificate examination.  It is not possible to give the Deputy the information which he has sought in the precise form in which he has requested it.</P>
      <P>I have provided information for the Deputy regarding examinations in table 2.  I have counted all results of grade D or higher at any level as &ldquo;passes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.  The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>This initiative is based on the outcome of detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.  Among the findings of these studies was a recommendation that a more targeted approach be adopted, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The studies also concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
      <P>Under the Breaking the Cycle initiative, a targeted programme of special supports is being made available to selected urban and rural schools.  In the case of urban schools, the focus was on schools which already had disadvantaged area status and were located in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second element of the initiative focused on schools from all parts of the country with fewer <Col N="1145" /> than five teachers and particulary schools in rural areas which serve dispersed populations and which have concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the school system.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, based on staffing and enrolment, the school referred to by the Deputy was not eligible to apply for inclusion under the new initiative.</P>

      <P>The director of prison medical services has responsibility for medical matters in the entire prison service, not just Mountjoy Prison.  He was appointed in 1990 for a period of two years.  At the expiration of this period, the post was established.  The original job description stated that the director will be responsible for achieving a high level of central <Col N="1147" /> direction and co-ordination of the medical services in the prisons and places of detention; play the lead role in researching and evaluating existing services provided by medical and para-medical staff and services provided by outside agencies; initiate proposals for improvements in these services and, where appropriate, recommend changes in structures and procedures affecting the medical service including recruitment and staffing arrangements; liaise with the various professional services in the prisons and local managements to ensure optimum response to the health needs of offenders; liaise with other health agencies and institutions; advise in relation to the recruitment, retention and training of medical and para-medical staff within the prison service; be responsible for therapy provided to offenders; advise on budgetary requirements and disbursements in areas related to his responsibilities; monitor relevant international developments and practices through maintaining appropriate international contacts; undertake appropriate clinical work within the service to maintain the necessary expertise &mdash; save in exceptional circumstances the director will not act as a substitute for other personnel within the service; undertake relevant academic research with a view to publication as appropriate in medical journals, etc, and promote aspects of the work of prison medical services through e.g. lectures.</P>
      <P>In reply to Question No. 664 on 25 July last, I indicated that there had been a failure to clearly define the accountability of the prison doctors to the director at the outset.  I also indicated that I had asked the director to review his role and to make a submission to me on the matter.  I have now received that submission and I will be discussing the issues raised with the director in the coming weeks.  These issues centre on his overall role and specifically the measures which are needed to achieve responsibility and accountability for service delivery and financial control.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the number of crimes committed in Seville Place to date this year shows a significant decrease on the figure for the same period last year.

      <P>The free television licence scheme is one of the free schemes administered by my Department which also include the free electricity allowance, the free natural gas allowance and the free telephone rental allowance.  The purpose of these schemes is to encourage elderly or disabled people, living alone on limited means, to continue to live in their own homes instead of going into residential care.  In order to qualify, an applicant must be in receipt of a social welfare type payment <Col N="1150" /> and satisfy the living alone conditions of the schemes.  Last July, the free schemes were extended to include non-qualifying payment pensioners subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>The present free television licence scheme was extended in October last year to provide a free colour television licence for all recipients.  An extension of the scheme on the lines suggested by the Deputy would involve additional expenditure which could only be considered in a budgetary context.  The cost of the free television licence scheme in 1996 is estimated at £11.9 million with about 192,000 people availing of it.</P>

      <P>The back-to-work allowance scheme and the education initiatives administered by my Department have proved enormously successful in helping people return to work or to improve their vocational skills.  The range of employment supports include the back-to-work allowance, family income supplement, continuation of child dependant payments for 13 weeks after returning to work and the retention of secondary benefits. Second-chance education options include the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, and the third level allowance.  There are also second level and part-time education options for people who may not be able to access VTOS locally or wish to undertake foundation courses, including literacy training, before advancing to a higher level.</P>
      <P>These schemes have been widely advertised and promoted by my Department, primarily through the network of job facilitators working at local level to ensure that unemployed people and lone parents are fully informed of the options available.  The job facilitators work closely with other agencies such as FÁS, local employment service, area partnerships and many voluntary organisations in providing information, advice and guidance in relation to employment supports.</P>
      <P>Information leaflets are also available on each of the schemes concerned.  Advertisements are placed from time to time in national and local media and the schemes are regularly highlighted through information events such as the back-to-work exhibition held earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effectiveness of the promotion and information strategy is clearly indicated by the high take-up of the schemes concerned.  In order to meet the requirements, I recently announced an increase of 2,000 in the number of places available <Col N="1151" /> under the back-to-work allowance scheme and it is likely that even this extended target of 17,000 places will be reached in the near future.</P>
    <P>However, all information dissemination arrangements need to be regularly reviewed and adjusted to ensure their continuing effectiveness and I welcome any feedback in relation to information needs.</P>
    <P>A publicity campaign will be launched shortly which while highlighting the risks taken by those who abuse the social welfare system, will also include information on the in-work benefits now available.</P>

      <P>The matter referred to in the Deputy's question relates to property vested in Coillte Teoranta under provisions contained in the Forestry Act, 1988.  The matter is, therefore, of a day-to-day nature for the company.  I have, however, passed a copy of the Deputy's question to Coillte Teoranta asking that the company correspond directly with him at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in cattle numbers stems from a number of factors, most notably the growth in total cow numbers in recent years and the delay in marketing cull cows because of the difficult market conditions arising from the BSE scare earlier in the year.  This problem has eased significantly in recent months as cow and heifer slaughterings catch up with 1995 levels.</P>
      <P>The CSO June sample survey estimated a 5 per cent reduction in sheep numbers in 1996.  This development was not unexpected as producers who suffered poor prices in 1995 reduced their sheep stocks.  However, record prices for lambs have been available throughout most of 1996 and this has done much to change the attitude of producers. There is a strong demand for breeding ewes as is demonstrated by the fact that prices for breeding stock are well above last year's level.  I am confident that sheep stocks are now being built up as producers recognise that the sheep sector can provide a good return on their investment.</P>

The cross-Border dimension of this initiative has allowed for information exchange on both the energy and agricultural aspects of biomass development.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Energy Challenge programme, which is funded under INTERREG II, allows for a cross-Border approach to biomass development. In 1995, Energy Challenge supported a feasibility study proposal on wood biomass to energy, submitted by a network of groups and experts from the North and the Republic.  A new Energy Challenge was launched in September this year and also includes grant support for biomass to energy feasibility studies.</P>
