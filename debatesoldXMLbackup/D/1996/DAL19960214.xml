      <P>The British Government's response to the Mitchell report is a proposal to hold elections in Northern Ireland.  This side of the House has grave reservations about this process as we see it as divisive and unnecessary when the mandate of the parties is already known.  I think it would tend to harden positions and lead to polarisation, not only between the two traditions but in the community.  Elections will tend to marginalise and possibly exclude the UDP and PUP in the Unionist community and similarly will push away Sinn Féin and the SDLP who have come closer in recent years to dealing with the issue on this island.  We would have to think long and hard about elections in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One phrase in the Mitchell report that stands out and was re-echoed during a radio interview with Billy Hutchinson, the loyalist paramilitary representative for whom I have a great deal of respect, is the &ldquo;decommissioning of mindsets&rdquo;. George Mitchell thought we should place the emphasis on the decommissioning of the mindsets on this island, rather than on arms decommissioning, albeit a very important subject. The Nationalist consensus which was disparagingly called the pan nationalist front has, in effect, been an effort to decommission the mindset of Irish republicanism and nationalism. That effort which started in the mid-1980s was the dynamic for the IRA ceasefire which in turn ultimately enabled the loyalist ceasefire.  It is imperative to nurture that Nationalist consensus.  The efforts to decommission the mindset of the Nationalist community have not been mirrored in the Unionist community.  The British Government and the Unionist family have not moved and recent events show they have retrenched further into their <Col N="1211" /> positions and have been allowed to do so.  We do not know where the three strand process, the foundation of the present negotiations, fits into the electoral process.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Taoiseach on numerous occasions regarding his assertion that he did not see himself as leader of Nationalist Ireland.  A week before the breakdown of the ceasefire, particularly in view of a letter Mr. Trimble wrote to the Tánaiste in which he referred to the fact that the two Governments were two distinct parties representing different interests and could not with integrity portray identical views, I again questioned the Taoiseach on whether he represented Nationalist Ireland.  Unfortunately I was given a lecture by him on Articles 2 and 3 and our responsibilities in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was particularly annoyed with the Taoiseach's attitude because it demonstrated his inability to understand what has been the dynamic of the peace process for the last six or seven years, that is, the coming together of people on the Nationalist side and joining the national consensus, implicitly acknowledging that ultimately they will have to compromise.  The Taoiseach failed to understand and recognise that was the strength upon which the peace process was brought forward to such an extent that it lasted for 18 months.</P>
    <P>The gulf between the two Governments in the past 12 months has been unfortunate and is one of the major elements that has brought us to this impasse.  Through the years efforts were made to bring the two Governments together.  I am a former co-chairman of the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body where tremendous efforts were made to bring together the parliamentarians of the Houses in Dublin and London.  In recent times even politicians have moved away from that consensus. There is not the same coherence in that body.  I say that with all due respects to my colleagues.  There does not seem to be agreement and that is mirrored in the <Col N="1212" /> attitude of the two Governments.  Reverend Roy Magee, one of the main proponents of the peace process, put his finger on it when he spoke the other day about what he saw as one of the main problems.</P>
    <P>What we need is the type of leadership we had up to the ceasefire, the type of risk taking we had in the mid eighties up to 1994 for which some of us on this side of the House were berated and felt uneasy about because we were doing things which perhaps we should not have done.  We were not given support on all occasions.  It is incumbent on those on the far side of the House to take the type of risks we took, not from a political point of view, but to solidify the process which I hope will lead to peace on this island.  I exhort the Government to get back on track with the British Government.  I accept that the fault mainly lies with the far side but it is one of the necessary components in this process.  If the two Governments do not speak to each other the process will disintegrate.  I implore the two Governments to get together.</P>

      <P>The events of Friday night last have cast a dark shadow over the peace process. The announcement of the ending of the IRA's complete cessation of military activities at 6 p.m. was followed quickly by a brutal and senseless bomb attack in London.  The images that filled our TV screens on Friday night and Saturday were of a kind which we had all hoped had been consigned to the past.  The bomb attack in Canary Wharf resulted in two further unjustifiable deaths in pursuit of a campaign of violence first initiated more than 25 years ago.  That attack has also resulted in inflicting horrific injuries on many more innocent victims.</P>
      <P>Our sympathy and first thoughts must go to the relatives of those who have died and to the other victims of that attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also need to consider how we respond to that attack both politically and in security terms.  The Government <Col N="1213" /> has always opposed the use of violence for political ends.  Successive Governments have responded to such violence by doing all in their power to protect the people.  As our statement on Saturday makes clear, the Government remains resolute in its determination to end terrorism from whatever source.</P>
    <P>The Government, accordingly, announced a full review of security to that end.  The decision to order that review was taken following a briefing which the Government received from the Garda Commissioner.  It was immediately put in hand and those steps which the Garda authorities considered necessary have now been taken.  Continuing vigilance will be required and I assure the House that the position will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and any further steps considered necessary will be implemented as circumstances require.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are also in close contact with the London Metropolitan Police and the RUC and will provide any assistance required in connection with the investigation of Friday's atrocity.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have ensured that the Garda Síochána have been equipped to deal with the terrorist threat.  Close co-operation exists between the Garda, the RUC and other police forces for this purpose.  The measure of our response and our commitment to cross-Border security co-operation is to be seen in the commitment of resources, in the enactment and application of legal measures and in the successes of the security forces in countering terrorist activity.  The high level of co-operation achieved within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference has long been recognised.  The benefits of that co-operation have already been seen in successful operations that prevented earlier attempts to disrupt the peace process by groups opposed to it.  The British Prime Minister acknowledged the closeness of that co-operation in his remarks in the House of Commons on Monday.  That <Col N="1214" /> policy will continue to inform our approach.</P>
    <P>It would be contrary to long-established practice and manifestly counter-productive to go into details on security precautions or ongoing security reviews. It is important, however, that I should issue a word of caution about reliance on media or other speculation as to what measures may or may not be involved.</P>
    <P>In this connection I refer to two suggestions which have been made to the effect that the London atrocity has resulted in the diversion of Garda resources from anti-drugs activity and from an operation recently mounted to counter the problem of attacks on elderly people in rural areas known as Operation Shannon.  There is no basis for either of these suggestions.</P>
    <P>I have decided to comment on them specifically, and quite exceptionally, because they have been a source of public unease.  I emphasise that certain other rumours and comments attributed to unnamed sources concerning the security response are also without foundation.  I am not, by selecting two alleged responses which have given rise to concern, confirming others.</P>
    <P>A security response to the recent event is very far from being the whole answer.  The tragic years that preceded the ceasefires have taught us all that real solutions to the Northern conflict can only be found through political action.</P>
    <P>We in this House and those outside must ensure that the events of Friday do not mark the start of another tragic phase in our history.  We must reassert the determination and commitment that existed within both Governments and among the parties in the North to find a way through dialogue to resolve our differences.  We were making progress, albeit slowly, but we can resume and strengthen our joint resolve.</P>
    <P>The Government firmly believed the IRA statement of 31 August 1994 represented a new departure and a new beginning.  Both the present and former Government acted on the basis that that was the case and that the cessation of <Col N="1215" /> violence was permanent.  The Government responded to that new situation in all of the ways that were open to us. That response was evidenced by such developments as the establishment of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in which Sinn Féin was engaged in seeking to build on the peace, the ending of the national emergency early last year and in the positive approach which the Government took on the prisoners issue.</P>
    <P>Peace brought with it enormous benefits. The economic benefits are there to be seen in the results of the initiatives undertaken by the United States administration and the European Union. Those benefits are also to be seen in the increased revenues from tourism throughout the island.  Peace also made possible a security response.  Measures which had been considered necessary by the campaigns of violence were relaxed both in Northern Ireland and in this jurisdiction.  Those changes brought immediate benefits to people in Border areas.  They are now put at risk again because of Friday's events.</P>
    <P>More than that, the new situation created by the August 1994 statement, and by the subsequent decision of the combined loyalist military command in October 1994 to universally cease operations on its part, created an unparalleled opportunity to secure a political settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict. The ending of the use of violence for political ends made possible the prospect of fully inclusive negotiations for the first time in 25 years aimed at achieving such a settlement.  It meant that all views could be represented in those negotiations and that all sides would have a stake in the process.  It also ensured that the atmosphere in which such negotiations would take place would not be poisoned by the spectre of continuing violence.  The prospect of achieving a political settlement of the long-standing problems of Northern Ireland were never more favourable.  Friday's events serve only to put all of this in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> Both this Government and the previous Government have worked unceasingly towards the objective of securing a political settlement based on consent. We have worked closely with the British Government in seeking to construct a basis for securing such a settlement through agreement on the Framework Document which was intended to inform all-party negotiations.  The Government has also worked long and hard with the British Government to construct a basis on which all-party negotiations could be launched.  We have also worked closely with the political parties both here and in Northern Ireland over a wide spectrum of political opinion and allegiance to seek to bring forward all-party negotiations.  We remain committed to that agenda and we remain ready to continue our efforts to that end.  That approach is and remains the best way forward for the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>Violence, on the contrary, has had no successful outcome over 25 years.  No community has escaped its effects and no one community has a monopoly of suffering.  We have had too many deaths and too much suffering as a result of the campaigns of violence.  There simply has to be a better way, and there is.</P>
    <P>The use or the very threat of violence has the capacity to reverse the economic and social benefits which the peace process has brought.  Those benefits have been widely felt and have been seen in the quality of life enjoyed by each and every individual on this island.  The ending of violence created an unprecedented opportunity for economic and social development in this island.  Is that now to be squandered?  Violence can only serve to undermine the confidence and trust necessary for negotiations aimed at a political settlement.  That trust and confidence has been slowly built up since the cessations announced in 1994.</P>
    <P>The Government is clear as to what is now necessary.  It is clear that the basis for democratic negotiations must now be restored using every opportunity and every good idea proffered as a means to <Col N="1217" /> achieve progress.  All those who seek all-party negotiations and a political settlement of the Northern Ireland issue must therefore work to create the conditions in which democratic negotiations become possible.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that the restoration of the IRA ceasefire is an urgent requirement.  Such a step can again create the basis for fully inclusive all-party negotiations.  I would therefore appeal to the men of violence to desist from the course on which they have embarked and to reconsider the consequences of their actions for the people of Ireland as a whole.  Violence means turning their backs on their families and neighbours and on negotiations and the search for a fully inclusive political settlement.</P>
    <P>I would equally appeal to those who have influence on the IRA to use that influence to secure the restoration of the ceasefire.  The IRA needs to be convinced that the path of non-violence offers the only means by which it can hope to influence the terms of any political settlement which will be the product of a negotiation process.</P>
    <P>That appeal is directed to Sinn Féin, in particular, who must understand that the announcement and events of last Friday fly in the face of the prospect of negotiations which it seeks &mdash; and we all seek &mdash; and only serve to frustrate such a prospect upon which so much time and effort has been expended.</P>
    <P>Establishing a broadly acceptable basis for all-party negotiations will require openness by all sides to new ideas.  The Government has been and remains open to such ideas.  The Government's recent proposal for proximity talks was made in that spirit.  We saw a need for the various issues which require to be settled as part of the preparatory talks process directed to all-party negotiations to be brought to a conclusion and proximity talks as a means to do this.  We saw such talks as an utterly consistent and logical step. We saw it, first, as a way of widening out the bilateral and trilateral talks that had already been taking place, for those <Col N="1218" /> who wished to participate in other formats. We also saw it as the most efficient way of advancing discussions on all the issues that need to be discussed between parties prior to inclusive negotiations.  There would be no need for parties to meet others whom they did not wish to meet.</P>
    <P>All of them by coming together at a convenient venue would have the opportunity of dealing in the most effective and efficient way with the business that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The Government has equally consistently stated that it does not exclude the idea of an election playing a part in such a process.  We have, however, made clear our view that it is for those who favour this approach to show how it can lead to all-party negotiations and how it can be integrated into the three-stranded negotiations to which the two Governments are committed.  Other ideas may equally have a role to play in creating a basis for all-party talks.  Some ideas have been expressed in this debate and no doubt we will hear others during the course of today and tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided in the light of the IRA announcement and the bomb attack in London that it would be inappropriate for it to continue with meetings with Sinn Féin at ministerial level.  To do so would be inconsistent with longstanding policy, as Sinn Féin must recognise.  As the Taoiseach made clear yesterday, that is not to say that the door has been closed to communication with Sinn Féin.  Contact will be maintained at official level and existing channels for that specific purpose remain available.  The sincere hope of the Government is that those channels will be used to create the basis for progress and bring about the situation we all want to see &mdash; the restoration of the IRA ceasefire.</P>
    <P>What the Government is saying to Sinn Féin therefore is not that it wishes to see them excluded from the political process.  Far from it.  What we are saying is that they must make it possible and credible for us to resume contact without delay at political level by restoring <Col N="1219" /> the confidence we all enjoyed for 17 months that violence had truly ended as a means of advancing political objectives.</P>
    <P>Official channels remain open to enable Sinn Féin to convey information and ideas which would help to restore that confidence.  If, of course, confirmation were forthcoming from the IRA that the ceasefire had been restored, then that in itself would immediately open the door to the resumption of full political dialogue with Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>Each of us has a duty not only to reject violence as a political option but also to create the conditions in which recourse to it is rendered impossible. My appeal is therefore also directed to the people of this island who can make their own rejection of violence and their commitment to a negotiated political settlement both as individuals and as members of parties and groups in which they participate.</P>
    <P>The Government for its part will continue its efforts to chart a way forward and to create a basis for inclusive all-party negotiations aimed at a political settlement based on consent.  We will continue to pursue proposals and ideas which we believe can contribute to making such negotiations possible in the short-term and will continue to work closely with the British Government with that objective in mind.  We will recommit ourselves to that work in the hope that the events of last Friday can be put behind us and that a basis for moving forward in which all can engage can be found.</P>
    <P>Rebuilding the peace process will require the commitment of all parties. It will require those parties who have to date failed to engage fully in preparatory talks to embrace that process and to give their fully commitment to it.  Parties who purport to believe in democratic negotiations can no longer have the luxury of standing aside.  They must demonstrate their commitment by showing themselves ready to engage with both <Col N="1220" /> Governments and other parties in establishing a broadly acceptable basis for negotiations.</P>
    <P>Friday's bombing brought tragedy and suffering into the lives of countless Londoners.  We grieve and suffer with them.  Friday's events also represent a serious setback to the peace process and, if we are to avoid a recurrence and a slide into the mindless and pointless violence of the past, we need to act.</P>
    <P>Action is demanded of us all.  It is required first and foremost from the IRA and those who exert influence over that organisation.  Real leadership has already been shown by the leaders of the loyalist parties in their response to Friday's events.  I hope that those who exert influence on loyalist paramilitary groups will continue to use that influence to prevent any return to violence on their part.  Both Governments, and all the political parties in Northern Irealnd, need to act to create the conditions in which all party negotiations become possible on the broadly acceptable basis, about which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>The task which faces us is not an easy one.  It has been made both more difficult and urgent by Friday's terrible events in London.  It will require the determined efforts of everyone to move the present difficult situation forward. The Government will not shirk that task.  It remains the single greatest priority that we have, and I earnestly appeal to the political representatives of both communities to engage with us in this task at this critical time on behalf of all the people on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Members who have spoken, and those who will speak on this debate, in abhorring the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire.  Most Members who have spoken have described it as an absolute tragedy, and that is what it is.  I also join with Members who have expressed abhorrence at the violence on Friday night, at the deaths of two innocent men, the injuring of dozens and the £100 million worth of damage to the Canary Wharf area by a bomb set off by the IRA in <Col N="1221" /> the name of the Irish people.  I reject the IRA's claim that it speaks on our behalf. As democrats and parliamentarians we must do everything possible to rescue the peace process.  We consistently called for this debate since last October and, unfortunately, it is taking place in the aftermath of the violence.  At our request it has been extended by the Government to three days.  This is a worth-while exercise on behalf of the Irish people.  They, and others, are being given an opportunity to hear the views of Members of the Irish Parliament on the tragedy of the breakdown of the ceasefire, our condemnation of the behaviour of the IRA and our emphasis that that organisation does not speak on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>Last Friday we all felt we were falling down a precipice and this morning we appear to find ourselves precariously on a ledge.  The need to take the right steps now with a proper sense of urgency is vital.  I am pleased about the more reasonable tones of some parties, especially the British Government, in recent days.  I welcome the conciliatory tone of the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons on Monday.  It is regrettable that we did not hear the same voices speak in those tones before last Friday.  What we witnessed was progress in the peace process at a snail's pace.  We had seen the consistent breaking of promises in relation to movement. I regret that failure was not only on the side of the British Government. While I do not want to score political points this morning it is essential we should be frank and also mention the failures on the part of our Government. In particular, the wrong signals emanated from both Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Framework Documents contained the result of 12 months work by both Governments on the future relationships in the North, those between the North and South and those between the two islands, commonly known as the Strand III type process.  It laid out the best views of the two Governments.  The ink was not dry on the paper when that document was pushed to one side.  The <Col N="1222" /> Taoiseach, in introducing a debate on that document in the House went to great lengths to emphasise it was not the only way forward.  We all knew that.  It was a discussion document, but he left a clear message in the minds of Unionists that they had a veto in relation to it. That document was then pushed off the agenda never to be heard of again.  It became a source of embarrassment when any Government spokesperson was asked about it.</P>
    <P>A further wrong signal was sent by the refusal of the Taoiseach to meet jointly, at their request, John Hume and Gerry Adams.  The reason for the decision was that it might send the wrong signal to the Unionist community, but the leaders of that community had made very little effort to show any flexibility in relation to all-party talks.  In refusing to meet John Hume and Gerry Adams together, the Taoiseach did not send the right type of signal to the Unionist community and its leaders, which was one of inclusiveness in that they also had a role to play.  He sent a signal of weakness because the Unionists interpreted concessions as a weakness.  Those wrong signals continued to be sent.</P>
    <P>We welcomed the communiqué of 28 November, but my party leader, Deputy Ahern, made an eloquent point at that time, as he did yesterday in his historic speech which in my 23 years as a Member will be recorded as one of the great speeches made in this House.  He made the point that the effect of the communiqué would be to move the road-block ten metres down the road and, unfortunately, that is what happened. The twin track approach was established. Senator Mitchell, to whom I will refer later, presented his report at 11 a.m. one morning only to have it rubbished by the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons at 3.30 p.m. that afternoon by announcing that he had decided to support the election process. Six lines out of 62 paragraphs in the 20 pages of the Mitchell report were devoted to the election process.  Again, all the wrong signals were coming from <Col N="1223" /> the British Government but those signals had been given not just at 3.30 p.m. on the day of the publication of the report, they had been given in a telephone message to the Taoiseach the night before that speech.</P>
    <P>In Question Time in the House a week later, I asked the Taoiseach why, having had a telephone call the night before the publication of the Mitchell report and having received an indication of the mind-set of the British Prime Minister, he did not pick up the telephone the following morning and try to persuade the British Prime Minister to alter his view on the downhill course he was embarked upon, of rubbishing the Mitchell report and opting for this election. The Taoiseach had no reply.  It was another failure; another wrong signal and so the history of the 17 months of the peace process continued.</P>
    <P>In raising those failures of the two Governments and others &mdash; maybe we, the Unionists with their intransigence and others could have been more active, maybe more could and should have been done &mdash; over the 17 months, nothing justifies last Friday's decision of the IRA to place that bomb in London and to announce the ending of the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>After the meeting between the Taoiseach of the time, Deputy Albert Reynolds, John Hume and Gerry Adams on the steps of Government buildings following the IRA's announcement of the ceasefire on 31 August 1994, the joint statement said that we cannot solve this problem without the participation and agreement of the Unionist people and they made it quite clear that the way forward was by the democratic road.  In participating in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, Sinn Féin made it clear that the way forward was only through the democratic process.  One cannot have <i>à la carte</i> democracy.  There cannot be a situation where if you get your way, you agree with the democratic principles but if there are frustrations and delays, you then revert to the bomb and the bullet <Col N="1224" /> in the name of the Irish people.  This is not, and cannot be, the way forward.</P>
    <P>Last Friday's bombing was an appalling act; it threatened to plunge us all back into continuing violence.  I want to say to the IRA and the Irish people that it must never happen again but we cannot have a situation where the threat of violence hangs over our heads like the sword of Damocles.  All sides must go back and fulfil their commitments as made at the outset of the ceasefire.  We cannot have a position where the IRA's Army Council is wondering whether to start bombing again because progress is not being made at the speed which they wanted.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed to read an article by Vincent Browne in <i>The Irish Times</i> today which referred to an interview he had with Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin.  It states:</P>
    <P>I asked if such &ldquo;absolute confidence&rdquo; were created and such &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; were given would the new ceasefire, in his opinion, be permanent. He said there was nothing permanent in life.  I pointed out the Progressive Democrats or the Alliance Party would have no difficulty in giving a &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; guarantee that they would not support the use of violence in the pursuit of a political goal (I should have said &ldquo;illegal violence&rdquo;), why could he not give the same kind of commitment on behalf of Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>He said that if we could be assured that there would be an end to injustice, an end to discrimination and an end to the &ldquo;undemocratic state&rdquo; then we could talk of a permanent ceasefire.</P>
    <P>We are in a situation where there are too many &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, &ldquo;buts&rdquo; and &ldquo;threats&rdquo;. Also disturbing in that article was Mr. McGuinness's reaction to the Mitchell principles.  Vincent Browne's article states:</P>
    <P>I went on to ask Martin McGuinness whether Sinn Féin could accept the Mitchell principles &mdash; I had <Col N="1225" /> written recently that neither Sinn Féin nor the IRA would accept all of them and a prominent Sinn Féin person had gone out of their way to inform me I was mistaken about that. I asked him whether specifically Sinn Féin accepted the principle &ldquo;to agree to abide by the terms of any agreement reached in all-party negotiations and to resort to democratic and exclusively peaceful methods in trying to alter any aspect of that outcome with which they may disagree&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He started his answer by saying that his response would probably not be satisfactory to me.  It wasn't.  He said this was a matter for negotiation, that people should not try to back Sinn Féin into corners at this time,....</P>
    <P>In Fianna Fáil's view, the six principles as laid out in Senator George Mitchell's excellent report are not items for negotiation. They are not to be added to with a seventh principle as the British Government wants to do but, equally, they are not for negotiation, as is the view of Martin McGuinness.  Article 20 of the Mitchell report states:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we recommend that the parties to such negotiations affirm their total and absolute commitment:</P>

    <P>f.  To urge that &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; killings and beatings stop and to take effective steps to prevent such actions.</P>
    <P>How can principles such as those be the subject of negotiation?  They cannot.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Senator Mitchell on a number of occasions and he has a crucial role to play in the peace process as we try to rescue it.  He has shown himself to be a man of extraordinary ability and skill and there will be the need for a mediator as the weeks advance.  I ask the two Governments not to be afraid to take on board the suggestion of requesting Senator Mitchell to act as peace envoy just because it comes from the Opposition or because it would involve the American administration. The American administration has been a good friend to Ireland in the peace process and we must build on it, not reject it.  Senator Mitchell's support must provide the basis for moving to all-party talks.</P>
    <P>On the suggested elections, neither Fianna Fáil nor the SDLP is convinced of the necessity for elections.  However, we will support whatever the SDLP ultimately decide to do about this proposal. In his contribution yesterday I noted the Taoiseach was much more positive about elections while the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs emphasised the difficulties still to be overcome; nevertheless perhaps the bottom line for each is the same.</P>
    <P>The basic requirements of the Fianna Fáil Party are that elections would lead immediately and directly to full scale negotiations, that there would be no assembly or elected body, as such and that any negotiations or meetings would be convened and organised by the two Governments on the three-strand basis. I emphasise that there cannot be internal solutions, which appears to be what is advocated by the Unionist parties. Our party recommends that any <Col N="1227" /> negotiations should take place on the basis of the six principles of the Mitchell report and phased decommissioning, and there must be a place for the loyalist parties in those talks.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about Sinn Féin and the IRA.  I now emphasise the very positive role the loyalist parties have played in this process.  I appeal to all concerned, including those within IRA circles who may listen.  We must get the peace process back on the rails.  Peace has been treasured by all on this island, including those the IRA claims to represent. The IRA actions are not carried out on behalf of the Irish people.  It is damaging the long-term interests of the people it claims to represent and I call on it to step back from the brink.  I ask Sinn Féin to use its influence to endeavour to get the peace process going again. There will be a place for Sinn Féin at the negotiating table on the basis of the peace process being restored and we on this side of the House will do everything within our power to ensure that progress is made with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House abhor the violence that took place on Friday last and ask all concerned to let the peace process continue.</P>

      <P>We meet today to discuss the breakdown of the peace process resulting from the bomb exploded by the IRA at Canary Wharf in London on Friday last against the wishes of the majority of the people of this island who abhor such atrocities.  I join in the condemnation of that atrocious act of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Members on all sides of the House have criticised the 18 month delay in taking action on the peace process, delay did not kill anybody but bombs do.  It is said that action was taken by the IRA without consultation with Sinn Féin, the democratic party that claims to know the minds of those in the IRA and to represent its views.  I accept that Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness are telling the truth when they say they <Col N="1228" /> knew nothing about the action taken. There appears to be an enormous lack of communication between Sinn Féin and the IRA.  Therefore, a question mark must hang over whether Sinn Féin represents the views it leads us to believe it does, or whether that party has lost the confidence of some people within the IRA who have reverted to their violent methods of the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Economic and Social Committee of the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary body I was in Belfast on Tuesday and Wednesday last where we met various groups and discussed the effect of the moneys from the International Fund for Ireland on the general position in the North.  As the House will be aware, that fund was established to improve economic conditions in the most disadvantaged areas in the North and bring about reconciliation there through the allocation of international moneys from the USA, Canada, Australia and Europe.  The administration of that fund has been very successful over the past three or four years, leading to a great deal of good generally.</P>
    <P>In the course of the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body's investigation in the past nine months its members visited groups and projects on both sides of the Border and saw the enormous progress arising from the operations of the International Fund for Ireland.  The body was to report progress on its investigations to our plenary session to be held in Adare at the end of April.  A bomb exploding in London on Friday evening, appears to fly in the face of all the progress made in the meantime including the economic regeneration.</P>
    <P>I propose to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Joe Costello.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We witnessed how economic regeneration could take place within a short period and how rapidly it <Col N="1229" /> could be brought to a halt by one single bomb.  Having condemned that atrocious act, we must remember what did not take place in the 18 month period. Throughout that period, there was a lack of generosity and, no movement from the entrenched positions of Unionist politicians in the North.  For example, when the peace process was initiated too many members of the Unionist parties in the North were to ready to say it would not last, it was not genuine, that guns and bombs had to be handed over immediately.  There was not any sign of the generosity of spirit one might have expected of those in a dominant position in the North.  In the immediate aftermath of last Friday's bomb explosion, the &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; brigade came to the fore saying they knew the IRA would revert to type and resume their bombing activities.</P>
      <P>Those same Unionists politicians witnessed the enormous economic benefits derived from the peace process.  Since they represent the vast majority of business people and various economic interests in the North, they could not but have witnessed those huge economic benefits.  Nonetheless, throughout the peace process, we did not see the type of generosity on their part that would have contributed so much to ensuring its continuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body was established five years ago.  It comprised 25 Members of the British Parliament and House of Lords along with 25 Members of the Houses of the Oireacthas and two places were set aside for Unionists, and they rejected them.  They were not even willing to participate in that small exercise to bring parliamentarians together.  Right up to last week they continued to reject that opportunity, refusing to join other members of that body in dealing not only with security and policing in the North but with other proposals of positive benefit to their constituents, through our mutual participation in the European Union with its many economic and social advantages for people on both sides of the Border.  For <Col N="1230" /> example, the Economic and Social Committee of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, of which I am chairman, did a report on social welfare benefits last year and it would have been of interest to have had heard their views.  We had a debate on education on both sides of the Border and it was the duty of participants to be involved producing a report but nothing happened.</P>
    <P>There has been a deafening silence from the social partners &mdash; trade unions, employers, farmers and others, professionals, the motor industry and the tourist trade &mdash; in the North during the past 18 months, all of whom have reaped the benefit of peace.  It has also been of benefit to us on this side of the Border.  Since the bombing on Friday last, none of these organisations has expressed their concern publicly, as they should have done, about the breakdown of peace.  Those of us who have travelled in the North over the past 18 months, are aware that businesses have flourished in spite of the bombs that decimated cities, towns and villages and drove tourists from the North and the horrific murders in farming communities. One would have thought that organisations who are independent of politics would have instructed their politicians to sit down and talk rather than point scoring about who was right and who was wrong.  I hope these people will bring pressure to bear.</P>
    <P>Pre-budget submissions were made by the social partners and interest groups who demanded to see their politicians to tell them about the needs of the organisation or group they represent. I hope similar organisations in the North will tell their politicians that they want the peace process back on track, to sit down and talk and not to score points against one another.  They should say that the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Downing Street Declaration have given their position permanency so long as they want it permanent.  They want peace now and want it to continue.  They want politicians to take the Mitchell report, which was set up to continue the peace <Col N="1231" /> process, as a basis for agreement and want the Irish Government, the Opposition and anybody who can make a contribution to start talks and to keep talking.</P>
    <P>The bomb has set us all back but it means the British Government realises that making preconditions is a deadly business.  I am glad that John Major, the British Prime Minister, is now prepared to give way in certain areas and to set out a programme so that talks can begin between the two Governments with a view to putting the peace process back on track.  I wish the Government spokesmen well in what has to be done urgently.  We all want to see the peace process continue.  I hope we have seen the last bomb set off by the IRA in any part of this country or in the UK.  Children are the biggest losers as a result of bomb explosions.  Their futures are in danger whether economically or through their presence on the streets of Northern Ireland, England or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We could all repeat what we read in the newspapers over the weekend and blame others.  However, we must look to the future, stop blaming others and say what must be done to achieve peace and get people back around the table.  It is my wish for both Governments that they see the urgency of the task in hand. They have to represent reasonable views, such as those of John Hume and others who have led the peace process since 1973 and the various initiatives since to try to achieve peace.  From my experience in the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body we have seen great progress and we want it to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute.  What happened last Friday was catastrophic.  The greatest moment in the history of this small island, over the past 25 years, was the declaration of the ceasefire on 31 August, 1994.  Since then we have had almost 18 months of peace which, unfortunately, was shattered on Friday last and we all know its reverberations.  It <Col N="1232" /> was like an earthquake all over the world and the sense of despair was universal.</P>
      <P>The condemnation was also universal. Everywhere there was condemnation that human life was again being taken. There were large scale marches in Belfast and Derry.  Clearly, ordinary people were shattered by the return to violence and wanted to show they did not want it back on a regular basis. There was a flurry of political responses in an attempt to save the ceasefire. Nobody wanted &mdash; or wants &mdash; the peace to die.  Almost 18 months of peace has meant that a whole new generation which has grown to adulthood without peace has tasted it for the first time. They have been able to live without fear in that period and have been able to bask in a sense of safety and normal life. They have been able to walk the streets which they had feared to tread, particularly at night.  The visit of President Clinton showed the emotional response to the feeling of sustained peace among people North and South.</P>
      <P>Cross-Border tourism has become a major part of the economy and of people's lives.  People from the North are travellng as far south as Cork and Kerry and booking hotels and guesthouses there.  On this side of the Border we are holding conferences in Newcastle and various parts of the North. There has been a tremendous amount of cross-Border activity as well as international tourism.  There has been a hands-across-the-Border approach and a co-operative spirit.  The whole economy of Northern Ireland had just commenced a restructuring process.  Investment was coming from the United States and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industries and houses were being built and derelict bomb sites were being renovated.  The ghosts of sectarianism and bigotry were seemingly about to be put to rest.  The conflicts of Catholic versus Protestant and Nationalist versus Unionist were no longer being played out in violence and hostility.  People were beginning to live together and to work out their differences.  All of that <Col N="1233" /> has been shattered.  The process which began with a ceasefire to enable dialogue to begin did not reach its conclusion.</P>
    <P>During the 17 months of the ceasefire hurdles were raised and the objective of talks seemed forever on the horizon yet unattainable.  The definition of &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;, the need for decommissioning and the issue of elections were all raised as hurdles to negotiations. While nothing justifies a return to violence the reasons for that violence are obvious.</P>
    <P>The step back from the precipice which now looms can only be taken by the IRA.  It must step back to the ceasefire. The first element of a renewed approach must be an urgent response from the IRA.  The second element is for the two sovereign Governments to clearly map out a path to all-party talks. They must make it clear that all-party talks is their joint primary objective.  In that context, the Government's proposal on proximity talks is excellent because it cannot compromise anybody yet can tease out difficulties that may arise.  Although Prime Minister Major's proposal on the elections was premature in its presentation, it may prove, on explanation and clarification, to have complementary elements.  Everything must be taken in the context of the Mitchell report which set a primary objective of avoiding obstacles and starting all-party talks.</P>
    <P>We are at a critical point.  Matters may get worse and if they do they will be atrocious.  However, we can improve matters by holding ground and pointing the way forward without violence. There is a deep desire for peace on this island and in the international community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most urgent task is to restore the peace and I hope this debate can go some way to making that happen.  This is an important debate and our contributions should be measured and thoughtful.  It is important to move on but before we do so it is important to understand how we came to this <Col N="1234" /> point.  Ego played a large part on all sides and if we get a chance to restart the process that ego should not be there again.  The bomb in London cannot be excused, but as politicians we have to try to find an explanation for it.  I join in condemning the IRA unreservedly and unambiguously for this despicable act of murder.  I offer my sympathies to those affected.</P>
      <P>I wish the Government well in moving the process forward but we have to learn from some of the mistakes.  In putting the process back together the Government will have the Opposition's support.  I do not doubt the Taoiseach's genuineness with regard to Northern Ireland but I will not join the cosy consensus that suggests he can carry on as if everything had been done properly.  I do not question the Taoiseach's genuineness, ability or integrity but he made major political mistakes.  We would be failing in our duty in this House to conduct a debate on the issue and not make that point because it may be helpful to the Taoiseach in trying to put the process back together.  He made serious mistakes and I hope he will not make them again.  The Taoiseach is responsible to the Dáil and it is appropriate that he accounts to the House for his stewardship as the leader of the Government.  He failed to stay close to the British Prime Minister.  He did not conduct the Northern Ireland policy as if it was his overriding priority.  He brought no sense of direction, urgency or passion to his policy on Northern Ireland.  I charge him with abandoning the peace process by delegating it to others &mdash; to colleagues, officials and committees.  This led to the 17 months of the peace process being squandered.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also failed to persuade the British Prime Minister, John Major, that he had to act jointly with him and not embark on a solo run.  The Taoiseach's job was to ensure the governments acted in unison.  It was his job to ensure there were no surprises on either side, to ensure there were no solo runs. He failed in his duty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> The Taoiseach should have been tackling the two major obstacles &mdash; decommissioning and elections.  He handled those issues badly and failed the House and the country.  Had he handled them properly they would not have become obstacles.  I will be accused of breaking the cosy consensus that every Member of the House did his best.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach did his best, but it was not good enough. Had he handled these two issues differently the reaction would have been different.</P>
    <P>On prior decommissioning, did he make it clear to the British Prime Minister that if the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, made this a precondition, the Government would publicly disown the Downing Street Declaration or did he turn on his television set and see Sir Patrick Mayhew do exactly that in Washington? This should not have come as a complete surprise to him.</P>
    <P>He should have made it clear in one to one contact with the British Prime Minister that if such road blocks were to be set up, he should be informed in advance and if the Government did not agree with such an approach, it would say so publicly.  It was stated explicitly in the Downing Street Declaration that the two Governments would act together.  He should have made it clear to the British Prime Minister that in adopting such an approach Sir Patrick Mayhew would incur the wrath of the Government and break the terms of the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the Mitchell report the British Government stated that it would like to see elections held in keeping with the wishes of Mr. Trimble.  It appears that the Taoiseach was again taken by surprise.  Having been let down on the issue of decommissioning he should have learned his lesson and expected this to happen.  He should have told the British Prime Minister bluntly that if he could not accept the findings of the report, he should tell him early enough to delay publication <Col N="1236" /> and allow them time to discuss the matter either in Downing Street or Dublin and that they should not allow the report to be published knowing that one of them would have to turn it down.  A child would have seen that such a split would lead to a breakdown in the peace process and a return to violence.  He should have made it clear that any solo runs by the British Government would be in breach of the terms of the Downing Street Declartion, that this would not be acceptable and not the way to move the process forward.</P>
    <P>It was made clear in the Downing Street Declaration that nothing would happen without the agreement of both Governments.  However, decommissioning and the holding of elections were laid down as preconditions without the agreement of the Government.  I, therefore, charge the Taoiseach with failing in his duty by letting the light in between the two Governments when he knew full well that the only way the process could be kept on the rails was by acting in unison with no surprises, solo runs or announcements from across the Atlantic leading to kneejerk reactions.</P>
    <P>I find the cosy consensus unrealistic as the two Governments must accept a large share of the blame.  I beg the Government not to allow this to happen again.  It should stay close to the British Government and ensure that it is informed in advance of any announcements from the other side of the water.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach &mdash; I do not mean Deputy Bruton plus two or three assistants &mdash; and the British Prime Minister should understand each other on these issues.  The British Prime Minister who is clearly in charge of his Government has to deal with a committee of Ministers, officials and advisers.  This leads to a lack of clarity.  Can one blame him for misunderstanding the signals?  We will never know what he was told from this side of the water.  I do not know what messages he received from the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, but the view must be conveyed that while some <Col N="1237" /> wanted elections, others did not and that while some were tough on the Provisional IRA, others felt that someone had to talk to them.  He must have sat back in his chair and said to himself &ldquo;I wish they would make up their minds&rdquo;. Because of the confusion in the minds of the members of the Government he failed to receive a strong single message from the Republic that if he failed to seek the agreement of the Government before going on a solo run, it would lead to destruction.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach took office the psychology in the relationship between Britain and Ireland and the <i>modus operandi</i> changed.  From my own observations during the past year I am deeply convinced that he did not make this his dominant theme.  Is the Minister of State amused?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach and the Government failed in their duty in <Col N="1238" /> their dealings with the British Government on the issues of decommissioning and the holding of elections.  The Minister of State should argue about policy, rather than hurl personal abuse at me across the floor of the House.  When the Taoiseach took office, the relationship changed.  Northern Ireland became a matter for the three leaders and officials and, instead of clear leadership, we had crab-like bureaucracy; Northern Ireland was not the priority and overriding passion of the Taoiseach and John Major.</P>
      <P>We should move on and the Taoiseach should accept those mistakes were made.  He should get back to the principles of the Downing Street Declaration and make them his personal priority.  I ask him to let John Major know he is in charge of the Irish Government.  He should use the Mitchell report and, if necessary, ask Mr. Mitchell to assist. It was an independent report and I ask the Taoiseach to try to get all parties to agree to its principles. He should not engage in semantics and talk to Sinn Féin without preconditions. It is too dangerous to set more preconditions.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should suggest to the British Prime Minister that if there is peace for three months all-party talks could take place in June.  I ask him to set a date and not lay down preconditions. If this is done Government to Government and if the Taoiseach can deliver the Nationalists, which I believe he can, John Major can deliver the Unionists and we can move on.  They should forget about elections because a new assembly would not work.  Negotiations, not debate, are necessary.  At the meeting between the Taoiseach and John Major next week the Taoiseach should tread carefully on the question of elections.  If necessary, the election of negotiators could be considered, but we should oppose the election of an assembly as that would be a step backwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Reynolds that the Government and John Major should jointly state publicly that if there is <Col N="1239" /> peace for the next three months they will name a date for the start of all-party talks.  If that happened the ceasefire could be restored.  We should move in the direction of that thread of hope.  All-party peace talks, without preconditions, is still the way forward.  In his speech last Monday, Prime Minister Major stated that the next time we hold all-party talks there will be no need for preconditions because decommissioning could happen simultaneously.  Therefore, we should pick up the threads and try again by, in particular, setting a date for all-party peace talks.</P>

      <P>There can be no justification for the appalling return to violence perpetrated by the IRA in London last Friday.  More than 25 years of such violence in Northern Ireland achieved only bereavement for the relatives of the 3,000 killed, misery for the thousands injured and countless billions of pounds worth of wasted resources.  It is important to state repeatedly that those who perpetrated the violence last Friday did not have a mandate.  There was no justification or mandate for their actions.  Effectively, they were self-appointed executioners and the united voice of the elected representatives of the people demands an end to such heinous activities.  Violence will never achieve anything.</P>
      <P>Prior to last Friday the objective was to work towards the commencement of all-party negotiations.  An additional huge stumbling block in the way of achieving this objective is the need to secure an immediate end to violence and a restoration of the IRA ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that we are not starting from scratch.  Much of the groundwork was laid by the Framework Document, the November communiqué and the Mitchell report.  It is also important to acknowledge the endorsements and help that have been forthcoming from the European Union and the United States.  There is now a great challenge facing both Governments and all political parties to confront the <Col N="1240" /> present crisis and restore the momentum of the peace process.</P>
    <P>In deciding on future action it is important to take cognisance of what happened in the past but, while mistakes were made, Deputy Brennan's remarks were intemperate and inappropriate. I do not accept his criticism of the Taoiseach who is well able to defend himself.  In a serious debate such as this, the charges of Deputy Brennan, a former Minister and Front Bench member of the Fianna Fáil Party, are not helpful in our attempt to give a united voice to the actions of the Government in trying to take us out of this crisis.  Where do Fianna Fáil stand on this issue?  I was one of those who applauded the masterly speech of Fianna Fáil yesterday.  I was pleased to join the Taoiseach and others on this side who appreciated it as such.  Deputy Ahern was helpful and statesmanlike.  Deputy Brennan's comments undermine the spirit of co-operation and consensus which underlay that speech.</P>

      <P>It is ludicrous to suggest that the issue of Northern Ireland, has not been given overriding priority by the Taoiseach.  He has taken a deep interest in Northern Ireland affairs for many years.  I have not witnessed any other person taking such a deep interest in a subject.  He could be said to eat, drink and sleep Northern Ireland matters. Deputy Brennan's comments were ridiculous.  He accused the Taoiseach of delegating work to Government colleagues and officials, another ridiculous allegation.  Is Deputy Brennan suggesting that under the previous Government the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, solely managed Northern Ireland affairs without reference to any other member of Cabinet or to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Deputy Reynolds played a central role in Northern Ireland affairs at that time and continues to work in co-operation with the Taoiseach.  I am very disappointed with the statements of Fianna Fáil Members. <Col N="1241" /> They are not helpful.  Attempts have been made to criticise the Taoiseach for decisions taken by the UK Government and the Prime Minister in particular. There seems to be an implication that the Taoiseach was responsible for those decisions or that he could have put a stop to them.</P>
      <P>Some of the decisions made by the UK Government were not helpful. Those who entered into the ceasefire did so on the basis that there would be all-party talks which would lead to a political solution.  Those who, deliberately or otherwise, obstructed the path to all-party talks have contributed to the present political problem.  It makes no sense, 18 months after the ceasefire, that the political parties are not talking to each other.  The overriding objection of both Governments since the ceasefire has been to try to commence all-party talks as quickly as possible.  Clearly the UK Government and the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland have different priorities.</P>
      <P>In so far as any aspersions might be cast on the Irish Government for the actions of the British Government &mdash; Deputy Brennan stated that we should &ldquo;not let light between them&rdquo;&mdash; I must state that it takes two to tango.  The Irish Government has pressed, at all times for the commencement of all-party talks. Clearly the UK Government has a different agenda.  It is correct to analyse what happened in the past, but Deputy Brennan's analysis was outrageously incorrect and entirely unhelpful.  In so far as the UK Government has not assisted, helped or persuaded others to join in all-party talks, this can be correctly categorised as a mistaken approach.  In recalling the past, we must consider where the problem originated. I believe it was due to the fact that all-party talks did not get under way.  The aim of the new twin track approach following last Friday's appalling atrocity must be to re-establish the ceasefire and commence all-party talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sinn Féin played a vital role in the establishment of the IRA ceasefire.  Its <Col N="1242" /> exact relationship to the IRA is somewhat ambiguous.  I accept Gerry Adams's assurances that he is not a member of the IRA, even though he appears to speak authoritatively on its behalf at times.  It is time for Mr. Adams and his colleagues in Sinn Féin to use whatever authority and influence they have to re-establish the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>Gerry Adams has complained about being unable to meet the Government on the same terms as heretofore.  The complaint is unjustified.  The Taoiseach's actions were quite correct in the circumstances.  On the other hand, it was correct to keep open the line of communication to Gerry Adams.  I fully endorse the decision to continue contacts with Sinn Féin and authorise meetings at official level to enable it to bring forward its ideas on how the ceasefire can be restored.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals have been made from different quarters in relation to the political situation, the first which is the proposal for an election.  I am engaging in a consideration of these proposals because some synthesis may be achieved to lead to a way forward. Perhaps the different proposals can be welded together to achieve the objective of all-party talks.</P>
    <P>The first issue which must be addressed is the suggestion of an election which principally emanated from David Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Party.  They are strongly in favour of this proposal and, as the original proposers, it is their responsibility to justify it.  I asked some Unionists why they felt so strongly about elections and I was informed that they wish to ensure they are represented in proportion to their relative strength as all-party talks.  I do not see any great problem in this regard. Their political representation in Northern Ireland is approximately 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>During all-party negotiations there should be a basic representation from the various party delegations.  I accept the numbers should be weighted to take acount of the proportional strength of the larger parties.  The Ulster Unionist <Col N="1243" /> Party is the largest party and I have no problem with that.  I accept the assurances of Unionists in this regard.  If the elections lead to all-party talks and are formulated on a basis which is acceptable to Nationalists, I have no difficulty with the proposal.  As the principal proposer of this idea, it is important that the Ulster Unionist Party understands the concerns expressed by the other parties, particularly the SDLP.</P>
    <P>The SDLP raised the issue of the divisiveness of elections.  I respect its experience in that regard but all elections are divisive.  I am not entirely certain that this should represent an obstacle to elections.  On that basis a party in Government could justify remaining in power due to the dangers associated with the divisiveness of a subsequent election.  I am more concerned about the fact that parties in such an election could campaign on the basis of manifestos that were entirely contrary to the idea of the election.  That could be unhelpful.  My basic point in relation to elections is that the Ulster Unionist Party is aware that the idea is under consideration.  It is its responsibility to confront the concerns expressed about the proposal.</P>
    <P>The UK Government also favours elections.  It stated that the elected body will only meet in exceptional circumstances and will have no legislative, executive or administrative functions.  It also stated that all-party talks would begin immediately after the elections. That approach would probably help to allay some of the concerns which have been expressed about the elections.  The SDLP was concerned that the body would be similar to the prior assembly. There is room for further discussion on the issue.  However, there are real problems with regard to the modalities and logistics and these would have to be teased out.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin wants to be included in all-party talks.  If elections are to lead to all-party talks, Sinn Féin will have to consider that route.  Let us be clear, however.  The main stumbling block for <Col N="1244" /> Sinn Féin is IRA violence and the urgent imperative to restore the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>The SDLP has suggested holding a referendum in Northern Ireland and the Republic asking people if they reject violence and agree with the establishment of all-party talks.  I am not sure how helpful that proposal is, or to what extent it adds to the overall objective of all-party talks.  If both communities in Northern Ireland agree to elections, they must be predicated on the basis of a rejection of violence and agreement to all-party talks.  This proposal must be teased out and the SDLP must deal with any concerns expressed about it.  David Trimble referred to the proposal as a diversion but I do not consider this a legitimate objection.  If Mr. Trimble has reasonable and logical concerns about it he should make them known so that the SDLP might deal with them.  That is the way political dialogue and debate should take place.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has suggested proximity talks on the basis that both Governments would convene a two day meeting bringing together on a voluntary basis all parties and both Governments at one venue, Stormont.  A party would not be obliged to share a table with any other party or Government and there would not be any surrender of principle involved for any party taking part.  The purpose of the meeting would be to reach broad agreement on a basis and timetable for the launch of all-party negotiations.  There is much merit in this proposal, particularly when one considers the difficulties involved in finalising the modalities and logistics of an election procedure and arrangements for all-party talks.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has suggested the involvement of the former Senator George Mitchell as a peace envoy for President Clinton.  It is possible that his influence could be useful in encouraging Northern Ireland parties to reach agreement. There may be a role for Mr. Mitchell but it is a matter for the Fianna Fáil Party to develop its proposal and <Col N="1245" /> address any concerns that may be expressed about it.</P>
    <P>At this stage all parties have something to offer and, as someone who spent many years as a negotiator in the legal world, I believe that would provide a favourable basis for the future.  All the ingredients for a reasonable and fair arrangement are in place but we need a display of political will to produce a synthesis of the various proposals and weld them together.  If that is done, and provided there is a commitment by all parties to a total cessation of violence and the restoration of the ceasefire, I would be hopeful that the momentum could be restored to the peace process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to pay tribute to the leadership shown in recent days by my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  He has indicated to us, and to the nation, the meaning of real leadership.  It would have been easy for him to go down the road of populism or engage in the rhetoric of condemnation and blame but instead he carefully, deliberately and responsibly tread his way through a difficult moment in our history.  He recognised, as do his Front Bench colleagues, the distinction between our role in Opposition and the roles of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste as leaders of the Government.</P>
      <P>We can take risks in Opposition which, by definition, cannot be taken by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  In that regard I commend the leadership role of the Taoiseach and, more particularly, the Tánaiste in recent days.  The ship of State needed to be held steady and in that regard there was consensus, not only in the minds of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, but also in the generally recognised attitude of the leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many solutions to the problem have been put forward since the bomb exploded in Canary Wharf last Friday but why was it necessary for a bomb to explode to produce the ideas that have emerged following that obscenity?  Why were those ideas not put forward during the 18 months of peace?  Why must we <Col N="1246" /> always wait for something terrible to happen before we come out with a flood of ideas some of which are good, others not so good and some of which are rather strange?  This is a time for reflection and we must continue to hold steady the ship of State.</P>
    <P>Last Friday night I had a palpable feeling that the country was in a state of shock.  People were literally traumatised by the event and places of assembly such as public houses, theatres and cinemas were empty because people were listening to their radios or watching their television sets.  They wanted to know if there would be another bomb or what the immediate future held for the country which had enjoyed 18 months of peace.  The experience was quite eerie and I was reminded of the question that is often asked: Where were you when President Kennedy was assassinated?  To use a current cliché, one will always remember that defining moment of history.</P>
    <P>I will always remember where I was when I heard about the bomb explosion in Canary Wharf and I will always remember the feeling I had when I heard the news which ended what could be referred to as phase I of the peace process.  We must proceed quickly to phase II of the peace process and encourage all the participants to engage in all-party talks as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>My party leader has offered a number of solutions to the problem the most worthwhile being that the former US Senator George Mitchell be asked to return to Ireland as a peace envoy, an honest broker, to broker a peace among the recalcitrant parties, the people who will not come to the peace table because they do not agree with proposals from the other side.  Those attitudes are not helpful.</P>
    <P>We believe Mr. Mitchell is the best man for this job and, in that connection, Deputy Ahern, Deputy Burke, Fianna Fáil spokesman for Foreign Affairs, and myself met with the American Ambassador, Mrs. Jean Kennedy-Smith, from whom we received a warm welcome.  I wish to pay tribute to her for <Col N="1247" /> the work she is doing in her capacity as United States Ambassador.  President Clinton has also achieved a great deal for this country and, as a matter of urgency, he should send Mr. Mitchell here, to, with the agreement of all the other parties, pursue phase II of the peace process.</P>
    <P>I want to add my voice to the over-whelming expression of sadness at the deaths of two innocent people and the maiming of so many others in the bomb explosion on Friday last.  The scenes we witnessed on our television screens were a grim reminder of the 25 years which preceded the ceasefire of 31 August 1994.  It is axiomatic to express feelings of shock, disgust and disappointment at the decision of the IRA to abandon the ceasefire and, over the past five days, I have experienced those emotions as has everyone in the country, more particularly on the evening of the explosion.</P>
    <P>It is easy to lay the blame for the crisis at the door of the men of violence. There is no doubt they carry the burden of responsibility for the mayhem at Canary Wharf.  Yet many people on these islands are frustrated with the fumbling efforts of the British Government and the sneering intractability of certain elements of so-called Unionist politicians over the past 17 months.  Perhaps the present situation is but a step on the long road to permanent peace. One thing which is clear today is that a return to peace and progress on the road to a permanent resolution of the problem on this island will require more compromise by all concerned than we have seen to date.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people want to see peace in the North.  The ceasefire showed a generation of people peace for the first time in their lives.  When the guns and bombs were silenced in 1994 the changes in people's lives were visible and palpable.  They know what life can be like without guns, bombs and soldiers on the streets and had been able to go about their lives in hope; after all, their Government had finally agreed that the talking would soon begin and <Col N="1248" /> there seemed to be a will among all political parties to talk about a solution. They are now facing an end to peace. They should not let this happen.  The disappointment they must surely feel at the inability of their political representatives to take even a few halting steps along the road towards a negotiated solution must find expression, if necessary, on the streets by way of peaceful demonstration in support of peace.  If the people want their politicians to get involved in all-party talks, they should get out on the streets and say so.</P>
    <P>The civil rights movement which signalled the end of the old Stormont rule also signalled the emergence of a strong voice for Nationalism, a voice for fairness and equality.  The foundations upon which the Stormont Parliament were constructed were first shaken and finally laid to rest following formal talks between the Irish and British Governments and the democratic political parties in Northern Ireland in 1992.  I was involved in those talks and I remember the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland stating repeatedly that a solution to the problem could not be found without the participation of Ian Paisley and his party.  We accepted that statement as a political reality and even when Dr. Paisley and his party were at their least co-operative we worked slowly and patiently to keep them on board, to draw them gradually closer to the table and to encourage their substantive participation in the process. The Irish Government then took the view &mdash; it still takes the view &mdash; that no lasting solution to the Northern Ireland problem could be achieved without the participation of all strands of Nationalism which, by definition, includes the IRA and Sinn Féin.  The fringe loyalist parties then in their infancy are now also a vital part of the peace process. The 1992 talks broke down because those involved began to realise we could continue to talk forever in such a format and never arrive at a comprehensive set of proposals which would solve the problems we faced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> Later there was the courage of John Hume in dealing directly with Sinn Féin and the leadership of Deputy Albert Reynolds in taking the issue a step further and persuading Mr. John Major and his Government to accept the work of John Hume and Gerry Adams as a genuine breakthrough.  This resulted in the ceasefire and the universal wave of hope and joy which swept the island. That hope and joy now seems a distant memory.  Peace must be brought back to centre stage and there must be all-party talks as a matter of urgency.  We cannot allow a long pause in the peace process; we can think in terms of a few weeks or months but no longer.</P>
    <P>It is now time for people to show courage and leadership again.  To use an expression we have all heard before, it is time to take a risk for peace.  Regardless of the motives of the IRA in bombing Canary Wharf &mdash; it is beyond me why it carried out this stupid and obscene act; obviously it has no standards in terms of political thinking or democracy and it will come to regret this act &mdash; both Governments must remain committed to solving the political impasse and be committed to doing everything necessary to bring it about. If this means knocking over a few sacred cows and dragging the odd reluctant bridegroom to the altar then so be it because the alternative is unthinkable. The alternative is an island once again divided where nobody visits the North because of the fear of bombs and violence and the presence of armed troops on the streets and a return to frightening levels of unemployment and emigration, fear, anarchy, despair and the same old rhetoric of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; and &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; on the one hand and &ldquo;tiocfhaidh ár lá&rdquo; on the other.  This prospect is profoundly depressing given that the future was beginning to look so bright.  Tourism and investment in Northern Ireland began to flourish when the guns fell silent.  The future can still be bright if public representatives act in a way which reflects the will of the people.</P>
    <P>If there ever was a time for the <Col N="1250" /> Unionist parties to show leadership to their supporters it is now.  They will find it easy to appeal for support based on the old values of solidarity with Westminister and fear of Dublin rule. They will find it more difficult to appeal to their supporters to give them the mandate to do whatever is necessary to ensure that peace lasts.  Until they accept the need to change and come to the negotiating table the path to peace will remain blocked.  They will be required to acknowledge the political reality that there will be no solution without the presence, participation and agreement of all strands of Nationalism and Unionism and give that meaning by showing their willingness to deal.</P>
    <P>As we showed in the all-party talks in 1992, the Unionists have no need to be afraid of all-party talks.  At that time we sat down more or less as equals, we in our capacity as a sovereign Government and the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Unionist parties as representatives of the people of Northern Ireland.  The only tragedy in those talks was that Dr. Paisley and his party would not speak to us and remained on the sidelines.  That was a pity as sometimes more good can be done <i>en marges</i> than in the full glare of negotiations.  That sort of attitude will have to be changed and the fear will have to be broken down.  The status of Northern Ireland is guaranteed in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and is reaffirmed in the Downing Street Declaration. Talking never killed anyone.</P>
    <P>Peace depends on the honesty of the parties.  I believe John Major wants a solution.  He has made a number of mistakes in the recent past, one of which was the decision to drop kick the Mitchell report into the wastepaper basket hours after its publication.  However, he is now trying to retrieve it and I believe he recognises he made an error of judgment in taking the line he took on that fateful day in the British House of Commons.  Mr. Major is a cricket aficionado &mdash; I also happen to support that sport &mdash; and on the occasions I met him at cricket matches in the United <Col N="1251" /> Kingdom I found him to be a very pleasant companion.  I have also found him easy to do business with in a political context.  He is a decent man who is well motivated.  However, like us all, he is subject to making mistakes.  What is important is to recognise those mistakes and correct them.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to see that the House stands united behind the Government in the pursuit of peace.  The desire of the SDLP for a solution cannot be questioned. The jury remains out as to the real desire of the so-called mainstream Unionists to see an all-inclusive political resolution to the problem in Northern Ireland.  If I am incorrect I will gladly retract this view, and it is my sincere hope that I am incorrect.  I appeal to the leaders of Unionism to use their undoubted talents and skills for the betterment of all the people of this island. Ireland will be a far better place to live in for all of us if they do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ring.  The bombing of Canary Wharf has been rightly condemned by everyone in this House.  It is not the first time a bomb has been planted in the name of Ireland.  Our task is to ensure that it is the last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has adopted a position which unequivocally sets down a line between democratic politics and paramilitary politics.  We cannot pick and choose whether to be democratic on one occasion and not to be on another. It is not possible to be half a democrat. This is the hard reality the IRA must face.  We can encourage them to make the leap, but we cannot make it for them.  We can understand their predicament. The revolutionary strand in Irish history is a long-established one and one from which they clearly draw some kind of atavistic justification.  However, many others have made that leap and have succeeded in creating good politics out of violent pasts.  Today, more than at any other time in our history, the choice <Col N="1252" /> for democracy must be made.  The men and women of violence must become men and women of peace.  We can encourage them and enable them to abandon that road, but ultimately we may have to accept that not every single one of them will make that choice.</P>
    <P>The peace process will continue not because of but despite the bombing. The building of trust will continue, despite the bombing.  The differences in approach are acknowledged, whether it is in regard to the election proposal of the Unionists, the referendum proposal of the SDLP, or the preparatory talks proposed by this Government.  It is possible and increasingly likely that an agreed proposal will be formulated drawn from these differences, but there will be much frustration, much complaint, much disagreement before agreement will be reached.  That is the way of democracy.  Politics is about frustration and how to deal with it.  That is what the IRA must come to terms with.  If it does not, if talks start and it is involved in those talks, how then will they deal with frustration &mdash; with another bomb, with more deaths?</P>
    <P>We have been told that the Canary Wharf bomb was a result of frustration. Of one thing we can be sure.  If this ceasefire is reinstated, if talks begin, the frustration will only be greater in the future.  Sinn Féin and the IRA cannot escape that truth, nor the reality that consent is an essential element, that, as David Irvine has said, nothing can ever be the same again because what we are involved in now is the politics of inclusion.  The politics of exclusion which were practised on both sides of the Border have failed.  There is no going back.</P>
    <P>It is important that mistakes should not be repeated.  It was clearly a mistake for the British Prime Minister to go into the House of Commons on 24 January to, in effect, ignore the Mitchell report. The Mitchell report is one of the most incisive examinations of the problems of Northern Ireland.  It can still provide a basis for progress.  It also presents Sinn Féin and the IRA with this challenge: <Col N="1253" /> are they or are they not serious about democracy?</P>
    <P>When President Clinton came here last year he spelt out the political reality of Northern Ireland.  The fundamental difference is not between political parties but between those who are for peace and those who are the enemies of peace.  We are all deeply saddened by what happened last Friday.  Across the island of Ireland there have been many expressions of grief and demonstrations for peace.  That public conviction and display is our mandate as democrats. Our task is to keep the train of the peace process going.  We must ensure that people can come on board and keep that access open, but there cannot be two tracks, one with a train for peace and the other carrying trucks full of explosives.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, others made the leap from violence to politics. Many of the parties in this House today had their roots in that same violent tradition that the Provisional IRA now claim.  The Government is committed to bringing about peace in Northern Ireland.  It requires all our skills, our patience, our intelligence and our imagination.  Mistakes have been made and, no doubt, will continue to be made. No one has a monopoly on wisdom. Politics by its very nature is messy, incomplete and frustrating, but politics alone can bring about peace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the position adopted by Deputy Bertie Ahern of Fianna Fáil, although I have to disagree with him on what he said about the role played by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  His has been a constructive role drawn from vast experience of the Northern Ireland situation.  Democratic Left is a party that exists both here and in the North, and that has given a dimension to our politics that I believe enhances this Government.</P>
    <P>I reject totally the views expressed by Deputy Séamus Brennan.  He suggested a three-month timeframe on the cessation of violence, a temporary ceasefire. That is a dangerous, naive suggestion. It also contradicts the view of his own <Col N="1254" /> leader.  I would suggest that he reconsider his suggestion.  I listened to Deputy Andrews who clearly does support the position taken by Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I wonder if there is some kind of twin track operating within Fianna Fáil &mdash; I hope not.  The least its leader deserves is support on this crucial issue.  It is certainly the least this country deserves.  We have a job of work to do, a task ahead of us.  The Government is working, with the British Government, to ensure that the peace process will continue.  We all have a responsibility, including Deputy Brennan, to make sure that that process is successful.</P>
    <P>I would like, as others have, to extend my condolences to the people who have suffered as a result of this bomb.  I can only repeat what I said at the outset. Our task is to ensure that it is never repeated and that the IRA understands, once and for all, what democracy is about, why it must come on board in relation to the future of Northern Ireland, and that this is an opportunity for it to make that leap.  Others have made it.  It is up to it now to make that leap and, for the good of the cause they represent, come into the political process. That is where it belongs.  That is where it needs to articulate the views it has in a way that does not hurt, does not destroy, does not maim, and does not kill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to contribute to this debate and to see that this House is spending three days discussing this very serious situation.  We should have had this debate a long time ago instead of waiting for what happened last weekend.</P>
      <P>Last Friday evening I attended a celebratory function in my constituency which finished up more like a wake. Everyone I met at the function was upset and annoyed because of the planting of the bomb in London.  I hope it will be the last bomb we ever see planted by the IRA in any part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> As somebody from a rural constituency I wish to say that people are concerned about peace in Northern Ireland. Last year I attended the Mayomen's dinner in London as a guest speaker. Every year for ten years I have attended the Westport emigrants' reunion.  the first to be affected by last weekend's bomb will not be me or anybody in this House, in Mayo, in Westport, or Castlebar but the emigrants in London, Luton and Newcastle.  It is they who will suffer. I have relatives all over Britain who have worked there all their lives and who have made a major contribution to that land, and they are the people who will suffer.  I do not blame the British public who, when innocent people are injured by a bomb in the middle of London, blame the Irish community.  It is the Irish community who have suffered over the years.</P>
    <P>I call on the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the leaders of the Opposition parties and everybody involved in the peace process to keep up the momentum of the good work.  It is important that the door be kept open for Gerry Adams.  People will say the door cannot be kept open for him, but it must be kept open as he will have to play his part in the peace process. I have not been a Sinn Féin supporter but on this occasion every door of opportunity has to be kept open to get the peace process back on the rails.</P>
    <P>Last Friday was a sad day.  I call on the general public to organise marches throughout the British Isles that will get the message to all politicians, whether in the South, the North or in England to play their part.  They will have to go to the table and resolve the problem through negotiations.  All sides will have to give a little to try to get the peace process back on the rails.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be an expert on Northern Ireland matters but as a rural Deputy from Westport, a tourism destination, I know the bombing will have a major impact on the livelihoods of those involved in tourism.  The explosion was televised throughout the world, which <Col N="1256" /> was bad publicity for Ireland.  Last year, Northern Protestants returned to the west for the first time in 25 years because they felt safe.  They welcomed the peace process.  They now have a duty to talk to politicians such as Ian Paisley, David Trimble and their supporters and tell them they want peace to continue.</P>
    <P>I too sympathise with the relatives and friends of the innocent people who died and wish those who have been injured a speedy recovery.  As a politician in this Government I compliment the Taoiseach for the work he has done on Northern Ireland and I call on him to keep talking because we do not want to return to the bad old days.</P>
    <P>I call on people to protest on the streets and tell politicians they will not tolerate another 25 years of violence. Politicians will listen to people.  If today's politicians are not prepared to do it, the people will have to look to others who are prepared to do it on their behalf.  People from Belmullet to Kiltimagh want peace.  I call on politicians from every side, from John Hume who has always been opposed to violence and played a major part in the peace process, to Ian Paisley, David Trimble, the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring to go to the table.  The British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major had one opportunity and should not miss his second opportunity for peace.  We do not want a return to violence with people being killed and injured in the name of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I join other members in welcoming the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Northern Ireland.  We requested the debate last October and it is unfortunate that we are debating the topic in the present circumstances. I too express my sincere condolences to the families of those who were killed and extend good wishes to those injured at Canary Wharf.  I join in the condemnation of the bombing.  It is not the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> As co-ordinator for the Fianna Fáil Party at the forum it has been my experience during the past 18 months that Sinn Féin has worked diligently to try to make the forum a worthwhile endeavour to bring about peace and reconciliation.  I pay tribute to the delegations at the forum from Sinn Féin, Alliance Party, the SDLP and other parties in the North as well as to the delegations from the parties in the South because something very dynamic and important took place in Dublin Castle each Friday, whether in plenary or committee session.</P>
    <P>Members have said they remembered where they were when news of the bombing at Canary Wharf was broadcast. I was in Donegal at a councillors meeting when we got word of the bombing. It was a shock to everybody.  One of the first people I met after the meeting was a Sinn Féin councillor.  It was evident this councillor was very shocked by what had happened.  It is important that this point be made.</P>
    <P>I have a simple view of the peace process &mdash; some may say it is simplistic &mdash; and the role that Government plays in it.  The Irish Government and the Taoiseach in particular should have acted as the leader of Nationalist Ireland in this context.  That is the role of whoever is in office.  The role of the Taoiseach and his Government is to convince the British Government to continue the progress made in the peace process.  The British Government must be the persuader of Unionist opinion and convince Unionists of the necessity for change.  We must acknowledge that we have all made mistakes.  I am not trying to score party political points but perhaps one of the mistakes made by the Taoiseach is that he believed, for one reason or another, he could persuade Unionist opinion.  Unionists will not allow themselves to be persuaded by an Irish Government and that must be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>We should make an effort to accommodate different views and make changes that will appeal to the Unionist people and politicians.  We must do <Col N="1258" /> what we can to advance peace and reconciliation.  Successive Governments, including the present one, have done so. I do not believe any Government will be in a position to persuade Unionists to change and be involved in talks from which they have nothing to fear.  That is the role of the British Government.</P>
    <P>The best illustration of what I mean is to contrast what the British Government did in the lead-up to the Framework Document and the Downing Street Declaration and what it has done since. From my experience in Government, in the period leading up to the Framework Document the British Government was proactive and tried to convince the Unionists there was a way forward.  By and large it succeeded in doing so.  We cannot say that Unionists enthusiastically embraced anything that was said or done but they came on board to some extent.  John Major has been criticised over the last few days but I pay tribute to him for doing that.  He played a huge role in bringing people on board and advancing the peace process at that time.  He has not pursued that policy since and has ceased trying to be a persuader. I do not know why.  Some say it is due to his slim majority in the House of Commons but I do not believe that. He was in a precarious position when he was involved in the Downing Street Declaration and so on.  There is some other reason, whether it is that there are different advisers or we are not vigorously pursuing the matter.  We must convince him to adopt the proactive role he played up to 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>Unionists are hard-headed, tough negotiators in business and politics.  If we want to do business with them we must be equally tough.  A policy of appeasement will not succeed and should not be pursued.  We should state our legitimate aspirations clearly, acknowledge that they have legitimate aspirations and try to reach an accommodation with them.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to insert a note of acrimony into the debate but I cannot let the remarks of the Minister of State, <Col N="1259" /> Deputy McManus, go unopposed.  She implied that there might be a twin track approach in Fianna Fáil on this matter. I assure her that there is no such approach in Fianna Fáil.  Our position was made clear by our leader and is supported by the parliamentary party and the Front Bench.</P>
    <P>She took exception to the comments made by Deputy Ahern on the role played by her party leader, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  I do not know where she has been for the past eight months.  As co-ordinator of the Fianna Fáil group at the Forum I had occasion three or four months ago to issue a statement taking Deputy De Rossa to task for his constant sniping at Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin when both the Tánaiste and Taoiseach were involved in delicate negotiations. Deputy De Rossa's sniping was not helpful to the Government.  As late as last Saturday he was more interested in scoring political points on a radio programme than in trying to bring about peace and reconciliation.  While we should all examine our conscience on whether we could have done more to advance the peace process, he has a greater reason to examine his on what he has done in that regard over the past 12 months.  His presence has been disruptive. The leader of a party that commanded about 2 per cent support in the last general election and in opinion polls has no major role to play in the Northern Ireland peace process.  I do not mean to denigrate the Minister personally and while we should be as inclusive as ever, a party that commands that amount of support should not be in a position to be disruptive.  That is what he has been over the past 12 months.  I ask him to desist and leave it to the leaders of the two major parties in Government to carry the negotiations. Their job is difficult enough without internal sniping.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  I am very pleased the Government has not persisted with its original approach that the Forum <Col N="1260" /> should be suspended indefinitely.  I express my appreciation to it for not forcing that issue.  To suspend the forum indefinitely would be a grave mistake.  I am pleased the delegation rooms in Dublin Castle are still available to all the parties involved and I thank the Government for that.  The decision not to close down the Forum was a wise one.  To do so would not be helpful to the peace process; it would be disastrous. The Forum has been adjourned for four weeks and while I and my party are not happy with that, we accept the reasons given for it.</P>
    <P>It could be speculated as to whether the Government has power to close down the Forum.  It was set up by the Government as an independent body, and on financial grounds the Government could close it down.  The Forum operates on a party basis rather than as Government or Opposition &mdash; that is its strength and will continue to be so in the present difficult climate.  Each party puts forward its position and concedes grounds in various areas.  When it came to light that there was a possibility the Forum would be closed down a person commented to me that talks, which have taken place in the past 18 months when there was peace, should not stop as soon as a difficulty arises.  That is a legitimate and fair point.  The Forum has worked well and will continue to do so.  Because it operates on a party basis rather than as Government or Opposition it will have an increasingly important role in the current climate.</P>
    <P>The Forum should be used, as it has been in the past, as a platform for groups outside the political system such as community, voluntary, sporting and educational groups.  They should have the opportunity to give their views on what is happening.  It is a very important platform in that regard and therefore it should not be closed down.  Reports of the Forum which have been almost finalised could be very important in the process of peace and for that reason they should be published and the work of the Forum should continue.</P>
    <P>The drafting committee report, which <Col N="1261" /> received great publicity, is one part of a very comprehensive document.  I ask people, when querying the credentials of Sinn Féin and others, to read the principal section of that document which was signed by all parties except Sinn Féin.  It withheld its support on the consent principle on the basis that negotiations are taking place on that issue. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is now more important than ever. I look forward to its next meeting on 15 March and to a continuation of its work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate. The IRA's return to violence and the bombing and murder of innocent civilians last Friday can only be described as a great tragedy and betrayal of all those who worked for peace.  Last Friday was one of the darkest and most disheartening days in recent history.  I speak for the majority of people in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim when I say they were shocked and saddened by the decision of the IRA army council to end the ceasefire and commence a new bombing campaign.  I join with every Member of this Parliament in extending my sympathies, and those of the people of Sligo-Leitrim, to the families of those killed and injured on Friday last.</P>
      <P>While the behaviour of John Major and the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party has been inexcusable and indefensible, there can be no justification for a return to violence and the killing of innocent civilians.  For the past 17 months all sections of nationalist Ireland, including Labour, Sinn Féin, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the SDLP, worked together to consolidate the peace process.  Despite the difficulties and obstacles and the intransigence of the British Tory administration, the Nationalist parties, led by the Government, continued to press the case for all-party talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very clear that while the Government commenced an international campaign to win backing for proximity talks, which it hoped would take place before the end of this month, and the Tánaiste, <Col N="1262" /> Deputy Spring, travelled to Washington to brief President Clinton on that campaign, the IRA army council was planning to wreck the entire peace process by resuming its bombing campaign. There was no hint or suggestion that a return to the bombing campaign was imminent.  Neither Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness nor anybody else in the political leadership of the republican movement was advised that the IRA ceasefire was about to collapse.  The militarists in the IRA army council decided unilaterally that it was time to start the slaughter once again.  Not only have they treated the political leadership of Sinn Féin and the republican movement with derision but they have treated the people of nationalist Ireland with contempt.</P>
    <P>Political leaders such as John Hume, Gerry Adams, Deputy Reynolds, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others have taken great risks to ensure the peace process succeeds.  The publication of the Downing Street Declaration and the IRA and loyalist ceasefires were greeted with open arms by the people. The Sinn Féin promise that the IRA ceasefire would hold in all circumstances was particularly welcomed by those who had suffered most, the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Despite the intransigence of John Major, particularly on the issue of republican prisoners and all-party talks, the process of community reconciliation was commenced, largely on the initiative of local communities and community organisations north and south of the Border.  The process of demilitarisation had also begun with the withdrawal of British troops from the streets, the removal of road blocks and opening of Border roads which had been closed for many years.  The economic benefits of peace were becoming clear with a notable increase in investment opportunities north and south of the Border by international interests and a major increase in tourists, not only in my area of Sligo-Leitrim but throughout the Border region and the country.  The Forum for Peace and <Col N="1263" /> Reconciliation was established and was playing a significant role and, most importantly, no one was being killed in Northern Ireland as a result of political violence.</P>
    <P>Very many of us were frustrated with the intransigence of John Major and the British Government and the refusal of Unionists to enter meaningful dialogue with Sinn Féin and Nationalist parties. However, all parties involved in the peace process, including Sinn Féin, had agreed to reject violence and there was common agreement that change could come about peacefully only through continued dialogue, discussion and negotiation.  The fact that neither Gerry Adams nor anyone else involved in the political leadership of the republican movement was advised that the IRA ceasefire was about to end last Friday clearly indicates that the militarists on the IRA Army Council carried out a military coup on the political leadership of that movement.  Gerry Adams and the political leadership of the republican movement have been sidelined by the militarists and apparently, an internal battle is being waged within the movement. Events over the next few days and weeks will clarify who is in control and which direction the republican movement takes &mdash; the road to war or the road to peace.</P>
    <P>I know that the great majority of members and supporters of Sinn Féin and the republican movement were shocked when they heard of the ending of the ceasefire and the London bombing on Friday.  They recognise the futility of starting another bombing campaign and despite their frustration they, more than any group, will recognise that a return to violence can lead only to political isolation and a war of attrition which no one can win.  The majority of members and supporters of Sinn Féin recognise that a return to the bomb and the bullet can only play into the hands of the most right wing elements in Ireland and Britain.  It is very important that they make it clear to the militarists on the IRA Army <Col N="1264" /> Council that a return to war is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Gerry Adams and the political leadership of Sinn Féin and the republican movement must reassert their leadership. He, more than anyone, will be aware that the IRA decision and Friday's bombing carries enormous risks of pitching the country into a conflict more horrible than we have ever witnessed.  If Gerry Adams is to retain his credibility as a republican leader and as one who can negotiate on behalf of the republican movement, he must take the necessary steps to ensure that pressure is brought to bear on the leaders of the IRA to convince them to restore the ceasefire.  We all recognise that Sinn Féin has invested heavily in the peace process and many within that party have worked tirelessly in its cause.  In that context Gerry Adams should advise members of the IRA Army Council that they have no authority, moral or political, to plunge this country into another 25 years of violence, death and destruction. He should also advise the IRA that it has no mandate or authority from the people of Ireland, North or South, and that its decision to start a new war will not have the support of Sinn Féin or its supporters.  We must all make it clear that the ordinary people of this country are entitled to raise their families free from violence and that they are crying out for justice and a permanent peace.</P>
    <P>It would be a crime against humanity if peace were allowed to slip away in the coming days.  If we are to overcome the intransigence of the British and Unionists and to move the process forward, we can only do so on the basis of promoting dialogue and engaging in discussion and negotiation.  It is most important that the lines of communication with Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin remain open.  It is time for all of us to rescue the peace process.  Despite John Major's outrageous and indefensible behaviour during the past year in undermining the peace process, the refusal of Unionists to enter into meaningful talks and their spiteful and vicious attacks on the <Col N="1265" /> Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the difficulties and obstacles which still face us, our task remains the achievement of a lasting and permanent peace in our country.  We must make it clear that a return to the bomb and the bullet would be playing into the hands of the most reactionary elements here and in Britain.  For all of us who seek Irish unity, the reality remains that unity can be achieved only by those of us who favour this outcome, persuading those who do not peacefully and without coercion or violence.  The search for Irish unity must become a search for unity of hearts and minds and one of purpose, not merely a search for unity of territory.</P>
    <P>I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Boylan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bree for sharing his time with me.  Like previous speakers and those who will contribute to this debate, I express my outrage and condemnation of what happened on Friday night in London.  That has no place in the Ireland in which I live and in which I want my family to grow up.  The people who planted that bomb had no mandate from anyone other than their self-thwarted interests.  The damage they did is untold.  Two people in the prime of their life, one 29 and the other 31 years of age, had their lives taken away.  They probably did not have any knowledge of Northern Ireland affairs and, I am sure, they did not have any knowledge of the politics of Northern Ireland.  Who had the right to take their lives and in whose name did they do it? A slur that has been cast on our country. A dark shadow of shame hangs over it and we are all brought down with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a number of telephone calls from friends in the Cavan Men's Association in Birmingham, Manchester and London, whom I meet annually. Those people were made welcome in England although their livelihoods were difficult during the 25 years prior to the ceasefire when outrage after outrage was committed by both sides.  They felt <Col N="1266" /> shame, hurt and isolation as a result of those outrages when they met their English work colleagues.  That was forgotten and friendships were being forged when suddenly it was thrown to one side.  Nobody had the right to do that. The people who stated or sent messages that they were frustrated because of the lack of progress during the past 18 months were out of touch with what was happening.  I, Deputy Bree and representatives of Border constituencies know good progress was made and we were pleased about it.</P>
    <P>I have never seen as many people from Northern Ireland travel south of the Border into the Republic as during the ceasefire.  Northern Ireland registered cars were a common sight. Nothing more than a reference to the sighting of a northern registered car was read into a comment from a person who said there was a Fermanagh registered car in the village of Butlersbridge in Cavan the other day.  Dozens of northern registered cars were visible in the Republic.  Their owners parked them openly and were not afraid.  It took time for northerners to travel south in their cars.  The first few trips were difficult and they were concerned about the outcome. They realised there was not much difference between the people of Cavan and Fermanagh or those of Monaghan and Armagh and they returned and told their friends about it.</P>
    <P>The increasing volume of traffic south of the Border from Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim to Northern Ireland was also welcome.  People talked openly about the beauty of Enniskillen, Down, Armagh and other places in the North which they visited and were not afraid of the repercussions of somebody overhearing those comments.  That was the change and people had normal relationships with their neighbours as should be the case.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of parliamentary draftsmen currently employed in the Office of the Attorney General; and the way in which this compares with the situation in December 1994 and 1995.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of parliamentary draftsmen currently employed in the office of the Attorney General is 11.  This compares with eight in December 1994 and ten in December 1995.  In addition, throughout the period in question, the office of the Attorney General has continued to avail of the services of three former parliamentary draftsmen on a consultancy basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline any major improvements which have been made in the reporting system, which was where the difficulty lay in that office?  Will he outline the current procedure in the delegation of responsibility and co-ordination of progress reports on particularly sensitive issues? Those were the two major issues which led to the reviews and improvements. Can the House have an update on those two matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to parliamentary draftsmen specifically, not to the general operations of the Attorney General's office.  The House will recall that extensive information on all the matters to which the Deputy's question refers was given in the Attorney General's first six-monthly report.  I do not have that report in my brief because this question relates solely to the number of parliamentary draftsmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue that matter but I will put down another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the <Col N="1268" /> number of full-time and temporary draftsmen within the office is adequate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  As the House may be aware, it was intended to recruit an additional five persons and a competition was held, as I told the House on 17 October, for that purpose. Of the five candidates deemed suitable, only three accepted offers of appointment and are in the process of being, or have been, appointed.  There remain at least two places to be filled in order to bring the number of draftsmen up to what would be regarded as a moderately acceptable level.  No doubt, even when one reaches that stage there will still be need for improvement but we have not completed our programme of enhancing the level of drafting resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the reason two of the five people did not accept positions is because of the level of remuneration and because many of these draftsmen come from the Bar where they are much better remunerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Deputy paying that man beside her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to get them into politics too.  In view of the fact that some work has been given to former employees of that office by way of consultancy work, can I take it consideration might be given to contracting out some work to persons other than those who worked formerly in that office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being considered. We will be availing of the services of draftsmen from other jurisdictions who have not worked in the office.  There are difficulties, to which I have referred on other occasions, in regard to contracting out drafting to the general Bar.  The drafting of legislation on behalf of the State is a specific skill, separate from general legal qualifications which requires specific training. The on-the-job training of a legislative draftsperson takes approximately three <Col N="1269" /> years over and above the normal level of qualification which persons would obtain by being a qualified and practising barrister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be desirable if the skills of drafting were more widely available?  Whereas I can readily agree with him that it is a highly specialised skill, it seems to me that, both in the Law Society in Blackhall Place and in King's Inns, there should be lectures and courses in legislative drafting.  At the very least, it gives skills in interpretation to those who undergo the courses, but it would also create a wider bank of people from which the State could choose its draftsmen.</P>
      <P>On occasion legislation is rushed through this House in circumstances where it is not adequately vetted.  If there were a wider pool of people who had some education in this area, there are many occasions on which the skills of draftsmen could be made available, both to the Opposition and the Government, in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have the Deputy's suggestion considered by the Attorney General and the Ministers for Education and Justice who may be able to examine collectively this aspect of legal education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say draftsmen have been extraordinary over the years because they have dealt with an amount of legislation in unbelievable circumstances. Their facilities, technology and numbers have never been great.  Some of the semi-retired people who have worked in that office have been extraordinary people and have given great service to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has always been the question of the length of time involved in training. It is complicated and takes seven years to become a draftsman.  Is it not possible to recruit at a far younger age? We will always have the difficulty when we seek to recruit senior draftsmen that <Col N="1270" /> they are not available.  As Deputy Harney says, the remuneration is not satisfactory. Is it not possible to recruit barristers or legal people at a young age? My understanding is that there are dozens of these people in the Law Library earning very little money.  Whether that is true, I am not qualified to say, but that is what I am told by legal friends in the House and elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are paid badly there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Should we not give them an opportunity to build up those skills over a few years?  It seems incredible that the Government must go around the world to find senior draftsmen. I am grateful to the draftsmen and am not in any way critical of them.  I was involved in trying to convince a few of them to stay on even though they were long past the final retirement age plus five years.  Will the Taoiseach examine that aspect of the matter?  Otherwise the problem will arise again in this House and somebody else will be talking about the same issue in ten years' time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Taken in conjunction with Deputy McDowell's suggestion, Deputy Ahern is making a reasonable point.  Nonetheless, I do not have available to me details of the ages of the people being recruited.  I have no reason to believe they are not comparatively young but I will check and let the Deputy know.  While I agree that some earnings at the Bar are very high, there are many people at the Bar who, given their present level of income and taking into account their very considerable talents, would be very happy to accept work of this kind.  It is a myth to suggest that everybody at the Bar is making huge sums.  There are many talented people who, for one reason or another, do not make huge sums and would be <Col N="1271" /> quite suitable for this type of work. Deputy Michael McDowell's suggestion of incorporating greater training in legal drafting in general law courses would be very helpful in this regard.</P>
      <P>Another helpful improvement would be in the training of officials in Government Departments in drafting heads of Bills.  The job is much easier if the heads have been properly prepared before being referred to the Draftsman's Office.  That is a matter of general Civil Service education and also of considerable relevance and perhaps reinforces Deputy McDowell's case for incorporating legal drafting in general education in the legal field.</P>

      <P>I would not like Deputy Dempsey to think I am neglecting contacts with the United States of America.  I paid three visits to the United States last year and will travel there next month.  I had meetings with senior American figures almost daily and on Friday last I met some very important American people.  I meet people in American economic and political life almost weekly.  While a visit by me to the United States obviously constitutes the best possible way of maintaining contact, there are other means of doing so.  There are considerable pressures on my time because of our forthcoming Presidency of the European Union in the second half of the year.  There has to be greater focus on <Col N="1275" /> Europe.  Unfortunately, one must balance that against the very great requirement of maintaining close contact with American opinion but we are doing the best we can.  As the House will be aware, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs was in the United States last week and other Ministers will visit America on St. Patrick's Day.  It goes without saying I will keep under review the possibility of further visits during the year, as and when the opportunity and necessity arises.</P>

      <P>While fully acknowledging the importance of such visits by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and other members of the Government, the office of Taoiseach is of particular importance.  I realise there are pressures on the Taoiseach's time in Europe and elsewhere, but will he reconsider leaving for the United States a few days earlier and availing of the opportunity to visit some other cities? Arising out of his comment that he has spoken to the United States President and others in recent days, has he raised the issue of former Senator George Mitchell being appointed a peace envoy? Does he intend pursuing that issue?</P>

      <Quest>if he will confirm media reports that one constituency has received over 50 per cent of the grants from the special local development scheme under the auspices of his Department.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2824/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The total sum available for assistance under the special local development grant schemes is £1.24 million for 1995 and 1996.  Applications were sought publicly and other applications were on hands from other schemes &mdash; in particular from the Urban Initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A series of criteria were laid down which had to be met.  These included: maximum grant of £100,000 to any one group or 75 per cent of reckonable costs; adequacy of material provided in support of application; the outcome of meetings/visits with the promoter; other sources of funds available to the applicant; whether project can/has received funds under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development and/or the Urban Initiative; demonstration of ability of group to carry out work; level of disadvantage in areas; relevance to local development/Operational Programme in one or more of the following areas &mdash; enterprise, services to unemployed, community development, environmental improvements, targeting disadvantaged groups; demonstration of ability <Col N="1281" /> to satisfy accounting and accountability requirements of Department.</P>
    <P>The total number of applications received was 199.  Following a critical examination based on these criteria, 84 applications were selected for funding. Of these, a total of 44 applications were processed and allocated funding to a total of £992,845 in 1995.  This included seven island voluntary agencies.  The remaining applicants will hopefully benefit from the remainder of the fund, subject of course to Department of Finance sanction.</P>
    <P>I am aware of media reports which suggested that one constituency, Dublin South Central, received 50 per cent of the grants under the scheme.  I can assure the Deputy that this is not the case.  I have allocated funding to 12 local organisations located in that constituency to a total of £243,845.  This represents less than 20 per cent of the total funds available.  One further grant was given to a community based school project in Dublin's inner city which serves four schools in underprivileged areas of three constituencies, Dublin South-East, Dublin South-Central and Dublin Central. Considering that the bulk of the fund applied to the five main cities in the country and that Dublin South Central has not been selected to benefit under the Urban Initiative under which £16 million will be available for integrated urban regeneration projects in three areas, i.e. Finglas/Ballymun/ Darndale, West Tallaght/Clondalkin and north Cork City, I do not think it was unreasonable to assign this allocation.</P>
    <P>It is also worth pointing out that financial assistance to a total of £287 million is available from a broad range of schemes to groups and agencies engaged in local development.  These schemes which were drawn up under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99 are operated under the aegis of my Department, the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Am I analysing the figures correctly if I say that about 2.5 per cent of the fund would be available to each constituency if it had been divided equally whereas, in fact, the constituency of Dublin South-Central received 20 per cent?  Will the Minister of State confirm that the criterion for all the applications was whether they were from Dublin South-Central?  Is that the critical analysis that was undertaken?</P>

      <P>I have nailed the lie that the amount is 50 per cent.  I have a file of press cuttings from spokespersons of various parties alleging that 50 per cent had been given to the constituency of the Minister of State.  Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>

      <P>I have pointed out it is not 50 per cent but 20 per cent.  Furthermore, the Minister of State's constituency did not benefit under a number of other schemes and projects.  It is not fair to allege that an undue proportion was disbursed to the Minister of State's constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State knows our job is to ask questions related to matters in the public domain and to elicit facts.  This is an important fund and the Minister of State has confirmed that Dublin South Central has received ten times more than the average amount that would have been available if a <i>pro rata</i> calculation had been used.  The constituency has received one fifth of the total and ten times more than one could reasonably expect.  The fact that it did not receive other funds has nothing to do with the matter.  One fifth of this national fund has gone to one constituency which happens to be the constituency of the Minister of State <Col N="1283" /> responsible for its allocation.  Is it not the case that the critical examination carried out in the section was the address of the applicant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">

      <P>My information is that each and every application submitted was evaluated on its merits in relation to the degree of social disadvantage, the preparedness of the project and its meeting the nine separate criteria required for qualification.  In the constituency in question 12 projects qualified. Having examined the details of the file in relation to the merits of a particular application, nobody could quibble that there was anything of an undue political nature involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State may agree that the exaggeration in the media arises from the fact that some of the money was spent in my constituency. Will he agree that there is a sting in the tail because the portion of my constituency in which it was spent is to be transferred to Dublin South Central under the forthcoming legislation?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that in this matter the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, could learn a lot from the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, who has let down his own constituency so obviously?</P>

It is 20 per cent of the total fund for the year but of the part of the fund allocated so far Dublin South Central has got slightly less than 25 per cent.  The 44 projects got £992,000; Dublin South Central got £243,845 which is nearer to 25 per cent than 20 per cent.  One in four of the pounds spent have gone to one constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Report No. 97 of the National Economic and Social Council, New Approaches to Rural Development, draws attention to the serious economic and social problems facing rural areas and states that they are sufficiently important to warrant detailed analysis <Col N="1287" /> and sustained attention by policy makers. The decline in population levels in the west has been identified as a key policy issue for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the implications for the country as a whole of the continuous trend of population instability and decline in the region.  For this reason a number of initiatives have been set in train to address the issues mentioned in the NESC report.  These include various measures in the area of rural development, the pilot programme on public service provision in rural areas and the renewal of local government.</P>
    <P>One of the key initiatives in addressing the problems in the western region is the work of the Western Development Partnership Board.  This was established on foot of one of the key recommendations of the Government Task Force on A Crusade for Survival. The partnership board's general function is to promote the economic and social development of the region with the objective of achieving population stability by the end of the decade at 1991 Census levels on a county basis.  In this regard, it has completed an action plan.  The Government will respond when it has had an opportunity to consider the recommendations in the action plan.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am undertaking an innovative pilot programme to see how best public services can be maintained in less populated rural areas.  This initiative is a direct response to the NESC report's recommendation that a pilot scheme be initiated to test the practicality of adopting a &ldquo;unified location-based approach to service provision&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following widespread consultation with service providers, local development organisations and local voluntary and community groups, I have received a number of pilot project proposals. There has been an initial evaluation of these proposals and discussion with applicants.  Tenders have been received for the management of the pilot programme and a contract will shortly be <Col N="1288" /> awarded.  This pilot programme will examine how adequate access to public services can be maintained on a cost effective basis in rural areas with a low density of population.  The experience will inform the development of Government policy and action in the future.</P>
    <P>A key requirement for successfully addressing the problems facing the west is the integration of work being carried out by various Government Departments. This is being examined by the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development.  In this context, the work of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in relation to rural development is a central response by Government to the problems highlighted in the NESC report.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has examined and implemented, where possible, the recommendations of the Government Task Force on A Crusade for Survival. In particular, changes were introduced in the milk quota regime to prevent milk production being moved from disadvantaged areas.  In addition, the proposed third category of extremely disadvantaged areas, which is being examined at present, will be designed to provide increased headage payments, particularly in western areas which are suffering population decline.</P>
    <P>The NESC report includes recommendations on the Leader programme. Leader II is being implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in a manner which is fully consistent with these recommendations. Public funding of £77 million, to be increased to £95 million later this year, has been allocated to 36 groups under the programme.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, has established a Rural Development Policy Advisory Group to advise him on future policy for rural development.  This group will examine the NESC report in the course of its deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and <Col N="1289" /> Forestry, with the accompanying CAP reform measures, support a wide range of actions which, as the NESC report suggests, will address the economic and social problems in rural areas by improving competitiveness and promoting farm diversification, forestry and land mobility.  Questions on these matters should be addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>A renewed local government system can provide a more effective focus for the delivery of a wider range of public services.  It could also assist the better development of local communities and the promotion of more local development and enterprise.  In The Statement on Local Government Reform of 4 July 1995, the Government announced the establishment of the Devolution Commission. Its task is to develop, for Government consideration and decision, statements of the specific steps necessary to renew the local government system.  Copies of the statement have been laid before the Houses.</P>
    <P>The commission has been mandated to make recommendations so that significant additional functions are devolved to local government; local authorities are involved with policy and administration in the case of functions not devolved directly to them; local authorities become the focus for working through local partnerships and the efforts of existing local development groups are co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>This is a coherent and comprehensive framework in which to address the issues of depopulation and development in rural Ireland and I look forward to progress being made on all these fronts during 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.  One of the recommendations of the NESC was that a study of settlement patterns in the west should be conducted.  Is the Minister of State aware that, according to the Western Development Partnership Board, approximately 9 per cent of the population live in the north west? Apart from outlining the measures the <Col N="1290" /> Government has taken, will he indicate whether it will commission such a study and consider other suggestions, such as the provision of a larger allocation of Cohesion Funds in the western region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The NESC examined the issue of settlement patterns and the Western Development Partnership Board has made certain recommendations in its action plan.  This plan is being examined and any recommendations will be put to the Government as quickly as possible.  Perhaps I should have taken Question No. 9 with these two questions.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State believe that the measures outlined will reverse the trend of population decline in rural areas and, if so, will he explain the reason local authorities in the major cities and towns, including Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Letterkenny, are planning for a massive increase in numbers?  Will he accept that they expect the present trend of population decline in rural areas and the process of urbanisation to continue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The NESC linked the withdrawal of these services, including the insensitive closure of post offices, particularly between 1987 and 1992, with the decision of many people to leave rural areas.  We have received five or six proposals to initiate pilot schemes.  These are being examined by a management team and will be proceeded with in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot wave a magic wand and in one fell swoop reverse the trend of population decline.  All I can do is put a <Col N="1291" /> framework in place to arrest the trend. In this context, pilot schemes will be instituted to provide for the integration of public services.  As the Deputy is aware, despite the best efforts of the local community in Letterfrack in his own constituency where a study was conducted, the public services which accepted the need for integration failed to come together to initiate a pilot scheme.  I am making a further attempt at the behest of the NESC and the Taoiseach to see that this is done.  The only people missing at the seminars I attended were the politicians.</P>

      <P>Neither did I.  What the Minister of State appears to be saying is that the population trends can be corrected by keeping post offices and other public services open.  Fifty per cent of the people of County Galway live within a 15 mile radius of Galway city.  City and county borough plans include a 30 per cent increase in that number, the majority of whom will come from rural areas.  While the small steps taken in this connection are desirable, does the Government have a mainframe plan to address the population imbalance between urban and rural areas which is widening every day and costing the economy dearly?  Has the Government any plans other than those relating to local post offices?</P>

The plan of the Western Development Partnership Board was initiated by the bishops and small farmers outside Loughrea.

      <P>The PIANO report was presented to me on 29 January 1996.  As I indicated in my speech on that occasion the issues raised in the report have vital funding implications and are proper to be considered by Radio Telefís Éireann, An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Minister for Education in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have embarked on a process of consultation with these bodies to obtain their formal views and inform my decision-making on the recommendations in the report.  It is, therefore, premature at this early stage to indicate which, or in what manner, recommendations contained in the report will be implemented.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that in view of the costs that might be involved if he were to remove the existing support system for the National Symphony Orchestra and make it an independent body, he may well cause additional problems with regard to personnel, finance and engineering.  The symphony orchestra in Britain is an integral part of the BBC.  Will the Minister consider the question of giving the NSO its own independent section or division within RTÉ rather than the current situation whereby it comes under the ambit of the radio centre?  I will be interested to hear the Minister's view on this because it may well be the route forward.</P>

There are implications in the PIANO report on the future of classical music for An Comhairle Ealaíon, Radio Telefís Éireann and the Minister for Education but the part of the report that ultimately falls to me for a decision relates to the future of the symphony orchestra.  I do not, however, want to pre-judge the consultations that may take place with any of the bodies.  In my speech at the launch on 29 January I described the proposals in the PIANO Report as radical and said they would require consultation with all the interests involved.  I am interested in the point the Deputy makes but those type of issues will be considered by me when the consultations, which I do not expect to take an undue length of time, have been completed and at that stage it will fall to me to make decisions on the matters within my remit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council Directive on the conservation of wild birds (79/409/EEC), known as the &ldquo;Birds Directive&rdquo;, requires member states to take measures to protect all wild birds and to preserve a sufficient diversity of habitats for such species to maintain populations at an ecologically sound level.  The principles of &ldquo;wise use&rdquo; as applied in this country are very wide but I assume the Deputy is referring to Article 7(4) of the birds directive which states that member states must ensure that the practice of hunting &ldquo;... complies with the principles of wise use and ecologically balanced control of the species of birds concerned...&rdquo;.  This is the concept of &ldquo;wise use&rdquo; or &ldquo;sustainable yield&rdquo; whereby the yield taken from the population through hunting on an annual basis does not compromise the survival of the population.  The conservation requirements of the species are met through the provision of a limited hunting season under section 24 of the 1976 Wildlife Act.  This restricts the hunting of the species by native and foreign hunter alike.</P>
      <P>The following are the measures in force.  First, game species and the periods when they may be hunted are included on the Open Seasons Orders, 1979 to 1995.  While traditional in origin they are primarily determined by the conservation status and needs of the species concerned with due regard to the principle of wise use.  This is reviewed annually.  For example, the grey partridge was removed from the open season hunting list for the 1995-1996 hunting season on conservation grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, hunters must hold a valid firearm certificate and hunting licence and have the permission of the land-owner. I understand that 77,000 shotgun certificates or hunting licences were issued to native hunters in the year ended 31 July 1995, the last year for which figures are available.  The figure for foreign hunters is 3,100 in the year ended 31 December 1995.  In addition, significant controls and procedures are and have been in place for some time <Col N="1299" /> for shooting by foreign hunters.  There is no evidence to suggest that current levels of hunting, by native or foreign hunters, are impacting adversely on the conservation status of the species or are in breach of the principle of wise use.</P>
    <P>New measures proposed include the preparation of the draft heads of a Bill to amend the Wildlife Act, 1976, which is being undertaken in my Department and which I hope to introduce in the Oireachtas later this year.  The amending Bill will, where necessary, strengthen the existing law to ensure protection of threatened species.</P>

      <P>Those who are not interested or do not know much about this directive might think this issue is quite frivolous but those of us who have taken an interest in it will know that the National Association of Regional Game Councils has 22,000 members throughout the country.  I am sure the Minister will agree that this organisation has achieved a great deal for education and conservation in relation to this matter. Is the Minister aware that the NARGC has been deeply concerned for many years about the threat to the populations of migratory game species because of the commercial exploitation by tourist shoot promoters and their foreign clients?  Is he aware that the most serious aspect is that tourists are interested only in hunting migratory birds?  What action does he intend to take to deal with abuses perpetrated against wildlife by foreign shooters?</P>

We will have to put in place additional protective measures following the signing of the African Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement which this country proposes to sign.  Under the terms of the agreement sustainable hunting of many migratory game species will take place only in accordance with a management plan agreed between the range states.  The agreement has been <Col N="1300" /> approved by Cabinet and certified by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Our Ambassador to the Hague will sign the agreement on behalf of Ireland in a month or so.  I am aware of the matters raised by the Deputy and of the work being carried out by the National Association of Regional Game Councils.

      <P>What action does the Minister propose to take to deal with the regular breaches by tourists of the firearms legislation, the nub of the question? On 28 March 1994 the NARGC raised with the Minister the legality of the licensing system but to date it has not received a satisfactory reply.  The Minister is ignoring his statutory obligation to vet the people to whom he gives a permit to carry a firearm on Irish soil.  Will he immediately review this issue and give an assurance that this situation will no longer pertain and that tourists will have to meet certain criteria? It may be argued that the NARGC is anti-tourist but this is most certainly not the case, as can be seen from the tremendous promotional work it has carried out.  Tourists should be required to meet the same criteria as Irish citizens.</P>

I am anxious to be positive and I am not suggesting that the NARGC is anti-tourist &mdash; I will discuss its concerns at the meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  In drafting the heads of the legislation to amend the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 1976, I will look at those subsections which may give rise to <Col N="1301" /> the need for parallel amendments to the firearms legislation.  My officials have had discussions with officials of the Department of Justice in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the figure proposed by An Chomhairle Ealaíon for 1996 in the Arts Plan 1995-1997 was £21.789 million.  In the context of the funding secured by me for 1996, I raised with an chomhairle the question of whether its three-year plan could be extended to five years without compromising the strategic objectives of the plan.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that at its meeting on 18 January last an chomhairle decided to redesignate the arts plan to cover the five year period 1995-99.

In the context of the 1996 budget, does the Minister <Col N="1302" /> accept that there has been a reduction of £3.4 million in the promised allocation for year two of the plan?

I want to be as straight in my remarks as the Deputy.  When I inherited responsibility for this wide area less than three years ago it was something of a desert.  The allocation at that time was £10.1 million while today it is £18.4 million. Regardless of the way one calculates the figures, that is an 84 per cent increase.  When I agreed to be a partner with the Arts Council and other groups in the publication of the arts plan I knew I was setting out targets which would be regularly revisited in the House.  The figure for the end of the plan is £26 million.  I am satisfied that the plan will roll on without any damage and that I will be able to deliver on the full plan for the figures given.  If the Deputy used her very considerable influence on her party spokesperson on Finance to ensure he was not so virulent about the need to control public spending my prospects might be better.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to explain the position to the Deputy.  The plan is made up of a set of modules and the original funding of £26 million was for a three-year period.  Depending on the allocation of funding across the extended five years, the projected allocations for one year following another will be different.  The Arts Council examined the integrity of the seven modules and whether it would have to abandon certain elements.  It is interested in rephasing aspects of different modules across the different time frame.  I would have appreciated being able to run with the level of expenditure that would have delivered the plan within three years.  I am deeply committed to the plan.  Lest I might have misled anybody, I was wrong to say I was in the Department for three years.  I was gone for just over four weeks and in that brief period funding for the Arts Council was slashed to the level of the previous year, and there was no talk of a plan.</P>

What it all comes down to is that there was a very low base.

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been argued that nothing has been happening in the context of the peace process.  That shows grave ignorance among the people who would make such a statement.  Much has happened on the ground, although probably not enough.  The interaction between people North and South was quite noticeable with people from Northern Ireland visiting the South and <i>vice versa</i> freely and without fear of intimidation.  That was a major step forward which may not be appreciated by people further afield who have the freedom to move without difficulty within their own region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my county and constituency our <Col N="1395" /> natural heartland was cut off by closed roads and the bombed bridges.  Within the last 18 months all of those roads were reopened.  Plans were well afoot to rebuild the Aghalane Bridge, the major link between the north-west and Northern Ireland.  Work was to commence on the building of that bridge later this year, and I hope the bombing in London will not prevent that.</P>
    <P>Tourism has picked up dramatically. The number of people coming to appreciate what we have to offer in our area has increased.  Bookings for this year alone were well up on last year's record numbers.  Many calls I had in the aftermath of the cowardly act in London were from people involved in tourism who wanted to know if this would have any effect on bookings.  They were annoyed because their livelihoods which were beginning to rebuild were being threatened.</P>
    <P>We have lived in the shadow of Northern Ireland in the six Border counties.  We existed during the 25 years prior to the peace, and that is a generous enough description in the context of what was achieved during the past 18 months <i>vis-a-vis</i> the upturn in the economy, the interest of people in developing their businesses, the rebuilding of towns and villages such as Belturbet and Ballyconnell which were literally dead towns.  There were programmes of rebuilding and urban renewal.  The opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal was an outstanding success and a flagship of the International Fund for Ireland.  To say that nothing had happened could not be further from the truth.  We do not want to turn the clock back.  We want to continue to develop and progress, and we are entitled to do that, having lived with the problems caused by the troubles for 25 years.  There can be no going back to that.  That is not a selfish attitude but the attitude of people who want to get on with their lives, rebuild and develop. It is an attitude of people who want to do business with their neighbours in <Col N="1396" /> Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa.</i> I cannot understand how Protestants and Catholics in counties Cavan and Monaghan can live and work together whereas in Fermanagh they find it very difficult.  There are probably deep rooted reasons but they could be overcome by people getting to know each other better and living in an atmosphere free of fear, where the finger of suspicion is not being pointed and accusations of murders and bombings are not being made against one section of the community.  People were beginning to leave this to the past, a process which, of course, will take time.  The hurt and suffering cannot be forgotten in 18 months, or even in 36 months, perhaps a decade would pass before total healing would take place.  The process was in place but it has now been stopped.</P>
    <P>We can talk about Nationalists and Unionists but, to be brutally frank, we are talking of Catholic and Protestant neighbours not being comfortable with each other after this atrocity.  It is a return to the past.  A number of my friends have had to seek their livelihood in England because they could not make a living in Ireland and the goodwill they had built up during the past 18 months with their English neighbours has been thrown away.  The feelings of being ill at ease which they experienced for 25 years have returned as a result of the London bombing.  The people who planted that bomb had no mandate and have dealt a cruel blow to people who want to get on with their lives.</P>
    <P>They will not be allowed to stop the progress of peace on this island.  People are bigger and better than that.  Out of this dastardly act, good will come. People will come to realise that they must work building peace at a faster pace, because the men of violence are waiting like murdering dogs in the dark of night.  They cannot or will not be allowed to take over as there is enough goodwill to rebuild the peace and bring our people together, united in heart, soul and spirit to work for all of us.</P>
    <P>In tourism the island of Ireland is being marketed as a single entity and <Col N="1397" /> people are being invited to travel North and South.  There was to be no difficulty with Border crossings and that is still on the agenda.  That will continue because our people are bigger than those who crawled out and planted that bomb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In any debate on Northern Ireland, security inevitably plays a central role and no consideration of political options can be divorced from the security aspects, even if some people wish it could.  It has again become noticeable, particularly since the terrorist atrocity in London last Friday night, that many people view the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin as two separate entities, one of which is full of militant baddies and the other consisting of peace loving goodies.</P>
      <P>The reality is different and should be borne in mind.  Provisional Sinn Féin is and has always been subservient to the provisional IRA.  The former exists as a political front organisation to help to sell and implement the policies and objectives of the latter.  There is a high degree of cross-membership between the two organisations; perhaps more accurately it could be said between the two parts of the one organisation.  It seems to have always been the case that at least one prominent member of the Sinn Féin leadership as perceived by the public was a member of the army council of the Provisional IRA.  There is no reason to believe this is not so at present.  All that is uncertain is which prominent Sinn Féin leader is a member of the army council of seven which makes the ultimate decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest, therefore, that Sinn Féin is a peace loving organisation that exists primarily to tone down the violent excesses of the IRA is erroneous.  It is quite unlike any normal democratic party.  It has a two-pronged approach which it summed up as &ldquo;the ballot box in one hand and the armalite rifle in the other&rdquo;.  The argument of its militant adherents is that when it commits an atrocious act of violence, particularly a high profile one in England, the public, <Col N="1398" /> politicians and the press all sit up and pay more attention.  That argument is probably true and in looking at the present situation we should try to bear it in mind.  In particular, we should not conclude that because of the bomb last Friday a strategic policy which was invalid on Thursday becomes valid this week.</P>
    <P>If the Governments and other parties are prepared to do things or advocate policies purely because of the bomb then those policies are inherently flawed and adopted for the worst and most undemocratic reasons.  The policies adopted in such circumstances strengthen the violent mindset and support the argument of the hawks that normal democracy is too slow and frustrating. If there are some individuals within the leadership of Sinn Féin who are genuinely looking for a permanent peace and settlement acceptable to all and in respect of which they are prepared to compromise, as everybody else will have to, then contact can be maintained with them and their views can be taken on board by the Governments and other parties.  There need not be a breakdown in channels of information, even if members of the two Governments quite self-evidently cannot meet people who condone and refuse to condemn an atrocity such as Canary Wharf.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech yesterday concentrated very heavily on an appeal to the IRA to cease violence.  While the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; was not used it was implicit in what he said.  While I cannot disagree with any of the Taoiseach's expressed sentiments, I still have an uneasy feeling when a Taoiseach at a time such as this directs the bulk of a formal speech in Dáil Éireann to an appeal to people who have spent 25 years murdering their fellow countrymen and British citizens.  In concentrating his remarks on the IRA, the Taoiseach is in danger, as are others, of being seen to react to force as a political weapon with greater alacrity than to anything else.  There is a great dilemma here for us all.  The vast majority of people so frantically want permanent <Col N="1399" /> peace that they are all in danger of succumbing to seeing this as an issue between the IRA and the British Government &mdash; in other words of seeing it in Sinn Féin's terms or accepting its agenda.</P>
    <P>We should know that is not the real underlying dispute.  That is the illusion fostered by Sinn Féin and echoed from time to time by others who do not stand back to think about it.  The reality of the problem is different.  The kernel of the problem has been, is and will be the inability of the two traditions in Northern Ireland to live together in a normal democratic society without bitter and fundamental mutual distrust.  Nationalists there have to be and remain conscious of the way the politico-religious majority dominated and excluded them for over 50 years.  Many Unionists claim to see that as the norm.  Many of them still hanker back to the old Stormont days and fear they might in the future be treated to a dose of their own medicine.</P>
    <P>Unionists may not be well served by their leadership.  In the two weeks leading up to Friday Messrs.  Trimble and Taylor made a series of singularly unhelpful and rather silly statements. They started referring again to the &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; Government as a foreign Government in a foreign country whose views they were not prepared to countenance. That is a total repudiation of Strand II and sets the clock back five or ten years.  If those type of views are persisted in it will make progress very difficult, as will the view of Mr. Ken Maginnis that even after an election there will not be talks until there is prior decommissioning.  This repudiates the Mitchell report.  It hardly betokens a willingness to compromise or an abandonment of the old mindsets for which Mitchell so strongly argued.</P>
    <P>There has been an air of unreality in the Republic about the Provisional movement since the ceasefire.  It has reached the stage where it is generally considered &ldquo;bad form&rdquo; and &ldquo;tedious&rdquo;<Col N="1400" /> publicly to confront Sinn Féin spokesmen with the reality of the IRA's activities.</P>
    <P>Take one example &mdash; punishment beatings.  This phrase is a euphemism for the systematic torture and permanent crippling of scores of people by the IRA-Sinn Féin.  The <i>modus operandi</i> is for half a dozen IRA members to, as they say, &ldquo;await&rdquo; a young delinquent or &ldquo;an anti-social element&rdquo; as they call him.  They take him somewhere they call &ldquo;safe&rdquo; and then systematically smash his elbow-joints, knee-joints and anklejoints with baseball bats and iron bars. The young man is then given a few extra blows to his face and left permanently crippled.</P>
    <P>This has been going on under our noses throughout the ceasefire.  No Minister has told the Provisionals to halt their beatings or else lose recognition or suffer a reduction in status.  What signal did that send to the IRA?</P>
    <P>We also know that the IRA has been testing weapons, staking out targets, training, gathering intelligence, manufacturing mortar and other bombs, moving arms and generally preparing for a resumption of terrorism, but it was impolite and impolitic to insist that this should stop.  What signal did that send to the IRA?</P>
    <P>Democratic parties at the Forum and elsewhere leaned over backwards to accommodate Sinn Féin's sensitivities, but eventually it became clear that Sinn Féin was not in the business of compromise; only in the business of grinding down the patience and forbearance of others.</P>
    <P>Nobody has ever insisted publicly that Gerry Adams or Martin McGuinness should spell out the relationship between Sinn Féin and the IRA.  Few journalists have dwelled on the matter. There is a general feeling that while we should accept that there is some link, it is best not to inquire too closely about whether Sinn Féin is autonomous.  One of the most alarming features of recent days has been the assertion that the Provisionals have got nothing from the peace process.  Let us look at what they <Col N="1401" /> have got: access to the airwaves; access to Governments; the establishment of the Forum; greatly reduced security force activity; return of troops to barracks; major concessions on prisoners; opening of Border roads; dismantling of observation points; visas to the US; access to the White House and the President of the United States; greatly reduced searching; unlimited fundraising; offices in Washington and Brussels and an end to exclusion orders.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at what they have given in return.  They have given: nothing at the Forum; nothing on the principle of consent; no promise to end violence permanently; no decommissioning of weapons; no end to punishment murders and beatings; no end to intimidation and extortion; no guarantee that they would not fire the first shot; no information about missing bodies of their victims; no end to banishments from Northern Ireland; no acceptance of the Mitchell principles; no end to condemnation of others and no condemnation of their own violence. Who is codding whom?</P>
    <P>I have dwelt at sufficient length on the difficulties and obstacles.  If I am to be constructive I must turn to the possibilities and opportunities, even though they have become severely more limited by Friday's barbaric atrocity.  Like Deputy Harney, I have not been convinced of the need for or value of an election.  The down sides of such a course of action in Northern Ireland are obvious and numerous.  The Taoiseach obviously thought so too as recently as Sunday night last when he expressed his implacable opposition in trenchant and colourful terms.  However, I see merit in John Hume's suggestion of a referendum. I have not had time to think this through yet, but a referendum has the merit of allowing the people of Northern Ireland to express straightforward and undiluted democratic views on what should happen, untrammelled by the bitterness and polarisation that is endemic to predictable elections of parties and people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have complained that we are all <Col N="1402" /> jumping to and debating the Sinn Féin agenda.  The great democratic deficit in Northern Ireland is that the simple views and requirements of the vast peace loving majority are sidelined by constant public debate on the demands of the IRA.  A referendum is an opportunity for the large majority in both communities to assert itself in a way that cannot be done there through a normal election, where most of the parties try to outdo one another in garnering votes by promises of no surrender and no compromise.</P>
    <P>The questions will have to be carefully phrased.  As posed originally by Mr. Hume, the questions were of the motherhood and apple pie variety, the answers to which might be meaningless. Carefully chosen, pertinent questions could and would allow a democratic expression of view that should be morally binding on anybody with any pretensions to being a democrat.  A referendum depersonalises the process in the best sense of the word.  It is worth teasing out and should form a part of next week's proposed summit on which preparatory work could usefully be done by officials.</P>
    <P>What is vital at that summit and for the future is that the two Governments should become and remain <i>ad idem.</i> If the movement towards a settlement and a permanent peace is ever to succeed it can only be if it is based on a bedrock of agreement on principles between the Governments and a willingness by both to work out and agree details as they arise.  There is a great deal in common as exemplified in the various agreements and declarations.  The silly ruptures of the last month or so should not be allowed recur.  The degree of communication and trust should be high enough to ensure that the kind of mistakes made by the British Government in the past year on Private Clegg and the Mitchell report are avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>If the Governments have a clear and unambiguous understanding, they can and should invite democratic parties to meet one another for serious dialogue. <Col N="1403" /> If it has to start in different rooms of the same building, so be it.  The only qualification necessary for inclusion should be the acceptance of normal democratic principles.  Anyone who is thus excluded is self-excluded.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity we are having the debate this week.  It is, however, necessary that we as elected representatives convey our views in a coherent and honest manner to the electorate, particularly the many parties and interest groups that are central to the Northern Ireland issue.</P>
      <P>My first reaction last Friday evening to the London bomb was of sorrow, revulsion and frustration: sorrow that a glorious 18 months of peace had come to such a tragic and unnecessary end, revulsion at what the IRA had done to innocent people who had nothing whatever to do with Northern Ireland, its policies or problems, and frustration that when the major players were doing everything possible to foster the peace process, many peace loving people had their hopes dashed cruelly.</P>
      <P>I have nothing but praise for the even-handed way the Taoiseach and Tánaiste carried out their respective duties in terms of the peace process. They have acquitted themselves very well in the most difficult circumstances. It is very difficult to balance the views and aspirations of two diametrically opposed communities, as in Northern Ireland.  It is necessary for a democratically elected Government to send a cast-iron message to the men of violence that they cannot expect full access to Government while they continue their evil ways.  It is not good enough for Gerry Adams to seek immediate access to the Taoiseach and Government Ministers. As a democratically elected leader, the Taoiseach is right to deny him that access.  I will return to that issue later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the memorable day in August 1994 when Sinn Féin and the IRA gave a commitment to turn their face against <Col N="1404" /> violence for good and enter the democratic process as soon as possible, a great burden was lifted from everybody's shoulders.  Immediately after the cessation of violence activities reached frenetic dimensions.  The famous handshake by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, to whom I give great credit for his endeavours on that occasion, with John Hume and Gerry Adams will never be forgotten.  Nobody should underestimate the outstanding contribution John Hume has made to the peace process.  Gerry Adams, in so far as it was possible given his position, was also a major player in the cessation of violence.  It is obvious that he is now on a very sticky wicket.</P>
    <P>For the past five or six months in particular it was obvious to everybody that the peace process was in difficulty, but I doubt if anybody expected a return to violence.  I stress that I hold the IRA totally responsible for what happened in London last Friday, and no amount of clever tactics can explain away that evil deed.  I think those views are shared by every elected representative.</P>
    <P>Looking back at events dispassionately, other who were involved in this process are less than deserving of praise. For instance, I cannot understand why the Unionists, as the major party in Northern Ireland, are so afraid of coming to the negotiating table.  That reluctance displays an inferiority complex and, given their history and numerical strength on the ground, they do not believe they are in a position to enter talks about their future on this island, particularly considering that we had 18 months of peace.</P>
    <P>It cannot go unnoticed in the Unionist community that, while their perception of the ceasefire may have been that it was very shaky, at least the guns were silent.  Given that that community has suffered greatly at the hands of IRA atrocities, it is very short-sighted of them not to enter into dialogue, if only to reiterate their heartfelt views on various matters, which I totally accept. Unfortunately, irrespective of the type of talks that are arranged, be they <Col N="1405" /> direct, proximity or intensive talks, it seems the Unionists are trying to find a way out.</P>
    <P>I put it to Mr. David Trimble in particular, who appears to be a very intelligent and perceptive leader, that if Unionists continue the policy of not giving an inch at any cost they will find themselves without friends anywhere in the world in the not too distant future. I have no trouble accepting that many Unionists are suspicious of talks tilting towards a united Ireland, but most people believe that a united Ireland is a long way off &mdash; I would say, at the end of the rainbow.  I would like to see a united Ireland, but I realistically accept that there are one million Unionists who will not, and cannot be expected to, change their allegiance in the foreseeable future.  Many Nationalists who live and work for a united Ireland now see that scenario as futuristic.  There is an unreal expectation on the part of people in both communities in the North who are aware that they will have to share that part of the island with each other for their lifetime and that of their children. They must know that murder, punishment beatings, knee-capping and blackmail will only make matters worse.</P>
    <P>Peace is a gift from God.  The 18 months respite clearly showed the world that the men of violence can be curbed. The fact that republican interests did not give the peace process more time to develop is a disaster.  Given that we are talking about centuries of distrust of the deepest kind it is too much to expect that everything would be put right in 18 months.  Apportioning blame is a useless pursuit and there is no point trying to decide who is to blame.  I appeal for talks and more talks.</P>
    <P>Given the decision by the British and Irish Governments to appoint former Senator George Mitchell, and his colleagues, to consider the many barriers to the peace process, it is unreal that the British Government favours elections in Northern Ireland as a precondition to talks.  It is obvious to everybody that there has been into shortage of elections in Northern Ireland down the years &mdash;<Col N="1406" /> any student of politics could write the results of elections the day before they are held.  As a democrat, I am not opposed to elections &mdash; we are all aware that they are the principles on which democracy flourishes and they serve a very useful and vital purpose.  I agreed with John Hume when he stated that following an election held in isolation we would end up, predictably, with more or less the same results and a shouting match.</P>
    <P>I found it hard to accept the British Government's view of what Senator Mitchell included in his final report.  It was remiss of the British Government to highlight the question of an election. It must have realised what the reaction to that suggestion would be.</P>
    <P>I am one of the advocated of keeping all lines of communication open to everybody.  I have no problem with Government contacts with Sinn Féin or anyone else who wishes to talk being kept at a certain level.  If we have learned anything during the past 18 months, it is that we must intensify the talks.  It is incumbent on the British and Irish Governments to come together immediately to organise some type of framework, such as the proposed proximity talks.  I was saddened to hear on a news bulletin last night that David Trimble is looking for a good reason for not becoming involved in that type of talks.</P>
    <P>If the IRA has decided to jolt everybody's attention towards what it views as a slow down in the talks process and will renounce violence at this late stage after the terrible atrocity in London last Friday, the bad fracture in the peace process might be healed.  However, if the IRA continues its violence while efforts are being made to secure a permanent peace, it can be taken that it is giving the two fingers sign to both Governments and the other parties in Northern Ireland and will not concern itself with the democratic process.  Every opportunity should be taken to restart the peace process.  We should make it as easy a possible for people who hold <Col N="1407" /> opposite views to come back into the fold.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, many a fine peace process was scuttled because of so-called core principles.  All parties must be given an opportunity to outline their objectives, principles, fears, suspicions and future plans in a non-pressurised atmosphere.  If a combination of proximity talks, an elective process and direct negotiations could be agreed as a package with something for everybody, that direction should be taken immediately.</P>
    <P>The American connection is very important.  The American influence on the United Kingdom is sufficiently strong to ensure that members of the British establishment are made to see matters in a slightly different way.  Anything that Senator Mitchell, President Clinton or anybody else in America can do to assist matters will be welcomed not only by the Irish people but all concerned.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned earlier that one of the terms used in Senator Mitchell's report was the &ldquo;decommissioning of mindsets&rdquo;.  We have become bogged down on the question of the decommissioning of arms.  Like most people, I would like some of the very dangerous weapons to be taken out of circulation. Not many of the arms used in the great conflicts around the world were decommissioned. The IRA will have to decommission its arms, but I do not know at what pace or when that will happen. The decommissioning of mindsets is even more important.  We can talk until we are blue in the face, but the necessary confidence and trust must be built up among people irrespective of where they live and people must be tolerant of others of different views and traditions. If we are unable to engender the necessary type of dialogue to achieve that and there is not the required level of trust and confidence, talk of decommissioning arms will not mean much.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a point which I am sure will echo something that is dear to the hearts of all our people.  For many years <Col N="1408" /> since I became a Member, I have reflected that anything that could be done to stop the dreadful carnage and murder in Northern Ireland would be the best day's work any Irish Government or Oireachtas could achieve. When that day came in August 1994 I genuinely believed that we were on the right road, and we were.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy O'Malley's contribution and it would be difficult to disagree with anything he said.  It will be difficult to have a peace process in Northern Ireland that will be seen to be fair and impartial to all concerned.  That is why it must be inclusive.  I share the revulsion expressed by Deputy O'Malley at what the IRA has done.  I have been a great opponent of its actions through the years, but we must have dialogue and Sinn Féin must be included at certain stages of the process. Matters are now in its hands.  Members of Sinn Féin have said on television that they did not get anything out of the peace process, but I believe they got a good deal out of it.  Everybody got a good deal and that is what a peace process is about.  The IRA must realise that 25 years of the type of activities in which they engaged have not done anything to secure what their political leaders believe is their core principle, a united Ireland.  If anything, it has ensured that the electorate in the Twenty-six Counties see things more realistically than 25 years ago.  We do not hear a clarion cry for a so-called united Ireland as often as we did then because everybody is more realistic.  What we want on this island is peace and harmony where people who hold different views will be allowed space to live their lives and their children and their children's children will be allowed to do the type of things they have grown accustomed to, as they believe they are entitled and as their traditions would demand.</P>
    <P>Many people will say this is only a talking shop, but it is important that Members record where they stand on this issue.  The next 14 days will be very important.  I hope we will get back on <Col N="1409" /> the right track and that we will have an Ireland of which we can all be proud.  I sincerely hope that in the next few days the men of violence will want to say they have had enough and they will not return to the path of violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the peace process, the situation in Northern Ireland and the relationships between the Irish and British Governments and the Northern parties.</P>
      <P>A debate in this House on the matter was long overdue as Members should regularly have the opportunity to articulate their views, impressions and ideas on what is the most important issue facing Parliament.</P>
      <P>In the spirit of my party leader yesterday, we must be self-critical in relation to the progress of the peace progress. We must learn from our experiences over the last 17 months and see how we can apply those lessons to restoring the peace process and bringing about final and permanent peace to our country.</P>
      <P>With my party leader and colleagues, I offer my sincere sympathy to the bereaved and those injured in the London bombing.  The IRA bears total and sole responsibility for that action and there can be no excuses for it.  We, in this House, are of the view that violence is not justifiable in the pursuit of political objectives.  With the cessation of violence over 17 months ago by the Provisional IRA, it was our view and hope that it, too, had come to the conclusion that the Northern Ireland conflict could best be resolved by democratic means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should try to understand the dynamic behind that cessation of violence, the process which led to it and the peace process itself.  We should try to understand the motivations of all the parties involved in that decision.  I do not accept Deputy O'Malley's analysis of the Provisional IRA and its relationship with Sinn Féin.  Any analysis of the Northern situation over the last 25 years will have discerned clearly a significant evolution of thought within the republican movement over that period. <Col N="1410" /> Granted, it has been slow, tortuous and snail-like but there have been perceptible changes in that movement's approach to the issue and in its progression of thought, culminating in the decision 17 months ago to announce the ceasefire.  There was a view, critical to the announcement, which Sinn Féin articulated and believed at the time, that there was a Nationalist consensus; that with the Irish Government, the SDLP and support from Irish Americans and President Clinton considerable pressure could be brought to bear to move the process forward and resolve it through political dialogue.</P>
    <P>There was also a considerable evolution of thought within the British Government and from the British establishment, beginning with the Brooke initiative and Peter Brooke's declaration that Britain no longer had any selfish or strategic aim in Ireland, that it would facilitate agreement by consent and a united Ireland, for example, if a majority in the North wished it.</P>
    <P>There was considerable movement all round on the peace process prior to the cessation of violence but the momentum slowed down incredibly from the beginning of last year.  The Framework Document, which was published in February 1995, was a natural follow on from the Downing Street Declaration.  It was a significant document signed by both Governments which was basically a framework for agreement between the parties in Northern Ireland; a defined suggested framework for resolving the relationship between North and South, its constitutional implications and the creation of North-South bodies.  It also dealt with the third strand, the relationship between the British and Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document was left on the shelf and the Taoiseach did not pursue it pro-actively.  I can recall Question Time on numerous occasions when my party leader put questions, such as &ldquo;Where stands the Framework Document?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What progress is being made on the Framework Document and the proposals therein?&rdquo;.  Clearly, that <Col N="1411" /> document was downgraded in status over a period and presented as just one of a number of documents.  That was a significant mistake.  I accept the sincerity of all involved, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others, but we must learn lessons and analyse what went wrong along the way and well in advance of any bombing in London.</P>
    <P>In March 1995, the decommissioning issue grew in status when the Taoiseach indicated he favoured the decommissioning process, particularly in conjunction with Washington Three as presented by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew. Again, that was an error.  Too much effort has gone into this whole decommissioning question and it was used fundamentally as an obstacle and a stalling process to prevent people having a deal with the critical issue, which was the convening of all-party round table talks, which is what should have happened early on in this particular process.  If one compares that with what happened in South Africa, the Middle East or other conflicts no one lost time in moving those processes forward and the protagonists involved moved quickly to keep the momentum and the dynamic going. The decommissioning row, which has taken a full year to address and which has still not been dealt with, was the first major stalling issue.  At the time, the Irish Government opened the door too much for the British Government and allowed it to make decommissioning the critical issue it has now become.</P>
    <P>We lost much time from May, June and July onwards and I understand that Government officials during those months were working towards a summit but little progress was made.  Then, of course, came the collapse of the summit which both Governments had agreed to hold in September.  We had that critical weekend when there was talk of crisis, blood on the streets, etc., and the Taoiseach stated the summit could not go ahead.  The critical issue was that it illustrated a significant breakdown in <Col N="1412" /> relationships between the Irish and British Governments.  A key element of the peace process and, the handling of Anglo-Irish relationships throughout the 1980s and right up to the present has been that both Governments were on the one track, meant to resolve their mutual difficulties, planned various summits and agreed a procedure.  There was much recrimination surrounding the fact that the summit did not take place.  The souring of relationships at that juncture was not helpful to the process. The lesson to be learned is that relationships must be restored between both Governments and it is essential, if the process is again to gather momentum or be restored, that both Governments get rid of the megaphone diplomacy and start meeting, talking and giving leadership on a joint basis.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the importance of the Nationalist consensus and, in particular, the republican perception that it was important.  A major error was made in October last year when the Taoiseach decided not to meet John Hume and Gerry Adams together in Government Buildings.  The Hume-Adams initiative was one of the major fundamental factors in bringing about the peace process, people talked of the Hume-Adams strategy and their relationship was an important one.  If they wanted to meet the Taoiseach at that particular time, they should have been facilitated.  After all, they had numerous joint meetings with Deputy Albert Reynolds, as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>For example, the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, has no difficulty &mdash; nor would I &mdash; meeting the leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party at any time. He will meet Mr. David Trimble and Dr. Ian Paisley together and has met Mr. James Molyneaux and Dr. Paisley. The signal sent to the republican movement arising from the decision not to facilitate a proposed meeting was a very negative one which should not have been taken.  Mr. John Hume was very angry at that decision, describing it as harmful and not at all helpful to the <Col N="1413" /> peace process.  Certainly, it undermined Gerry Adams's position in the republican movement.</P>
    <P>November 1995 was another month when very little progress was made until the meeting between the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister before the arrival of President Clinton after which a joint communiqué was issued.  Events leading up to that communiqué were interesting.  At approximately 6 p.m. on that evening RTE more or less signalled there would not be a meeting, that there was no agreement.  However, by 8 p.m. both leaders had been on the telephone and, by 11 p.m., we saw them on our television screens commenting on their joint communiqué.  Mistakes were made then also.  The lesson to be learned is that we should not allow ourselves be pressurised into making late night, eleventh-hour agreements involving concessions.</P>
    <P>Included in that communiqué were two harmful concessions.  Even though the proposal that former American Senator Mitchell should meet all parties, develop the decommissioning issue and so on had been mooted, it was accepted that that November communiqué would not be binding on the British Government, that Washington 3 remained intact.  Essentially, the British reserved the right to dismiss the Mitchell report in favour of Washington 3.  That was a mistake.  The other was that the joint communiqué signed on behalf of both Governments introduced the concept of an elective assembly and the role that might play in the decommissioning process. We opened the door too widely for that concept to gain credence and those late night concessions should not have been made.  While acknowledging all the pressures there were on both Governments to hammer out an agreement in the advent of President Clinton's visit, we must learn from that experience.  The concept of an elected assembly, the manner in which it was proposed and gained credence in Westminster among all political parties there bearing in mind the electoral position unfolding there, was very negative. <Col N="1414" /> The old Orange card has been deployed very effectively in Westminster.</P>
    <P>We all know the difficulties elective processes entail for Northern Ireland, the type of hardline mandates people seek, and very often win, which tend to prohibit them thereafter from being flexible.  I can foresee Unionist leaders going to their electorate seeking a mandate not to negotiate with anybody.  The language of Unionist leaders in recent months and weeks has been very regrettable. It was exemplified by a remark to the effect that the most detested politician in Northern Ireland is Dick Spring.  That is most depressing particularly when one remembers that, in the course of the Peter Brooke initiative in 1992, Unionists met Irish Government representatives.  Is that how far we have travelled, that all they can do is heap personal abuse on the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs who, to his credit, has made a great commitment and sincere efforts to resolve the impasse.  That type of language from Unionist quarters was very unhelpful.</P>
    <P>At the time of the November communiqué it was asked whether we had merely moved the impasse further down the road.  I think my party leader said so at the time.  To his credit, former US Senator George Mitchell did a great deal of work from November to January but his report was ditched in no uncertain manner by the British Prime Minister on the day of its publication.  While he subsequently endeavoured to retrieve it, the signal he sent out was the wrong one sent in a very shabby, unhelpful manner.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell report was a very good one, its six principles having found agreement on all sides of this House. My party contends it can continue to form the basis for the restoration and continuation of the peace process.  My party believes former Senator Mitchell should be invited back as a peace envoy or as an individual who, with credibility, could engage all parties in working towards a resolution of this conflict.  He is neutral, has gained the respect of all involved in the process and, through his <Col N="1415" /> talks with the various parties on the decommissioning issue, has gained considerable insight into the minds of all those involved in this process.  My party strongly believes that George Mitchell still has an important role to play in this process.</P>
    <P>It is equally clear the IRA should be asked what they are now fighting for. Why, in the name of God, did they have to plant a bomb in Canary Wharf, killing two people and injuring others?  If one reads any of its political dialogue or position papers, one realise there has been a considerable movement forward. We are now literally down to semantics, splitting hairs within the concept of selfdetermination and so on.  Nobody can credibly argue that our present position warrants spilling a drop of blood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>What of Éamon de Valera?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting analogy.  I listened to Deputy O'Malley's comments on the relationship between Sinn Féin and the IRA.  That party would do well to reread what happened in the 1920s, as I have done. I do not accept the black and white argument that they are all the one.  Any movement will encounter tensions, caused by people with varying positions in it.  In any movement like that of Sinn Féin-IRA there will be what people might loosely call the civil and military wings.  I recall coming across correspondence, from about 1923 in the height of our bloody Civil War, when Éamon de Valera wrote to Liam Lynch about some atrocities committed at that time. He threatened to resign as President of Sinn Féin if he did not gain some insight into and knowledge of what the military wing were up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eventually Éamon de Valera effectively and successfully moulded a political process from the Third Sinn Féin party and the anti-Treaty side, but he did not do it immediately.  He entered Dáil Éireann in 1927 and &mdash; from the documentation I have read of events <Col N="1416" /> during that period &mdash; had been working on it from about 1923 onwards.  When he became a Member of this House he lost half his parliamentary party but built it up again in subsequent elections. Any reading of events of that period gives some insight into the dynamic between a military and civil wing of any movement, the jockeying for power and influence that takes place and the way the whole process can evolve.  Eventually a process evolved in the South to allow full participation in parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>The same can happen in the Northern conflict, which is where I differ somewhat from Deputy Desmond O'Malley's analysis.  We should not give up hope.  If people are still in a position to persuade the men of violence that dialogue and democracy represent a better opportunity, we should encourage and facilitate them in their endeavours to retrieve the process.</P>
    <P>I have made these comments, not to criticise any of those involved but merely to emphasise that we all need to be critical of our roles in the overall process. We should learn from our mistakes and apply the lessons learned to the position evolving, redoubling our efforts to save this very precious peace process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute.  We all regret that this interesting debate could not have taken place in different circumstances. Substantial contributions have been made by the Taoiseach and the leader of the Opposition and much of the ground has already been covered. I hope that what I have to add will be helpful.  Some of the insights drawn from my visits to republican prisoners and the relationships built up with them and their families would offer the most fruitful addition to the debate.  In attempting to do this in the wake of the bombing last Friday I, like other speakers, walk a delicate line between seeking to help understanding and avoiding condoning violence.  I share the view of Deputy Albert Reynolds that if talks <Col N="1417" /> with anyone can stop the killing, they should continue.  Having got to know some of these people and their families, through correspondence as well as meetings, one cannot close the door overnight.  Robert Emmet said that once a new thought has entered your mind, you are changed forever.  Only further expansion can come from that.</P>
      <P>John Hume, whose actions were questioned by members of my party during the process which led to the ceasefire, proved that talks and communications can be valuable and risks may be worth taking for a very important outcome.  Countless negotiations in world conflicts have proved this.</P>
      <P>I agree with the analysis that the opposite policy of isolation of the IRA and Sinn Féin, which is a simple and highly moral policy to maintain in times of conflict, yielded only sterility and more violence.  I have grave doubts about a rapid rush back to that isolationist policy, although I understand the difficulties of leaders.  I welcome the doors left open by the Taoiseach, who would have my support in going as far as possible on that.  I welcome the American position on contact with Gerry Adams.  It is helpful because their perspective is a more distant and less personal one than that on these islands. I welcome also &mdash; unlike some of my colleagues &mdash; the intervention of Deputy Albert Reynolds.  He has a unique background in the peace process and all contacts at this time are valuable and should be brought into play.  I will also continue to use my contacts with the broader republican family to strengthen the men and women of peace in those organisations to return to the path of peace.  There is a very strong lobby for peace within the movement.  It cannot carry the whole movement with it at all times and we as politicians can help improve the environment to win the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that my journey to this unusual position for a traditional Fine Gael Deputy contrasts with that of my constituency colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, <Col N="1418" /> whose position became an issue of debate.  I heard him defend it last night in his customary strong and determined way.  From his youthful republicanism he has exhibited the zeal of a convert in his current anti-Sinn Féin views.  Zealots are never attractive.  His zealotry may be inhibiting him from exhibiting the intelligence, integrity and consistency which I respect in him in the constituency and his work as a politician.  It may be that he is missing the wood for the trees and not giving the process the benefit of his many talents.  Perhaps he should listen openly to some of the comments made and consider using his undoubted talents in a more constructive way.</P>
    <P>Some 18 months ago, with no personal knowledge, I watched events unfold.  I was fascinated by the Hume-Adams process and the Government process which yielded such a fantastic result.  I learned from my reflections. When the opportunity arose to become part of the Fine Gael delegation I welcomed it because we were a year into the peace process and there was evidence of a substantial slowing down in the process over the summer months.</P>
    <P>There had been difficulties in arranging the summit and arguments over decommissioning &mdash; an unwise precondition &mdash; which my side of the House toyed with for a while as being a valid argument but one which proved to be a major stumbling block for so long.  In our efforts to do what could be done in the atmosphere of the ceasefire I was glad to participate in the visits to republican prisoners.  On our first visit, one year into the ceasefire, we were stunned to find that conditions had deteriorated, not improved.  We suffered the stress of a closed visit to Michael Ryan who was on a dirty protest at the time.  We agreed with the analysis of Gareth Pierse, the lawyer representing the prisoners, that their treatment was deeply provocative, in relation to transfers, education, visits, phone calls and medical needs.  Prisoners talked about treating Paddy Kelly's cancer themselves by applying pain killing remedies, even though <Col N="1419" /> trained prison medical personnel ignored and neglected his condition. The list of humiliations was endless, although we were one year into the ceasefire.  We concluded that there were two possible reasons &mdash; that at least one section of the United Kingdom establishment was still waging war, not peace, or, at best, that prisoners were being used as a pawn in the peace process. During that period Michael Mates went public with his solo suggestion that there should be a return to a short sharp war to sort out the position.  It was certainly a solo run but it caused great concern.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the prisoners, their families and the IRA had reached their own conclusions about the commitment and intentions of the British Government in the context of the peace process. From many of the signs and signals and looking back over reports on those visits it is clear that the Clinton visit only bought a little more time.  I am attempting to analyse the reason these men with a long tradition of violence and a lifetime of involvement in the violent struggle, having been won over to peace, having made that huge gamble and initiated what they and all had hoped would be a permanent ceasefire, were willing to return to war.  It was to be another five to six months before the ceasefire was broken when there was still hope after the Clinton visit and the Mitchell report.</P>
    <P>Over the visits I would have met 17 of the 25 prisoners in the UK at the time.  They are not the kind of people I met in Mountjoy Prison which I had reason to visit in my political work.  As one relative whose two brothers were in Long Kesh said, they would never have seen the inside of a prison but for the troubles.  The visits have meant the families have been in touch more often with me and the other members of the delegation and the Labour Party delegation. One can thus get a broader picture of how they perceived the last year and how unrest among republicans generally increased as time went by.  Not <Col N="1420" /> only did nothing happen, conditions for the prisoners got worse.</P>
    <P>This morning I met the partner of one of the prisoners who also has two brothers involved in one way or another, and she told me about the situation in County Tyrone around Coalisland and Dungannon.  Talk of peace dividends and tourism booms as the year went on stuck in the craws of communities who were still searched when they went to visit prisoners, still subjected to random searches in their own homes and had little hope for a change in their circumstances.</P>
    <P>In attempting to move the situation forward it is important to understand those involves.  Deputy Bertie Ahern referred yesterday to the tortuous thinking of the republicans and Deputy Martin also mentioned it.  It is easy to take the high moral ground and forget our own history.  It was the tortuous idea of when is an oath not an oath which led to our civil war.  If we look deeply we may still have an understanding of how such matters can become a reason to go to war for people in some situations.  I was in a pub last night and wondered if anybody can now go into a pub and know they will leave it.  Such is the awfulness of what faces us.</P>
    <P>We must always remember the victims of last Friday night.  However, some of those who have perpetrated such crimes have also given their lives.  My second prison visit involved attending the reviews of three of the five life sentenced prisoners.  Three of them were my age but they had already served 21 years in jail.  If they had families they had grown up without them.  Some of them had not had the chance to start families because they went to prison at the age of 17 to 21 years.  Many of them have given a lifetime, and they and their families are also victims.  I am encouraged from my meeting that many of them have grown and changed during their periods in jail and this is evidenced by the thinking within Sinn Féin Although it may seem extraordinary <Col N="1421" /> after last Friday's events, there is a great willingness to try the path of peace.</P>
    <P>When the ceasefire was declared there was a strong minority within the republican movement who did not support it, who did not believe it could be effective and that politics could deliver. They were held as long as possible but, ultimately, some elements returned to acts of violence.  The context in which that occurred was the failure of the political process to deliver, and that is our great challenge.  In assessing our ability to deliver questions remain about what the British authorities were doing in regard to prisoners over the last year. What is the explanation for their attitudes?</P>
    <P>As the leader of the Opposition said yesterday, there was an opportunity to make concessions in relation to prisoners which could have created a better climate of understanding.  It was one area in which the Unionists were willing to move.  Policy in this area was directed by those in the British Home Office.  What were they doing?  I put this question to them directly at meetings. We asked them if they realised they were undermining the ceasefire.  In our reports we noted that on our first visit we indicated that their policy had the potential to destabilise the process and the second time we told them it was destabilising it.</P>
    <P>In accessing whether we can deliver politically we have to be sure of the bona fides of all the political forces involved.  The British Home Office may suggest it never believed the ceasefire was genuine and has been proved right. We argued the point when we met the governors of prisons and Home Office officials.  We were never granted a direct meeting with the junior Minister in the Home Office but wrote to argue that movement on their part could help. However, we got little satisfaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> In the last year I also had the opportunity of being involved in a unique bridge building experience with the Unionists with the national prayer breakfast.  The isolation of the Unionists from the rest of the country is a real problem.  The national prayer breakfast involved 300 people from business, politics and religious life.  Many of those present were senior figures in public life in Northern Ireland and meeting Irish parliamentarians for the first time.  It highlighted the need to build bridges and have communication at all levels.</P>
    <P>A feature republicans and Unionists have in common is a tendency to say what they mean; a directness which is refreshing.  Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have said they cannot go back to the IRA unless they have something to offer.  That &ldquo;something&rdquo; is all-party talks, which we have been trying to achieve for the last year.  Last Friday's events have made that objective more difficult but it remains the challenge for us as politicians.  All proposals &mdash; the referendum and the elections included &mdash; must be analysed urgently in that context if we are to seize the opportunity for peace.  I retain a sense of pessimism because I question whether the political willingness is there on the part of the British and Unionists to make the progress needed.  If that willingness is there and imagination and skill are shown on our part the peace can be retrieved and again enjoyed.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy McGahon has joined us in the Chamber. This is one of the few areas of national life in which we have often found ourselves in profound disagreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the assertion of British Ministers that it was a lack of confidence in the permanence of the ceasefire which caused them to require decommissioning and prevented them from entering into negotiations with Sinn Féin.  The British Government regarded the ceasefire as permanent and felt that there was no longer any <Col N="1423" /> reason for it to pay much heed to the views or expectations of Nationalists or republicans.</P>
    <P>For 50 years Northern Ireland was a political slum.  The British Government knew that there was discrimination, injustice and state sectarianism.  This would not have been acceptable anywhere else in the United Kingdom, but it did nothing about it.  It tolerated what was happening as it was easier to turn a blind eye to genuine Nationalist grievances than to stand up to Unionist bigots who have always been willing to oppose the will of the majority in the United Kingdom to which they profess allegiance.  It was only when the civil rights movement turned the spotlight on Northern Ireland and the bloody suppression of civil protest became an international issue that the British Government reacted, but it left it too late.  By then the troubles had respawned the IRA and this country was condemned to the violence we endured for a quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>It is not alone ironic but deeply informative to note that the British Government met, negotiated and had official contacts with the IRA during its campaign of violence.  What, therefore, are we to make of the quibbling and cavilling engaged in by the British Government about meeting not with the IRA but Sinn Féin after the ceasefire was achieved?</P>
    <P>During the campaign of violence financial and political expediency dictated that the British Government should endeavour to halt it even at the risk of offending the Unionists.  One can still recall the dramatic exchanges in the House of Commons when the leader of the DUP stormed out having accused the British Prime Minister of lying over the contacts between the British Government and the IRA.</P>
    <P>When the ceasefire was announced the balance of expediency shifted and for the past 18 months the entire efforts of the British Government have been confined to placating and appeasing the Unionists.  It is no coincidence that the <Col N="1424" /> parliamentary arithmetic at Westminster has increasingly made the British Government hostage to Unionist demands.  The tragedy is that, believing there was no risk of a resumption of IRA violence, the British Government ignored its obligations to the Nationalist population and consistently reneged on its commitments under successive Anglo-Irish agreements.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that one must evaluate the IRA's decision to plant last week's bomb.  As a constitutional politician, I deplore the planting of the bomb and, especially, the killing and maiming of innocent civilians. On the other hand, we should have learned by now that the politics of condemnation do not bring peace.  For 25 years the IRA was routinely condemned. Its guns finally fell silent when it was persuaded that violence could not produce a lasting or just peace and that the path of negotiations offered a better way.  Although the guns fell silent there were no negotiations.  The irony is that it would appear that last week's bomb was planted with the aim of expediting the negotiations which the IRA had been persuaded offered a better alternative to violence.</P>
    <P>The danger is that we have now become trapped in a vicious circle. Those who oppose negotiations with Sinn Féin can claim that the Canary Wharf bombing shows that one cannot engage in negotiations with persons still capable of reverting to such acts of violence. On the other hand, given the way the British Government obstructed the path to negotiations prior to the bombing, the risk is that if it is now seen to behave more responsibly this change will be seen by some in the IRA as resulting from and justifying the bombing in Canary Wharf.  The current situation is fraught with risk.  There are, however, a number of self-evident truisms which should govern how we proceed.</P>
    <P>The history of Irish nationalism this century has been one of compromise. When the democratically elected parliament of the United Kingdom voted for <Col N="1425" /> Home Rule in 1912 unionism said no. The first Irish rebels against British rule in this country this century were the so-called loyalists.  The response of Unionists to the most modest of proposals for non-sectarian policing in the new Northern Ireland state was to unleash the bloodiest of pogroms against the defenceless Nationalist population.  The Unionists have said no ever since to every proposed reform, peace initiative and suggestions that the resolution of conflicts of this type requires compromise on both sides.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Unionists cannot be coerced.  The British Government has even declined to attempt to persuade them to compromise or talk about compromise, yet, it is as clear as day that without persuasion or the pressure which a democratically elected Government is always entitled to bring to bear on a recalcitrant minority the Unionists will continue to block any proposal which does not give them everything they want.  It should be remembered that it was through a combination of persuasion and coercion the Government prevailed on the IRA to halt its campaign.  We are entitled to expect a similar commitment and effort on the part of the British Government.</P>
    <P>The concept of an election in Northern Ireland at this time is intended to reinforce unionism's rejection of any compromise and it is unbelievable that the British Government or anybody else could take it seriously.  The Ulster Unionist Party first called for an election. On what platform would it seek electoral support?  Would it be on the basis of seeking a mandate to enter negotiations with Sinn Féin or for compromise and reconciliation?  The answer is no; Unionist and loyalist politicians would vie with each other to put the most uncompromising platform before the electorate.  Are we to take seriously the suggestion that once given a mandate for no compromise they would be expected to turn around and immediately repudiate their electoral commitments and that mandate?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> It is clear that an election at this time, far from facilitating dialogue and reconciliation, would only underpin and reinforce the negative basis on which unionism has approached the peace process. I have heard Unionist politicians and the British Prime Minister ask rhetorically how any democrat can oppose the holding of an election at any time.  I pay Mr. Trimble the compliment of believing that he is being capricious, not stupid.</P>
    <P>By way of analogy, in 1921 an Irish delegation signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty which contained such negative features from a Nationalist point of view as partition, the oath of allegiance, the denial of sovereignty and so on.  Nevertheless, Dáil Éireann voted to accept it and this decision was subsequently ratified by the people in the general election that followed.  What would the position have been if the Irish delegation had been selected on the basis of an election held just before the treaty negotiations?</P>

      <P>How many candidates would have stood on the platform advocating a settlement such as the treaty, let alone been elected on such a platform? What later became known as the republican view would have overwhelmingly prevailed.  What would have been the result?  If, with the benefit of hindsight, one accepts that the establishment of the Irish Free State by Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins and its subsequent development into a sovereign State by Eamon de Valera were good and worthwhile achievements, the danger of an election at this time is self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a more recent context, would the calling of an election North or South immediately after Bloody Sunday in 1972 have been a useful exercise in democracy?  Elections are central to the democratic process but their timing must take account of the emotions and problems of the day.  Any elections now would, to quote the Taoiseach, &ldquo;only <Col N="1427" /> have the effect of pouring petrol onto a fire&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The third issue I wish to raise concerns the decision of our Government not to speak at ministerial level with Sinn Féin.  If I correctly understand the Taoiseach's position, before ministerial meetings take place with Sinn Féin, it will be necessary for it to, not only call on the IRA to restore the ceasefire, but to prevail on it to do so.  Is that approach logical or correct?  I have heard the Taoiseach's reasons for not having ministerial contacts with Sinn Féin and while many of them are valid, the same arguments could be applied to contacts at official level, yet at least one such contact is being allowed.  Are we at risk of engaging in the type of hair splitting exercise for which we have correctly criticised the British Government?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's experience, when in Government, of dealing with Gerry Adams causes me to believe he is genuinely committed to the peace process. Equally, it is obvious there are others in the republican movement who are less committed than he to that process.  It would be very foolish to respond in such a way that would undermine the position of those in the republican movement with whom experience shows it is possible to deal.  Nor should our natural revulsion at what happened at Canary Wharf or our desire to dissociate ourselves from such action cause us to dilute the responsibility the British Government bears for the crisis confronting us.</P>
    <P>It was obvious before and after the ceasefire announced in August 1994 that in general the only people on this island who did any real thinking about the development of Irish political life, Nationalism and republicanism were members of Sinn Féin.  The majority of people, opinion leaders, commentators and politicians were more or less programmed to condemning atrocities whenever they occurred.  This was the general way of thinking as violence on the island became the norm.  The shock <Col N="1428" /> of the ceasefire was beyond the mind capabilities of many politicians and opinion makers, particularly those in the South.  One might have expected this across the water, but many people here had great difficulty comprehending what had happened.  New speeches had to be drafted and some people were not capable of changing their thought processes. However, to their credit, some people who had strong views prior to the ceasefire changed their thinking, but the majority of us were locked in a scenario.</P>
    <P>There is ambivalence among most Irish people about the use of physical force to achieve political aims</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy McGahon that there is a level of schizophrenia about the use of physical force on this island to achieve political aims. While it may not be popular to say so, I have always maintained there are two sides to my brain, one which logically abhors the use of force and the other which, given our background, understands it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is part of our problem, to deny that it exists presents another problem.  In fairness, Deputy McGahon has consistently abhorred the use of force to bring about political aims.  He has a more consistent view in this regard than any other Member of the House and referred to the schizophrenia that exists.  However, we cannot ignore our history and try to wipe out, in 70 or 80 years, what took place for hundreds of years.  I envy those who can <Col N="1429" /> do so.  Some Members were recently party to, or members of, organisations which gave credence to physical force and have been able to change their mindset.  They now preach the zealotry of the other side.  I wish I was able to do likewise, but in saying so I am not casting any criticism.  Some people, both inside and outside the House, have been very successful in that regard.</P>
      <P>Having studied our history in some depth, there has not been a majority of people in favour of the use of physical force on this island during any decade this century, including the years prior to 1916 and up to the 1930s.  I am sure I could safely say there was never a majority of people on this island who favoured the use of force to achieve political aims.  While most people were proud of what happened in the 1920s, they did not favour the use of physical force.  However, that is not to deny a large element of the population believed in force to achieve political aims.</P>
      <P>The road to politics for most parties in this House has been tortuous, born out of the gun and violence.  The antecedents of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Democratic Left believed in the use of force.  Why should we, therefore, deny others the opportunity to travel the same path?  I have paid tribute to the late W.T. Cosgrave, probably the most under-sung hero since the birth of this State, for allowing Fianna Fáil to enter this House without sticking to the letter of the law.  The late Mr. Cosgrave had many great achievements but his greatest was allowing the transfer of power in the early 1930s to Fianna Fáil which, less than a decade earlier, was using force against the institutions of the State.  Of all the people written about in Irish history, W.T. Cosgrave ranks with anybody else this century for the course he took at that time.  Why would some politicians in this House and opinion writers deny to others the opportunity to travel the road from which they came?  I cannot understand that element of their argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gerry Adams and others in Sinn Féin <Col N="1430" /> are sincere when they say they have turned their backs on violence but there is an element in the republican movement which is of the view that they are making a mistake.  Irish nationalism lost approximately 45 per cent of its followers when it took the constitutional road.  A civil war was fought in the 1920s on that very point.  Fianna Fáil was formed and when it entered democratic politics it lost a fair element of its support. That happened again at the end of the 1960s with the establishment of Sinn Féin.  There is little point in condemning Gerry Adams outright, placing impossible demands on him just to make all of us feel happy if 45 per cent of the people we want to bring in are left outside the door.</P>

      <P>That attitude has got us nowhere.  It is easy for me as a member of Fianna Fáil to condemn last Friday night's atrocity.  If Gerry Adams also condemned it we in this House would cheer him but a considerable element of the republican movement would desert him and he would then be of little use.</P>
      <P>I hope and pray that the progress made prior to and following August 1994 will soon continue and that we will be in a position to welcome all the parties on this island into the constitutional process.  The ordinary people, North and South, are way ahead of the politicians in this regard.  They want to see people talking together and are not interested in the nitty-gritty.  The sooner that day comes, the better.</P>

      <P>Few of us will forget where we were or what we were doing when we heard the chilling statement from the IRA last Friday night <Col N="1431" /> accompanied by the news that a bomb had been detonated in Canary Wharf. We had begun to take peace for granted and perhaps we had become too accustomed to hearing good news about investment, growth in tourism, cross-Border contacts and all the other beneficial aspects of the peace process.  We may also have forgotten the deep sense of shame which overtakes us when we hear that yet more innocent lives have been taken in our name.  We had forgotten also the sense of trepidation with which we listened to news bulletins, wondering what new atrocity would flicker across our television screens.</P>
      <P>Last Friday we were reminded that peace cannot be taken for granted.  We were reminded also that when politicians fail, or are seen to fail, the gunmen take over.  War is the ultimate failure of politics but war is also the first refuge of those for whom compromise means too much giving, talking means too much delay and democracy means too much uncertainty.</P>
      <P>We must be quite clear that those who seek to achieve their aims through the barrel of a gun or the detonator of a bomb cannot be allowed to call themselves democrats.  Part-time democracy is not an option.  The word &ldquo;frustration&rdquo; has been bandied about inside and outside this House in recent days.  There is no doubt that democratic politics can be frustrating.  The path to dialogue is often tortuous and it is strewn with obstacles.  It meanders towards its object rather than travelling in a straight line; all of those involved have to compromise.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, the IRA sought to relieve its frustration with a bomb.  In so doing, it has merely increased the frustration felt by those on all sides who are slowly working for peace.  Restoring the ceasefire will not eliminate the frustration; on the contrary, there will be many months of frustration before the final goal of peace has been achieved. That is the nature of democratic politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of those commenting on the peace process have drawn comparisons <Col N="1432" /> with the peace process in play in South Africa.  No two countries or two peace processes are analogous but the republican movement might do well to reflect on the words of President Nelson Mandela in concluding his autobiography, <i>Long Walk to Freedom</i>, when he states; &ldquo;I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb&rdquo;.  We must ensure that each hill in the peace process &mdash; and there will be many &mdash; is not marked by more violence on the part of those for whom democracy is too arduous a climb.</P>
    <P>We must send forth two messages from this House, the first being that violence as a means of achieving political aims is totally unjustifiable and unacceptable.  Let there be no equivocation about that issue and, above all, let us not blame last Friday's atrocity on the slowness of the British Government or the action or inaction of any democratic party.  One of the cornerstones of democracy is responsibility.  The IRA, and nobody else, bears the sole responsibility for the bomb which murdered two people and injured more than 100.  I share the disappointment felt by many at the slowness of the British Government and others to respond to the imperative of the peace process. There is a need for compromise and movement on all sides and all parties to the peace process must be prepared to abandon previously fixed positions if we are to move forward.</P>
    <P>The second message that must go out from this House is that the IRA does not kill in our name or in the name of our children.  Its actions are repugnant to us.  It claims to act on our behalf but it dishonours each and every one of us by its actions.  Last night the Taoiseach spoke simply and movingly of the two men murdered by the IRA.  He spoke of the ordinary lives ended by an extraordinary event.  Let us also speak of the lives which were not ended but which have been forever altered &mdash; the grieving families and those who have been permanently maimed.  What we say here today cannot restore those lives.  The <Col N="1433" /> greatest tribute we can pay to them collectively is to look forward and ensure that last Friday's atrocity was the last of its kind.</P>
    <P>The peace process can recover.  One can already detect a new impetus towards finding a way out of the current impasse despite, and not because of, the Canary Wharf slaughter.  The wish for peace among all of the people on these islands is far too strong to be blown off course by an IRA bomb.  Those within the republican movement who want the peace process to continue must reassert themselves.  In that they will have both the moral and the practical support not only of the Irish Government but of all democratic parties on these islands.  An immediate restoration of the ceasefire and an unequivocal commitment to the democratic path is the only possible way forward.  The Irish Government's decision not to engage in formal discussions with Sinn Féin until the ceasefire has been restored was the only possible decision in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government and everyone on this island has a responsibility to uphold democracy and ensure that the lines between democratic politics and the politics of violence are not blurred. However, that does not mean the door has been closed on Sinn Féin; on the contrary the door is open to it to come in from the cold into which last Friday's bomb propelled it, to affirm its exclusive commitment to democractic politics and to persuade the IRA to embrace the path of peace.  In recent days we heard statements to the effect that Sinn Féin has no message to take back to the IRA. The people of Ireland are sending the republican movement the very clear message that it should stop the killing for good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to many of the predictable contributions yesterday and today, I found Deputy Byrne's speech very refreshing.  Some speeches were sincere but predictable in that after the ritual condemnation came the &ldquo;buts&rdquo;&mdash; the ambivalence of the schizophrenia to which Deputy <Col N="1434" /> McCreevy referred &mdash; blaming the Brits. This is a national pastime and when we take part in it we join the IRA in its claims.  There is a unique mentality, a kind of reverse responsibility, prevalent in the North, that the planting of a bomb is somebody else's responsibility. As Deputy Byrne stated emphatically, the people who bear the responsibility for last Friday's tragedy are undoubtedly the murderers who have besmirched Ireland's name for the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>My speech will be somewhat different from those already delivered.  Like everyone else I hope that some day &mdash; no Member of this Assembly will live to see it &mdash; this country will be united through peaceful means.  This can only happen when the Unionists realise they have more in common with us, knock on our door and ask to join us.  I have grave reservations about the Anglo-Irish Agreement, laudable though it seemed at the time, and I am deeply concerned that the Irish Government has meddled too much in the affairs of Northern Ireland over the past ten years.  That is the perception of one million Protestants and it is one of the reasons for their intransigence and repeated slogan of &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;. They do not want to join us and will not get into bed with us at gunpoint.  Will the penny ever drop in the South that they want to remain British and have the right to do so, as acknowledged by every democratic party in the State? The perception among Unionists is that they will be deserted by the British and forced into a united Ireland.  There is no doubt that the British want to get out of the North and would do so tonight.  I do not trust them in this regard but I want them to stay in the North until a rational solution is arrived at and they are told by the Unionists to leave.  Otherwise the threat of a civil war will undoubtedly hang over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planting of the bomb last Friday night was the result of the appeasement policies pursued by the British and Irish Governments who could not find an acceptable way to deal with terrorism. <Col N="1435" /> Some people have referred to the &ldquo;war&rdquo;.  Terrorists do not wage a war. They are despicable vermin who plant bombs in pubs and under cars and shoot people in the back.  They do not wear uniforms, they wear balaclavas.  These people have been very evident in the North over the past 17 months.</P>
    <P>When the ceasefire was announced I warned amid the euphoria in the House that it was unreal and said I did not believe it.  I referred to the most prominent republican in the House in recent years, Neil Blaney, who also welcomed it but gave it a very muted response as he did not believe it either.  The IRA is not sincere when it says it wants peace. Seventeen months ago we had to endure the spectacle of IRA posters which stated &ldquo;Give peace a chance&rdquo;.  Yet last Friday night these murdering vermin took the lives of two unfortunate people who did not know what the fight was about.  Their bodies were blown to pieces and all the parts have not yet been found.</P>
    <P>The peace process is also in pieces. How can Unionists have any faith in the promises of an organisation which called a truce and then broke it in such a foul manner?  It is the policies of appeasement which have allowed murderers and terrorist gangs to exist and call themselves nonsensical names such as Sinn Féin.  There is no distinction between Sinn Féin, the IRA, the UVF or the UDA &mdash; they are all killer gangs, criminals who masquerade under the acceptable cloak of republicanism and unionism.  I find it very difficult to watch on television shadowy figures from the UVF such as Billy Hutchinson, David Ervine and Gary McMichael who are guilty by association in the deaths of hundreds of innocent people, mainly Catholic in the North, and Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness.  Thousands of people found it very difficult to accept Mr. Adams presence in the House when President Clinton came here looking for votes.  This House was guarded day and night for 25 years against this man and his organisation in whose campaign of <Col N="1436" /> violence 14 gardaí and five soldiers were cruelly butchered.  However, it now seems that people are expendable and the crime of murder has been downgraded.  The effect of this can be witnessed in the increase in crime in Dublin and rural areas.  The culture of the slaughter fields of Ulster has permeated into Irish society.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has meddled too much in the affairs of the North. Stormont has been abolished and will not sit again, and we all say amen to that.  We pay lip service to the idea of democratic politics.  If we believe in democratic politics why do we not accept the idea of elections in the North for a relatively short period of 18 months with an absolute guarantee that Stormont cannot be entertained again? The British Government has given such a guarantee.  If we believe in the democratic principle of elections we should not deny people in the North the right to hold elections.</P>
    <P>We should withdraw somewhat from the internal divisions in the North and be replaced by an international commission set up by the EU which would ensure the guarantees the SDLP feels are necessary.  Many of the irritations and disadvantages suffered by Catholics in the North have been removed and life has improved out of all recognition. I spent a weekend in the North and like everyone else appreciate the benefits of peace, North and South.  However, I will not be ambivalent about this issue.  I condemn murder out of hand, it can never be right regardless of whether it is green or orange.  What kind of society would we have if we bowed the knee to terrorist organisations?</P>
    <P>Most politicians, having condemned the British, glibly ask why the parties do not talk, as if the Holy Ghost could bring a resolution of the problems that have beset this country for so long. What magic potion is contained in talks?  What will people so diametrically opposed to each other talk about?  They are worlds apart &mdash; a million Protestant people who want integration with <Col N="1437" /> Britain and half a million Catholics who want a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Until people here speak unambiguously and reject violence as a solution to this tragic problem, we will have fellow-travellers of the IRA who justify the taking of life.  The IRA could have killed 100 people on Friday night, and I had to try to console a 15-year-old girl in Dundalk who was inconsolable because her older, only sister, was working in England.  Friday night shamed this nation and indicated the number of gullible people who believed the IRA was sincere when it called the ceasefire.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in such an important debate as the question of the North, particularly at this difficult time. My own party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, had been hoping for a debate since 5 October.  However, I am pleased that, even in these sad circumstances, we have the opportunity to have that debate.</P>
      <P>Whatever people's views and emotions at this time &mdash; and obviously emotions are high on all sides &mdash; it is important to remember that we would not have had a peace process but for the initial talks between Gerry Adams and John Hume.  It is only fair that both men should be acknowledged for the work they have done and continue to do with regard to the peace process.</P>
      <P>We have had nearly 18 months of a ceasefire.  Some people called that peace, and it was peace for that number of months.  However, it is important to realise &mdash; and perhaps the British Government did not really realise its importance &mdash; that it was a period not only to consider the problem but to take things further.  That particular opportunity has been lost.</P>

    <P>I refuse to be pessimistic about this because the alternative to continuing the ceasefire is too sad to contemplate. As politicians we have a very grave responsibility to do all we possibly can to bring this process back on track.  It is easy for any of us to say that we wish the peace process to continue, but for <Col N="1438" /> that to happen we have to work hard to get people to the table for talks.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be accused of just laying the blame at the door of the British Government in making a political point.  I simply state the facts as unemotionally as I can in this situation. I look at the question of the Framework Document, the debates over clarification and the binning by the British Government of the Mitchell report on the question of decommissioning.  I look at the communiqué of November 1995 between the Irish and British Governments on the eve of the arrival of the President of the United States to this country and believe that it was only because of his imminent arrival that a communiqué was issued.  Unfortunately and sadly for this country, there was no follow-up of that communiqué by the British Government either.  Instead there was a proposal for elections which, in the Taoiseach's words &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; can only pour petrol on the flames of the situation we now face.  The Tánaiste then put forward a proposal for proximity talks which are worth considering.  Yet again this was dismissed by the British Government before the ink was dry on the proposal. A week or less before the bomb exploded in Britain Mr. Ancram, in a debate in UCD, said that even if Sinn Féin were to accept the six principles of the Mitchell report, that in itself would not be enough for talks.  There was great difficulty on the part of the British Government in accepting any positive proposal to move towards talks.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;frustration&rdquo; has been used many times in this debate.  We in this House share this sense of frustration, but we must also remember the very grave sense of frustration on all sides in the North.  One other indication of the stagnant approach of the British Government in working towards all-party talks is its treatment of the prisoner issue.  This was a very negative approach in an area where the British Government could have shown good faith.  Unfortunately, as I have been told by those who have taken a particular <Col N="1439" /> interest in the prisoner issue and who on all sides have visited the prisoners and seen their situation for themselves, since the ceasefire their situation has worsened.</P>
    <P>What are we to do about this situation? We have to keep dialogue open with everyone.  We have to use all our contacts.  We must tell the British Government, the Unionists and other groupings who have set up barriers that although there is always the temptation to put up obstacles, we should not do that.  We need to move forward to all-party talks where everyone will have the opportunity of discussing their matter of principle at that level.</P>
    <P>It is also important to remember that in 1990 Mr. Brooke gave a public commitment that if there was movement towards a ceasefire the British Government would reciprocate with an imaginative and generous response.  There has already been a ceasefire that lasted for 17 months, but we have not yet seen an imaginative or generous response.  In the Declaration, the British Prime Minister signed a document which said that he and his Government would be prepared to help to persuade the Unionists on the Irish question.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a recurring pattern in Irish history where, depending on the arithmetic in the House of Commons, we are heard or not heard as a nation. A problem that is so difficult, delicate and sensitive should not come down to votes and party affiliations within the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the statement by the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Blair, that he and his party did not intend to make the issue of the Irish question a party-political one.  That is very welcome for a number of reasons.  It shows that Mr. Blair has an interest in and a concern about what is happening in Ireland and that he is giving space to the British Prime Minister to act positively on this issue.</P>
    <P>In the present situation it is not too surprising to hear leaders reverting to their old stances.  I was saddened but <Col N="1440" /> perhaps not surprised by Mr. Taylor's recent remarks about the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and Mr. Trimble's reference to Sinn Féin as pariahs.  I am very sorry to hear Deputy McGahon use the provocative phrase &ldquo;murdering vermin&rdquo; because this is not the time to use that type of language.  The language used continually by the US administration, President Clinton and his ambassador to Ireland, Mrs. Kennedy Smith, is more appropriate.  I believe they have been a tremendous asset to the Irish cause.  I thank the American administration for its very positive and helpful approach to this matter.  The American ambassador reacted very positively to the Fianna Fáil suggestion that the former US Senator, Mr. George Mitchell, should come again to Ireland to act as an envoy because he knows the situation and already has had the opportunity to talk to people on all sides.  The American ambassador was open about the fact that she personally agreed with this idea and would have it put to the American administration.  This is more than a ray of hope.  The American ambassador said that Gerry Adams was an essential part of the peace equation.  I believe we must ensure we talk to everybody regardless of whether he espouses a Nationalist, republican, Unionist or loyalist view.  In my view they are all Irish men and women.  We have an opportunity in negotiations to put the difficulties behind us.</P>
    <P>It is sad that politicians find it so easy to condemn, yet what alternative have they been able to put forward?  In fairness, the Irish Government put forward some worthwhile suggestions which fell on not so sympathetic ears in the British Government but I hope there will be more flexibility.  Those who are completely committed to the political system have to show that it is possible for a consensus to emerge in negotiations. Until now we have had political paralysis which does not do political institutions much good.  What is needed is an open and flexible approach so that no further preconditions are put in the way of talks.  We have heard the references <Col N="1441" /> to vetoes but that outmoded approach has to be changed.  Deputy Albert Reynolds has said and continues to say during this crisis that we have to take risks for peace, that we have to change the mode of our thinking.  One does not have to renege on principle but one has to have respect for different points of view.  In order to do that, politicians have to create the political climate where people with completely opposing views can come to some kind of consensus.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon seemed to be rather depressed and felt that diametrically opposed individuals or parties could not possibly come to a conclusion. I do not agree with that because if it were the case there would be no need for the political system.  I look at what has happened throughout the world during recent years where the parties to conflicts going back hundreds of years are reaching an accommodation.  I believe that is possible in Ireland.  Why should ours be different from any other difficult situation?</P>
    <P>In the flux it is important not to over-react where security matters are concerned. That is very important because I can imagine that tensions must be very high in the North and if there was to be precipitative action by the security forces or the Government in bringing in further security measures the problem would be exacerbated.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to call for all-party talks as soon as possible.  We had 17 months of peace but the opportunity was lost.  We now have the opportunity to regain the initiative.</P>
    <P>I refuse to be pessimistic and say it is not possible.  I believe we have to find a way forward and we will.  To return to fighting among ourselves, to reiterating old arguments and holding on to old modes of thinking will not help us to achieve.  The split was always top of the agenda in Irish politics.  In history we always seem to turn in on and disagree among ourselves.  What was so positive about the peace process was that for the first time in many years we had a Nationalist consensus that allowed us to <Col N="1442" /> move forward.  I believe the bedrock for that is still there.  Let us have the courage to grasp that opportunity.</P>

      <P>The bombing of Canary Wharf on Friday last shortly after 7 p.m. was a devastating blow to the dream of a peaceful political settlement of the problems in Northern Ireland.  Our thoughts are with the innocent victims of this tragedy.  Can the Provisional IRA explain to those families that the Irish people benefited from misguided action?  We must consider how Irish people living in Britain can explain this return to violence in their name to their work colleagues.  They are at a loss to understand how anyone could hope to gain anything from this wanton madness or wish to benefit from the misery and sadness of their neighbours.  It is not sufficient to say we are angry about the lack of progress in the talks; the refusal of the Unionists to meet all parties; the slowness of the British Government to bring about a relaxation in the prison regime for republican and loyalist prisoners; the disregard for the sensitivities of Irish feelings by the early release and promotion of Private Clegg; the disregard for the Mitchell report and the amazing decision by the British Government to disregard the view of the Irish Government and the Nationalist parties by agreeing with the Unionists to go ahead with an assembly type election before entering into negotiations with the Irish Government.  None of these matters is worth shedding one drop of blood for no matter how angry we feel about them.  Our anger should not be seen as condoning the action of the IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look for a way forward out of our present dilemma and make a concerted effort to reinstate the ceasefire. The Government cannot be expected to <Col N="1443" /> talk directly with Sinn Féin at ministerial level but contact must be made if we are to have a solution.  We acknowledge that Sinn Féin, its leadership and in particular Gerry Adams have made a major contribution to peace and should help them to restore it.  As Deputy de Valera and the American Ambassador to Ireland said, without Gerry Adams the likelihood of holding peace talks is remote.  It is appropriate that he be facilitated in every possible way and that the doors be left open.  In the mean-time we must support the Government in its call for closer co-operation with the British Government.  We must use whatever means we have at our disposal to ensure a programme for the commencement of all-party talks is put in place, whether that is through the summit meeting which I hope will take place in the near future, or through rescheduling the Forum.  No avenue should be left unexplored.</P>
    <P>We cannot have inclusive talks if all parties are not present.  Unless the Unionists see a reason to be present convening such talks will be difficult. That is why there was a groundswell of support for the action taken by the Government and in particular the Tánaiste.  I commend speakers who mentioned his efforts in this regard. During recent years he spent much time and effort at great personal and family expense dealing with this matter.  He tried to keep an even keel even when he was subjected to criticisms from various quarters, including Unionists.</P>
    <P>Our party has commended and given him its full support for his efforts and those of the Government in their unremitting search for a speedy and certain route to all-party inclusive negotiations aimed at securing a comprehensive settlement in Northern Ireland based on consent and the three stranded approach.  It is difficult to understand the attitude of Mr. Trimble with whom I have had the honour to serve on committees. I chaired an international committee of which he was a member.  I cannot understand why he should be <Col N="1444" /> concerned about participating in all-party talks when one of the grounds we have laid down is that any change made will be on the basis of consent.  If consent is included in our agenda the Unionists, being a majority in Northern Ireland, have an effective veto on whatever settlement is arrived at.  The Unionists should consider seriously the tremendous advantages for the North of Ireland over the past 17 months, the boom in the economy, benefits to industry, the happiness of families and children, the development of the tourism industry and all that has happened as a result of the ceasefire.  It must be emphasised to the Unionists that there are benefits to be gained and that we are not involved with any group that want to exclude them from any settlement or agreement and bomb them into the sea.</P>
    <P>My party reaffirms its total commitment to the actions of the Government and Tánaiste.  Despite our sense of betrayal following the London atrocity, the responsibility for which lies with the IRA, the Labour Party believes every effort must be made, consistent with democratic principles, to keep the lines of communication open to those committed to reinstating the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively to what Gerry Adams said recently.  I have no doubt he was unaware of the impending doom last Friday.  From his statements he appears to be committed to continuing his efforts for peace.  We must be seen to support him.  We call on all democratic parties, North and South, to be involved in a search for a way forward. We commend the idea of proximity talks as a way to reconcile the conflicting objectives of those who favour elections before negotiations with those who believe negotiations should be held first.</P>
    <P>There are options which can be prioritised with the agreement and consent of the two Governments and the political parties.  If we can do that and bring the parties together on the basis of consent surely the IRA must, if it has any heart at all, which we sometimes doubt, listen <Col N="1445" /> to the plea of democratically elected politicians who strive earnestly to bring all sides together and see if there is a way to move the process forward.  There is a responsibility on us to be cautious in our approach.  We should commend the efforts of those with direct responsibility for restarting talks which must be as inclusive as is humanly possible.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy for the Border counties of Sligo and Leitrim I have witnessed at first hand and on a regular basis the change brought by the ceasefire. It is not so much a change as a total transformation.  For many, their way of life has changed.  There is freedom from fear and freedom of movement across the Border in both directions.  A recent survey showed that the traffic on the Sligo-Blacklion-Enniskillen road increased by 31 per cent since the ceasefire was announced almost 18 months ago.  That is an indication of the change in lifestyle of the people in that area. The message from cross-Border areas after black Friday is that the peace process must be got back on track.  A way must be found out of the present crisis. Peace efforts must be intensified.  No one wants a return to violence.  Typical of the correspondence I received on this issue, not only from Sligo-Leitrim but also from across the Border, particularly Fermanagh, is a letter from the Reverend Ian Henderson, Chairman of Enniskillen and Sligo District Methodist Church in which he stated: &ldquo;I am convinced that no-one wants a return to such a situation which breeds fear, suspicion and mistrust and can never bring about a lasting peace to our land&rdquo;.  I am sure the message is similar throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know it will be very difficult to make progress again, but many ideas put forward in the Dáil and the House of Commons are being actively pursued by the leaders whose job it is to find a solution to the problems.  The Mitchell report, with, as the Taoiseach described yesterday, &ldquo;its challenging insights&rdquo;, must be revisited.  It is only right on an occasion such as this to pay due tribute <Col N="1446" /> to Senator Mitchell, and his colleagues, for the job they did.  They faced an extremely difficult and delicate task, with a tight time schedule.  Their incisive, balanced, constructive report deserved a better fate, and I hope it now receives due consideration.  One suggestion put forward is that Senator Mitchell should be recalled as a peace envoy.  His conduct of affairs so far, compiling and presenting his report and his stoic reaction to the way it was treated, suggests he is a man of stature, talent and impartiality. He is passionately concerned about bringing permanent peace to Northern Ireland and could play a vital role in that regard.  Among the many interesting proposals to advance the peace process is that put forward by John Hume in the House of Commons for referenda, North and South.  They would produce massive majorities for an end to violence and the start of negotiations. They would show the highest turnout at polling stations in the history of our voting, and that would be a very powerful message.</P>
    <P>The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation has done a very good job, with many ideas being put forward and much consensus reached.  I am disappointed it will not meet for a month.  That forum still has a role to play.  The Tánaiste's proposal for a multilateral proximity meeting is designed to bring together on a voluntary basis all parties and both Governments in a single venue.  A proximity meeting is a concept that is new to me, but it worked at Dayton and therefore it is highly recommended, even for such intractable circumstances as in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, has called for the election of a negotiating body, an electoral process greatly qualified and modified as regards the functions and lifespan of the body to be elected, presumably with a very firm agreement, a strict timetable and agenda on the follow-up to the elections and with no further preconditions. There are serious problems with an election at this time, many of which <Col N="1447" /> were outlined by the Tánaiste yesterday. One of the main problems with holding an election in advance of and designed for negotiations is that inevitably it would lead to a hardening of attitudes, a retreat to old entrenched positions and a polarisation between communities and within each community. It is inevitable that there would be personality clashes.  Those elected would move straight away into negotiations, and that is when the difficulties would arise.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an election leading to negotiations, it should not be on the traditional lines of separate constituencies with their list of candidates from the rival parties.  A much better electoral system for this once-off specific job would be to have one constituency with a list system in operation, or some similar system.  There are many models in continental Europe and around the world on which such a system could be based.  It would have the effect of reducing confrontation, diminishing personality clashes and encouraging voters to turn up at the polls, even in areas totally dominated by one party, as is the case in many parts of the North.  It would ensure parties would have an appropriate geographical spread among their representatives at the negotiations. Most important it would give an opprotunity of representation to the fringe parties such as that of David Ervine, an eminently sound man whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the economic conference in Washington.  Otherwise the smaller parties, with a total vote fragmented among the constituencies, might have no representation in the negotiating body.  That would not be good for the negotiations.  Those parties should be represented and the electoral system should facilitate that.</P>
    <P>Under the list system every person turning up at the polls, regardless of the area they live or whether it is dominated by one party, would know that his or her vote would count in the final tally. The list system would give extra powers to the parties drawing up the list, but <Col N="1448" /> for the negotiating body that might have some positive elements &mdash; for example, the presence in the new body of people particularly skilled as negotiators who might not otherwise have an interest in taking part in the elections.  In some combination of the ideas being considered here, in the North and London, there must be a way forward.  Anybody with even the slightest knowledge of Irish history can recite a litany of lost opportunities.  We now have one of those historic opportunities, and this time if we take the necessary action it may make a difference.</P>
    <P>Despite black Friday and the fact that as of now the IRA has not restored the ceasefire, I hope structures will be put in place to ensure peace prevails, an agreed way forward is found and a negotiated settlement reached to which everyone can subscribe.  There is great urgency about getting the process under way again.  We all wish and must all work to ensure there is no repeat of Canary Wharf.</P>

      <P>Like almost everyone I know, I was devastated and angry at the detonation of a bomb in Canary Wharf in London last Friday evening.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of the peace process is a tragedy.  It is clear that the IRA bears responsibility directly and solely for that bombing, but the peace process must continue.  It must be rescued and restored without delay.  Sinn Féin should point out to the IRA the great achievement of the peace process to date and the great support given to it by people throughout the country and ask it to reconsider its change of heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peace process was a magnificent achievement.  Gerry Adams deserves his share of credit for bringing about the ceasefire, but there is no justification for writing off the peace process after only 18 months on the basis the its pace was <Col N="1449" /> too slow.  We understand the frustrations. We, too, were very frustrated. We were restrained.  We expressed our concerns, supported the Government and pressed it to continue its work with a degree of urgency.  We will continue to do that because that is the political process.</P>
    <P>Two young men, Mr. Inan Ul-Haq Bashir and Mr. John Jefferies, died and more than 100 were injured in last Friday's bomb.  The effects of those injuries will last for many years.  Tomorrow morning I am meeting one of my constituents, a victim of the 1974 Dublin bombing, who still calls to see me.  He is deaf and has various other problems. His life was destroyed after that bombing. Even though there was some financial recompense, nothing worked out for him.  That is the reality facing victims who suffer injuries.  We all forget about them.  We believe once they are sent to hospital they are patched up and on the road to recovery, but the devastation and trauma lasts a long time.</P>
    <P>I join with all Members in offering my sympathy to the relatives of the deceased and those who were injured. We were deeply disappointed at this breach in the ceasefire and the failure to make political progress.  The start of all-inclusive talks was delayed far too long.  The politics of brinkmanship went too far.  I will not allocate blame &mdash; perhaps enough has been said about that. Those who were responsible for the brinkmanship know only too well how they put the peace process at risk.  There are hard men among the paramilitaries and politicians on both sides in this dispute. I ask them to retreat from the precipice.</P>
    <P>Our conflict has continued for more than 700 years, the last 25 of which have been marked by death, destruction, sorrow and devastation, but now we have an historic opportunity to break that cycle and bring peace to our island.  The complete cessation of violence for almost 18 months provided the necessary space and time for a resolution of our problems, but the politicians moved too slowly.  Politics is a frustrating business in a democratic society.  We in this <Col N="1450" /> House know that.  When elected we have great ideas about what can be done immediately, but in practice find it always takes a good deal longer, although usually we achieve our objectives in due course.</P>
    <P>Politics is the best approach.  It needs skill, courage, perseverance and from time to time the strength to be able to turn the other cheek and keep going.  It needs great endurance and commitment. The people, above all, realise the importance of politicians and their work in our society and the danger of demeaning and reducing that work, given that it is the work on which our democracy is founded.  The political path is a tough one.  Those turning from violence to political participation need to be tough.  Sometimes it can be easier to set a bomb and run away than to stand, fight, argue and persevere for what one believes in.</P>
    <P>The framework for progress and the dividends of peace are there to be seen. People are living now instead of dying. People are whole and entire instead of being maimed in their thousands.  They are happy, not sad or bitter.  There has been delay and frustration with the pace of political development.  We in Fianna Fáil are totally and unreservedly committed to the reunification of Ireland by peaceful means through consent.  We will work by every political means available to bring a just and lasting peace to all the people of Ireland, North and South.  What is the alternative but violence? Violence will turn this country into a wasteland in the vain hope that the British will want to leave it some day.  Violence is against the wishes of 99 per cent of the people of Ireland, and ultimately, those who participate in it will destroy themselves and their children and disgrace the legitimate Nationalist aspiration.  Governments and politicians on all sides can no longer afford the luxury of delay.  The peace process is a perishable.</P>
    <P>With the proposals recently in the public domain, the goodwill and the political skills available, there is room for compromise and for a way forward and <Col N="1451" /> there is still hope.  In the context of the proposal for an election to a peace convention put forward by the UK and the Unionists and the Irish Government's proposals for proximity talks and a two-day conference, it is easy to envisage a constructive role for Senator George Mitchell.  He must have a role, whatever it may be, in achieving peace and a settlement here.  If proximity talks were used to finalise the basis of any election, the role of a convention, to establish the democratic principles and immediate timing of all-inclusive talks, they could make a great contribution to peace, but we must proceed soon.  There is no room for delay.  Sinn Féin should enthusiastically support this process as the only way to participate in all-inclusive talks on an overall political settlement within a reasonable timeframe. Sinn Féin must use its influence to persuade the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire and enable progress towards peace.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Irish Government's unequivocal acceptance of the principle of consent, there is no basis for any fear or apprehension among Unionists.  I appeal to them to move towards consensus in the interest of lasting peace.  I also appeal to the IRA to accept the over-whelming desire of all Irish people, North and South, to have the long-term, political and constitutional future of all parts of the island settled solely by democratic and peaceful means.</P>
    <P>The two Governments must rescue the peace process as a matter of urgency in the interests of all the people of these islands.  Now is the time for political leadership, for political risk taking at the highest level.  Political leaders must get meaningful talks under way and proceed without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in condemning the London bombing and sympathise with the families affected.  One lesson to be learned from the extremely regrettable bombing of Canary Wharf last Friday is that there is no room for complacency when dealing with the highly dangerous political vacuum in the <Col N="1452" /> North.  It is understandable that relief at the cessation of armed conflict has been the predominant response of most people in the last 17 months or so.  The citizens of Northern Ireland have regained a sense of normality in their every day lives.  All who have recently visited the North heard people say that for the first time in a quarter of a century they can go shopping or socialise. They have been visibly pleased about it. The bombing is a dreadful tragedy and the people who engaged in violence have much to answer for.  However, it is totally unacceptable for politicians to be complacent at this stage.  The peace process is far too delicate and precious.</P>
      <P>Any impartial assessment of the political events of the past 17 months is almost certain to reveal that the requisite sense of urgency in moving towards vibrant and just new structures was frequently absent.  What made it worse was that at times the process seemed to be going backward.  Month after month we waited for some breakthrough and the final straw was the Mitchell report.  That it was dealt with in a cursory way was an insult to the peace process and Senator Mitchell and represented a lost opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government and the main Unionist parties were remiss in their complacency.  In the context of the Northern Ireland crisis, there is no room for negative posturing and that was increasingly the behaviour of Mr. Trimble and others.  At a time when every sinew needs to be stretched to ensure peace every democratic party must play its role and have regard to the concerns and aspirations of all sections of the community.  The failure of many senior Unionist politicians to engage with our Government was worrying and disappointing. To turn on an answering machine when the Tánaiste sought to talk was grossly irresponsible and unacceptable.  It could also be interpreted as a rejection of the 40 per cent or so Nationalist population in the North at a time when, in contrast, all Nationalist parties, including Sinn Féin, were willing to engage in unconditional <Col N="1453" /> talks with the British Government, the representative of the Unionist tradition.</P>
    <P>There has been the ongoing spectacle of senior Unionist politicians seemingly more concerned with indulging in profoundly negative rhetoric than in taking the first positive steps towards developing a broadly acceptable administration in the North.  Their behaviour suggested that little or nothing had changed in their attitude since 1969 and that what went on for the previous 50 years was all right; they were in control, it was a 60-40 situation and they called the shots.  The trouble is that those old, tired and totally discredited attitudes of &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; are no good today.</P>
    <P>I salute the smaller Unionist parties' representatives, such as David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson, who are far more reasonable in their general approach to the future.  Without moving from the traditional beliefs of the Unionist community, they refreshingly acknowledged the rights and aspirations of their Nationalist neighbours. The time for change is now.  Too much progress has been made to allow the advances of the past 17 months to be frittered away.  Under no circumstances should constitutional politicians allow the initiative slip back to those involved in terror and murder.</P>
    <P>This and future generations, North and South, will reap enormous benefits from securing peace.  Apart from lifestyle, contentment and the natural order of things, there is an economic dividend. We must not fail, either through a lack of perseverance, political wisdom or, perhaps above all, generosity.  It would have been nice to have seen generosity from all sides over the past 17 months. One truism overhangs future developments in Northern Ireland.  Ultimately, the Irish and British communities will be winners or losers.  The prospect of losing is not a matter I would like to contemplate.  There is no room for any sectional interest to steal a march on any political or traditional opponent.  That cannot be overemphasised during the critical coming days and weeks.  Posturing, often an intrinsic <Col N="1454" /> part of the lead up to landmark negotiations, is certain to be of no real benefit in the context of Northern Ireland. The opposite is the case since posturing only encourages those who do not have the best interests of all the people of the Six Countries at heart.</P>
    <P>The immediate priority is to restore the peace process.  It will take some political skill and in this context, it is vital that all steps taken are inclusive rather than exclusive, geared to the future and bilateral, and even multilateral, rather than partisan.  Above all, we must be generous rather than mean-minded and minimal.  Watching discussions on current affairs programmes, I see people falling back on the old clichés and shibboleths; it is absolutely depressing.</P>
    <P>We must focus on a workable system in the North, for instance, devolved government at local authority level. There are many examples of that.  The people from Sinn Féin and the Unionist parties in the North and from across the Border can at local authority level sit down and talk about credible projects and programmes.  If we had a referendum and made a decision on the constitutional issue and then put it aside for ten years we could make progress such as was made in the co-operatives in Counties Fermanagh and Monaghan and various other countries when the constitutional flag-waving was put aside.</P>
    <P>I suggest that community, co-operative local authority-borough development is the way to make progress leaving the flag-waving and constitutional matters to be decided at the end of each decade.  There are so many people who want to make a contribution to positive progress out of this particularly difficult impasse, I believe that to be the way forward.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Is ait ach is iontach go bhfuil daoine anseo ag labhairt le dhá lá beagnach faoin-síocháin a bhí againn agus ar chóir a bheith againn fós sa tír seo.  Tá suim ag furmhór na ndaoine sa tír seo sa tsíocháin <Col N="1455" /> seachas dream an-bheag ar fad atá tábhachtach agus cumhachtach mar go bhfuil gunnaí, piléir agus pléascáin acu.  Tá furmhór na ndaoine ag rá gur chóir go mbeadh an tsíocháin againn arís agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an tsíocháin sin againn.  Tá brón ó chroí orainn go bhfuil beirt fhear macánta marbh i Sasana toisc go raibh siad ag obair go dian ina siopaí.  Ní raibh baint ar bith acu leis an tír seo agus b'fhéidir nach raibh baint ar bith acu leis an tríoblóidí atá againn ná leis na cainteanna.  Bhí siad ag obair go dian dícheallach agus maraíodh iad go náireach.  Tá brón orainn go léir sa tír seo gur tharla sin.  Gortaíodh os cionn 100 duine go dona.  Is uafásach an rud é sin freisin mar bhí na daoine sin ag obair nó ag siopadóireacht agus gan baint ar bith acu le haon rud ach amháin len a gcuid gnó féin.  Tá brón ar gach éinne gur tharla an rud.</P>
      <P>Last Friday's atrocious bombing episode, killing two people and injuring so many others, was shocking to all of us and will be remembered.  When I saw televised portrayals of people injured and buildings destroyed, initially I thought it was a programme on what were described as the troubles, a flash back but, when somebody was interviewed on the spot, I realised the atrocity had just happened, not having heard any earlier news or that there had been any warning that the ceasefire was at an end.  Watching those horrible pictures was a chilling experience for any decent person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose we here, and particularly those in Northern Ireland, had become somewhat used to peace, which must have been a marvellous experience for the latter, particularly those aged 25 or younger who had never experienced peace there in their lifetime, but had grown up witnessing heinous crimes, of people being killed simply because some so-called patriot had decided to plant a bomb in a public house, shop or elsewhere.  Those young people who had never experienced anything else suddenly began to realise that life could be enjoyable and, from my knowledge <Col N="1456" /> of some residents in the North, I am aware just how much that enjoyment meant to them.  As my colleague, Deputy Crawford, said last evening, the ordinary human pursuits of shopping, travelling, visiting friends without fear of being blown apart constituted an enormous change for the people in the North.  It must be dreadful to come to the realisation that, whether in one's own home, having a drink in a public house or wherever, one is in danger of being blown apart.  Therefore, the 18 months of peace enjoyed by all those who had experienced that former tough life must have been marvellous.</P>
    <P>In addition, within that period, many people from the South were very anxious to visit the North, the peace process beginning to open up a whole new era of possibilities, tourism alone benefiting enormously, and which I hope will continue.  On the other hand, if there are to be more explosions dreadful losses will be incurred throughout the island, the most grievous being that of the precious commodity of life itself.</P>
    <P>I compliment all those who played a leading role in the evolution of those 18 months of peace.  In that respect I include, of course, former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds who put so much into that effort and took much flak for the manner in which the IRA were behaving.  When everybody else thought there was no hope, that that organisation was merely stringing things along, Deputy Reynolds stayed with it and managed to have the peace process initiated, aided by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs in his negotiations leading to the announcement of the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has maintained a very balanced line, helping enormously in keeping talks going while John Hume never seems to waver in logic, seldom losing his temper, with the exception of the occasion when the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, spoke in the House of Commons on the day of publication of the Mitchell report.  John Hume has done so much and taken so much flak also.  It is very easy for us in <Col N="1457" /> the South to read about events taking place in the North but those living there, dealing with each other, have a much tougher task.</P>
    <P>We should at least give Gerry Adams &mdash; who seems to be blamed by many for the collapse of the ceasefire &mdash; credit for having persuaded the IRA to call its ceasefire.  It was not easy to persuade those who had been used to carrying guns and planting bombs to cease their violent activities.  It is amazing that former US Senator, Mr. George Mitchell, was able to talk about a split within the IRA.  There must have been some rumour to the effect that matters were getting out of control before last Friday's bomb explosion; yet it was amazing that did not reach the ears of those one might have expected would know.</P>
    <P>Gerry Adams managed to help in our having had almost 18 months of peace, so it is a pity he was unable to keep the IRA under control, but neither could many others.  Therefore, perhaps it is unfair that Gerry Adams should be singled out for having allowed this latest incident to occur, simply because he was not told.  One cannot always manage the wild men of the IRA.  Under no circumstances do I condone what that organisation does; in fact I condemn its activities out of hand, simply usurping their freedom within a democracy to endeavour to get their way by force.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who has taken a very responsible line on this matter; from a republican party view-point his stance is to be commended as is that of Deputy Harney.  Within this debate, with one or two exceptions, there has been no sniping or apportioning of blame on the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has done his best to reach agreement with the British Prime Minister which, when arrived at, was not broken by the Taoiseach but by Mr. John Major who decided he could do something else.  Recalling the scenario that obtained in August 1994, had anybody said: &ldquo;if only we could get peace for a couple of weeks, we would be able to sit down and discuss matters.&rdquo; we <Col N="1458" /> would all have replied readily: &ldquo;Get us peace for a month and we will certainly sort something out with regard to talks.&rdquo;  However, not alone has a month passed but 18 months have elapsed during which it has been very difficult to pinpoint any major achievements on the political front.  While acknowledging the enormous benefits of that peaceful period, people's comfort and enjoyment, any analysis of what emerged during that period when there was time to talk, leads one to ask why so little progress was made.</P>
    <P>The final straw must have been John Major's treatment of Senator Mitchell's report.  I do not know whether he meant his criticism to sound as it did but he certainly gave the impression that he was wiping out the work of the Mitchell trio.  That is one of the issues which upset the people who were anxious to break away from the peace process all the time and they decided, after this twist, that there would be no talks.</P>
    <P>The idea of insulting the Tánaiste as part of the political process was outrageous. Politicians and leaders of responsible and democratic parties cannot go back to the early 1970s when the British Prime Minister, Ted Heath, sent a telegram to the Taoiseach.  Jack Lynch, telling him to mind his own business. That was bad enough in those days but if the language of diplomacy in 1996 describes somebody as the most hated person in the North that is going beyond the serious level of politics and it cannot help the resumption of serious talks.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why people are not prepared to sit down and discuss matters with those with whom they disagree.  Clearly, talks will never be easy.  It was difficult to get the peace process going but the follow-on will be much more difficult.  One would expect that if people had experienced 18 months of peace they would be anxious to sit down and discuss matters, having the guarantee, which the Unionists have, that they will not be forced into anything.  If John Major backs them and seems to give them encouragement perhaps, from his own weak position as far <Col N="1459" /> as a majority is concerned, that is encouraging them.  If they were told they should sit and discuss matters with those with whom they disagree they might see reason.  We can hardly continue as in the past.  Surely some lessons must have been learned from the troubles of the past 25 years.  It is time people sat down and discussed the matter.</P>
    <P>We had the argument that there would be no talks until there was a decommissioning of arms.  It is easy to say that nobody should have guns if they are in politics except that one is dealing with people who think they have that right.  They see that other people in similar situations did not hand up their guns prior to talks.  Decommissioning was not mentioned when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and John Major agreed to the peace process and discussions.  It became a problem afterwards. Now decommissioning is a block preventing talks.  If the elections take place the question is whether decommissioning will be another block.  It does not appear as if a real effort is being made on the opposite side.</P>
    <P>I compliment and thank Senator Mitchell and his group for their work and regret, despite their great efforts, that their report was not used in the way it should have been.  It must have been disheartening for him, having devoted so much time and effort and extended the time to meet everyone, that the report was disposed of in the House of Commons in a few minutes.  I hope it will not discourage him from coming back as a peace envoy or co-ordinator, as has been suggested, for proximity meetings in the North to help get over the block on talks.  Senator Mitchell could be a co-ordinator or the neutral person who would go from room to room when people are not prepared to sit down and talk to one another.</P>
    <P>The latest proposal is that there will be elections in the North but there are different views on that.  An election at any time, even in the Twenty-six Counties, can cause blood pressure and <Col N="1460" /> excitement and people can lose their cool.  An election in the Six Counties will not help to create a peaceful attitude because there are extremists on both sides who will use it to ensure their case is heard.  Somebody asked for what they will get a mandate.  Will they get a mandate not to talk or to talk? It would be nice to think there would be round table talks and that the issue of elections would be agreed in advance.  That is what caused all the havoc.  When the announcement concerning elections was made people were not prepared for it. If it had been agreed that there would be round table talks to decide on holding elections in the North that would have been acceptable.  It appears that an announcement was made that elections would be held and, come hell or high water, this was one solution.  Such a solution does not help.</P>
    <P>It does not appear as if the normal type of election in the North will help. The list system has been suggested as a better way where a party gets a percentage of the vote and the candidates are nominated on that basis.  It may take some of the heat out of the elections and has the advantage, as pointed out by many, that smaller parties &mdash; some of which are more reasonable than the larger parties &mdash; would get their place in the sun.</P>
    <P>In South Africa and Israel where the position was as bad, if not worse than in the Six Counties those in Government who were sworn enemies were able to sit down and discuss the issue.  Yet we in Ireland cannot manage to have common sense which would enable people to sit around the table.  Any celebration of the Battle of the Boyne is of no advantage in 1996 when we are trying to work towards sanity, common sense and peace.  We have to accept that the plantation of Ulster took place a long time ago and that the people there are Irish so long as they want to be and have their rightful place in the sun.</P>
    <P>There is still hope that talks will take place, that common sense will prevail and that instead of calling names across the airwaves people will sit down and <Col N="1461" /> help to bring back a peaceful scene to this country and allow people to live and enjoy themselves as best they can in normal circumstances.  With bombs, bullets, shootings, and murders there is no peace on this island.  I hope the peace which was interrupted will continue and that the explosion in London was a once-off affair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my sympathy to those bereaved by Friday's tragedy and who have become the latest victims of the Northern Ireland problem.  It is important to recall the achievements and success of the Downing Street Declaration. For the first time it created a situation in which Nationalists and republicans came together in a special role in the affairs of the North.  The Irish and British Governments also took on a new responsibility and a new role.  Tribute must be paid to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, John Hume and Gerry Adams for the calling of the ceasefire.  It was only hours old when it was beset by difficulties.</P>
      <P>On the afternoon of the Downing Street Declaration the Tánaiste introduced the concept of decommissioning as something which should be established with a permanent cessation of violence.  It became, for the first time, a feature of that which was essential before all-party talks could proceed.  It was not a feature of the Downing Street Declaration.  Consequently, under strong questioning in this House from Deputy Michael McDowell, the Tánaiste reluctantly accepted the view that it was not possible for Sinn Féin to participate in constitutional talks or the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation without clear, unequivocal and demonstrated disarmament by the IRA. Although the Tánaiste rowed back from this point later, it was further enhanced by the Taoiseach on his departure for the 1995 St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties started to emerge when this Government took office.  The <Col N="1462" /> departure of Deputy Reynolds as Taoiseach was a serious loss to the process. Many crises developed during the ceasefire, for example, the IRA murder of the post office worker.  That difficulty was overcome and contact was maintained with Gerry Adams and the Sinn Féin party; they were asked to explain and they did so and were warned. Throughout those crises the lines of communication were kept open.</P>
    <P>Over recent months Sinn Féin has been accused of scaremongering, yet the Irish and British Governments were almost surprised Sinn Féin did not know about the bomb on Friday night. Gerry Adams was surprised by Friday's bomb, if not more shocked than anyone. Developments since then, whereby Gerry Adams has been pushed to one side, have been unprecedented.  The removal of the section 31 ban gave Gerry Adams access to the airwaves and should have been sufficient justification to allow contact to be maintained with him at the highest level.</P>
    <P>President Clinton visited Ireland before Christmas and, in preparation for that visit, the Governments cobbled together an arrangement in the Joint Communiqué.  The dogs in the street knew the peace process was in crisis. All-party talks had been promised repeatedly; the Tánaiste said they were tantalisingly close.  However, the talks have not taken place.  As Deputy Reynolds said this morning, his understanding is that if a date is set for all-party talks that will ensure a restoration of the ceasefire.  That is a significant understanding of the present position.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals have been put forward recently, among them that of holding elections.  John Hume does not agree with the idea but the Government seems to go along with the suggestion that they are justifiable.  There will be a general election in Britain and the North of Ireland shortly and I cannot understand why there has to be a special election in the North.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> Proximity talks is another proposal. Proximity talks have been going on for a number of months; persons of opposing politics have been in the same room or have often sat in the same broadcasting studio.  For years Unionist and Sinn Féin representatives have sat together on councils in the North.  Proximity talks may be a means of buying time or concentrating minds but they will not get us where we urgently need to go.</P>
    <P>The Government has a responsibility to ensure that the British Prime Minister, John Major, will set aside his own political needs in the interests of peace in Britain, the North of Ireland and the South.  The hardline Unionists in the North must recognise that they must give a little to ensure peace can be restored.  It is through compromise that peace can be re-established.</P>
    <P>The British Government's response to the bombing was typical.  All condemnation is justified.  However, it was amazing to hear Sir Patrick Mayhew indicate that the British Government would not be deflected by bombs and bullets.  At the same time, I have never witnessed as frenetic a flurry in the comings and goings of recent days.  Why was that not taking place before last Friday night?  Why were attempts not made to ensure the ceasefire could be protected?</P>

      <P>It is time the Irish and British Governments faced up to their responsibilities and were no longer dictated to by parties with a small electoral mandate.  Those parties include the Unionists and Democratic Left which is in Government but only represents 1 per cent of the voting population of this country.  The serious minded elected representatives from majority parties must take the responsibility to set the date for talks and ensure that those who can secure peace participate.  Gerry <Col N="1464" /> Adams will then have something with which to influence the IRA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my heartfelt sympathy to the families and relatives of the people killed and maimed in the Canary Wharf bombing.  It is probable that they had little or no knowledge of the troubles in the North, that they were merely in the wrong place at the wrong time.</P>
      <P>The ending of the ceasefire last week was a devastating blow and a major setback for the people of this island and Britain.  When the ceasefire was announced 18 months ago it was said that we were moving to a new plane. Few could have disagreed with that assertion.  It brought to an end 25 years of murder and mayhem.  The necessary bridge building to remove the hatred and bitterness between the two communities was going to be a slow and tortuous process, but where there was a will there was a way.  There was an out-pouring of goodwill which was unthinkable a few months previously.  Tangible support was forthcoming both from Europe and the United States.  President Clinton took a personal interest in the process and his offer of financial support was warmly welcomed.</P>
      <P>We tend to overlook the fact that the people of the North are nothing if not resilient.  During the 25 years of the troubles when there was significant disruption the perception was that the economy was stagnant, but its growth rate was higher than many expected.</P>
      <P>Every effort must be made to put the process back on track.  If Sinn Féin fails to exert its influence and impress on the IRA the error of its ways, there could be an escalation of violence.  There is also a danger that the two Governments, through their statements, may exacerbate what is already a difficult situation. The comments of their representatives should be measured and tailored so as not to make more difficult the task for those within Sinn Féin who wish to see the process put back on track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party leader has called for the appointment of a US peace envoy.  That <Col N="1465" /> is a positive and worthwhile suggestion which I hope will be seriously considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>If we are to convince the people of the Six Counties that we are serious about finding a final settlement, the objective of all-party talks must be achieved.  There is a responsibility on the British Government to exert its influence and convince the Unionist parties that this is in their best interests and the best way to ensure a permanent peace.  If the political parties fail to hammer out a settlement and there is a return to the cycle of violence, it will take a long time to re-establish the process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my heartfelt sympathy to the families and relatives of the people killed and injured in the Canary Wharf bombing on Friday night last.</P>
      <P>We must examine the background to the peace process.  Were it not for the efforts of John Hume and former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in conjunction with Gerry Adams, progress would not have been made.  This high risk strategy required an element of trust on all sides, but particularly between Deputy Reynolds and the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major.  A ceasefire was announced on 31 August 1994 on the understanding that all-party talks would commence as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the tragic events in this House in December that year resulted in many changes which had a bearing on Anglo-Irish relations.  The trust which had been built between Deputy Reynolds and the British Prime Minister disappeared and we entered a period of inactivity during which the British Government failed to make progress and John Major was a hostage to Unionist demands in order to maintain his position as British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also a change of leadership in the Ulster Unionist Party.  It has been obvious for the past six months that <Col N="1466" /> David Trimble is not as committed as his predecessor and many others within his party to advancing the process.</P>
    <P>The British Government has ignored the best efforts of the Government during the past 12 months to make progress. The process has limped on with issue after issue being raised.  Imaginative steps were taken to prevent further progress being made.</P>
    <P>In anyone's language decommissioning is a myth.  The paramilitaries can rearm as quickly as they can decommission. When it was raised as an issue by the British Prime Minister he received support in this House from people who did not decommission any weapons when involved in paramilitary activity.  No one knows where the arms they used are buried.  Decommissioning was used as a pretext to prevent further progress being made.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have a duty to put the process back on track.  Nationalists and Unionists and the innocent people injured in the Canary Wharf bombing on Friday night last do not want to see a recurrence. Politicians should take the initiative. In this context, Deputy Reynolds's decision to meet with Gerry Adams was a positive development, although some may not agree.  The fact remains that if someone is part of the problem, they are entitled to be spoken to at all times.  As we learned last weekend, megaphone diplomacy is not in the best interests of this country.</P>
    <P>The holding of an election has been mentioned in an attempt to marginalise the paramilitaries on both sides and people such as David Ervine, Billy Hutchinson and Gary McMichael.  Those who live in the real world and whose friends and relatives have suffered because of the troubles do not want to be sacrificial lambs for mainline Unionist parties.  It is time people realised this.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on every politican to talk to all those involved, either directly or indirectly, so that the peace <Col N="1467" /> process can be put back on the rails.  We want the prosperity of the past 18 months to continue and the people of Northern Ireland want a return to peace.  Who is afraid of peace?  There is an onus on the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, John Major, David Trimble, John Hume, Gerry Adams and all paramilitary leaders involved in the peace process to return to the table for negotiations. There is an onus on the two Governments to set a date for all-party talks and get the peace process back on the rails.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Peace in Ireland is about including all and excluding none.  If peace is what we seek, violence and the threat of it must be put into the past.  Of all the pan-Catholic parties, Sinn Féin has the greatest responsibility to convince the one million Protestants in the North that it no longer wants guns, bombs or bullets.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of talk about decommissioning, which is about more than handing up guns.  For some it is about forcing Governments to recognise that illegal guns and bullets are legal and that bombing equipment held by private armies for the purpose of killing and maiming is legal.  No government or democracy can yield to that. Neither the British nor Irish Governments can concede that guns used to rob banks and shoot soldiers on both sides of the Border and bombs used to kill and maim Irish and British people should be legalised.  That is what decommissioning would mean and anyone who believes that was not mentioned in the talks that took place between Deputy Reynolds and John Major is not living in the real world.  They are not facing the reality of modern society and democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When two people sit down to talk about peace, implicit in those talks is that the guns, bombs and bullets have <Col N="1468" /> been put away.  I may be a lone voice in saying this, but my reading of the position in Northern Ireland since the ceasefire is that the British Government has been trying to find a formula of words that would take Sinn Féin-IRA off the hook on the question of decommissioning. I have heard Michael Ancram and others claim that decommissioning is not about handing in guns overnight.  As Deputy Ellis and others stated, one could never be sure that all guns would be handed in.  We are talking about the principle of decommissioning and the recognition by an illegal organisation that a Government elected by the people is sovereign and that there will not be a dilution of democracy to allow it hold illegal guns smuggled into the country.  Decommissioning is not about handing up all guns immediately, it is about an acknowledgement that guns have to be handed up and bombs decommissioned. The question of how and when that should be done then arises.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the thinking of one of the pan-Catholic parties, namely Sinn Féin-IRA, who more than anyone want the British out to allow the Irish sit down and talk about the future.  They want peace through British withdrawal, whereas such withdrawal could be assisted by peace.  If the IRA were to decommission its arms and be seen by the Protestant community in the North to do so, we could wave goodbye to John Major and the British Army. Those who believe the British will leave Ireland in advance of peace live in cloud-cuckoo-land.  The British will not be driven out of Ireland by the use of arms.  If anybody stands in the way of a solution to the Northern problem, it is IRA-Sinn Féin, those who preach from the platforms of New York and elsewhere in America.  They are not republican or nationalist, they are simply anti-British.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as unionism, nationalism or republicanism.  People <Col N="1469" /> are either anti or pro-British, which is influenced by British policies on Northern Ireland.  The people who claim they are Unionists are as Irish as I am, but they have a different way of expressing it.  They are Unionists only because they believe in the British Government's policies on Northern Ireland and those who are anti-British are anti-British only because they oppose British policies on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If John Major were to change his policies and claim he believed in a united Ireland, how long would Ian Paisley continue to be a Unionist?  How long would he continue to be pro-British?  He would not remain in that camp.  If the coin were turned, it would also follow that Gerry Adams, Mitchel McLaughlin and the other leaders of the Sinn Féin movement would become Unionists because they would believe in the British Government's policy on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The bombing in London last Friday was the greatest act of madness ever perpetrated on innocent people by, whether we like it or not, people from our tradition who were brainwashed into believing that what they did furthered the aims of the Irish people. That blindness has been our greatest curse since Cromwell's time.  Some people who condemned the bombing are not in favour of decommissioning. There is no logic to that.  Any person who condemns the violence in London should favour taking the guns, bombs and bullets off the scene.  We should stop the double think.  It is unacceptable that someone should go on television and talk about the terrible destruction caused by the bomb in London and claim that decommissioning is not an issue.  Decommissioning will always be an issue because one million people in the North have no great desire to have members of the IRA living next door to them.  That is a problem for the IRA, but in continuing its violent campaign it <Col N="1470" /> is preventing the legitimate Government of this House and people who believe in constitutional politics from communicating with one million Protestant Irish in the North.</P>
    <P>David Trimble has put forward a proposal for an elected assembly.  Pan-Catholic parties view him as putting another block in the way of peace talks. Let us consider David Trimble's position. For the past 25 years the Protestant people in the North adopted a blunt, unambiguous, unapologetic, deliberate position &mdash; they would never talk to Sinn Féin.  A new leader has taken over the party and he is looking for a mandate from the people he represents to give him the authority to sit down with the people who have been killing them for the past 25 years.  What is unreasonable about that?  I am not flying the flag for David Trimble but I can understand his position and it is time for people who should have greater vision to understand also.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago I floated the idea of an electoral system, such as that now being proposed by David Trimble, to Protestant and Catholic leaders in the North.  I walked the streets of Belfast trying to communicate that message and also came into this House to outline the views of Protestant people in the North whose voice was never heard in the South.  People criticised me, called me a Unionist and a west-Brit and said I was pro-British simply because I tried to communicate to this House the views of one quarter of the Irish nation.  I was criticised by people whose political parties signed a pledge to do everything to unite the country and promote the Irish language, and failed in both, who could not buy a ticket to Belfast and never spoke to a Protestant Irishman, but they knew how to settle the Irish question.</P>
    <P>When I spoke about these matters in this House 20 years ago I floated the idea of an election but I heard the same criticism from both sides of the House. I was told that elections would generate <Col N="1471" /> emotion, that there would be all kinds of distractions and that election campaigns would go off the rails and we would reverse the whole process.  In talking about that, I was reminded that Members are not elected directly by the people to the Seanad but by county councillors.  Why can we not have a forum in Northern Ireland elected by local councillors made up of 40 or 50 members from all sections of the community who could sit down and talk about peace and reconciliation?  Why has someone not thought of that in the recent past?  Holding an election in which candidates are directly elected by the people is not acceptable because too many people have taken up positions. The proposal for elections will not work because it would require a climb-down on the part of some people and in Ireland that is not done.</P>
    <P>I appeal to people like David Trimble, Gerry Adams, John Hume, Dr. John Alderdice and Dr. Ian Paisley, representing the broad spectrum of people in Northern Ireland, the Government and all parties in this House to consider the idea of a forum elected by local councillors in Northern Ireland.  Such a development would be devoid of emotion because people would know who they want to represent them.  There are other ways of doing that but the structure to which I referred, namely, the Seanad, is the one closest to my heart.</P>
    <P>Whether we or Sinn Féin like it or not, illegal guns are illegal guns and any Government that tries to legalise them is not acting in the best interests of democracy.  We constantly hear Sinn Féin spokespersons calling on the British Government to do this or that but when they are asked to condemn the violence in London, they give the stock answer that they are not in the business of condemnation, they have listened to condemnation for 25 years and it does not work.  They then proceed to criticise John Major, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste <Col N="1472" /> and everybody who disagrees with them.  Sinn Féin is in the business of condemnation.  I know people in Sinn Féin who have condemned the atrocity in London last week but they are afraid to say so publicly.</P>
    <P>I stated last week that I believe Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness did not know about the plan to cause an explosion in London.  I now believe they did not know because those around them did not tell them but I am not convinced that the decision to detonate the bomb was not taken by people very close to the leadership of Sinn Féin.  If I have to be convinced in that regard, approximately one million Protestant people in the North, who are part of this equation and with whom we must some day sit down and work out our future on this island, must be convinced also. If Sinn Féin cannot convince them, we are going nowhere.</P>
    <P>I have heard people talk about John Major playing politics with Northern Ireland.  Perhaps he is because he is protecting his back; he wants the support of the Unionist party.  We all forget, however, that every party in this House has played politics with Northern Ireland.  Every one of us, some more than others, is guilty of playing politics with Northern Ireland.  When the troubles first broke out in Northern Ireland people here said: &ldquo;It will be all right.  As long as it does not interfere with us, we will be all right&rdquo;.  We have played politics with Northern Ireland and the sad fact is that regardless of who is in power in the United Kingdom or here, that will continue until such time as a solution is found.  A solution will not be found, however, until David Trimble can convince one million Protestants that he is prepared to sit down at a table to discuss their future with us and ours with them.</P>
    <P>I have spoken many times in this House on this topic.  We have not learned anything since 1969.  We talk all <Col N="1473" /> the time about &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;, Catholic parties, Nationalist republicans, etc. and in so doing imply that the one million Protestants in Northern Ireland are second-class citizens.  If we are sincere about bringing the peoples of Ireland together in nationhood, we must recognise that there will have to be first-class citizenship for all.  We must be entitled to express our political views and practise our faith.  When we feel free to do so, when people in the South, particularly Sinn Féin, recognise that there are two valid arguments on this island, one held by one million Protestant Irish people in the North and a different view held by three million Irish Catholics, we will be getting close to recognising the real way forward.</P>
    <P>Gerry Adams has a choice to make. He has to decide whether he wants to return to violence or stay in constitutional politics.  I pray he follows the constitutional road.  If he does this he will fall out with former friends.  When Michael Collins did this there was a civil war, when Eamon de Valera did it six years later he fell out with close friends and when Sean McBride did it in the 1930s he also fell out with close friends.  The history of republicanism has been a split between those who want to pursue violence and those who want to be involved in constitutional politics.  I hope Gerry Adams uses whatever influence he has to steer people away from violence.  The choice is his and he cannot be ambivalent. Being slightly constitutional has been the curse of this country.</P>

      <P>Last Friday night's bombing in London and the breakdown of the 17 months IRA ceasefire is a tragedy which should not and need not have happened and must not be allowed to continue.  The peace process must be put back together before a further tragedy occurs and Sinn Féin must ask the IRA to stop the violence before it spreads throughout Ireland and England.  There is no justification for <Col N="1474" /> violence and the peace process must be proceeded with as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
      <P>The peace process was a tremendous achievement of which Irish people throughout the world felt justly proud. It was also admired by other nations.  It was mainly created by Irish people and sustained by them and the Nationalist and Unionist communities in the North. The republican and loyalist paramilitaries held their ceasefires with great discipline.</P>
      <P>The peace process was mainly brought about as a result of the courage of, and risks taken by, republican and loyalist organisations as well as political leaders such as John Hume, Deputy Albert Reynolds and Gerry Adams.  A sustained campaign of violence would be a major setback to the growth of the Irish economy, North and South.  People seeking employment here will suffer in different ways as a result of Friday night's bomb.  For example, there is a fear among tourism interests that bookings for this year could be cancelled because of the threat of further violence. The tourism industry has great potential for growth, not only in Ireland but worldwide.  In County Kerry approximately 11,000 people are employed in the industry and the same applies to new industries and service projects.</P>
      <P>The long suffering people of Northern Ireland deserve better than the prospect they now face.  They have endured 25 years of terrible violence and conflict and do not want to go through it again.  Over the past 17 months discussions were held on projects for the improvement of economic and social conditions and progress was made, security was scaled down, cross-Border roads were reopened and there was new hope for a better life for everyone. I was very sorry this evening to hear that British troops are again being deployed on Border roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the ceasefire is restored the country <Col N="1475" /> will benefit and the North and South will be brought closer together.  It is imperative that there are no further acts of violence by any side as each act will make the restoration of peace under any reasonable conditions very difficult.  The breakdown in the ceasefire was a breach of the IRA's definitive commitment to peace and of subsequent statements by Sinn Féin leaders.  On the other hand, serious questions must be asked about the actions of John Major's Government. The British Government granted early release to some of its soldiers and loyalist paramilitaries who had been convicted of serious crimes.  If 50 republican prisoners in the North had been given early release it is almost certain that the ceasefire would be intact today.</P>
    <P>My party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern stated:</P>
    <P>In the Anglo-Irish Agreement the British Government promised to work together with the Irish Government to accommodate the rights and identities of the two traditions.  The British unilaterally announced an elected body without any proper consultation with the Irish Government the day the Mitchell report was published. This was a clear breach of the spirit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>Why did the British Government never publicly say to the Unionists that it was time for them to talk to Sinn Féin? Serious questions must be asked about why the Labour and Liberal Democratic Parties sided with the British Government at peace talks, meetings and consultations. In recent months the British Government seemed to abandon its commitment to early all-party talks which were clearly referred to in the Framework Document.  The political resources were deployed in the opposite direction, to put up new obstacles to progress.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months the British <Col N="1476" /> Government failed to provide any credible or broadly acceptable route for all-party talks.  Outwardly, it appears that it made no effort to urge the Unionists to engage in talks.  The British Prime Minister and his Government risked the peace process by not making positive progress towards negotiations.  This exposed the process to huge risks and placed it under severe strain.  The atmosphere which would have ensured serious all-party talks with Sinn Féin and the Unionists was spoiled from the beginning when the British Government questioned the IRA's ceasefire statement. It then imposed an unrealistic precondition of decommissioning, against which it was warned by successive Irish Governments and which created a serious obstacle.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the British Government selected one option only from the Mitchell report immediately after it was published, the proposed elected body. Elections in Northern Ireland could pose problems for the British and Irish Governments.  There could also be serious problems for the people of Northern Ireland during the election campaigns.  The Mitchell report should be further studied by the British and Irish Governments in their efforts to find a solution to decommissioning and pave the way for all-party talks.  The British Prime Minister opted for elections in Northern Ireland instead of adopting the Mitchell report in its entirety as the way forward.  A further question arises as to whether the British Government was listening any longer to the advice of the Irish Government.  I firmly support the proposals for a United States peace envoy to help resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>A further major effort is required to mobilise public support for peace.  I welcome John Hume's proposal for holding a referendum North and South at the same time.  I am not convinced of the necessity for elections in Northern Ireland given that they are likely to give <Col N="1477" /> rise to new obstacles to all-party talks during the campaign.  The peace process and the talks process must be treated as one if political progress is to be restored and maintained.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Last Friday night's bombing by the IRA outraged and horrified every person who felt that the peace process was being turned on its head after 17 months.  The peace process brokered over 16 months ago by Deputy Albert Reynolds, the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, John Major, John Hume, Jim Molyneaux and Gerry Adams was based on trust and brought about following long and protracted negotiations.</P>
      <P>Over the past 16 months people, North and South, have enjoyed a peaceful Ireland without the bomb and bullet, daily killings, injuries or damage to property which had been the norm over the previous 25 years.  People in the North were able to go about their daily business without the fear of being killed or maimed.  There were extensive economic benefits, jobs were beginning to come on stream and there was financial support from the EU and the US.  Since last Friday a number of business people who had intended to invest in Northern Ireland have signalled that they will no longer do so because of the bombing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a time for provocative words or hysterical language.  We are all outraged by the bombing in London but always believed in our hearts that there would be setbacks along the road to peace.  When the peace initiative was brokered the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, said there would be times when people would lose faith but that we would have to strengthen our <Col N="1478" /> resolve to overcome any setbacks and get the process back on the rails.  We must strengthen our resolve in this regard, and this debate has enabled all political parties to come together to do this.</P>
    <P>The IRA must realise that the people of Ireland do not want a return to violence. Also, John Major must stand accused of not playing his part in moving the peace process along the road to a final solution.  I have no doubt that his delaying tactics, his pandering to the bigotry and entrenched opinions of the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland and his continuous creation of road-blocks to all-party talks have led to the situation we are in today.</P>
    <P>President Clinton visited, and we were promised all-party talks by the end of February.  It did not seem that those talks would take place.  We had the Mitchell report, and it was generally ignored by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major.  Instead we had talk of elections which, in the North, have not been helpful in the past.  Certainly, John Hume would not go down the road of holding elections at this time.</P>
    <P>John Hume has played a major role in trying to keep the peace process on track in recent months.  In many ways he has risen above the <i>status quo</i> of petty local politics in Northern Ireland in trying to ensure that we do not have a return to the violence and hatred we had over 25 years, but his concern, efforts and sacrifices were not matched with any great degree of urgency or support by the British or Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>When an opportunity for peace arises after years of violence and suffering, surely we should have men and women in positions of leadership here and in the United Kingdom with the vision and, more important, the courage to grasp such an opportunity with open arms and not let it slip back to the men of violence as now seems to be happening. With the exception of the <Col N="1479" /> Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, we do not have people of such courageous leadership. The continuous &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; attitude of the Unionist leadership &mdash; David Trimble, Ian Paisley, John Taylor and others &mdash; is a shirking of their responsibilities to the people they represent. It seems they would prefer to see the violence continue in Northern Ireland with resultant death and injury to their people than develop the opportunity for permanent peace from the ceasefire we have had in the past 17 months.</P>
    <P>What we need from the Unionist leadership at this time is a de Klerk with the guts, courage and ability to see the unique opportunity that exists for peace on our island and lead his or her people down the road to a lasting and peaceful solution.  That opportunity may never come again in our lifetime.  We cannot afford to abandon such an opportunity. I believe Mr. Trimble has the ability to be such a leader, but has he the courage or vision to become a legend in his own lifetime?</P>
    <P>We have heard much talk about isolating Gerry Adams but, as the US Ambassador stated clearly on radio yesterday, there can be no peace process without him.  I concur with that view. Mr. Adams played a major role in brokering the peace process and keeping it on track.  He can and will encourage the IRA to put the peace process back on the rails and should be given every support by the Irish and UK Governments. To slam the door in his face or stop the dialogue with him at this time will only lead to a complete breakdown in the peace process.</P>
    <P>It is time to set a date for all-party talks, to stop the waiting and delaying tactics which have gone on for far too long.  The only way forward is for all sides to sit down around a table for inclusive all-party discussions to take place, and ensure that we do not hand back the Northern problem to the men <Col N="1480" /> of violence who controlled it for 25 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I condemn absolutely the outrageous and terrible carnage imposed on the innocent people of London at Canary Wharf last Friday evening.  It was a grave tragedy and nobody has the authority to inflict such atrocities on innocent people and cause millions of pounds worth of damage to property.</P>
      <P>For centuries Northern Ireland has been a political tragedy of the gravest human proportions.  Many people in Northern Ireland, and in the United Kingdom, have failed to grasp that.  We have experienced 25 years of violent war.  Three thousand people have lost their lives and 30,000 have been injured. Damage costing millions of pounds has been done to property and both sides on this island have suffered economic losses amounting to billions of pounds.</P>
      <P>Throughout, there was only one reasonable, sincere and sane voice, that of the great Nationalist leader, John Hume, who worked incessantly to bring about political progress and rid Northern Ireland of the terrible violence.  He used every opportunity in every forum in Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the European Parliament and elsewhere to focus international attention on the problems of Northern Ireland and get support for his efforts.  He talked to the leader of Sinn Féin and was berated for doing so by Members of this House and people in this part of the country.  He is a brave man, an excellent politician, and he ploughed forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no progress until Deputy Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach in November 1992, but he never got the credit he deserved.  He has now been grudgingly given credit in this House and outside for his role in brokering peace on our island.  Peace came about because a political leader, the leader of <Col N="1481" /> Nationalist Ireland at the time, was prepared to listen, to assess, to give credibility to the efforts of two Nationalist leaders in Northern Ireland, John Hume and Gerry Adams.</P>
    <P>Peace was achieved as a result of the efforts of the team that worked behind the scenes to condition the people of Northern Ireland to peace.  On 31 August 1994 we had an IRA cessation of violence, unconditional and without equivocation as to duration or otherwise. It was not easily achieved, but the Joint Declaration of December 1993 which gave hope of parity of esteem, equality of opportunity, and absolute democratic rights for all people in Northern Ireland made it possible to go forward to 31 August 1994 when peace was, ultimately, achieved.  At that time the IRA, through Sinn Féin, gave certain commitments to the Government of Ireland on the basis that there would be all-party political dialogue.  That, in turn, was negotiated with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major and, ultimately, peace was achieved.</P>
    <P>Immediately the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, announced the setting up of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  Within one week he met John Hume and Gerry Adams and was berated by Members of this House for doing so.  Others, now deeply involved in the peace process, chose not to be available for that meeting because it was not politically correct to attend and high risk.  However, Deputy Reynolds kept the process moving and drove the peace initiative forward so nobody could accuse him of procrastination.  He wanted to ensure political dialogue would be utilised and all-party talks would commence.</P>
    <P>It was a tragedy that so soon after that certain political events destroyed the opportunity for further progress.  It is now political history that a covert effort by three people, all of whom had legal qualifications, ensured that Deputy Reynolds was forced out of <Col N="1482" /> Government in November 1994.  Since then the peace initiative has lacked the drive that existed heretofore.  The international community was shocked that something that happened 30 years before could bring down a democratically elected Government.</P>
    <P>Today we have a Government voted into office by this Parliament but without a mandate from the people. Members of that Government when in office in the past refused to talk to, negotiate with or recognise Sinn Féin and not allow elected members of Sinn Féin on this part of the island to be part of official delegations.  It is those people who have the task of developing the peace initiative and it is obvious there will be a slowing down of momentum.</P>
    <P>The Unionist leadership did not want to be part of the political dialogue with Sinn Féin.  The British Prime Minister then proposed decommissioning, which was accepted by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on no fewer than two occasions and by the Taoiseach in Dublin Airport in March 1995 before he went to the United States of America.  Sir Patrick Mayhew had put forward this proposal, the media then questioned the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste about it and they agreed it could be considered.</P>
    <P>During the present stand-off there is a serious vacuum.  The Unionists led by David Trimble, Ian Paisley and others with the United Kingdom Government led by John Major are on one side, the Nationalist community led by John Hume and Gerry Adams are on the other and in the centre is the leader of Nationalist Ireland, the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton.  Never before in political history was there such support from Irish America and the US President. It behoves the Taoiseach and his Government to fill the vacuum and they will have the support of President Clinton to bring about political talks that will give rights to people who have been elected in Northern Ireland so that the <Col N="1483" /> people of Ireland can enjoy the peace, tranquillity, mutual respect, economic growth and prosperity that has been experienced during the past 18 months. There is a grave responsibility on the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Government who have the support of the international community.</P>
    <P>It is time we recognised that it was the attitude of the United Kingdom and Unionist Northern Ireland that got rid of democratic political representation as far back as 1927 because the working class Protestant people in Northern Ireland were gaining strength.  The same situation prevails today.  David Trimble has called for elections because he wants to assess his position in Unionist Northern Ireland.  He is not worried about Nationalists.  It is up to the leader of the Government with the support of Irish America to ensure the talks commence immediately before further lives are lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all share a sense of revulsion at events in east London on Friday night.  The peace process was shattered but I hope it has ended only temporarily.  What is most reassuring is the all-party consensus in this House and the apparent sincerity of some politicians in trying to ensure the talks on the peace process are resumed as soon as possible at the highest level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in congratulating those who have brought about the peace process and continued to work with it &mdash; the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, his predecessor, Deputy Albert Reynolds, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern and the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney.  As Members know, when one mentions names one probably omits some who should be mentioned.  The work of their predecessors from all parties should also <Col N="1484" /> be borne in mind.  During the 25 years of the troubles, politicians have acted responsibly on this part of the island.</P>
    <P>The champion of the peace process during those 25 years has been John Hume, as others have so rightly mentioned. He has gone through hell and high water and I would say his private life is virtually non-existent.  He has devoted himself unselfishly and bravely to the cause of justice and peace and all things that are good on this island.  We should also remember his deputy leader, Mr. Seamus Mallon.  I dread to think what will happen when we lose such people.  There is only so much an individual can take and John Hume has worked well above the call of duty.  I am disappointed that he has not been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize because I do not know of anyone who is as entitled to it as he.</P>
    <P>I include also the present leader of Sinn Féin because I believe he has made an honest effort to bring about peace on this island.  He has had to endure taunts, insults and denigration on a daily basis from people of whom we would expect more.  His political opponents on the Unionist side have been less than magnanimous. Initially, we were quite sceptical about Mr. Adams's motives and abilities but we now recognise the sincerity of his work and this should not go without comment.  Sinn Féin has shown in the past 16 to 18 months considerable ability in articulating its views, whether it be by Gerry Adams, Mitchel McLaughlin, Pat Doherty or Martin McGuinness.  This has played a major part in maintaining the peace process for such a lengthy period.  I am quite sure, although it is only a supposition, that Gerry Adams's life must be under serious threat not just from militants on the Unionist side but from extreme hardliners on the Republican side.  They deserve great credit for holding the line.</P>
    <P>The British have made many mistakes. I am sure at times they meant <Col N="1485" /> well but they have the ability not to understand the politics of Ireland.  It is an historical inability going back hundreds of years.  A major turning point I believe was the replacement of the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Brooke.  He had shown that he understood the considerable problems which affect relationships between republicans and Unionists on this island. It was a grave mistake by the British Prime Minister, John Major, to have him replaced as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland because I believe that the peace talks would be in progress if he had remained.  One of the tragedies is that a man who understood the position was replaced at such a critical time. I do not know if other Members of the House had an insight into where the talks on the peace process were leading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this serious issue. The background is that approximately one million people were slaughtered in the horrible genocide in Rwanda a couple of years ago.  It is possible that we could now face another human catastrophe of similar proportions.  The Government of Zaire is poised to rid its country of in excess of one million refugees from Rwanda.  Voluntary repatriation has failed miserably.  The refugees have refused to leave as they fear revenge killings if they return to Rwanda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the refugees are Hutu.  It was mainly the Tutsis who were massacred in the appalling genocide a couple of years ago.  Clearly, there is a score to settle and many objective observers believe that the Government of Rwanda wants to settle it.  Therefore, it wants the refugees back in their country.  There is no judicial system in Rwanda and no <Col N="1486" /> justice.  There are holding centres and already 60,000 people are held in stinking and rotting captivity.  These vile conditions virtually sickened President Robinson when she visited Rwanda. There may be a benign reason for Rwanda seeking to have the refugees back.  However, the record last year in Kibeho is not encouraging.  There was a decision to disperse throughout the country 7,000 or 8,000 refugees who gathered there.  When they resisted through fear they were all slaughtered without mercy by the Rwandan Army.</P>
    <P>The proposed repatriation is not voluntary. Much of my information is from GOAL whicf has people on the ground working in the camps, particularly in the Kibumba camp which was the one first selected by the Zairean authorities for forced repatriation.  The Rwandan Government has announced its intention to tax donations to that country at the rate of 60 per cent.  It will require NGOs to hand over vehicles to it and when they leave or are forced to leave it will confiscate all their assets.  It has announced that it regards these measures as a good way of raising funds but has not taken any steps to help refugees return to their own country in safety.</P>
    <P>The Government of Zaire now says it will expel all refugees and, clearly, wants to be rid of the problem.  It has announced its intention to surround camps with troops leaving only a corridor open to Rwanda and has commenced with the camp in Kibumba where GOAL operates.  I know the Minister of state is concerned about this and that we cannot do very much on our own.  Can we seek to have an international force stationed in Rwanda to protect and ensure the safety of refugees if they are forced to return to Rwanda?  If that is not possible can we seek to obtain UN and other international support to ensure Zaire continues to provide a safe refuge for the one million Rwandan refugees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising an important issue concerning the welfare of Rwandan refugees in the camps in Zaire.  My Department is closely monitoring the situation in Kibumba camp and the Goma region.  This involves ongoing and regular contact with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees via our permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva.  As the Deputy will recall, the UNHCR has responsibility for the care and maintenance of refugees in these camps as well as a co-ordinating role with the Government of the countries of asylum for the return of refugees.  My Department also maintains close contact with Irish NGOs in Goma and Rwanda as well as with our EU partners and the UN Human Rights Mission in Rwanda.  Our understanding is that the UNHCR has worked intensively in recent months with regional Governments, including the Governments of Zaire and Rwanda, to make arrangements for the voluntary organised return of refugees.  They have agreed on the need to take concerted measures to give a new impetus to repatriation and on the importance of taking steps against intimidators in refugee camps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following these discussions the Zairean Government announced its intention to embark on a programme of camp closures.  On Tuesday, 13 February, a unit of Zairean troops surrounded Kibumba camp.  This camp is only a few kilometres from Rwanda and has the same relationship to it as Tallaght has to the Dublin Mountains.  The Zairean Minister of the Interior announced that the intention is to prevent the residents of the camp engaging in commercial activity and thus encourage refugees to return voluntarily to Rwanda.  The UNHCR sought and received assurances that troops will not go inside the camps to force refugees to depart.  The Zairean authorities have also said they <Col N="1488" /> will not enforce a deadline.  The heads of the main international agencies, including the UN special representative, are in Goma and direct contact with senior Ministers of the Zairean Government. The UNHCR is standing by to transport those who wish to return to Rwanda.</P>
    <P>Our information is that on Tuesday, 13 February, 40 people left the camp voluntarily.  Today, at 11 a.m., the figure was 91.  Our latest information is that the situation remains calm and that normal relief activities are continuing, including the distribution of food, fuel and water.  The circumstances are volatile and much depends on the good faith and discipline of the Zairean side.</P>
    <P>We have raised with the UNHCR and the aid agencies our specific concerns about the welfare of aid workers working with the Irish aid agencies in Zaire. We have been assured that contingencies are in place to evacuate personnel if the situation deteriorates from a security perspective.  The decision of the Zairean Government to secure the camps in Kibumba yesterday raised understandable fears in the public mind that Zaire was resorting to enforced repatriation of refugees by violent methods on the lines witnessed last August.  Our position on this issue is clear: we will not condone the use of violence to force Rwandan refugees in Zaire to return to their homes in Rwanda.  This is also the position of our EU partners, some of whom are providing police advisers to the UNHCR on security within the camps.</P>
    <P>On several occasions in recent weeks the Tánaiste briefed the House on the situation of Rwandan refugees in the neighbouring states of Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi.  We must be aware that local people in these countries, particularly in Zaire and Tanzania, are considerably worse off than the refugees under international protection and fed by the international community.  That is not an inconsiderable factor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> The Government considers that the voluntary and organised return of refugees is central to a solution of the political and humanitarian crisis in the Great Lakes region.  In addition, it has repeatedly made clear that efforts to promote regional stability and encourage large-scale voluntary organised repatriation, including the efforts of former President Carter, have our fullest support.  We recently received a detailed briefing from Julius Nyerere, the former President of Tanzania, who has also been making efforts to secure peace in the region.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity to see the situation in the camps at first hand last October when I accompanied President Robinson on her visit to Goma and Kibumba camp.  The assessments of Zairean, NGO and UN officials then &mdash; as now &mdash; point to the need for decisive action against intimidators from the former Rwandan Government who operate in the camps to discourage ordinary refugees from returning to their homes in Rwanda.  We must bear in mind that many of the Hutu refugees who are in the camps in Zaire were involved in the perpetration of genocide against the Tutsis.</P>
    <P>My impression, which has been confirmed by correspondence, is that most people simply want to go home, but there is great intimidation from the Interhamwe and other elements among Hutu militants.  Within Rwanda we have been assured that contingency plans are in place to prepare for increased numbers of returning refugees and facilitate their safe return to their homes.  The planning involves close co-operation between the Government of Rwanda, the UNHCR, international aid agencies and the UN Human Rights Field Operation for Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The Deputy rightly expressed concern about the safety of Rwandan refugees on return to their homes and the humanitarian crisis in the prisons in Rwanda.  This issue must be considered <Col N="1490" /> against the repeated statement by the Rwandan Government of its commitment to refugee return and its active co-operation with the UNHCR and aid agencies in planning for such a return. When in that country last October we expressed very forcefully to the Rwandan Government our concerns on these issues.  There have been some improvements in the judicial system since then, including the appointment of a supreme court.  We stated our view that conditions in which prisoners are held are unacceptable.  At the same time we have made available considerable financial support to the International Committee of the Red Cross which is working with the Government to relieve prison overcrowding.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the fact that the 1994 genocide was a major catastrophe for Rwanda.  Close to one million Rwandan people were killed and some people estimate that between one and two million Rwandan people could be criminally implicated in these killings.  The genocide has caused the collapse of the justice system and led to the huge problem of prison overcrowding.  Alleviating the crisis in the prisons in Rwanda requires urgent international action and must be accompanied by a coherent sustained strategy to rebuild Rwanda's justice system so as to allow the domestic judicial process to get under way as quickly and effectively as possible.  I have expressed my disappointment that no effective indictments of the perpetrators of genocide were made by the international tribunal.  It is extremely difficult for Tutsis and moderate Hutus to understand and appreciate that.</P>
    <P>As the Tánaiste outlined in his reply on 7 February, the Government has dispersed a total of £6.9 million for emergency relief and rehabilitation efforts in the Rwandan region since 1994.  The assistance has been channelled through the Irish relief agencies and the Rwandan Government and to multilateral agencies.  The objective of our assistance <Col N="1491" /> has been to support international efforts to bring relief to refugees and restore the judicial system and the rule of law in Rwanda.  Last year the Government spent more than £1.35 million on the justice sector and human rights initiatives in Rwanda.  Assistance was provided for communal police training and to restore legal structures in the Ministries of Justice and the Interior.  The Government also allocated grants to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the UN Human Rights Field Operation and for the UN High Commission for Human Rights programme to rehabilitate the system of justice in Rwanda.  The Government will continue to work politically and on the humanitarian front to find solutions to the complex and intractable problems of the Great Lakes region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment to highlight the trauma and anxiety experienced by parents and children in the Ballyphehane-Greenmount area due to the failure in early January to offer them second-level school places in their immediate catchment area.  Eleven children were denied places in second-level schools in the Ballyphehane area and three in the Greenmount area.  A similar problem arose last year, with more than 30 children failing to secure places.  Considerable distress and anger was caused and the problem was eventually resolved following prolonged agitation and negotiation. I was involved in discussions, as was the Department, with the parties concerned and was of the understanding that arrangements were made which would avoid a recurrence of similar difficulties this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, difficulties arose again this year.  We should never underestimate the worry and emotional upset caused to children in these circumstances. When they return from school <Col N="1492" /> anxiously asking their distressed parents if the letter of acceptance from the secondary school has arrived, a negative reply results in an enormous sense of exclusion for them and reduces their self-esteem and confidence.  They wonder what they did wrong.</P>
    <P>Since I first tabled this question places have been secured for the children involved.  I urge the Minister to ensure a similar problem does not arise next year.  Satisfactory arrangements should be put in place to ensure children do not have to suffer such trauma again.  Children should not be used as pawns.  I am not sure why there was an apparent stand-off in this instance between the parties involved and the Department.  I thought that since the matter had been discussed last year and it was articulated that this would not happen again, it was satisfactorily resolved.  I hope the Minister will assure me that arrangements are in place to ensure the problem does not arise again next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Martin for raising this matter. The Deputy will be aware that last year a similar problem arose for some 30 sixth class pupils, all boys, leaving primary schools in the Ballyphehane, Greenmount, Togher and Glasheen areas of Cork city in securing second level school places for September 1995. In response, my Department held consultations with all the relevant school authorities, primary and post-primary, with a view to identifying the full scope of the problem and to seek their active co-operation in ensuring that all the children concerned would be accommodated. As a result of these consultations, sufficient places were made available in second level schools in the area for all the children concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avoid a repeat of this problem in the lead up to the next school year, my Department has been <Col N="1493" /> closely monitoring the position with a view to establishing the demand for, and the availability of, second level places in the area for next September.  This process has involved regular consultation with the local primary and post-primary school authorities.</P>
    <P>The information available to my Department earlier this month indicated that of the 130 boys approximately in the general area seeking second level places for next September, ten or 11 from the Morning Star and Greenmount primary schools were still unplaced.  However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that further contacts with the local post-primary schools have resulted in places being secured in their local community for all these children.  I wish to take this opportunity also to say that my Department appreciates very much the co-operation and goodwill demonstrated by the post-primary schools concerned in resolving this problem.  The question of adequate post-primary provision in future years for this area of Cork city will be kept under review by my Department.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank the Chair for allowing me the opportunity to raise this issue and the Minister for coming in to reply to it.  This debate highlights the dumping and discovery of chemical canisters along our coastline, particularly on the south and south east coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three canisters were found in west Cork, two in east Cork and several in Wexford during recent weeks.  An Army investigation into this matter is being carried out.  Yesterday I listened to a member of the Army on &ldquo;News at One&rdquo;<Col N="1494" /> outline in detail the serious consequences for people who come in contact with these lethal chemical canisters. He pointed out that the public should not handle them and, if found, they should notify the Garda or the Army which would take the appropriate action to deal with them.  The discovery of such dangerous chemicals is a matter of grave concern.  It is important that the Minister, Deputy Barrett, should investigate their source.  The Army and the Navy should be utilised to examine the markings on the canisters to trace them to their country of origin and appropriate action should be initiated against those responsible.  From listening to that member of the Army yesterday.  I gathered that the canisters could have been used as military markers at sea.  I would like the Minister to confirm if that is the case.</P>
    <P>Our coasts are widely used by the public, fishermen and tourists.  I hope that the discovery of these canisters will not pose a danger to the public.  There is concern that the Irish coast is being used constantly as a dumping ground for dangerous chemicals by passing ships and, if that were allowed to continue, it could cause problems for our fishing and tourism industries.</P>
    <P>In recent years an estimated 2,000 dangerous objects have been washed up along the Irish and British coasts.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, has outlined here on numerous occasions during the past 12 months that he asked the UK Government to clarify details of arms dump sites off the south eastern and north eastern coasts.  The UK Government has admitted that such dumping has occurred since 1920, but some of the answers it has given to the Minister of State have been fairly evasive.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the potential dangers posed by such canisters. Fishermen and members of the public have contacted me about this matter. This issue was raised initially by the <Col N="1495" /> media and a member of the Army outlined the seriousness of this matter on yesterday's &ldquo;News at One&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>People using our waters and beaches are concerned about the potential danger posed by those canisters.  Will the Minister clarify the validity of headlines which stated that canisters containing lethal chemical gases were found on the south east and southern coasts?  Will he allay the fears of local residents in this regard and outline the investigations carried out to date to ascertain the country of origin of such canisters? It is important to allay fears as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for allowing me the opportunity to contribute to this debate and the Minister for coming in to reply to it.  His presence is an indication of the seriousness which which he treats this matter.</P>
      <P>Anything I say this evening will not overstate the case.  When the words &ldquo;should not be touched&rdquo; or &ldquo;gases that are highly dangerous&rdquo; are used by members of the Garda or the Army in connection with these canisters, people become concerned.  Many of my friends walk the coastline in search of bits and pieces, kindling and more profitable material, but people have been warned not to touch these canisters.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Browne said, these canisters have been washed up in coastal areas in Cork and Wexford and late this evening one was discovered up in Ardamine on the east coast.  They seem to be heading for the Minister's constituency, and I am not being facetious in saying that.  Fishermen, and children and adults who walk our beaches will become curious if they discover such canisters.  It appears the most dangerous objects since mines were introduced during World War II are being washed up on our coasts.  For that reason we must treat this matter seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> Army forensic people, who have analysed the gas contained in those canisters, have said it is deadly when mixed with water.  The canisters measure 17 inches in length and five inches in diameter and their origin is unknown.  That is a major cause of concern.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in some publications yesterday that those canisters may have fallen off ships.  Like Deputy Browne and others, I would like to know where they come from and why they were dumped off the south coast.  Recently the dumping at sea legislation was introduced, which I welcomed.  Do others consider that legislation a joke because of our lax treatment of the British Government in relation to the dumping of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea?  The Government has a serious responsibility to tell us where the canisters came from and the action that will be taken to deal with those who have caused this problem.</P>

      <P>The marine emergency service of the Department of the Marine has been in contact with the Army and the Garda to establish the source of the canisters in question and the hazards which they may pose for shipping, fishing operations and the general public.  The canisters which have been washed up on our shores to date are empty and have posed no danger.  They have been identified as marker location marine canisters or smoke candles, as they are commonly known.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are approximately 16 inches in length and three to five <Col N="1497" /> inches in diameter.  I am advised that they are normally used during military exercises for marking areas.</P>
      <P>To date this year nine canisters were found at various locations.  I am not aware of the discovery of the recent canister to which Deputy Byrne referred.  If he wishes to table a question, I will supply him with an answer immediately.  One canister was found at Ravenpoint in County Wexford, one at Ballinesher, County Wexford, three at Inchydonney, County Cork, one at Arklow, County Wicklow, one at Ardmore, County Waterford, one at Kilmore Quay, County Wexford and one at Rosslare, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>The canisters washed up in Wexford, Wicklow and Waterford are regular marine signal candles which would have contained substances that present no danger.  These type of empty canisters are washed up on our shores each year because of storms at sea.</P>
      <P>The three canisters washed up at Inchydonney are, I understand, the first of their type ever reported on our shores.  The canisters were empty.  These type of canisters contain calcium phosphide and when they come in contact with water or damp air they give off smoke and phosphine gas for about five minutes.  This should not be confused with the much more lethal nerve gas phosgene.  The military authorities have initiated inquiries with a view to establishing the source of these canisters.</P>
      <P>Empty canisters pose no danger to the public.  However, precautions must be taken in the unlikely event of full canisters being found.  A procedure to deal with such incidents is in place. When a canister is found the gardaí notify Army operations which immediately investigate the finding and on the basis of such investigation a decision will be made as to what action should be taken.  IMES will issue alert notices and navigational warnings advising mariners on how to deal with such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised by officials from <Col N="1498" /> the Marine Institute that because phosphine gas decomposes rapidly in water, these canisters are highly unlikely to pose any danger to fish stocks, about which Deputy Browne is concerned.</P>
    <P>Reports in today's newspapers, of canisters being found at Rush, have been investigated.  I am advised the canisters in question are not marine markers and pose no threat to the public.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed that the canisters may have come from the Beaufort Dyke.  I have been assured this is not the case.  This is a separate issue I am pursuing vigorously on a number of fronts.</P>
    <P>The Scottish Office recently published a report of the results of a survey carried out on the Beaufort Dyke dump site.  This survey was made in response to requests from the Department of the Marine.  While the report does not prove conclusively that the laying of the British Gas pipeline disturbed munitions in the Beaufort Dyke, the UK authorities have accepted it is likely that this was the case.  The UK authorities advised the Department that the gas pipeline will not become operational until British Gas can convince its health and safety authorities there is no risk to the environment.  This will require further studies and risk analysis. Arrangements are in place to meet with Lord Lyndsay, Minister for Agriculture and the Environment, Scottish Office and Lord Howe, UK Minister for Defence with a view to establishing a system of monitoring and managing the dump sites.  It is expected this meeting will take place within a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>Preparations are under way for a quality status report which will cover the Irish Sea.  This report will be produced jointly by the Irish and UK authorities as part of their obligations under the OSPAR Convention for the North-East Atlantic.  As a matter of priority we will examine the impact of munitions dumping.  I reassure the House that the issue of canisters being washed up on <Col N="1499" /> our shores is being monitored closely. Precautionary procedures to deal with it will continue to be followed.  The military authorities will continue their inquiries with a view to establishing the source of the canisters.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Coastal Erosion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter.  It is really a continuation of tonight's maritime theme.</P>
      <P>Coastal erosion is not a phenomenon unique to the coastline in County Louth; it is a problem all along our coastline.  We have a particular problem in County Louth, where dwelling houses and farmland are under serious threat from coastal erosion and, while it is not an immediate problem, there is also the matter of the deposition of the eroded material along the coast.</P>
      <P>Those who have inhabited County Louth longer than I have say there is clear evidence of substantial agricultural land loss because of erosion, particularly in south-east Louth, around Annagassan and along the coastline in the Cooley Peninsula.  Many of those areas have been severely affected and individual farmers and householders have taken steps to combat the serious threat posed by the sea at these points.</P>
      <P>Remedial work to tackle coastal erosion is expensive.  Some remedial work is undertaken without the benefit of proper surveys and the necessary professional advice, and in some cases the benefits are of short duration.  To tackle erosion on a long-term basis would require significant resources and I know the Minister has funding available to deal with the problem.  Meath County Council was successful in its application for grant aid to tackle coastal erosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister briefly outline the Department's policy on coastal erosion as it is a serious issue and there is a need <Col N="1500" /> for a degree of consistency in the matter? If one county procures significant grant aid and a neighbouring county is not successful, there is clearly an element of dissatisfaction.  Is the Minister prepared to give some grant aid to Louth County Council to get a worthwhile remedial scheme under way in the county?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The coastline is recognised as a resource of immense value in economic, environmental, ecological and sociological terms.  In recent years it has become generally accepted that erosion is a major threat to the coastal environment.  The coastal resource is fragile and non-renewable and the systems operating in the coastal zone will significantly depend on the preservation of the coast.</P>
      <P>Our coastline stretches for some 5,800 kilometres.  In 1992, a needs study by the National Coastal Erosion Committee of the County and City Engineers Association showed that out of the total coastline of 5,800 kilometres, some 1,500 kilometres are at risk and some 490 kilometres require immediate attention, at an approximate cost of £125 million.</P>
      <P>Erosion can also impact on local ecological environments.  Loss, for example, of sand dune systems can disrupt the natural habitats of a number of birds and other animals.  Erosion can, in certain instances, pose a social threat to isolated coastal communities.  Apart from the obvious economic disruption, erosion threatens the communications and transport links of these communities. Being cut off from the mainland would have serious and potentially catastrophic consequences for these communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the threat posed by erosion and the need for coast protection.  In 1994, the Government decided that EU Structural Funds should be made available to <Col N="1501" /> help address the serious erosion problem, and allocated moneys from the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99, amounting to £5.1 million, to tackle priority erosion problems in that five year period.</P>
    <P>The aim of the investment programme is: the preservation of the State owned foreshore, local authority owned property including county road networks, tourist amenities, including beach and dune systems and natural habitats and their ecology.  Such preservation works support rural development, tourism, environmental protection and other activities which contribute to increasing the economic potential of coastal regions.</P>
    <P>The County and City Engineers Association estimates that some £125 million is required to tackle all the most urgent erosion problems.  In view of the fact that funding under the operational programme is limited to £5.1 million, it was obvious that priority projects for possible funding under the programme needed to be identified.  Therefore, in order to draw up a targeted programme of priority coastal locations, consultations were held with coastal local authorities and submissions detailing their top four priority proposals were sought.  Given the limited funding available and demand levels, all the local authorities were advised that value for money from investments in coastal protection schemes must be achieved.</P>
    <P>In other words, the cost of undertaking any scheme must be considered against the benefits, tangible or intangible, arising.  Such benefits would include property, infrastructure, transportation, livelihoods, community concern, conservation value and commercial value.  These proposals are with the Department and works being undertaken to the end of 1999 will be chosen from among the priority proposals submitted.</P>
    <P>A number of projects identified by <Col N="1502" /> the local authorities were aided by the Department last year.  In 1995, some £773,000 was invested in protection works at ten locations: the Maharees Peninsula and Waterville in County Kerry; Courtown and Duncannon in County Wexford; Inishboffin and Roundstone in County Galway; Bertra Beach in County Mayo; Killiney County Dublin; Laytown, County Meath; and preparation work in Bray, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>To date, no works in County Louth have been grant-aided.  However, I am sure Deputy Kirk will fully understand that the funding available in any one year is limited and as a result it is only possible to undertake a small number of works in any particular year.  Louth County Council's proposals, which I will detail, will be considered along with all other priority proposals received over the remaining years of the operational programme.</P>
    <P>The proposals submitted by Louth County Council are as follows: (1) protection of a seven kilometre stretch between Greenore and Whitestown; the proposed works, which include a variety of protection measures, are estimated to cost in the region of £365,000; (2) protection of seven kilometres of coastline between Callystown, Clogherhead and Dunary Point at an estimated cost of £390,000; (3) protection of the coast at Annagassan, including reshaping the beach and providing rock armour, the cost of which is estimated at £200,000, and (4) protection of seven kilometres of coast at Clogherhead, including the beach and dune system and a number of caravan parks and holiday homes.  The works, which include a dune management scheme, will cost approximately £130,000.</P>
    <P>The total cost of these four proposals is £1,035,000.  The total cost of all the proposals submitted to the Department of the Marine exceeds £25 million. Funding over the life of the programme is limited to £5.1 million.  The House will <Col N="1503" /> appreciate, therefore, that demand levels far exceed the funding available.</P>
    <P>Final decisions remain to be taken on the programme of protection works to be undertaken in 1996.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Kirk I will bear in mind the points he made.  I share his concerns, and those of other Members who have spoken to me about the damage being caused through coastal erosion. As the House will appreciate, we are talking about huge sums of money.</P>
    <P>I have also asked my Department to contact local authorities to ascertain whether we could resort to community employment schemes, working in conjunction with local communities, to undertake some immediate works <Col N="1504" /> which, while perhaps not of the Rolls Royce type, would halt further erosion pending more moneys being made available in future years to undertake a proper job.  Perhaps some immediate works can be undertaken at reasonable cost under community employment schemes thus preventing the problem worsening. We will continue the major works planned under the operational programme.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the problems to which Deputy Kirk referred and assure him that the projects selected will be dealt with fairly, no priority being given to any one county over another.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 February 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The problems which affect our offshore island communities are complex and long standing.  This Government has, for the first time, explicitly acknowledged the unique contribution that our offshore islands make to the fabric of Irish society and has developed a strategic response to the problems they face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> As chairman of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, it gave me great satisfaction to publish the committee's report.  The report identifies and addresses the long-term issues affecting the communities on our offshore islands.  It establishes a coherent and comprehensive basis for Government policy in relation to the islands.  Finally and most importantly, it sets out a strategic framework within which future action in relation to the economic and social development of our island communities is to be pursued.</P>
    <P>One of the key strategic issues identified in the report as being crucial to the development and long-term viability of the islands is access transport &mdash; that is to say the availability of a regular, reliable and safe transport service.</P>
    <P>At local level, the relevant local authorities through their Islands committees are being asked to draw up, in conjunction with Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, expenditure proposals for the development of a minimum standard of access service.  These will be submitted to the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee for assessment.</P>
    <P>The report identifies the total level of current expenditure on island access transport services at approximately £900,000 per annum.  The Government has agreed to the consolidation of expenditure by Government Departments on island access services within a single financial envelope, which I will co-ordinate as chairman of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee. This action should significantly simplify, for islands and Government Departments alike, the present administrative arrangements in respect of funding for island access transport services.  Furthermore, I am delighted that the Government has agreed to an additional provision this year of £1 million to this financial envelope.</P>
    <P>In addition to addressing the issues of access, the report recommends that there relevant local authorities carry out a survey of their islands in order to draw up a priority list of costed works <Col N="1307" /> required to ensure a minimum standard of infrastructure on each island.  I am arranging to meet the local authorities involved in order to get this work under way.</P>
    <P>Appropriate administrative structures are key to the ongoing development of the islands.  Accordingly, and on foot of recommendations in the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee's report, important new administrative structures and mechanisms are also being established at national, regional and local level.  These mechanisms will ensure that the work being done by the many organisations involved in the development of islands will be co-ordinated and the maximum benefits gained from available resources.</P>
    <P>These new administrative relationships will ensure that the unique circumstances of island communities are given full consideration in the formulation and implementation of policies at a national, regional and local level.  The interdepartmental co-ordinating committee will remain in operation for a further period of three years to oversee the implementation of the proposals in the report.</P>
    <P>An important additional element in the Government's response to island communities is recognition of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann as a LEADER group.  Under the LEADER II programme, £1 million is being provided to the islands for economic and social development.  This is the first time that offshore islands have been separately designated for a programme such as this.  The Islands LEADER II programme is complementary to the actions being taken on foot of the report of the, interdepartmental co-ordinating committee.  Jointly, these two initiatives will make a significant contribution to the development of all island communities.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards funding, at the end of last year, I made grants totalling £120,000 to island communities in respect of a number of community development initiatives.  This funding <Col N="1308" /> included a grant of £32,000 to Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann in recognition of its important role as the representative organisation of island communities.  This grant is assisting An Chomhdháil to develop an inter-island communications network.  It will also improve the effectiveness of its operation and administration.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the wide ranging and strategically based proposals of the report of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee will be of significant assistance to all our offshore islands.  I believe that the very positive response by the Government to the proposals within the report clearly illustrates its commitment to the long-term viability of the offshore island communities.  The welcome Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann has given the proposals in the report is, I believe, a clear recognition of this commitment.</P>

      <P>Tugann mo Roinnse deontas substaintiúil bliantúil &mdash; suim £185,000 i 1995 &mdash; do Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, eagraíocht a bhfuil sé d'aidhm aige an ceol traidisiúnta a chaomhnú agus a neartú, mar chabhair chun a chuid imeachtaí uile a reachtáil. I measc na dtionscnamh faoi scáth an Chomhaltais áirítear: &mdash; Fleadh Ceoil na hÉireann agus Fleadhanna Ceoil Áitiúla &mdash; Cartlann den cheol traidisiúnta i gceanncheathrú an Chomhaltais i mBaile na Manach, Contae Bhaile Átha Cliath &mdash; Ceolchoirmeacha sa tír seo agus thar lear &mdash; Ceolfhoireann nua pobail &mdash; Ionaid Chultúrtha Réigiúnacha &mdash; Cúrsa Dioplóma sa Cheol Traidisiúnta do mhúinteoirí agus Cúrsa Teastais do Fhoghlaimeoirí; agus &mdash;<Col N="1309" /> Seimineáir agus cúrsaí do lucht foghlamtha, moltóirí agus léiritheoirí.</P>
      <P>In addition to my Department's support for traditional music I understand that An Chomhairle Ealaíon has also taken initiatives in the area.  The principal initiative taken by An Comhairle to date was the establishment in 1987 of Taisce Cheol Dúchais/The Irish Traditional Music Archive for the purpose of collecting, preserving, documenting and seminating material relating to Irish traditional music.  This body now houses what is perhaps the largest collection of such material anywhere in the world and which is freely available and accessible to allcomers.  The Archive is jointly funded by An Chomhairle and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>An Chomhairle also supports Na Píobairí Uilleann which is based in Dublin and has membership of almost 1,000 throughout Ireland and in many other countries.  My Department has also provided that organisation with funding to assist with its Pipes On Loan Scheme.</P>
      <P>Other activities supported by An Chomhairle include the Folk Music Society of Ireland and a wide range of organisations and events which are focused exclusively and specifically on the transmission of technical skills, repertory, musical insights and related matters which are at the heart of the transmission and development of Irish traditional music.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 24 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have on several occasions incidated in this House, I and my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, Minister for the Environment, established, in February 1995, an interdepartmental working group made up of officials of our Departments and of the Office of Public Works to examine and report back with recommendations on improving the protection for listed buildings, including placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis, introducing incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings and undertaking a full <Col N="1313" /> national architectural audit, pursuant to commitments in the policy agreement for Government entitled <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>To date, the working group has met on thirteen occasions, and I am informed that it is making good progress and expects to be able to submit its report within the next few months.  The working group has not been asked to prepare a report for publication but to report the recommendations of the officials for the consideration of the Minister for the Environment and myself.  I can assure the Deputies that we will give careful consideration to the report, to the introduction of any necessary new policy initiatives in this area, and to the most suitable time frame for the implementation of such initiatives having regard to the nature and extent of such initiatives.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to the preservation of monuments there has existed since 1930 a body of legislation, the National Monuments Acts, under which National Monuments have been protected. In addition, the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, introduced by me, provides for the establishment and maintenance of a record of monuments and for the public exhibition in each county of the record for that county.  These monuments are afforded protection under that Act.</P>

      <P>There already exists considerable links between arts organisations on both sides of the Border.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Northern Ireland Arts Council have held joint meetings since the mid 1970's.  Following on a meeting between myself and Michael Ancram, Minister of State for Political Development, Education and Community Relations in Northern Ireland in December, 1993, the two councils established a joint committee comprising the two chairmen, two ordinary members and the two directors.  This committee meets two or three times a year in addition to the annual joint meeting of the councils to consider areas in which co-operation can be increased.  An arts co-operation officer post co-funded by both councils was established in September, 1995.  At present, the principal remit of this officer is to encourage North-South touring by arts organisations and to bring proposals to both councils as to how this activity can be increased.  The fruits of this initiative will not be fully evident until later this year.  There is also a position of European Affairs Officer which is jointly funded by both councils and whose remit is to maximise interaction between arts organisation on both sides of the Border and EU activities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of &ldquo;The Arts Plan&rdquo;, which sets North-South co-operation as <Col N="1318" /> one of its key strategic objectives, augurs well for the continued expansion of links between arts organisations North and South.  This co-operation is ongoing, with the most recent examples being through &ldquo;L'Imaginaire Irelandais&rdquo; and the 1996 Frankfurt Book Fair.</P>
    <P>There will be strong involvement from Northern Ireland in &ldquo;L'Imaginaire Irlandais&rdquo;, the festival of Irish culture scheduled to take place in France from April-August this year.  The director of the Northern Ireland Arts Council is a member of the Irish organising committee and five of the seventeen artists to be featured in the core visual arts exhibition in Paris are from Northern Ireland.  A strong input from Northern Ireland is also expected in the other planned events.</P>
    <P>There will also be a strong involvement from Northern writers and publishers in the 1996 Frankfurt Book Fair at which Ireland has the honour of being the Focal Theme Country.  The board set up to oversee Ireland's involvement in the Fair contains representatives of the Northern Ireland Arts Council.</P>

      <P>The possibility of restoring the Ulster Canal has been the subject of talks for some time now between the waterways service and its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the watercourse management division of the Department of Agriculture.  In 1994, a scoping study of the canal was undertaken and this identified the main engineering and other difficulties which will have to be overcome should it be decided to proceed with restoration.</P>
      <P>Consideration is now being given to the undertaking of a full scale feasibility study which would endeavour to identify solutions to these difficulties and would include also a cost benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment of the project.  The availability of the necessary funding for the study is of course a prime consideration and this matter is currently being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the integrated range of strategies which I have put in place to develop the Irish film and television production industry offer significant prospects of long-term indigenous job creation in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IBEC economic database records the factual employment position in respect of all films supported by section 35 and-or Bord Scannán na hÉireann in 1993 and 1994.  This indicated that 4,191 persons or 480 full-time job equivalents. were directly employed in these projects in 1993.  For 1994 the figures were 12,784 persons, or 1,115 full-time equivalents. When employment figures are taken for both the direct and indirect impact of the State incentives, it is estimated that some 1,228 full-time job equivalents were secured in the industry in 1993 and 1,957 in 1994, representing an increase of 59 per cent over the previous year. Membership of SIPTU's film and television section gives a good index of the <Col N="1324" /> increasing level of activity in the industry. I understand that in December, 1991, the section had 496 members.  In March, 1994, this figure had increased to 735.  By the end of 1994 it stood at 815 and at the end of January, 1996, it stood at 1,292.</P>
    <P>With regard to the plans I have to review the incentives for film making, it was announced in the recent budget that section 35 will continue for a further three years.  Some modifications have been made in the current scheme having regard to the in-depth review carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants into the operation of the section 35 scheme.  The continuation of this scheme to 1999 will make a major contribution to confidence in the industry and allow for our indigenous producers to plan ahead.</P>
    <P>A key area in ensuring that we maximise the employment potential of the film industry is that of training.  Following the publication of the STATCOM report a &ldquo;Training Needs to 2000&rdquo; for the independent film and television production sector in Ireland, a national training committee for film and television production has been established to oversee the implementation of the training recommendations in the STATCOM report.  In support of this, £2.58 million is being provided to me under Ireland's Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-99 for film industry human resource development. In addition a further £250,000 annually, subject to demand, will be provided by FÁS out of its mainstream funding. Finally, STATCOM, the committee of State bodies and agencies involved with the film industry, on which my Department is represented, operates to co-ordinate the activities of these agencies so as to address the remaining obstacles to the committee's full development and to optimise the various elements of State support for the film industry.</P>

      <P>In response to a question on this issue on 14 November 1995, I explained the situation regarding the nominee of the National Youth Council of Ireland to the National Economic and Social Council.  I indicated that an offer had been made to NYCI and unfortunately, since that time, I have received no further communication from NYCI regarding their nomination.</P>
      <P>I am not refusing to accept a nomination from the NYCI to the NESC but, rather, I have requested that they make a female nomination to the council.  It is Government policy to have at least 40 per cent of both men and women in appointments to State boards and the Government has requested all the social partners to observe this gender balance in making nominations to the NESC. There are currently 33 members of the council, with a full membership of 34 if a nominee of the NYCI is agreed.  Of the 33 appointed members, 12 are women, which represents 36 per cent of the membership.  Assuming the appointment of a female NYCI nominee then the level of female representation will rise to 38 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other social partners have made <Col N="1326" /> efforts to enhance the proportion of women in their representation of the council.  I accept the difficulty that an organisation which only has one representative may have with this Government policy, however, as the representative from NYCI has always been male, I decided to request them to nominate a female representative for this term of the NESC.  I indicated, last October, to the NYCI that they may wish to nominate a male alternate for a female member of the council as a means of overcoming any difficulty.  I have received no response from the NYCI but I look forward to hearing from them.</P>

    <P>* Increase after deducting £140 million.  Equal Treatment payments from 1995 is 5.9%. The information requested by the Deputy, on the cost in 1996 of the total increases in public spending in 1995 is not readily available for the following reasons:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Central Fund Services</i>&mdash; The main element of expenditure under this heading is the cost associated with servicing the national debt.  There are many factors affecting debt service expenditure in a given year, the most important of which are fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.  The overall increase in debt service expenditure in 1995 would have resulted from the combined effect of all these various factors and it would not be practicable to cost the effect on 1996 expenditure of these changes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Capital Supply Services and Exchequer financed Capital Expenditure</i>&mdash; The change in total expenditure between 1995 and 1994 reflects the combined effect of both additions and reductions to spending across the full range of Government expenditure programmes.  These additions and reductions to spending arise from numerous different factors, the variety and complexity of which hinder attempts to calculate the total cost in 1996 of the 1995 changes in total spending.</P>
    <P>The following table shows the estimated 1996 post-budget expenditure under the main headings compared with 1995.</P>

      <P>Children requiring orthodontic treatment at secondary care level are assessed by health boards in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists according to the severity of their treatment need.</P>
      <P>The cases of greatest need are placed in category A (the most severe cases) or category B (cases with severe functional handicap) and have priority over children placed in category C (non-handicapped cases).  Category A cases receive immediate treatment, where possible. The waiting period for category B cases can range from 12 months to about 4 years.  At present there is an indefinite waiting period for category C cases.</P>
      <P>In some areas mild orthodontic conditions are treated at primary care level by health board dental surgeons who have adequate orthodontic skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.  Most health boards now have a consultant in place and are consolidating and extending their orthodontic services under the overall direction <Col N="1340" /> and supervision of the consultant.  In addition to his/her own direct clinical involvement, each consultant is required to organise and co-ordinate training for health board dentists in the provision of orthodontic treatment.  This will achieve a high level of service at a high standard and improvements in waiting periods. However, treatment will continue to be provided on a priority basis to category A and B cases.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to review the levels of nursing home subvention rates which have not been index linked since 1993; if his attention has been drawn to the increased charges being notified recently by private nursing home owners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The subvention scheme which accompanied the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 came into operation on 1 September 1993 and ensures that those most in need of care in a nursing home, and without the means to pay for it, receive assistance towards the cost.  In 1995 approximately £15 million was expended on the subvention scheme and a further £16 million has been allocated for 1996.</P>
      <P>The current levels of subvention are among the various aspects of the scheme which have been examined by a working group, comprising of officials of my Department and the health boards, which has reviewed the operation of the Nursing Homes Act.  I understand that the group has finalised this report and I expect to receive it in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have no responsibility as Minister for Health to control or regulate the fees charged by nursing homes which are private or voluntary enterprises. While the Nursing Homes Act gives new power to health boards to enforce high standards of accommodation and care in nursing homes, it respects in full the private or voluntary ownership and management of nursing homes.</P>

      <P>Following the enactment of the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum was designated a custodial treatment centre.  However, only a limited number of places are available in Dundrum and the numbers now charged and imprisoned for drug related offences are very much greater than that envisaged when the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 was enacted.  It is not considered feasible to set up a parallel detention facility to the State's penal structure to provide for the care and treatment of drug misusers, who become the responsibility of the prison authorities upon their imprisonment.</P>
      <P>However, my Department has had discussions with the Department of Justice about the services available for drug misusers in prisons and the question of designating custodial treatment centres will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>The national training strategy for the independent film and television production industry is being based on the STATCOM report entitled &ldquo;Training Needs to 2000&rdquo; which was carried out by a project team in FÁS and was launched by me on 28 June 1995.  STATCOM is the committee of statutory bodies addressing the remaining obstacles to the full development of the film and television industry, on which my Department is also represented.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the report, I announced the establishment of a strategic alliance between my Department and FÁS and the establishment by FÁS of a national training committee for film and television production, representing a wide range of interests under an independent chair.  The committee reports to the board of FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary responsibility of the committee, on which my Department is represented is to oversee implementation of training for the independent film and television production sector within the audiovisual industry in Ireland and in accordance with the recommendations of the STATCOM report.  Over the next four years the <Col N="1348" /> committee will put in place and approve the expenditure of dedicated funds of £2.58 million, which had been allocated in the EU Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-1999 for film and television training.  These funds are being supplemented by FÁS mainstream funding of a further £250,000 annually, subject to demand.  The committee will also co-ordinate training in this area which is funded from other sources.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the activities of my Department covers a very wide spectrum.  However, in so far as it can be ascertained, only grants which were financed from the proceeds of the national lottery have been made available in South Tipperary since 1993.  In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 109 of 13 February 1996 in which I outlined the position regarding projects which benefited from national lottery funding in the areas of arts and culture, heritage and the Irish language during the years 1987 to 1995.  No such funding has been made available to projects in South Tipperary in the current year to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1982 report of the Stardust Tribunal, a copy of which was placed in the Oireachtas Library, made a wide range of recommendations in relation to the fire service and other related matters.  These recommendations have either been implemented or taken into account in the ongoing formulation of policy on fire safety and the development of the local authority fire services over the intervening period, with the support of successive Governments. Improvements have been carried out on a comprehensive basis, covering such areas as the financing and equipping of the local fire service, its organisation and staffing, the legislative framework, and emergency planning.</P>
      <P>With respect to capital investment, a total of £81 million has been provided from State funds since 1981 to finance work on 92 new or reconstructed fire stations, the purchase of 316 replacement fire appliances and major improvements in telecommunications, emergency equipment and so on.  As regards staffing, there were about 30 professional posts in the local fire service prior to 1982, whereas now there are 129 such posts, with a greatly increased emphasis on fire prevention and fire safety.</P>
      <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981 strengthened the overall statutory regime for enforcing fire safety.  Regulations under the Act, make the locking of exits and blocking of escape route from places of assembly an offence.  Building regulations, which came into effect in June 1992, set out the requirements, including fire safety requirements, to be met in the design and construction of new buildings and material changes in existing buildings.  With some limited exceptions, a fire safety certificate is now required for new buildings, extensions, and material alterations and changes of use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A series of codes of practice and guidelines have been issued giving advice on fire safety in places of assembly, in hotels and guesthouses, in flats and apartments, and in regard to <Col N="1354" /> furnishings and fittings in places of assembly.  Operational guidelines covering training needs, the use of breathing apparatus, the design of fire stations, etc. have also been issued to fire authorities. Work is continuing on the preparation of further advice and guidance.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in fire service training have also taken place.  For example, since it was set up in 1983 the Fire Services Council has held over 150 training courses at central level for almost 3,000 local fire service personnel, to supplement the training carried out locally by fire authorities.  The need for a national training centre recommended in the report has been overtaken by events in that major training facilities for the fire service have been provided at several centres, including the Dublin Fire Brigade Training Centre at Marino.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council, established in 1988, promotes public awareness in relation to fire safety, as well as roads and water safety.  Local authorities have developed plans to deal with major emergencies and my department provides extensive advice and assistance to the authorities on this matter on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Three mobilisation and communications centres to handle all fire &ldquo;999&rdquo; calls are being developed in Limerick, Dublin and Castlebar.  The Munster system came into operation in 1993, planning for the fitting out of the control centre in Dublin is at an advanced stage, and plans for the Castlebar centre are being developed.</P>
    <P>All the recommendations of the report have received full and careful consideration in the ongoing development of the fire service.  I am satisfied that the improvements which I have outlined have significantly strengthened the capacity of the service to respond to fires and other emergencies, and in fire prevention activities.</P>

It is not possible to quantify the level of grant expenditure specifically in any one county.  However, a special project aimed at disadvantaged young people in areas of Kilkenny city is funded through the National Youth Federation under the grant scheme for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth.  In addition, a youth information centre in Kilkenny is grant aided from the Youth Information Fund.  Grants to these initiatives have been allocated as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the issue of the leaving certificate results on 16 <Col N="1365" /> August 1995, an application for a recheck in respect of three art candidates was received from Ursuline College, Sligo on 25 August.  A letter from the school dated 1 September was received in my Department on 5 September 1995, indicating the school's disappointment with the examination results of 12 candidates in higher level art, including the three who had already sought a recheck.  The letter also inquired if other candidates should seek rechecks.</P>
      <P>In response, my Department rang Ursuline College on 6 September and advised the school that, in line with normal procedure, a recheck should be sought for any candidate whose performance in the examination was significantly at variance with that expected by the school.  Applications for recheck were subsequently received on behalf of four further candidates on 11 September. The results of the seven rechecks were issued to the school on 4 October, the date of issue of all recheck results.</P>
      <P>On or about 20 November, my Department received a phone call from the mother of a candidate from Ursuline College during which she requested a reply to a letter which she had written in October regarding her daughter's art result.  As this letter could not be located, the mother was requested to send on a copy.  A copy of the letter dated 7 October was then forwarded, together with a covering letter dated 21 November.  This correspondence was received in the Department on or about 22 November.</P>
      <P>Subsequently a check was carried out on the marks awarded to the candidate. This revealed that marks had not been credited for the craftwork component and on further investigation it emerged that none of the candidates from Ursuline College had been credited with marks for craftwork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school was contacted by phone on 12 December and arrangements were made for a visit by one of my Department's officials on the following day.  During the course of this visit it was <Col N="1366" /> confirmed that the craftwork material had been despatched by the school to my Department in June 1995.  Assessments from the school regarding the ability of the candidates in craftwork were also obtained.  My Department issued amended leaving certificate result forms to Ursuline College on 21 December by fax, following a phone call with the school principal.  The amended result forms were also posted on the same day.  The mother, whose query brought the error to light, was also contacted by telephone on 21 December by an official of my Department and was informed of the revised result.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, at the invitation of the school principal, two senior officials of my Department visited Ursuline College on 24 January 1996 and met parents, students, the school principal, school staff and representatives of the board of management.  Prior to this meeting, on 19 January 1996, each of the students involved received a personal letter from my Department, care of the school, notifying them of the arrangements for the meeting.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that this issue is the subject of an external inquiry which is being conducted by Price Waterhouse.  The report of this inquiry will be made public.</P>

      <P>The records of my Department show that, in 1994, there was no instance where the packets of craftwork despatched by a school were not received.  Records of packets received from schools prior to 1994 are not available as such records are normally retained only to assist with inquiries regarding the results of the current year.  It is, however, an extremely rare occurrence for a packet to be lost.</P>
      <P>In order to allow time for craftwork items such as pottery to dry out, packets of craftwork are despatched to my Department over a period of about two weeks.  Occasionally, there is a delay in sending these or they may be delayed in transit in the postal or rail network. When this occurs the procedure is for my Department to contact the school to ascertain details of when and how the craftwork was dispatched.</P>
      <P>Where, very exceptionally, a packet of craftwork cannot be located, the procedure is for my Department to secure an assessment in respect of the candidates involved.</P>

      <P>Every such application is given careful and detailed consideration on its merits, but I would say that, save on very pressing humanitarian grounds, such as those involving caring for a sick relative, the normal practice is to refuse such requests on the grounds that permission to visit the State for a period of up to three months is sufficient for holiday and related short-stay purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the avoidance of confusion, I would point out that there can be no question of granting extensions in circumstances which involve a change in the persons's status from that of a visitor <Col N="1369" /> to, for example, a student, or a worker. Such applications, involving a change in the applicant's status may only be made by that person while outside the State and at an Irish Embassy or consular post.</P>

    <P>Recipients of old age (contributory) pension who are blind would normally not have qualified for the blind person's pension during their working lives due to the application of the means test.  The current personal rate of old age (contributory) pension is £72.80 a week as compared to £62.50 a week in respect of blind person's pension.  The question of extending the free travel companion pass to include people getting old age (contributory) pension who are also blind will be kept under review in the light of the availability of resources for further improvements to the scheme.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the free travel scheme is a non-statutory scheme and, therefore, does not come within the scope of the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>Death grant is a social insurance benefit which is payable, subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person or of their spouse or child under 18. The amount of the grant varies with the contribution record and, in the case of children, with the age of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards people who retired before the introduction of the death grant on 1 October 1970, the position is that social insurance contributions paid prior to that date did not contain an element in respect of the cost of the death grant. Consequently, people who ceased to be insurably employed before that date <Col N="1375" /> would not have contributed towards the cost of the scheme and, accordingly, there are no plans to extend the death grant to include that category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of home recording royalties is one of the many subjects which is currently being examined in depth by the Intellectual Property Unit of my Department in the context of a comprehensive review of Irish copyright law.  It is also an issue which is being examined by the European Commission and by the Committees of Experts working on a possible Protocol to the Berne Convention and a possible new Instrument on the Rights of Performers and Producers of Phonograms.</P>
      <P>When these bodies have concluded their examination of this very difficult subject and come forward with recommendations the Government will decide on whether or not to introduce home recording royalties into Irish copyright law.</P>
      <P>The introduction of royalties places real costs on domestic users of tapes and recording equipment.  It may also diminish the exclusive nature of the authors' existing rights to control reproduction. This might not be in the long-term interests of Irish composers, artists and music publishers and may, indeed, work to their detriment.  For this reason alone I do not propose to rush into a decision on this issue which could have detrimental effects on both consumers and the music industry at large.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the huge level of interest in Irish music overseas and the possibilities for revenue generation for the industry from that source.  However, I am also aware that the vast majority of music played and audiovisual material used in Ireland and taped onto blank tapes is not of Irish origin and any reciprocal arrangements could lead to large outflows of money from the Irish economy.  Whilst it is extremely difficult to quantify the precise level of this out-flow I am fairly sure that the overall result would be substantially negative from an Irish economic point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the intention of the Minister directly concerned, the Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology, <Col N="1378" /> that the work of the Intellectual Property Unit will proceed in tandem with the work of the European Commission and the groups of experts and will lead to a balanced recommendation on how to deal with this difficult question.  He would then propose to incorporate any legislative proposals that might emanate from these groups in the new Copyright Bill which is currently being prepared in the Department.</P>

      <P>The Holidays (Employees) Acts, 1973 and 1991, provide for entitlement to public holidays. In respect of a public holiday, an eligible employee is entitled to receive from the employer: (i) a paid day off on that day, or (ii) a paid day off within a month, or (iii) an extra day's annual leave, or (iv) an extra day's pay, as the employer may decide.</P>
      <P>To be &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; a worker must, generally, be employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship.  There is no service requirement in respect of public holidays, except in the case of day to day employees and some part-time employees.  These qualify for public holiday entitlement provided they have worked at least 120 hours (or 110 hours if under 18 years) during the five weeks ending on the day before a public holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the worker referred to by the Deputy considers that she is an eligible employee but has not received her entitlements under the holidays legislation, she may refer the matter to the Employment Rights Section of my <Col N="1379" /> Department which will investigate the case.</P>

        <i>Commission on the Newspaper Industry</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Commission, under the chairmanship of the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas Finlay, was asked to examine, report and make recommendations about a wide range of issues affecting the newspaper industry.  The commission, which held its first meeting in September, is continuing with its work. To assist the commission in its deliberations certain consultancy studies have been commissioned at an approximate cost of £58,000.</P>

    <P>A number of initiatives are planned or under way as follows:</P>
    <P>An internal review is under way of national policy in the area of human resources development.  This will result in the publication of a White Paper on Human Resources Development.</P>
    <P>The Department has recruited an external consultant to advise on certain aspects of human resources development. The final cost is estimated at £2,000-£2,500.  The results of this consultancy are expected shortly.</P>
    <P>The planning unit of my Department has been engaged for some months in a review of labour market strategy which I hope to publish shortly.  While the majority of the work has been carried out in-house, some costs will arise in relation to preparation of the document for publication.  These costs are not likely to exceed £2,500.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Work sharing</i>

      <i>SME's</i>
    </P>
    <P>The consultancy unit of the Department is currently undertaking a survey of the equity capital needs of Irish SMEs.</P>
    <P>A review of the subsidised loans scheme for Irish SMEs (SBELs) is currently being considered.  A decision on when or whether it will proceed is likely to be taken shortly, but will depend on the available data to assess performance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Information Technology</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Consultative Committee on Software provides an ongoing forum in which the Department of Enterprise and Employment and representatives from industry, higher education and the state agencies concerned with the development of the software sector can meet to discuss issues related to the software sector.  There are no costs associated with the operation of the Consultative Committee on Software.  I propose to establish in the near future a committee for the development of a national information society strategy and action plan.  Until details have been finalised it is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the cost of the proposed committee.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Science and Technology</i>
    </P>
    <P>A task force was set up by the Government in May 1995 to advise on how best to progress the STIAC report and how its 160 recommendations could be brought forward for implementation. Their report, presented to Government in November 1995, will be used as a basis for the Government response to <Col N="1384" /> the STIAC report.  The response will be published within the next few months.</P>
    <P>The work of the task force did not involve any additional expenditure as the members were already paid by the State.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Partnership</i>
    </P>
    <P>An advisory group on partnership and change is working with the unit for partnership in enterprise, which was established in March 1995 to encourage the development of partnership at the level of the enterprise.  Costs to date associated with the group's work amount to £404.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Enterprise and the Environment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The establishment of a task force on enterprise and the environment was announced at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Sustainable Development. The terms of reference for the task force and the composition of its membership are currently under consideration. A budget of £15,000 has been allocated.</P>
    <P>4.  Management</P>
    <P>
      <i>Strategic Management Initiative</i>
    </P>
    <P>As part of the Strategic Management Initiative in the Civil Service, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve its own operation. These relate to all aspects of management, including mission and objectives, organisation, human resources, communications and resources and outputs. While most of this work is being carried out in-house, some external consultancy involvement has been necessary. The cost of the consultancy work carried out to date has been in the order of £20,000.</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply on 31 January last, any amendment to the Euratom Treaty will require the unanimous agreement of all member states.  This unanimity will be difficult to achieve because of the opposition of certain member states to any review of Euratom. Nevertheless, the Government remains committed to seeking an improvement in the health and safety provisions of the Euratom Treaty and has raised the issue of a review of the Treaty in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference to be held this year.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the ports in question is a matter for the Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
      <P>A sum of £120,000, funded equally by my Department and Dublin Port and Docks Board, has been allocated towards certain works at Balbriggan and Skerries harbours.</P>
      <P>The works which are specialised and marine specific are being undertaken by the board as prioritised and agreed with the technical staff of the Department of the Marine and Fingal County Council and are progressing.  These priorities did not include the levelling of the ground and protection of the supports of the pier at Skerries and surfacing at Balbriggan harbour.</P>
      <P>I am informed that quotations were received by Dublin Port and Docks Board of between £4,000 and £10,000 each for dismantling wrecks at Balbriggan and Skerries harbours and a sum of £10,000 in total was spent for the removal of wrecks, other than those privately owned, at Skerries harbour.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, that exist to help young people interested in fishing to acquire boats; and if he will reintroduce the 55 per cent grants for the purchase of new boats particularly as the average age of the fishing fleet is now becoming so old that safety at sea is a constant worry for all interested in the safety of the fishing community.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Department to critically assess the scope for additional measures to encourage new entrants into the fishing industry in line with policy objectives for fleet modernisation and renewal and legally binding EU commitments on fleet capacity.  The assessment will have full regard to the ongoing work of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group which is examining the age factor as part of its comprehensive review of the safety status of the fleet.</P>
      <P>Current strategy is geared to supporting a significant investment programme of over £30 million in fleet modernisation projects, where there is generally a substantial safety element.  In addition, under the decommissioning scheme up to £6 million of financial incentives is available for the removal of old and uneconomic tonnage.</P>

      <P>A great deal of progress has already been made in preparation for the proposed Intergovernmental Conference of the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bilateral contacts have been made and joint action motivated in areas such as the quality status report on the Irish Sea under the auspices of the Oslo and Paris Conventions, monitoring and management of dump-sites, search and rescue, pollution response, marine <Col N="1392" /> research, fisheries conservation and ferry safety.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, and I are assessing how these developments might best be progressed and, in that regard, the contribution which an intergovernmental conference might make.  An announcement will be made in this regard in the near future.</P>
