      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): It is proposed to take No. 8, Financial Resolution re Finance Bill, 1996; No. 16, Statements on the White Paper on Foreign Policy (resumed) and No. 17, Statements on &ldquo;Developing a Policy for Women's Health&rdquo; (resumed).</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I condemn the bombing last evening at Hammersmith Bridge.  None of these matters is helpful to the ongoing work of developing and reactivating the peace process.  Now that the way is clear for all parties to participate in the electoral process, will the Minister highlight to the Taoiseach as soon as possible the fact that parties must not be excluded from the electoral process? The IRSP is one such party.  The people will decide the issue but to exclude parties creates an unnecessary obstacle and gives excuses to people.  This is unhelpful and could be used in various ways to <Col N="1170" /> block the progress we all want to see. There is much support in the British system for not making the mistake of excluding parties from the electoral process.</P>

      <P>I, too, condemn the bombing last night.  It is the second bomb in a week and a further cynical exercise.  Does the Minister agree that the absence of the IRA ceasefire remains the greatest obstacle to meaningful negotiations on 10 June?  If the IRA ceasefire is not restored those negotiations cannot be meaningful or successful.  Will he join me in calling on Sinn Féin to use its enormous influence, as the political wing of the IRA, to have the ceasefire fully restored?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East</i>): I join Deputy Ahern in welcoming the fact that all parties, including Sinn Féin and the SDLP, have stated their intention to contest the election in Northern Ireland. It is the Government's objective to have all parties at the negotiating table on 10 June.  The bomb detonated in Hammersmith last night does not improve the position or do anything to help us to achieve that objective.  In reply to Deputy Harney, the only matter which would prevent Sinn Féin from attending talks on 10 June is that the ceasefire has not been reinstated.  Sinn Féin is aware of the views of all parties in this House and I hope that it will do everything in its power to reinstate the ceasefire. Rather than having dialogue here talks will continue at official level to achieve that end.</P>

      <P>Is uafásach an rud é go leanann feachtas an IRA ar aghaidh leis an mbuama a tharla i Londain inné.  Is cinnte nach gcabhraíonn sé le ról na tíre seo thar lear nuair atá ag teip orainn deireadh a chur le foréigean ó Éireannaigh sa tír seo agus gó mór-mhór thar lear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I last spoke on this debate almost a month ago the Israelis have bombarded Southern Lebanon and the Irish soldiers serving there with the UN have been fortunate to escape with their lives &mdash; their tour of duty was unexpectedly prolonged as a result of the reckless Israeli violence.  The background to that bloody aggression serves to illustrate the need for serious reforms in the UN.  It does no good to the efforts towards reform, improvement and greater efficiency in the UN for our Government to flirt with the Western <Col N="1175" /> European Union and NATO's Partnership for Peace.  To call a body linked with NATO &ldquo;Partnership for Peace&rdquo; is a cynical abuse of the English laguage. It would be more accurate to call it the partnership of those preparing for war.</P>
    <P>Although the PFP, which was formed at NATO's 1994 summit, allows members to be flexible in deciding in which areas it wishes to co-operate with NATO, there is no doubt that membership involves support for a military bloc. Two of the five objectives contained in its framework document are: the development of co-operative military relations with NATO for the purpose of joint planning, training and exercise in order to strengthen their ability to undertake missions in the fields of peacekeeping, search and rescue, humanitarian operations and others as may subsequently be agreed; and the development over the longer term of forces that are better able to operate with those of members of the Notth Atlantic Alliance.  Ireland does not have to join a body linked with NATO to take part in peacekeeping operations as we already take part in such operations under the auspices of the UN.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at specific aspects of the White Paper in relating to neutrality, security and defence.  The section on the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe states that Ireland's policy will be to strengthen the OSCE and refers to maximising the contribution the OSCE can make to European security.  Yet there is not one specific suggestion of what changes might be introduced for that purpose.  For example, there are no suggestions on improving the decision-making procedures, even for operational decisions. When that is contrasted with the more specific suggestions as to how Ireland can contribute to NATO's Partnership for Peace and the Western European Union, it is evident that the Government's real interest lies with these military blocs.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the Government <Col N="1176" /> has promised a referendum on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference if it has implications for neutrality, the White Paper offers no referendum on the decision to join the Partnership for Peace &mdash; that will be decided by the Oireachtas.  However the Government might like to dress it up with talk about peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.  Joining the PFP or agreeing to participate in Western European Union activities means signing an agreement with military alliances and, therefore, aligning outselves with these alliances.  If the Government claims that has no implications for neutrality, it must have a very peculiar definition of neutrality.</P>
    <P>The document states that NATO agreed to make available its collective assets for Western European Union operations undertaken in pursuit of the common foreign and security policy of the European Union.  That is not true. NATO and the Western European Union have an agreement in principle with regard to each other's resources, but the specifics of what operations would be covered have not yet been worked out.  The Government, in jumping the gun on this point, appears to be even more enthusiastic about this development than NATO and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The document states that the Government has decided to discuss with the Western European Union the possibility of Ireland taking part on a case by case basis in humanitarian and rescue tasks and peacekeeping tasks under the Petersberg Declaration.  These tasks include humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping tasks as well as tasks of combat forces in crisis management &mdash; if one can believe its stated intentions, the Government does not intend to take part in the latter.  Will that happen independently of the Intergovernmental Conference?  The White Paper does not state that that will be part of the Intergovernmental Conference, as we have been led to believe.  Is this another attempt to avoid a referendum on yet another move to align ourselves with a <Col N="1177" /> military alliance?  These tasks may be requested by the UN, the OSCE or the EU.  In other words we may be taking part in peacekeeping missions not agreed by the UN or the OSCE.  Even if the missions are under the auspices of the UN, placing Ireland under a Western European Union umbrella will make the position more complicated rather than more efficient.  The document states that this proposal would help Ireland to make available our experience and knowledge in peacekeeping areas, but in what way is that not available now?</P>
    <P>While the Government has succeeded in giving the media and the public the impression that the White Paper maintains our neutral position, section 4.114 reiterates the commitment of successive Irish Governments that when the time came Ireland would be willing to enter into negotiations on a common defence policy for the Union.  It is clear, therefore, that there is still a good deal of ambivalence regarding our neutral position.</P>
    <P>We should focus in this debate on the UN and the need to radically overhaul that body.  The Israelis can do what they want as long as they enjoy the support of the USA, indeed as long as they enjoy the backing of any combination of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.  The UN, however, must get its own house in order.  Ireland has the credibility as a neutral country and the experience as a long serving contributor to peacekeeping duties around the world to play a key role in having the UN's house put in order.</P>
    <P>The five permanent members of the UN Security Council do not have a veto on wisdom and non-violent conflict resolution. These countries make a fortune from selling military hardware around the world.  Is it any wonder that Islamic fundamentalists deride the hypocrisy of the patronising calls for peace from these hard-nosed warmongers?  I put it to the Tánaiste that a strong case exists for countries with trade in military hardware to have a diminished role in deciding UN policy instead of the present <Col N="1178" /> veto which this permanent member élite enjoys.</P>
    <P>The current UN structure makes life difficult for the UN but, more tragically, it allows wars to rage fuelled by the latest weaponry and, in the case of Israel, results in Irish soldiers' lives being put at risk as we saw in the recent attacks which so narrowly missed a UN base in Southern Lebanon.</P>
    <P>At times like this points must be made and the strongest protests must be lodged and acted upon.  I met many people who felt the Irish Government's response to the slaughter of innocent civilians in Lebanon was so weak as to be disrespectful to those killed and injured in the face of these acts of terrorism. We all know Israel has been attacked by terrorists but what type of country can call itself modern, civilised and democratic and at the same time blow innocent people to smithereens?</P>
    <P>Israel is not alone in facing what is in effect a charge of hypocrisy.  All the permanent members of the UN Security Council continue to manufacture landmines which are not just weapons of war; they are described by many as slow motion instruments of genocide.  As we speak, a three weeks conference is proceeding in Geneva to agree a ban on the manufacture and distribution of these murderous and disfiguring devices.  So far, 30 countries have called for a ban but there has been no move from Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>When I expressed that view the response from some people in this House was a snigger.  I appeal to the Tánaiste and his opposite number, my constituency colleague, Deputy Burke, to raise above the warped sense of priority which seems to exist in the Dáil and to produce a clear Bill, rather than <Col N="1180" /> going back over British law from the last century covering bans on gunpowder. This is unnecessary when we have the ability to bring forward modern legislation on this issue.</P>
      <P>The lack of importance to the landmines issue in the Dáil highlights the underlying weakness of traditional politics along the traditional axis of left and right.  All too often the focus has been &ldquo;I'm all right Jack, pity about the rest of the world's family&rdquo;.  Not only is this fortress mentality immoral, it is also dangerous and threatens to increase global tension, conflict between countries in dispute over oil reserves and, ultimately, makes the use of weapons of mass destruction more likely, regardless of the well-meaning agreements to limit arms production.</P>
      <P>If for no other reason than to preserve and promote peaceful coexistence, I urge all concerned, particularly decision makers, to learn to live by the Green movement's maxim of &ldquo;think globally, act locally&rdquo;.  Before the other parties here declare their credentials along those lines, let us remember that the First World, of which Ireland is a part, is consuming over and above what this earth and her people can sustain. On the other hand we praise Bob Geldof and all who give time and money to help the poor, but do we really believe that one day the people in Rwanda and the Philippines will be able to do everything we do, take out a mortgage, have one or more cars in the driveway and take one or more holidays every year? The brutal truth is that even if everyone in China were to have a fridge or a car, we would have problems in finding a sufficient amount of metal in the world to meet the orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the solution if we want all our poor sisters and brothers to live the way we do in the west?  It seems the only solution is to find three more earths and join them to the one we inhabit; not a very realistic proposition.  Why then is the Government responding to the needs of the world's poor in this White Paper in a way which accepts that we <Col N="1181" /> can all carry on merrily throwing a bit of aid in the direction of the poor?</P>
    <P>I can imagine some people agreeing but saying that this is the real world and that is life.  This is not living in the real world.  There are no other earths lying in wait.  The poor are getting poorer in spite of our aid.  The rich are getting richer although they are few in number. The earth is losing millions of tonnes of top soil every year and cannot feed its people.  In much of the soil that remains for agriculture, people have no choice but to grow tea, coffee, pineapples and cocoa beans to sell in repayment for loans lent by the rich banks of the West.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Tánaiste has access to figures for Ireland but currently in Britain, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund consume 14 per cent of Britain's aid budget.  These two institutions cost each UK taxpayer an average of £12 per year and yet the people who run these bodies are largely unelected and unaccountable.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the generous supporters of GOAL, Oxfam, Concern, Trócaire and all the other agencies realise by how much debt the people they seek to help are burdened.  The magazine <i>Third World Now</i> has broken down the money given by the rich for one year as follows: Aid&mdash;$14 billion; Loans &mdash; $13 billion; Total &mdash; $27 billion.  How many people realise, however, that the poor give the rich much more than that.  In one year, $51 billion was given in debt and interest repayments.  That situation is getting much worse and poor countries are paying three or four times the amount they receive in aid and loans. Currently, the debt of sub-Saharan Africa is 2.7 times larger than its annual income from exports, according to the World Bank.  In 1995 the total developing countries' debt topped $1.6 trillion, $1 thousand billion, for the first time.</P>
    <P>Anyone who ignores these figures cannot claim to be living in the real world.  Any politician who does not act to cure this debt crisis is not a friend of the real world and anyone who ignores the maxim of Gandhi who said: &ldquo;There <Col N="1182" /> is enough in the world for everyone's need but not for everyone's greed&rdquo; ignores the real world at their peril.</P>
    <P>Perhaps he has already done so but I urge the Tánaiste and the Minister of State to read a new book, recently published by Earthscan, which complements the White Paper.  It is entitled <i>The Politics of the Real World</i> by Michael Jacobs.  Whereas the White Paper is an Irish view looking out on the world.  <i>The Politics of the Real World</i> is an earth based view looking in on us with a critical role in managing the future of this planet.  Although it has less than half the pages of the White Paper, it makes up in wisdom what it saves in paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this extensive statement of the Government's foreign policy at this critical period in world affairs.  While I do not agree with a number of views adopted in the report, the document represents a major effort by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and his team and I compliment them on their work.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks we have had much debate on the wisdom or otherwise of reducing the importance of history in the curriculum of our second level schools.  The general consensus emerging from that debate seems to be in favour of maintaining the current status for history.  I support that position since a knowledge of history is a major advantage as a young adult develops an understanding of the present state of organisation of the society in which he or she lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same context, I equally stress the importance of giving our young students a detailed insight into the current state of world affairs.  It may be argued that the quality of life of future generations will be more significantly influenced by current international developments than by remote historical events.  We have only to look at the current state of relationships within the European Union.  Over the past decade <Col N="1183" /> or so a strong German-French relationship has been a major influence in maintaining the growth of the concept of institutions of the Union and yet these countries were involved in major conflict just over half a century ago.</P>
    <P>A study of the relationship between these two countries which did not encompass the special recent efforts of Chancellor Kohl and the late President Mitterand would fail to explain the current high degree of common purpose between the two nations.  I make these observations simply to emphasise my assessment of the vital importance of each member of our society becoming keenly aware of the relevance of international affairs to our future well-being. In this regard <i>Challenges and Opportunities Abroad</i> is a timely document. The quality of production of the report is excellent and this factor should encourage a greater level of readership.</P>
    <P>The vital importance of foreign affairs comes from the extremely high level of inter-dependence of nations in the modern world.  We have an increasing level of economic trade which ultimately affects each and every household.  In this context, it is vital that we continue to increase access to foreign markets for our manufacturers.  The importance to date of our membership of the European Union is clearly reflected if one examines recent export statistics for the country.  With the exception of the United States, the vast majority of our trade is with fellow EU countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France.  Therefore, on the grounds of simple economics alone, it is vital that we develop carefully and comprehensively our foreign policy and international role.</P>
    <P>From time to time we hear people talk about the &ldquo;good old days before we joined the EEC&rdquo; and were free of European laws, rules and regulations.  It is true to a certain extent that the arm of the European Union has been more far-reaching than we anticipated when joining what we thought of as a free trading Community.  The way forward now is to <Col N="1184" /> ensure we work to our maximum potential within the EU to influence its development in a manner consistent with the wishes and interests of the people.  As the document clearly states, we must ensure that Ireland continues to have the power to appoint a Commissioner in a new and expanded European Union.</P>
    <P>In general I agree with the Minister in terms of welcoming the expansion of membership of the Union.  The dramatic fall of Communism in Eastern Europe and the subsequent development of democratic institutions in these countries has provided a unique opportunity to secure an extended and united Europe as we approach the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the addition of a number of less economically developed countries will add a significant financial burden to the European Union.  Consequently it will become even more difficult to secure much needed regional support for existing member countries with ongoing needs for economic growth and development.  The financial implications of the addition of a number of East European countries are not all negative since they will provide tremendous marketing opportunities to Irish firms.  In this regard our second and third level educational institutions must move rapidly to develop training programmes in language skills.</P>
    <P>Our foreign language teaching is dominated by French, German and to a lesser extent Spanish and Italian.  This is totally inadequate as we anticipate much closer links with countries such as Poland and Hungary.  Similarly, to date there is little opportunity for the Irish student to become familiar with the language of North European countries such as Sweden, Norway and Finland. This must change, and change rapidly, if we are to seriously develop economic and cultural relationships with these countries, otherwise our commitment to the concept of greater European integration and union will seem shallow and insincere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> The importance of foreign policy is not limited to matters of trade and commerce. As we review a very troubled world, the vital importance of international peace and national security is becoming increasingly evident.  The world is going through a period of tremendous growth in terms of technical knowledge and commercial wealth.  One might reasonably expect that trends would have the effect of &ldquo;lifting all boats&rdquo; but that is not the case.  Instead, we have evidence on a daily basis of widespread conflict, violence, war and strife.  The recent war in the former Yugoslavia has shown a level of viciousness and hate which is almost beyond belief.  We have to ask ourselves how can this happen in an era when international communication systems ensure that the most bloody and unacceptable of incidents are immediately brought to the world's attention.</P>
    <P>It is only 50 years or so since the world began to realise the full implications of the campaign of genocide which was waged against the Jewish people.  The simple message that &ldquo;This must never be allowed to happen again&rdquo; was adopted by nations throughout the world.  Any assessment of the past ten years or so throughout the world will show how little success has been achieved in that regard.  We have had successive disasters in countries such as Cambodia, Uganda, Sudan, Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Central America, Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.  The system in Burundi, in particular, and Liberia seems on the verge of total breakdown and chaos.</P>
    <P>Despite the excellent work of many peacekeeping forces and non-governmental agencies, how can the modern world have allowed such chaos to develop in the years following the collapse of Communism throughout most of the world?  We have to seriously examine the level of effectiveness of the United Nations organisation.</P>
    <P>We have only to look back to last year to see the absolutely disastrous performance of the United Nations in the town of Srebenica in Bosnia.  This <Col N="1186" /> town was attacked and taken by Serbian forces despite being under the control and protection of United Nations forces. Recent reports suggest that as many as 10,000 male citizens of this town were brutally massacred.  If these reports prove to be substantially true, they place a dark cloud over the moral standing of the overall United Nations and on those with direct responsibility for making the decision to evacuate Srebenica when under UN control.</P>
    <P>The current situation in Lebanon is equally unacceptable.  On the one hand the State of Israel is under attack from areas which should be under the control of the United Nations and anti-Israeli forces seem free to move as they please in the region.  On the other hand Israel is showing contempt for United Nations' resolutions and the basic elements of international law.  As well as continuing an involvement in the illegal occupation of Southern Lebanon, they have for the second time in 15 years launched an all-out war on the State of Lebanon.  As a result many civilian lives have been lost and little or nothing has been achieved in terms of securing a long-term peace between Israel and its neighbours.  Furthermore, United Nations personnel, including our excellent forces, have been placed in mortal danger by people whòm we are attempting to help.  This nonsense cannot be allowed continue as it only breeds further conflict and war.</P>
    <P>The United Nations should carry out a comprehensive review of the various factors which contributed to its inadequate response to a number of crises in recent years, in particular the conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi.  As the document states, active and effective involvement by the United Nations is required in the early stages of conflict.  In that way, communication could be established between the various sides and attempts at reconciliation and a just settlement commenced.</P>
    <P>The more powerful nations must address their moral responsibilities on the development and maintenance of international peace.  Too often blatant <Col N="1187" /> acts of aggression are let go without an effective response merely because of a veto by a powerful member of the United Nations.  There can be little doubt that Russia's reluctance to act against Serbia's interest limited early and effective intervention by the United Nations in the Bosnian war.  Similarly, the United States probably provides support too readily to Israel when it becomes involved in outrageous acts of aggression.  While such one-sided interventions may be motivated by good intentions, they do little or nothing to uphold respect for agencies of international law and order.</P>
    <P>Poverty, social injustice and the widespread abuse of human rights usually go hand in hand with conflict and the White Paper correctly places great emphasis on these matters.  The majority of conflicts and wars have their origins in some form of social injustice.  The level of social inequality throughout the world is staggering.  Nevertheless, we must use our independent voice at all times to speak for those who are oppressed, whether for political, social or religious reasons.  Irish people throughout the world have played a major and honourable role in advancing the cause of peace and social justice. Politicians should build on the excellent examples of our Defence Forces, voluntary agencies and missionaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of one of the Oireachtas committees dealing with European Affairs, I am delighted to welcome the publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  Not only is it the first document of its kind published by a Government but it is also the result of a lengthy consultation process and was published at a very important juncture in Irish national life.  The Intergovernmental Conference began last month in Turin in Italy, will continue until next year and will be closely involved with the Irish Presidency.  It will determine the future of Europe and the European Union and test Europe's vitality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> I am particularly pleased with the chapter on the European Union which provides a clear overview of our position and how the Government views our future role in the Union.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs are currently discussing this document at the request of the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Tánaiste &mdash; to whom I send best wishes for a speedy recovery &mdash; appeared before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, also appeared before that committee and spoke about development co-operation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, who has responsibility for European Affairs, will address the Joint Committee on European Affairs next week.  A consultative process is ongoing following the publication of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, for her presentation yesterday not only of the sections that deal with overseas development aid, particularly in Africa, but also for her widespread communication to the committee on the important question of human rights.  I confirm for Deputy Sargent that a lengthy debate took place at yesterday's meeting and the Minister of State received recognition as one of the first to raise the question of landmines internationally.  This matter has now been taken on board by many other countries.  The Department of Foreign Affairs provided financial assistance for destruction of those horrific devices.  I was particularly pleased to hear the Minister of State say that the UK has decided to cease manufacturing them.  That is in line with our Government's policy on the question of disarmament, including landmines which have caused great devastation throughout the world.</P>
    <P>As the White Paper unequivocally states, the process of European integration has been good for Ireland.  We have been a major beneficiary of Structural Funding, the Common Agricultural Policy and Cohesion Funding, but <Col N="1189" /> Europe's influence on the culture of Irish politics for the past two decades has been more pervasive.  We are now an outward looking State, confident of our past and our future.  Gone is the obsession with our neighbour, the UK, and the ironic inferiority complex of even the most Anglophobic.  When we reflect on the incessant anti-Europeanism, the Euro sceptics and the insularity about the many aspects of European affairs we realise the benefits of our independent view, particularly having regard to the comments of some British Members of Parliament.  While we have been blinkered by an obsession with the past, Ireland now sits comfortably in the modern age.  Throughout the European Union our independence as a neutral State has received concrete expression and our objective is to strengthen that process.</P>
    <P>However, none of this should be taken for granted.  The debate on the future of the European Union is crucial. Section 3 of the White Paper, which deals with my area of responsibility, will ensure that such debate encourages consultation with all interests so that the consensus arrived at by the committee will be reflected in the decision made by the House.  However, it would be wrong to lay out all our options, especially our negotiating position, in advance of the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>The White Paper suggests broad outlines of how we would like the debate to develop.  The paper presents five challenges with which I agree.  They include balanced economic development and realisation of the potential of the Single Market, Europe and its citizens, Europe's role in the world, the future enlargement of the Union and an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe.  Europe must be more than a free trade area.</P>
    <P>If we are to convince the people of Europe of the need for further integration &mdash; sadly we have failed to do this although the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has endeavoured <Col N="1190" /> to adopt a communicating Europe policy &mdash; we must be able to show that the EU is capable of acting on issues which affects it, for example, drug trafficking, terrorism, crime and unemployment. There has been recent discussion on the viability of the European model as against the American system of free and deregulated markets.  However, there is no choice between the two.  The people of Europe expect, and given their experience during the course of this century, are entitled to expect, a humane and caring social order.</P>
    <P>The opening of the Union to the countries of the former Eastern Bloc marks a formidable hurdle in the development of the Union.  On the one hand, the admittance of countries notably poorer than ours cannot but have implications for Ireland vis-á-vis the continuation of Structural Fund payments, FEOGA grants, Common Agricultural Policy etc.  We must ensure that such admittance does not alter the fundamental co-operative nature of the EU.  However, only by accepting the membership of such states can the EU fulfil its originally perceived purpose which is to bind together the peoples of Europe.  As the White Paper puts it, our function is to consolidate for future generations the peace and prosperity of Europe.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement in the White Paper that the Government, while welcoming the deepening of European integration, will not assent to further progress unless Ireland's interests are protected.  Nothing would do more to alienate people from the European process than to see our Government sign away their livelihood in pursuit of any ideal, however noble.  Importantly too, it is the Government's determination throughout the Intergovernmental Conference to ensure that the delicate institutional balance of the European Union is maintained.  If a time comes when a cap is to be put on membership of the European Parliament, we are prepared to debate that, but we must retain our unique powers as a small nation with a tremendous input into the cultural and <Col N="1191" /> economic life of Europe.  The success of the EU so far has been its supra natural structures.  On no account can we countenance loss of our Commissioner status, for example.  Neither can I accept the arguments of some of the larger countries that they are in danger of being out voted by the influx of smaller countries.  As the White Paper points out, and as has been the case for a considerable time, matters other than size influence member states' attitudes to issues.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the successful and prudent management of the nation's finances over the past decade, Ireland is well placed to enter the final stage of economic and monetary union.  The single currency is a crucial step towards binding the people of Europe irrevocably together.  However, we are faced with problems because of Britain's current refusal to participate in plans for a single currency.  We are still some time away from having to make a decision on this.  Perhaps a victory for the left in the forthcoming elections in Britain may alter the tide as it appears to have done in Italy.  Our task is to continue the steady progress we have made in the public finances to date so that we can make a decision when the time comes. Interestingly, we are one of the few member states at the moment meeting the criteria, which is a compliment to the management of our financial affairs.</P>
    <P>One of the more controversial elements of the White Paper is that Ireland should enter into discussions about joining the NATO-backed partnership for peace.  It is amazing that a previous Minister from the main Opposition party, Deputy Kitt, in a major speech at the European Institute, welcomed the development of the partnership for peace as a wonderful thing to think about.  That is all the White Paper is asking us to do, to consider the benefits for Ireland of membership of the partnership for peace.  Regardless of misinformation being put out by the Opposition, the Green Party and people <Col N="1192" /> with another agenda, it is obvious to anybody who has considered the options that whereas we have decided we will not join the Western European Union as full participating members but will retain our observer status with it, and whereas we will not join NATO or any military alliance, we will look at the options of joining the partnership for peace if there are benefits for Ireland. There is nothing wrong with looking at options that might benefit us, particularly as some of our sister members of the European Union have already signed up to the partnership for peace which has no military alliance with NATO.  It is a welcome development that we will consider it if it is in our interest, in the knowledge that only this House and not the Government will make the final decision on it.  If, in future, we have to go further and our neutrality is compromised, we will have to have a referendum of the people, and that would be an excellent way to approach an emotive subject.</P>
    <P>There is a moral obligation on us as a developed nation to participate more fully than we have already done in the Petersberg tasks, regardless of who organises them.  The European Union's hand must be strengthend in this regard. Over the past few years, for the first time in a generation, we have witnessed a war in our own back yard which we were unable to end, and this is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>No debate on foreign policy would be complete without mentioning overseas aid.  Overseas development aid now stands at 0.3 per cent of GNP.  This is the highest level of contribution in our history.  This year the figure stands at £106 million and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and the Tánaiste, are to be congratulated on pursuing in Government the aim to increase this level to 0.7 per cent of GNP, the recommended UN figure.  In that regard I wish the UN would pay what it owes us for taking part in UN missions.  I thank the Minister for Defence, Deputy Barrett, for his briefing to our committee on the <Col N="1193" /> role of the UNIFIL Forces in the Lebanon and sending our best wishes to the troops who are trying to ensure peace and a resolution of that conflict.  I condemn the Israeli Government for the way it has escalated this problem in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. Committees of this House drafted a balanced resolution last week condemning both sides, requesting them to desist from engaging in such armed activities. Since then the position has further deteriorated.  It is obvious that Hizbullah chooses sensitive locations, where such armed activities are likely to lead to loss of life to innocent people who have had to leave their homes and find solace in United Nations posts.  Whenever Hizbullah adopt positions within some 300 metres of the perimeter of UNIFIL posts, the Israelis, in retaliating, risk killing totally innocent people, as happened recently when 100 people were killed.</P>
    <P>I agree we have a major role to play in implementing peace in the Middle East.  I hope that as a result of the Troika which has been active &mdash; including representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs who have been meeting the various protagonists in the Middle East crisis &mdash; with United States, French and Russian intervention, common sense will prevail and this provocation cease.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the White Paper on Foreign Policy forms the basis of discussions and consultations, finally leading to decisions being taken and addresses the matter of foreign affairs across a wide spectrum, involving not only European but international affairs, overseas development, human rights and the United Nations itself.  From that point of view it is an excellent example of transparency and openness.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference will possibly take us to the end of this century and into the next, with further enlargement of membership of the European Union when we will be faced with many challenges but, likewise, have many opportunities.  In addition, by the <Col N="1194" /> year 1999, the Delors II package will have been finalised when the matter of funding will recur.  On the basis of current economic trends it is predicted that, because of our present growth trend, we may then receive less funding which will probably be exacerbated by the advent of membership of the European Union of less wealthy member states, accepted in principle by all current members.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances Ireland will turn a new corner, possibly adopting a different role within the European Union for which we should prepare. This White Paper on Foreign Policy will help us in such preparations, setting out our present position, indicating the direction in which we should be heading and, primarily, forcing us to examine our future within the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>While this debate is very useful more than that, it is very important for too often in the past decisions were taken on foreign policy matters which had not been adequately debated in this House and, perhaps even more importantly, had not been adequately debated in the country.  The fact that a White Paper on Foreign Policy has been published is a major step forward as is the debate on it.</P>
      <P>It is important that this debate is based on reason and logic, that it is rational rather than emotional because, when talking about foreign policies, some issues tend to arouse emotions. On the other hand, when examining its contents, one finds common accord on approximately 90 per cent of the issues addressed in it as far as foreign policy is concerned.  While some need to be teased out further, there is no fundamental difference between the various political parties or the electorate on 90 per cent of those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, a couple of issues that tend to arouse controversy need to be teased out and debated a lot more.  The first is the matter of European security and defence, probably the most controversial issue.  There is one other issue that could be controversial, which needs to be teased out and prepared for, that <Col N="1195" /> is monetary union in circumstances in which there is a common currency and the United Kingdom does not join it.</P>
    <P>Let me take the easier issue first, the one on which it is easier to present a view and come to a conclusion.  European citizens, businessmen, farmers and others incur enormous additional costs arising from all the different currencies within Europe.  It has been estimated that billions are being wasted annually because of the need to change from, say, punts to sterling, to francs, to lira or into the currency of the country to which one exports produce.  Since we are an exporting nation, we are particularly badly hit by these additional costs.</P>
    <P>I will give two examples to demonstrate how ridiculous this exchange rate system can be.  I was returning to Ireland from France last year by landbridge, driving across England.  On the ferry from France to England I had some sterling travellers' cheques for which they would give me francs but not sterling.  This meant I would have to have taken francs, be charged commission for that transaction and then have those francs changed into sterling and charged further commission.  Quite frankly, there is a huge rip-off in this exchange operation, many of those involved rip-off not the system but you and me, those who avail of its facilities from time to time.  While it may not amount to very much business people availing of those facilities day in day out must incur enormous cost penalties.</P>
    <P>The second example of how ridiculous this system can be was on another occasion not too long ago when I travelled first class on the train from Dublin to Belfast, paid a supplement and later had a meal.  I found that I could pay the supplement only in punts but the meal only in sterling, or <i>vice versa</i>; I cannot remember which, further demonstrating just how ridiculous is the system.</P>
    <P>The sooner we have a common European currency the better from which Ireland in particular will gain.  However, we must address the crucial issue of what will happen if the United Kingdom <Col N="1196" /> remains out when there is a common currency.  Not sufficient thought has been given to that contingency.  Let me lay down my markers in this respect.  We must now examine current trends and ascertain what will be best for our country. From any examination of our trading patterns it is quite clear that the proportion of our trade with the United Kingdom over the past five to ten years has declined in proportion to the increase in our trade with the remainder of Europe.  Therefore, the trend over the past ten years is upwards as far as our trade with mainland Europe is concerned and downward in proportion to our trade with the United Kingdom, that is in proportion to the whole, not in volume terms, which is a very strong indicator of where we should be going.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism, the numbers of visitors coming here from mainland Europe, proportionately, are ever greater, but not so in the case of those from the United Kingdom, indicating a further strong trend.</P>
    <P>Whenever the United Kingdom does come to a decision &mdash; while not unduly affected &mdash; I predict they will at least notice the approach we will be adopting. There may well be even very slight pressure exerted on them if we are very positive in our approach to the common currency.  For that reason we should be giving very clear signals now that, irrespective of the decision of the United Kingdom, our approach is to join the common currency and monetary union, if we can; certainly, we should conform to the criteria to enable us do so.</P>
    <P>European defence and security is an issue of much greater controversy. While this White Paper on Foreign Policy is an excellent document &mdash; and those who compiled it must be complimented &mdash; on this issue it is a bit of a fudge.  The approach adopted is very timid and nowhere is this more clear than in relation to the Partnership for Peace.  The conclusion that we should explore further the benefits that Ireland might derive from participation in the Partnership for Peace and determine <Col N="1197" /> the contribution we might make to the partnership is very timid.</P>
    <P>The situation may be misunderstood or, even worse, may be misrepresented but that should not prevent us from being very clear in our conclusions on the simple issue of the Partnership for Peace.  The Partnership for Peace is a co-operative security initiative designed to intensify political and military co-operation in Europe.  We might question the need for that.  The Cold War is over and people may think that all the problems are over because there are no longer two super powers and there will be no difficulties.  That is not so.  The new international system is unstable. Even since the collapse of the communist bloc in Eastern Europe in 1989 and the collapse in the Soviet Union two years later &mdash; fundamental turning points &mdash; we have had wars and rumours of wars all over the place.  In Yugoslavia, which is just a two hour flight from Dublin, one of the most vicious wars since the Second World War has been taking place.  Let us not think for a moment that because the Cold War is over we have a stable international system.  We do not, therefore we have to be concerned about security, particularly security in Europe.</P>
    <P>Security and defence issues must be recognised explicitly as central concerns of our external relations.  We have to be explicit as to the role we can play and that is why I am so disappointed at the decisions arrived at on the Partnership for Peace.  I am also somewhat disappointed at the approach adopted by the principal Opposition party.  The Partnership for Peace has the support of almost all members of the OSCE &mdash; 43 states now subscribe to it, not only the members of NATO, but the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the three Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the four mainland European neutrals, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Malta, whom some may say are a little more neutral than we who are always neutral.  Further east, Russia and all but one of the states of the former Soviet Union subscribe to the PFP.  Despite <Col N="1198" /> this, we cannot make a clear decision to participate in the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>We are in rather unholy company.  A few other countries have still not joined including the countries involved in the conflict in Yugoslavia; Cyprus, which has its own problems; Switzerland, the bank vault of the world, which would not join the UN because it wants to keep away from everyone; and Tadzhikistan, the only one of the former Soviet Republics that has not joined.  Why are we in such company?  We are too timid in our approach.  It is quite clear that the purposes and objectives of the Partnership for Peace are ones to which we can subscribe.  Membership does not involve membership of NATO, the assumption of mutual defence commitments or any commitment or obligation whatsoever in relation to future membership of NATO.  I am certainly not in favour of joining NATO but I am in favour of participating in the Partnership for Peace and I strongly urge that we take a definitive approach in regard to it.</P>
    <P>In his contribution to this debate, Deputy Raphael Burke said participation in the Partnership for Peace &ldquo;would amount to a second class membership of NATO.&rdquo; That is not so.  I do not think that many of the 43 countries to which I have referred would have a notion of joining NATO.  Deputy Burke on behalf of the main Opposition party said he objected because some of the participating states have a nuclear capability. Does that mean we should withdraw from the United Nations because some members of the United Nations have a nuclear capability?  I cannot accept those arguments.  If we cannot reach a decision on that we will have the greatest difficulty in coming to a view as to what should be done about European defence in the future.  I accept fully that there is not a case for joining NATO but like former leaders of this country including the late Sean Lemass, who was a great visionary in his time, I believe that as the European defence component develops we have a role to play in it.  If Europe is worth joining <Col N="1199" /> it is worth defending.  This is the simple approach I have taken.</P>
    <P>There is a great emphasis on what we can get from our membership of the European Union.  I am not one of those purists who believes we should not be squeezing every bob we can from it but we have a responsibility also.  If we are members of the European Union we we have a responsibility together with other members for the defence of that Union. It is fundamental that we as politicians have a duty to explore, tease out and convince the people of this.  I am not sure how a defence pillar of the European Union will develop but I think it will develop.  I accept fully that it should be approved by the people in a referendum but we should explain fully the rationale behind it and there should be a reasoned debate on the issue throughout the Intergovernmental Conference and thereafter before any such referendum. It should not be decided on the basis of a motion as that is not the basis on which rational decisions should be made.  I am sure we will hear a great deal more about the issue of European defence and security in time to come.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues in the White Paper and it is important to refer to some which are of central concern to us.  The Intergovernmental Conference will focus on the balance between the institutions in Europe.  I want to see a strengthening and a widening of the European Union.  We have committed ourselves to a future in the European Union and now that we are a member of the club we have a role to play in helping to see it develop.  That is why I am in favour of enlargement.  There is no doubt that from the point of view of European stability, encouraging the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to prepare for membership of the European Union has a huge role.  I was in Romania a few weeks ago and it is quite clear that the first objective of their foreign policy is to prepare for membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>We cannot be selfish about this and decide because we are inside everybody <Col N="1200" /> else should keep out in case we might lose a few crumbs.  We can not have it both ways, but we must take an approach in favour of enlargement.  In the course of negotiations it will be possible for us to defend our corner and fight as well as the next country for whatever slice of the European cake is available.  We have a good record in that regard and we can maintain it.  I have no philosophical or other problem with such a campaign provided we conduct it on the basis that we do not try to limit membership.</P>
    <P>The institutional balance will be important and there is common accord on some aspects of that issue.  The Commission has a central role, and we have always supported it and been represented on it.  This House is probably unanimous in believing we should continue to be represented on the European Commission.  It is most important from our point of view, as a small nation within the Union.  That representation must be a central plank in our approach to Europe.  If trimming must occur the member states with two commissioners should be first in the firing line.  There is no reason the British, French and Germans should have two members of the Commission but, it is easy to give up other people's entitlements.</P>
    <P>What to do about smaller new member states such as Malta and Cyprus will be a problem.  We will have to reserve judgment especially in view of the fact that a small state.  Luxembourg, was a founder member of the Union.  I made a proposal some years ago, subsequently derided by Fianna Fáil but which should be given careful consideration.  I proposed that the President of the European Commission should be directly elected by the people of Europe in the same way as the President of the United States is directly elected.  I do not envisage equivalence between the two positions but the proposal should be given careful consideration.  It would increase the democratic legitimacy of European institutions.  I hope the proposal will receive more thought on this occasion, <Col N="1201" /> particularly from the main Opposition party which derided it some years ago.</P>
    <P>There are other issues with regard to European institutions.  There is the question of the European Parliament, the number of members it should have and its powers.  A case can be made for some extension of the Parliament's powers.  There is also the issue of voting in the Council of Ministers.  Should there be a further extension of weighted majority voting?  We must cautiously agree that some extension of majority voting will be necessary, particularly in an enlarged community.  Otherwise the European Union will be paralysed.</P>
    <P>I can only touch on the issues in the short time available.  I hope there will be many more debates and we will focus on certain issues and give them the careful and detailed attention they require.  A good start has been made and I am delighted to have been able to participate in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to this important debate on the White Paper and I congratulate them on the calibre and thoughtfulness of those contributions. The White Paper attempts to set out where we see ourselves as a nation.  It is not the definitive answer to our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the world but it sets out the reflective Irish position about a series of European and international institutions.  It does so in the context of our consciousness of ourselves as a small, neutral country with an important voice and important historical experiences which allow us to make a contribution to both the European Union and the institutions of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one principle underlies our foreign policy as a neutral state it is that neutrality is not mere passivity.  The White Paper emphasises our neutrality and states categorically that it has served this country well.  No real arguments have been put forward as to why we should vary that policy.  The paper also states that we will not join either NATO <Col N="1202" /> or the Western European Union.  Given that we are a small, neutral country we have an obligation, which the White Paper also sets out, to make a strong contribution to disarmament in the context of both nuclear and conventional weapons.</P>
    <P>This is the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl and it is appropriate that we are debating foreign policy today.  We should remember the victims of Chernobyl and the continued suffering which that terrible tragedy has caused.  Our role in promoting nuclear non-proliferation is well known.  However, on this anniversary, it is appropriate to reiterate our opposition to the use of nuclear power for electricity generation at home and our concerns about the safe management of nuclear waste abroad.  We will continue to pursue with both the UK Government and at EU level our legitimate concerns about Sellafield and similar plants.  The memory of what happened at Chernobyl is a reminder for us to be ever vigilant and active with regard to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Sargent's remarks, in the context of non-proliferation of weapons, I welcome his statements supporting the position taken by NGOs such as Pax Christi and others about landmines.  I am delighted he has made a public statement on the matter and the Green Party supports our calls for a worldwide ban on landmines.  However, it is unfortunate that Deputy Sargent does not appear to be aware that when Ireland attended the review conference last year &mdash; I represented the Irish Government &mdash; it was one of five countries calling for a total ban on landmines.  There are now 31 countries supporting a worldwide ban.  On 23 April last, the British Government announced it was joining the call for a ban on anti-personnel landmines.  This is a substantial advance, in addition to the statement released just before Easter by the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States military that they would review their position on landmines.  Irish people can be rightly proud that the Irish Government has taken a leading role in this matter.  That <Col N="1203" /> role is acknowledged by Pax Christi and many other NGOs in Ireland and throughout the world and by the European campaign of NGOs, a group that campaigns on the landmines issue and which I have met on a number of occasions.  They have congratulated us on the leading position we have taken and will continue to adopt until the world sees an end to the use of these weapons.  Landmines are weapons of war but they cause about 26,000 deaths and injuries a year to innocent civilians long after conflicts have ended.</P>
    <P>Regarding dialogue on foreign policy, the White Paper was preceded by a series of seminars, each of which had an attendance in excess of several hundred people.  It initiated a fairly widespread debate on areas of our foreign policy which has been helpful.  It focused and highlighted areas of concern, such as human rights and development issues which our people expect the Government to ensure will be addressed at international fora.  The process of dialogue, initiated by the Government in preparing the White Paper, will not end with its publication.  Already various committees of the House, particularly the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the sub-committee on development have had fairly lengthy discussions on it.</P>
    <P>Regarding a number of points that arose on enlargement of the Union, Deputy O'Malley rightly referred to the future of the CAP and the Union's policies in the area of economic and social cohesion.  We fully recognise the challenges in these areas.  That is why we must ensure that enlargement takes place in the context of the deepening of European integration and the maintenance of those key policies.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Malley that Structural and Cohesion Funds have not been well used.  The Commissioner responsible is on the record as saying that Ireland has been particularly successful in the use of Structural Funds.  I agree <Col N="1204" /> with Deputy Ahern that we have nothing to apologise for in insisting that our structural and cohesion needs should be recognised and that the Union's policies in these areas should be fully implemented here.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies expressed concern about the publication of the White Paper prior to the official launch of the Intergovernmental Conference in Turin on 29 March.  As the Taoiseach said recently in this House, the publication of the White Paper was very timely. Ireland's White Paper is one of the most up to date statements on the broader issues which are likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference and its publication close to the launch of the Intergovernmental Conference helps focus the public's attention on the European Union, its importance for Ireland and its future development.  The Government is very aware that for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference to be a success it must be transparent in its conduct and outcome.  We have sought since last year, in the context of the preparation of the White Paper, to encourage informed public debate about the issues likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference and their implications for Ireland and Europe.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference must consider what Treaty amendments could bring the Union closer to the public in terms of making its workings more comprehensible and transparent and, above all, in terms of Treaty reforms which would make the Union more effective in areas of direct concern to the public.  Deputy Ahern noted that we are strongly in favour of the establishment of transparency in the operation of the institutions.  In the White paper we have identified a number of specific issues of public concern which we believe could be better addressed through new or enhanced Treaty provisions. These issues include the maintenance and creation of employment and the continuing fight against international drug trafficking.  The Intergovernmental Conference must not be seen as a panacea for all Europe's <Col N="1205" /> ills.  I am confident that it can produce a framework within which the Union can more effectively play its role in tackling on a broader front those issues which affect the well-being of the Union and society in general.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency in the latter half of the year we will make every effort to ensure that our stewardship of the Intergovernmental Conference encourages openness and transparency and that it is not perceived as a secret negotiation behind closed doors.  If the reasons for public indifference and lack of comprehension, which were evident in many member states during the Maastricht process, remain neglected and untreated the necessary support for the process of integration, which is profoundly in the interest of the citizens of the Union, will not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the political and security aspects of the White Paper which have received a considerable amount of attention.  In the course of his intervention Deputy Ray Burke described as a double-think the Government's wish to be a constructive participant in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations on a common defence policy for the European Union. That is surprising because the Maastricht Treaty, ratified following a referendum, states that, &ldquo;The Common Foreign and Security Policy shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Ahern seemed to imply that the Government is edging towards membership of the Western European Union, but that is not the case.  I reiterated earlier that the White Paper sets out unequivocally our position and the benefits we have derived from our neutrality and that we will not be applying for membership of NATO or the Western European Union at any stage.</P>
    <P>What is missing from this debate is a broader conception of how Europe, particularly in the context of the enlargement that has taken place and will take place in the future, which will <Col N="1206" /> incorporate more countries with traditions of neutrality, such as ours, and countries with differing histories, will be a Europe that will offer a number of different models, ways of participating and historical traditions.  In that diversity will lie one of the strengths of the future European Union.  It is not homogeneous, with large countries or those with a strong military history dictating to smaller ones.  It will be a community of diversity which will allow the citizens of the Community to express a broad diversity of approach to foreign policy and security issues.  Therein will lie the future strength of the Union.</P>
    <P>As stated in the White Paper, the Government will examine on a case by case basis the possibility of Irish participation in humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping tasks under the Petersberg Declaration.  The Government believes that a willingness to participate on a case by case basis in the Petersberg Tasks would be in keeping with Ireland's commitment to international peace, would constitute a concrete contribution to European security and would be a sign of solidarity with our European partners and neighbours in the search for a more secure and stable security order in Europe.  It is envisaged that humanitarian and peacekeeping tasks under Petersberg would take place at the request of the UN, the OSCE or the EU in accordance with the Maastricht provisions.  We should not have any doubt about the strength of commitment in the White Paper, paragraph 4.9 of which states that Ireland's policy of military neutrality has served us well and that there is no intention to amend it.  Paragraph 4.10 states: &ldquo;The Government will not be proposing that Ireland should seek membership of NATO or the Western European Union, or the assumption of their mutual defence guarantees&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Partnership for Peace is not a military alliance nor is it a backdoor for Irish entry into NATO.  It is an inclusive co-operative venture with significant value in the area of training for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, environmental protection and drugs interdiction.  As the White Paper makes <Col N="1207" /> clear, the overall objectives of the Partnership for Peace are consistent with Ireland's approach to peace and security and participation in it could have important advantages for us.  The Partnership for Peace now includes nearly all members of the OSCE.  Has Ireland nothing to contribute to or gain from this co-operative security framework in which almost every other European country is involved?  The Partnership for Peace is a novel concept in international security co-operation and it is not surprising that there should be such a level of interest and debate about our possible participation.  However, I am disappointed at the misperceptions of what is involved.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed, at the level of some of the debate on this issue.  It is important that there should be an examination, on a case by case basis, of our possible participation in PFP tasks. People seem to have an incredible desire to take refuge under the shelter of the UN framework, while at the same time many people who debate this point, such as Deputy Sargent, go on to outline detailed critiques of the failures of UN structures, in particular the UN Security Council.  The reality of the Security Council and of missions carried out under the UN mandate, for those who are concerned about this broader debate, is that council members have the largest armies and the largest nuclear capabilities in the world.  PFP includes many countries with strong traditions of military neutrality.  We should honestly examine the shortcomings of the UN, particularly the military structures and capabilities of the permanent members of the Security Council.  If we are to have a balanced debate, we must discuss all aspects and elements of the issue in an open and honest manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the discussion document, <i>Developing a Policy for <Col N="1208" /> Women's Health.</i> It is welcome in that it mainlines and mainstreams women's health issues which, up to the time of this and the former Minister, tended to be solely the concerns of women's interest groups, such as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights. The Minister rightly gave credit to its former chairman, Ms Monica Barnes, on whose initiative the first steps towards developing this policy in its present form were commenced.</P>
      <P>During the 1980s we discussed documents drafted by the UN, the Council for the Status of Women and the Commission for the Status of Women, which pointed out the need for a specific policy on women's health.  They pointed out areas where women suffered, that women in Ireland were faring worse than women in other parts of the world and that there were women in some places who were a great deal worse off than women here.  All the related issues were raised from time to time by specific women's groups.</P>
      <P>This document is extremely welcome in that these issues are being taken on board in a comprehensive and committed way by the Department.  Commitments are being given, albeit tentative and directional at this point in terms of resources, and services are being developed in response to particular areas of concern.  I thank all the women who participated in various commissions, councils and committees.  I have never been a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights but I thank all those who have worked on behalf of women to mainline what have too often dealt with as also ran issues outside the mainsteam of policy.  I congratulate the Ministers involved for actively taking the report on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When reading the report one cannot but be taken aback by the major problems facing women, particularly with regard to risks of mortality.  Irish women have a substantially shorter life expectancy than most of their European counterparts.  The main causes of early death are heart disease and cancer. Specific services need to be developed, <Col N="1209" /> particularly in the area of cancer, and the Minister has given a strong commitment in this regard.  I look forward to hearing in the near future details of the proposed programme for the development of services for cancer which the working group is to issue.  Substantial funding has already been given to St. Luke's Hospital and to other services.</P>
    <P>Services are needed by all sectors of society but particularly by women who are prone to risks of lung and breast cancer.  Lung cancer is associated with smoking.  It is disturbing that many young women are commencing and continuing to smoke.  This indicates the need for an interested programme, starting with health promotion which, hopefully, would ultimately reduce the need for increased services later in life.</P>
    <P>Because early detection of breast cancer can lead to successful treatment, and much less radical treatment than was the practice in the past, many of us would like to see the level of services, including screening, improved.  Screening services are available on a relatively <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Until the recent past, they were mainly available only when voluntary groups provided them; they were provided in only a limited way by State services.  The extension of screening services on a universal, countrywide basis, particularly to age cohorts at highest risk, should be an absolute priority.</P>
    <P>For women the spread of services is critical.  As a Dubliner it is easy for me to relax and say that whatever is available is bound to be available in Dublin. From my attendance at the Fine Gael women's conference, where we discussed this health policy, I know there are great concerns among rural women about access to a wide variety of services, particularly in the areas of pregnancy, fertility and cancer.  Women who were infected with the hepatitis C virus as a result of the failures of the blood transfusion service identify with the problems of having to travel long distances for specialist services.  People in Dublin and other urban centres must continue to make the case for women in isolated communities who may be less <Col N="1210" /> economically well off and reliant on public transport.  The availability of accessible health services is critical for women who are confined to their homes and have the responsibility and burden of caring for children.</P>
    <P>The report identifies heart disease as one of the other major causes of early death among women.  This might surprise people because we tend to think of heart attacks as being associated more with stressed out businessmen rather than with the stereotype image of Irish women.  This can be linked to diet and life practices.</P>
    <P>It was announced during the week that a new committee would be set up to oversee the development of sports facilities.  The Minister asked it to concentrate on the development of sports facilities for women.  I very much welcome this as it is a critical issue for women.</P>
    <P>Once they reach their teenage years, it is very easy for girls to be sidelined into sedentary activities, except perhaps for a short period when they go disco dancing.  Almost all physical sporting activity models are male and almost all television coverage concentrates on male sports.  Due to the successes in women's hockey and the emergence of female soccer teams, women are beginning to get their noses in, but one only has to contrast, for example, the attention given to the all-Ireland football and hurling finals with that given to the camogie final.  I welcome the President's initiative to assist in giving a higher profile to women's sports.</P>
    <P>Lifestyle is a critical issue for women as both good and bad practices are established during teenage years.  If the situation was transformed and there were models and support from a wide range of State services, many women could avoid problems.  There is no doubt that diet and exercise are of critical importance.</P>
    <P>I know from experience that, with the best will in the world, it is extremely difficult for a mother of two, three or four <Col N="1211" /> children to find time for herself.  Traditionally, 8.37 a.m. is the time the single woman, the businessman and perhaps the politician &mdash; Deputy Richard Bruton was seen jogging down Griffith Avenue at 8 a.m. recently &mdash; goes for a jog before work, but it is also the time a mother with children is under more pressure as babies have to be addressed and children sent to school.  Likewise, in the evening, when others might find time for themselves, she catches up on work while the children are in bed. Opportunities are, therefore, limited, even for women with a desire to take exercise.  If there were sufficient images of active women, to match the expectation that men and boys will be involved in sports, women could be much healthier and have a better quality of life, thereby reducing the demands on the health service.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the problems of women suffering from depression and overweight, smoking and teenage pregnancies. A large European document, which I have not yet had time to read analyses child care services in European countries.  I have no doubt it will confirm the findings of the last study that within this State there is a lack of child care services, such as the general availability of créches, child care and Government financial support for child care.  Apart from the United Kingdom which is the only country with comparably poor service, a vastly better service is provided throughout the rest of Europe, in terms of maternity and paternity leave, parental leave and State provided child care services.  This is critical in terms of the health of women.</P>
    <P>While many women choose to be in the home, many others would choose to mix being in the home and at work, or being engaged in sporting and voluntary activities and having a healthier lifestyle if support was provided in terms of child care facilities.  It is no accident that, despite the availability of choice, most men choose to remain in the active workforce where they can attend business lunches and go for a drink after <Col N="1212" /> work with their friends with the camaraderie and personal satisfaction that goes with it.  Work in the home is extremely hard and demanding, although working with children and overseeing their development can be very satisfying.  However, its remains unsupported with the result that many women, if they had a choice, would prefer a mix.</P>
    <P>In the absence of well paid employment, State child care facilities are essential.  The provision of a substantial impetus would lead to a marked improvement in the health of and morbidity rates among women with fewer suffering from depression and needing valium.  The opportunity to work also offers women independence.</P>
    <P>The issue of violence against women is dealt with in the report.  The findings of recent reports and the campaigns organised by the various organisations which deal with women and children who have suffered abuse illustrate that there is an extraordinarily high incidence of violence.  In this context the anlaysis in the most recent book by Roddy Doyle is revealing and shows how women can become trapped.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of services for the victims of violence and this is not covered sufficiently in the report.  The position in Dublin is unsatisfactory.  Although there are one or two well supported refuge centres they cannot cope with the demand for places.  Last year the Minister provided substantial finance to fund the development of a major new centre on the northside of the city, but this is only a tiny drop in the ocean.  Elsewhere there is a dependence on voluntary groups to provide such centres.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any location where the State decided to provide a service.  It has responded to the demands of local active groups in our main cities, but there are many areas without a refuge. Until we offer women and their children a way out of violent situations, large numbers of women will continue to suffer from depression and their children will suffer other long-terms effects.</P>
    <P>These are the gaps in the report that <Col N="1213" /> I would like to see filled in.  If women are to be healthy and have a good quality of life, child care and other services, such as refuge centres, are of critical importance.</P>
    <P>The issue of teenage pregnancies is dealt with briefly in the report.  The Government has committed itself to a specific policy of targeting resources towards groups with low health status and giving them priority.  Particular attention will be paid to teenage pregnancies. In other words, we will try to care for the young women concerned as well as we can, which is meritorious, but it is not enough for those who become parents at such an early age.</P>
    <P>A deputation of members of the Select Committee on Social Affairs visited Sweden where a ban on the physical punishment of children has been successfully implemented for over 20 years. It met representatives of the social services from which it received much general information.  Teenage pregnancies are virtually unheard of there.  This raises the question of the way we order and organise our society.  Apart from the problem of high levels of unemployment, there is the issue of why so many young women make that life choice.  It is not enough to say we will try to look after them as best we can; we need to do something much more fundamental to offer young women choices comparable to those expected by young women in Northern Europe, such as the opportunity for personal development, to grow to maturity, to take up work and pursue education courses, before they enter into the demanding role of parenting. Something much more fundamental needs to be done to offer better choices to young women so they will have a life comparable with what other young north European women expect.  Such a life would, at least, offer them personal development, an opportunity to reach adult maturity as well as having work and educational opportunities before entering into the demanding role of parenting. It would be better for them and for their children, as well as giving them a better quality of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> While I welcome the concern about teenage pregnancy, we have to review fundamentally our acceptance of the high numbers of young women who become mothers by the time they are in there late teens when in physical, emotional or intellectural terms their own maturing process is not even complete. We should be able to do better for the next generation.  The best group from whom we can learn are lone parents who have matured and coped with it.  A substantial study should be done among them in relation to how we can offer the next generation, a better life choice with different health and welfare outcomes as a result.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome and valuable document which faces up to the medical and health problems facing women.  It identifies all the main categories of special medical problems associated with women and those that affect women a great deal more than men, as well as identifying strategies to tackle them.</P>
    <P>I pointed out one or two gaps in this proposal which largely covers the Department of Health.  When discussing women's health it is impossible to stay within that narrow area because issues, including employment, sport, recreation, education and social welfare, also impact directly on the quality of their lives.  In the context of a health strategy it is an extremely welcome document which further expands the commitment, to the areas of child care and domestic violence.  If, in reviewing this in five to ten years' time, we find that substantial sections of it have been implemented, we will see the results in improved health for women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on this report.  I will not repeat the points that have been made on child care and other areas touched on by the previous speaker.  I will restrict myself to a number of points including the need for proper, well equipped and professionally manned health centres available to women in local areas.  These <Col N="1215" /> would provide the best quality health service at local level.</P>
      <P>We have a greying population and, consequently, there will be an increasing need for proper geriatric care in our society.  The absence of such care is a burden that falls in most cases on the daughters or wives of the elderly, and it is a burden which damages the health of wives and daughters.  A concentrated effort should be made to provide adequate geriatric care within our communities.</P>
      <P>In my own area of Fingal in north County Dublin there is an ageing population &mdash; as is the case in every other part of the country &mdash; and there is no care facility for geriatrics outside the private sector.  In St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane, where I was born and where my father nursed, we have a fine facility with well trained, caring staff who are capable of providing geriatric facilities for the local population.</P>
      <P>The numbers of psychiatric patients in that hospital are, thankfully, dropping as we have more and more care in the community, including St. Joseph's mental handicap service.  We have available, however, a core of well qualified and well trained staff who have provided care for generations &mdash; the sons and daughters of those who previously nursed in the hospital.</P>
      <P>While the number of psychiatric patients is falling, we have an increasing potential to use that site and the expertise of staff for the development of proper geriatric services for Fingal residents. We have a ludicrous situation where, within St. Ita's Hospital, health board policy dictates that older residential patients are being moved out to private nursing homes in County Meath and elsewhere while well trained staff are available who are capable of providing geriatric services for the hospital's resident patients.  What is going on is totally contradictory because at the same time we have an ageing population in north County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the trained staff that are available, and using few resources, we should <Col N="1216" /> be able to provide geriatric care for the region.  There is a tradition of care involving tained staff in the peninsula of Portrane and Donabate, and I call on the Minister to examine that matter urgently.</P>
    <P>There appeared to be a policy within the Eastern Health Board of trying to close the St. Ita's facility.  Rather than closing it we should examine the matter with a view to opening geriatric care facilities there for local people and for residential patients who are already in the hospital.  It would make more sense than demolishing the existing buildings. We are celebrating the centenary of that facility and should have a long-term policy for it.  This issue affects women's health not just because women live longer than men but because the task of caring for elderly relatives usually falls on them.</P>
    <P>I know a number of women who were infected with hepatitis C and the affect it has on them physically and mentally. It is a scandal that merits the closest examination and action.  The matter has been debated in the House on a number of occasions.  Neither the Government, agencies such as the Blood Transfusion Service Board or specialists should try to defend what happened, obscure records and so on.  This affects the health and peace of mind of many thousands of women.  We should be open in our approach and err on the side of generosity of spirit rather than go into a defensive mode, which apparently is how matters are being treated at present.</P>
    <P>Delays in orthodontic treatment are shameful.  It may not be politically correct to say so but teenage girls are conscious of their appearance if they need orthodontic treatment.  Many parents have come to me as a public representatives stating that their 12 year old daughter who needs orthodontic treatment was placed on a waiting list and would not receive treatment for four or five years.  Not only is the damage done by that time but there is psychological damage as the girl grows up realising she needs orthodontic treatment which <Col N="1217" /> is not available to her.  This can leave mental scars in later years.  This area must be addressed.  Young boys also need orthodontic treatment.  There is no reason orthodontic treatment cannot be carried out privately and that proper contracts cannot be negotiated with orthodontists who charge ludicrous prices for treatment.</P>
    <P>There is need for proper geriatric services nationally but I emphasise the need in north County Dublin.  St. Ita's in Portrane is the ideal facility for such a service as it has sufficient space and a trained and caring staff.  Two units have been set out for geriatric care.  What is needed is a change in the health board's philosophy of &ldquo;close everything down&rdquo;. There is undoubted need for such a service and, rather than depend on private nursing homes, we should adapt the existing facilities and make them available not just for psychiatric and handicapped services but for that one also. Not a week goes by without people telling me about their experience of trying to get an aged parent or relative into geriatric care.  It is a dreadful burden for any daughter or niece to bear and that matter should be looked at in any policy which purports to deal with women's health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this document.  There is a commitment in A Government of Renewal to publish a plan for the development of health services for women.  This discussion document, published in the middle of last year, is the first step.  It was proposed that the issues in the document would be debated at as local a level as possible, there would be widespread consultation and that consumers of women's health services would be involved in devising the Government's policy.  That happened as planned. There was widespread consultation and a great deal of involvement by women in developing the policy.  My experience in the Eastern Health Board bears that out.  It was exemplary in its approach to developing the policy and drew many lessons from <i>Shaping a Healthier</i><Col N="1218" /> Future.  The National Women's Council of Ireland was very much part of the launch of the document and had a big input in the consultative process.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Eastern Health Board I am aware that that whole process has been extremely successful. Since last June 6,000 to 8,000 women in that area were consulted about the services they believe are needed in the women's health area.  Notices appeared in newspapers, submissions were invited and questionnaires circulated throughout the health board area.  A large number of completed questionnaires were returned and submissions were received from a number of organisations and individuals.  Workshops were held on a wide range of issues relating to women's health, covering such items as women and violence, mental health, lifestyle and health behaviour, reproductive health and the health of different age groups of women, young, middle-aged and elderly.  Lesbian health issues were also considered as well as consultation and the representation of women in the health services.</P>
      <P>As a result of many months of consultation with various groups, the Eastern Health Board has drawn some conclusions and is making submissions to the Department of Health.  The consultation process is proceeding as outlined by the Minister last year.  During the course of consultation a number of recurrent themes were raised by individual women and women's groups.  It is strongly believed that there are barriers to women becoming involved in the health services, particularly in terms of accessing services.  Many of those barriers result from socio-economic factors. Concern was expressed about the current methods of dissemination of information and there was reference to the need to concentrate on preventive measures and promote a healthy lifestyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to involve women's organisations in planning, monitoring and evaluation of services was raised.  The main barriers to a healthy lifestyle were considered financial, time factors and the <Col N="1219" /> lack of facilities &mdash; the biggest factor being cost.  Concern was expressed by many people about the need to develop locally based services.  It is believed that women should have an input to the planning and provision of services on an ongoing basis &mdash; the need to involve women's groups with expertise in this area was particularly underlined.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised was the need to develop health services.  The importance of friendliness and efficiency of professionals working in the field was stressed, as well as the need to develop sympathetic and sensitive listening skills.  At the root of this issue is self-empowerment for women in terms of health and lifestyle in general.  During the consultations an issue raised repeatedly was stress, which is believed to be one of the most powerfully destructive factors in women's health.  That basic cause of ill health, which may result in psychiatric difficulties and general unhappiness for women, must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board drew up a number of priorities, which will be submitted to the Department, covering a wide range of issues relating to women. It was stated that much work has been done in the maternity area by the Irish association for improvements in maternity services.  Recommendations in that regard were taken on board by the various groups and individuals involved in the consultation.  Another matter highlighted was the disappointingly low level of breast feeding &mdash; 30 per cent of women start breast feeding while in hospital but on return to the home that figure drops dramatically.  It was felt that not enough is being done by the Department and health boards to promote and encourage breast feeding. There is a societal negative attitude to breast feeding and that problem must be tackled so that people perceive breast feeding as the optimun feeding for babies and are aware of the health benefits that accrue.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed about the lack of family planning services throughout <Col N="1220" /> the country, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  There is need for greater access to information in this area and widespread promotion of family planning in schools and groups.  Women who have their own income, particularly working women, are in a position to access and pay for these services, but concern was expressed that many women may not have access to information and do not have money to spend on family planning services.  We must concentrate on making those services much more widely available in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The question of hormone replacement therapy is a matter of concern to older women.  There is a belief that there is a great lack of information on this matter.  Given the importance of hormone therapy for older women, it should be widely available free of charge.</P>
    <P>Throughout the consultation process the underlying theme was the need to include women in the development of services. The expertise of support groups for various aspects of health services should be availed of.  Rather than making decisions at departmental or health board level and imposing services we should examine what is currently in existence.  Despite working on shoestring budgets these groups have developed a great deal of expertise and built up the confidence of local women. We should use that as a base and increase resources.  A bottom up approach should be adopted.</P>
    <P>Another area dealt with in the document is the question of violence against women and the lack of adequate refuge places.  While I recognise progress has been made in this area in the past number of years, including provision of additional funding, we have a long way to go before our services are at an adequate level, given the scale of the problem of domestic violence.  In addition to providing more refuge places there is an ongoing need to provide proper training for people working in refuges.  We need to develop refuges <Col N="1221" /> more as one-stop-shops offering a range of legal, health and social welfare expertise.  In that way, they can respond to the urgent needs of women who face this problem.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk recently about teenage pregnancies, an area of concern to many of us.  Huge numbers of teenage girls either by accident or design end up in circumstances which are undesirable from a public policy point of view.  Previous speakers referred to the difficulties faced by young girls, merely children, who become pregnant.  I frequently come across cases in my constituency involving 15, 16 or 17 year old girls who are very much at risk because of their circumstances. If these girls are at risk, how much more at risk are their children? Such thoughts can make one feel a sense of gloom in regard to the future of many of these children.</P>
    <P>These pregnancies should not occur but, where they do, there is a lack of support for young mothers and a lack of intervention on the part of the health services.  It is important, however, to give credit to the new services that have been developed in this respect.  One of the jewels in the crown is the community mothers scheme which has been successfully developed.  This scheme is based on the principle of availing of the expertise of other mothers who have reared children successfully and who share that expertise with young mothers.  That is an effective way of intervening with young teenage mothers without the barrier of the professional language so often used which can be off-putting. The scheme is also consumer friendly which has contributed to its success.</P>
    <P>An issue that arose in the course of the consultations was the need to have specific services for lesbian women.  It is quite disturbing that the priority area identified for them was the need for the provision of a Freefone line for life saving services.  For that to be seen as the priority area is an indictment of society and an indication of the health issues <Col N="1222" /> involved for lesbian women and the psychological supports they need.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the problems of carers.  There are generally two women involved, the person being cared for and the carer, and the needs of both must be recognised.  This problem does not fall only to the Department of Health; there is significant input from the Department of Finance, as well as significant constraints.  There is a need for specific focus on carers.</P>
    <P>Another area highlighted related to female drug users and the need for specifically female services and support groups.  It was indicated in the consultations that the preference of women with a drug abuse problem is to meet in an all female support group.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to refer to all of the areas covered in the document which represents a comprehensive response from the Eastern Health Board.  I have no doubt the responses from the other health boards were equally comprehensive. It was recognised by the Minister when he launched the document that the key note in approaching the question of developing a health policy for women is to listen.  We have gone through that whole procedure.  There has been a great deal of listening and input by individual women and by women's groups.  I look forward to the Minister responding to that, as I am sure he will, and to having a comprehensive women's health policy document which the Government can follow in the coming years.</P>

    <P>It is a sign of the times that equality has been accepted and that we can discuss these matters without the objections of men.  Such debates can be a boost for men also.  Perhaps we will all live to be 100 years old but if we highlight women's health issues, the health problems of men may also be focused upon in the future.</P>
    <P>Over the years women did a great deal of hard work in bad conditions. Mothers without the benefit of mod cons, did great work in looking after large families, often sacrificing their own lives for the sake of their children. We cannot pay a sufficiently high tribute to mothers who I am sure were waved into heaven by St. Peter because of the sacrifices they made.  When it came to sharing the food on the table, they were the people who got the leftovers. Many a big strapping son decided he deserved his share of the food more than his mother.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): The mother of the family worked the hardest to ensure that the rest of the family did well in life.  Previous speakers referred to teenage pregnancies.  It is difficult for teenagers to look after their babies. Anyone who is married, has a mature and responsible partner and lives in good housing knows it is not easy to rear children.  Teenagers who may want to go out and enjoy themselves with their colleagues but who have to stay at home to look after a baby 24 hours a day have a difficult role to play.  When they come to my clinic looking for a house my heart goes out to them in view of the responsibility they have to take on.  Babies cannot be clocked in and out at certain times.  They need all kinds of attention every hour of the day and night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> It would be nice to think we could do something to lower the number of teenage pregnancies because we certainly have far too many.  For their own sakes and for the sake of the babies who have to grow into children and adults, they have to get a chance in life.  We should do all we can for those who have babies to ensure they have the opportunity to look after them properly.  There is no point in being moralistic about it: the babies are born and we have to look after them.  This has put a big strain on housing.  Children cannot grow up healthy if they are living in poor housing conditions.  Often teenage mothers get the worst flats because people are not inclined to let flats to them.  Frequently young girls have to rent substandard flats which are bad for themselves and their babies.  If there is any way in which we can get across the message that teenage pregnancies are not advisable we should do so but it is not easy to moralise on this issue.</P>
    <P>We should pay tribute today to a former colleague, Mrs. Monica Barnes, who in the days before equality was the in-thing and before women's problems had been highlighted, set about drawing attention to women.  This was followed by the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which suggested there should be discussion documents on women's health.  These discussions are not confined to the Dáil.  It is important that women can meet and express their views because they know their problems at first-hand.  They are expert in child birth, yet it is amazing the amount of advice they receive from males.  They have to listen to all kinds of advice when in fact they are the experts.  The one advantage in this type of discussion document is that they can offer their views.  They should be listened to much more than at present.  It is important that their experiences, awareness and concerns are expressed. Frequently there are theories on certain topics which are far removed from the practicalities.  The way in which the medical services are arranged and the inconvenience for women and mothers <Col N="1225" /> are issues that should be highlighted. Any discussion is an opportunity for women to express their views.  They know better than most men exactly what they want.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the role of health boards and said some were setting up new systems.  This is important because the health boards are becoming more local.  The reports are in the local newspapers and on local radio which is more effective than advertising on national bodies in the daily newspapers or on national radio.  Many of the people who need this type of help do not read the daily newspapers or pay much attention to national radio but they listen to local radio.  If statements from the local health board about medical treatment or plans for the future are read out on local radio or published in the local newspapers there is a greater chance of people hearing or reading them and, therefore, they will have more effect.  The local health boards can provide facilities at local level.  There is no point in having exclusive screening schemes in Dublin if people cannot avail of them.  I am aware one cannot have expensive top rate facilities in every village but the more available they are the more they will be used and the better they will be for those who wish to avail of them.</P>
    <P>It has been highlighted in the report that people suffering from depression may not go out and that the radio is their only lifeline.  They may never read a newspaper.  Local radio has filled a void in the lives of many people.  It should be used to get across the message to the ordinary person who may never buy a daily newspaper or listen to national radio.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to read in the Minister's speech of the prevalence of heart disease among Irish women.  He said: &ldquo;Mortality from heart disease in Irish women is among the highest of any of the countries of the European Union and is currently 70 per cent above the EU average&rdquo;.  If the rate is 70 per cent above the EU average, something must be seriously wrong in Ireland and there <Col N="1226" /> should be a focus on that disadvantage. Smoking has been mentioned as a contributing factor but I shall deal with it later.  Something must be drastically wrong that should be easily identifiable. Seventy per cent above the EU average is shocking.  Depression has been referred to as being a serious contributor. It may be that housing conditions, financial considerations and so on, apart from any medical problem, are major factors.  Obviously the more discussion there is on this topic the more advances will be made.</P>
    <P>Smoking has been referred to by several people and has been mentioned by the Minister.  In this day and age when people are educated and young people are probably better educated than any previous generation, there are more young people smoking than in the past. One has only to drive past any secondary school at lunch time to see this.  I am convinced &mdash; I do not think I am biased &mdash; that more young girls are smoking than ever before.  They are standing around corners, sitting on walls puffing smoke.  I cannot understand why they begin at such a young age.  If they started to smoke at the age of 45, when they are more stabilised, I am sure they would not be able to continue the art of smoking.  The number of teenagers smoking at lunchtime is unbelievable. What can one do for young people who are intelligent, who understand and who take no notice?</P>
    <P>The statistics on breast cancer are more encouraging.  The Minister said we could reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 years of age by one-third by screening women aged 50 to 64 for the disease.  If the number of deaths could be reduced by one-third it would be a major achievement. The Minister introduced new plans for breast screening facilities throughout the country.  Surely such screening should be encouraged if it results in a one-third reduction in deaths from breast cancer.  He also stated that 40 of every 75 deaths &mdash; a reduction of more than 50 per cent &mdash; from cervical cancer <Col N="1227" /> could be prevented by a screening programme for women between the ages of 30 and 50.  While I am sure the Minister will provide additional facilities for such screening, that does not mean people will avail of them.  Women's organisations, in particular, should advise their colleagues to avail of those facilities.  I hope the publication of this document will encourage more discussion on women's health and that women will listen to advice.</P>
    <P>In disagreeing with raising the minimum age at which a person may marry a theologian from St. Patrick's College in Thurles stated that the Church should allow people at 14 to marry.  I do not wish to get involved in a discussion on moral theology but anyone who suggests that a person is ready for marriage at the age of 14 must believe more in theory than in practice.  Perhaps celibacy has something to do with his comments. It is outrageous that anyone should encourage teenagers to marry. The Government should be commended for raising the age at which people can marry.  Marriage is difficult and requires maturity, commonsense and patience which children of 14 years do not possess.  I am not sure if age brings maturity in all people, but it is outrageous to suggest that because people have reached the age of puberty and are sexually curious they are ready for marriage.  If marriage at 14 merely allows them enjoy a sex life, the marriage would not last long.  I am amazed that a person in a key position would adopt that position.  Although some cope well, most teenagers of 17 and 18 find it difficult to cope with pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I hope discussion on women's health will improve their lives.  Everybody should be as healthy as possible and anything that gives rise to that should be encouraged by the Department of Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this document. Given our finite resources we <Col N="1228" /> should examine how we can spend money to deliver services that will provide tangible results.</P>
      <P>I welcome the document with some reservations.  A document on women's health excludes 50 per cent of the population. The statement that there are twice as many women as men over the age of 75 raises fundamental questions about the health of 50 per cent of our population.  While it is important to dwell on the document before us, I await with interest the final chapter from the Department of Health, a policy document on men's health.  There are a number of issues relating to men's health on which we should also focus.  A banner headline in one of today's newspapers stated that we have the highest rate of male suicides in Europe.  Those two statistics alone make a case for the publication of a document on men's health.</P>
      <P>Apart from ensuring that services are delivered in a more focused, customer friendly and value for money fashion, the <i>raison d'étre</i> for the document must be that we score badly on the league table in regard to women's health.  The life expectancy of women here is lower than that in any other EU country.  To arrive at a consensus on future policy in this area there have been ongoing consultations since the document was published.</P>
      <P>It is important that women are included in decisions on their health.  As a member of the Southern Health Board for the past 11 years I have observed with interest the valuable contributions of professional and non-professional female members of the board. Some of their alternative views do not appear to cross the minds of male members of the board.  It is vital that politicians encourage greater female participation in the decision-making process particularly on issues relating to women's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the two new Members of the House, I am delighted we have a new female Member.  I have no doubt both will make valuable contributions to <Col N="1229" /> all debates, including those on women's health.</P>
    <P>The question of women's health is a cause of grave concern and the role of the GP is crucial in this regard.  The general practitioner in the front line of service delivery offers a holistic approach to patient care that is very often separate and differs significantly from the centralised specialised treatment delivery on which hospital care tends to focus.  General practitioners offer a particular advantage in that, by virtue of the medical card system, they deal with approximately one third of the population. As access to a medical card is largely financially determined, they deal with the lower socio-economic groups, including the unemployed and elderly, whom research indicates are the least amenable to the national preventive schemes on which the Department has embarked.  They are also the people who most need to be included in the delivery of services so that we can redress inadequacies in certain areas of women's health.</P>
    <P>In concentrating improvements in this area through the GP service, it has to be acknowledged that they cannot be delivered without significant investment of resources.  It would, therefore, be worthwhile for the Department to look at the capitation fee which is available to GPs for each patient they have under the general medical scheme, the availability of proper back-up services such as practice nurses and secretaries, encouraging the setting up of group practices where resources can be pooled and the provision of ongoing education for GPs.  All these areas should be looked at more carefully if GPS are to be to the forefront in delivering an improved service. A good example of how GPs can play a positive role is the child vaccination programmes which they have embraced as agents of the Department of Health and on which they have delivered effectively.</P>
    <P>At present there are well intentioned but fragmented approaches to improving specific areas &mdash; cholesterol testing, breast and cervical screening.  Many of <Col N="1230" /> these services could be given greater focus if they were delivered through the GP service.  That cannot be achieved cheaply or easily; it will require a significant investment of resources.  If we are serious about dealing with the problems set out in this document, we should face up to the question of resources.  If we do not proceed by involving GPs to the maximum degree possible, we run the risk of developing parallel services by way of a series of regional clinics to deal with various areas on the one hand, with GPs simultaneously offering similar services which, through no fault of the GPs, are underfunded and inadequate.</P>
    <P>My party colleague, Deputy Browne, referred to a number of preventive measures that could be adopted.  Some of the statistics are worth repeating to show the extent of the problems and what could be achieved with proper policies.  In 1993 there were 647 deaths from breast cancer.  Apparently these could be reduced by 30 per cent if we had a national screening service in place.  I welcome the Department's intention to move in that regard, but progress is too slow, and we will continue to have unnecessarily high mortality rates from breast cancer unless we accelerate the rate at which a national screening service is available.  There are reservations about the provision of such a service because of the high incidence of false positive results, but it would be better to have a safety net in place, albeit with the trauma associated with false positive results, than not to have a service.  The aim of significantly reducing the number of deaths in that regard is a laudable objective.</P>
    <P>In 1993 there were 509 deaths from lung cancer.  Newspaper headlines never cease to amaze me.  During the week one newspaper published a headline to the effect that there had been a falloff in the numbers attending bingo nights because of the new regulations on smoking in public buildings.  Surely responsible reporting would have highlighted the high incidence of deaths directly linked to smoking rather than bemoaning the declining attendance <Col N="1231" /> because of the new regulations.  We should get the message home to people that their health would be enhanced if they would give up or reduce smoking.</P>
    <P>I do not have figures regarding fatalities from cervical cancer, but it is estimated that we could achieve a 60 per cent reduction in fatalities nation-wide. It is regrettable that cervical smears are not available as a service to medical card holders as making them available would be an indication of the Minister's serious intent in delivering real improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned maternity services and the setting up of a specialist working group to investigate the delivery of ante and postnatal services. I want to move the debate on to a more parochial level by discussing maternity services in the Southern Health Board area, specifically in Cork city and county.  Maternity services in Cork city are fragmented in a number of locations for various reasons, chiefly the infrastructural arrangements and the fact that certain &ldquo;fiefdoms&rdquo; had been established by those delivering the service at various levels which made it difficult to achieve a consensus on how best to improve it.  I am glad that has been resolved and that there is now a consensus approach, that a new centre of excellence for the delivery of maternity services in Cork city and county will be located in the grounds of Cork University Hospital.  I implore the Minister to give the green light to the stages the process must now go through as quickly as possible because, not to be alarmist, what exists in the absence of the new facility is not what would be considered adequate by expectant mothers, their relatives and the people delivering the service.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on two other subjects. The choice of doctor is one of the foundation stones of the general medical scheme, and that means choice in its widest context in that medical card patients have a choice of doctors of different ages and attitudes.  By and large it works.  However, choice of <Col N="1232" /> doctor has not been tackled under present arrangements, particularly in rural areas where female patients predominantly want access to a female general practitioner.  I am aware that well in excess of 50 per cent of places on medical courses in universities are being taken up by female students, a trend which will eventually be reflected in general practice.  Nonetheless, in many rural areas there is not really a choice between male and female general practitioners. The Department should instruct all health boards to facilitate patients wishing to have a choice of general practitioner.  That may often necessitate allowing medical card patients access to a female general practitioner who may not hold a GMS contract. If we are serious about choice of doctor and women's health issues, that is a fundamental need that must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne touched on the general issue of smoking, the increasing incidence of which among young people, specifically young girls in secondary schools, is to be lamented.  Given media concentration on other addictions such as alcohol and, even more alarmingly, ecstasy and other drugs, some parents may tend to turn a blind eye to their children smoking.  The statistics to which I referred earlier, in particular the incidence of curable cancer to which smoking significantly contributes, should never be omitted from the equation, bearing in mind the serious impact on public health generally.</P>
    <P>Our educational system has many questions to answer in regard to this practice of smoking.  Much emphasis is placed on sporting activities in secondary schools.  Recent research points to much greater numbers of young girls than young boys smoking, no doubt directly attributable to the influence of sport and outdoor activities in the case of boys.  This imbalance needs to be redressed.</P>
    <P>Given the emphasis placed on the inherent dangers of smoking over many years, regulations introduced by the <Col N="1233" /> Department of Health and the continued taxation of cigarettes, it is most disappointing that we have such a significant smoking problem.  This will continue to be an enormous contributory factor in the ill health of a significant proportion of our population.  I must reiterate that sport for all, boys and girls attending school, would be one method of tackling that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to contribute briefly to this important debate and comment on the statement of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Brian O'Shea, when he introduced this policy document in the House on 9 November, 1995.  Reading through his contribution I was startled to read that the average life expectancy of Irish women is among the lowest in the European Union, with death from heart disease being 70 per cent above the European Union average.  That trend cannot be allowed to continue without some positive identification of its causes and immediate remedial action.</P>
      <P>I agree with much that Deputy Creed had to say on the overall attitude to and the role of women in Irish society. There is no doubt that heavy smoking has been identified as a major cause of heart disease, with increasing evidence that many more young girls are smoking than their male counterparts.  I am convinced this stems from lack of education as to its consequences.  Whenever one attends a social function invariably one sees nine out of ten young girls smoking, if not cigarettes, some other substances, whereas among a corresponding group of ten boys one will see one, if any at all, smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt this trend has to do with overall attitudes to health matters.  Most young boys and men are geared toward sporting activities and keeping fit but that is not the case with young girls. That phenomenon is indeed sad.  Young girls may feel insecure or bored and that should be addressed.  No doubt it is related to the high incidence of heart disease among Irish women which, with <Col N="1234" /> proper intent, could be substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>While we here may be only catching up with trends elsewhere, soap operas portraying slender, fashionable female figures have developed a huge following, particularly among young girls. Some become obsessed with having a good figure and resort to a rigorous diet aimed at reducing weight, the fatty content of foods and so on.  Manufacturers of alternatives to dairy produce have got away with murder.  The Dairy Council has been very negligent in not counteracting the highly orchestrated campaign run by the many multinationals and blenders of alternative dairy products here and abroad over the past ten years or so.  It prompted one esteemed heart surgeon, Mr. David Nelligan, to draw attention to the fact that what was happening was nothing short of criminal, pointing out that dairy produce was a good source of nutrition and that many alternative blends have a high risk of causing heart disease.  Many alternatives like margarines and butter oils contain an ingredient comparable to a substance used for the repair of cars and household equipment, plastic padding and so on.  It is unbelievable that many people consume such harmful products which can lead to heart disease.</P>
    <P>Education has a major role to play. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian O'Shea, on 9 November 1995, at column 18 of the Official Report stated:</P>
    <P>I stress that this document is not an excuse to hold up developments which will provide women's health or reduce illness among women.  Even since the discussion document was published, decisions have been taken on some issues where there is general agreement that progress should be made.  Funding has been allocated for counselling women with crisis pregnancies and research has been commissioned on the reasons women with crisis pregnancies seek terminations abroad.</P>
    <P>The numbers of teenage pregnancies and others outside of marriage is a <Col N="1235" /> cause of serious concern.  It is a very sad phenomenon that the lifestyles of many young women are totally disrupted.  I cannot understand why there should be so many pregnancies among young girls when so much information and education is available to them.  Is there a breakdown in our society?  While I am a traditionalist, I see the role of the mother and father in marriage as extremely important, even stretching that concept to advocating that two people should make a joint commitment, whether in a church or elsewhere, to set up home and rear a family.  There is a growing number of casual partners. When young girls become pregnant, their overall approach to life, of necessity changes totally and their future plans are disrupted, through unwanted pregnancies which are becoming ever more numerous.  This leads one to believe that our educational system is lacking.</P>
    <P>That takes me back to all the fashionable nonsense being portrayed on our television screens.  Various imported programmes portray this type of casual lifestyle which seems to be the order of the day.  It is also portrayed in many foreign magazines sold here.  I am not against people having a broad outlook on life and seeing what happens but it is sad that young girls should think that is a good lifestyle, it comes back to the point I made about the role of parents. The role of the mother is extremely important.  The attitude of society is that the mother who goes out to work is held in higher esteem than the mother who works at home.  Marriage should not disrupt a girl's career but I do not think a career is the be-all and end-all.  I do not think that the mother who works at home should feel less adequate than a mother who holds down a job.  Rearing a family is a full-time job, now more than ever because of all the opportunities for people to get into trouble.  It is a constant job to educate and advise young people because they can easily be misled.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, recognised the importance <Col N="1236" /> of the work of the mother who stays at home.  He had the idea of introducing a payment of £9.50 per week in recognition of the role of the mother who works at home but it never came to anything. I believe it was his genuine intention to introduce it but it never became Government policy.  Many women who work in the home were disillusioned when this financial recognition did not materalise.  When we see all the problems that young families face I think it is time that the role of the mother in the home should be recognised by the State and that the mother who stays at home to look after her children should not feel less adequate than the mother who has a role outside the home.  I fully recognise the need for both partners in a marriage to work outside the home but rearing a family is a big task.  After a day in the office or working in business, the woman has to come home and deal with her children and all the problems that go with it &mdash; in case people think we in Cavan are not forward thinking people and are inclined to keep the women in the house let me congratulate the appointment of a married woman as chairperson of the county enterprise board.  I have no doubt that if one spoke to her, she would say it is a big strain.  Because any woman working outside the home has to face the household chores, the school lessons and getting the clothes ready&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy is going well, we have a good Government and an excellent Minister for Health who is very caring and has done marvellous work in extending the health services across the country.  Nevertheless the hepatitis C <Col N="1237" /> figures are starting and nothing has changed very much since last November except that the issue of compensation for the unfortunate women who have hepatitis C as a result of the contaminated blood is being addressed.  The Minister should look at the possibility of reintroducing Dr. Garret FitzGerald's idea of financial recognition for mothers who work at home.  The £9.50 of a decade ago would be around £25-£30 now. It would take some of the pressure off a woman who, with her partner, has to earn a living to keep the household afloat.  The money certainly would not go to loss and a great many of the problems of our young people would also be addressed.</P>
    <P>I certainly appreciate the role of women and the marvellous work they do inside and outside the home.  The startling figures need to be addressed and I know the Minister will do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I am pleased to respond to this debate on the discussion document, <i>Developing A Policy for Women's Health.</i> It gives me an opportunity to express my commitment, the commitment of my Department and the commitment of Government to improving the health of Irish women.  As the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, said when he opened the debate, the publication of the discussion document on women's health was the first step in a process which, I hope, will lead to significant improvements in women's health.  The second stage of the process is now concluded. Women throughout Ireland have been consulted on the document and on their experience of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the National Women's Council for their assistance to the consultative process on women's health.  The council responded to my invitation to assist with the consultative process to ensure that consultation with women was as broadly based as possible.  Representatives of the council have worked closely with the health boards and the Department to <Col N="1238" /> facilitate consultation and dialogue on the discussion document, <i>Developing a Policy for Women's Health.</i></P>
    <P>I acknowledge the commitment and enthusiasm of the health board staff who organised the consultative process. As one would expect, the process was handled differently in each health board, reflecting different priorities, perceptions and needs.  This diversity has added colour and tone to the consultative process.  It is all the more persuasive then that the women who participated in the consultative process are saying broadly the same kind of things. They want a health service that is women-friendly.  They want to see women's health services improved and developed.  They want information on health and social services that is accessible and relevant to their needs.  They would like access to more complimentary health services.  They are calling for ongoing consultation of women by the health services and greater representation of women generally in the health services.  If we are to take seriously the idea of developing services which are perceived by the consumer to be of high quality, a goal set out in the health strategy, we must listen to what women say about their health and design services which they feel comfortable using.  The consultative process on women's health has posed a challenge to the health services. It is a challenge to which the health services are well able to respond but it is one that calls for some fundamental thinking about the way in which we plan, organise and deliver services to women.</P>
    <P>Now that the consultative process is completed, my officials have begun drafting a plan for women's health.  It is my intention that the plan for women's health should grow from the discussion document and the consultative process. The plan must take on board the issues raised during the consultative process.  It must address the issue of how to develop more user friendly services for women and how consultation with women can be built in to the operation of our health services.  The plan should <Col N="1239" /> also heighten women's awareness of the risks to their health and the measures which are within their control to improve their health.</P>
    <P>I hope to bring the plan to Government for approval in the early summer and to commence its implementation as soon as it has been approved.  I cannot promise an overnight transformation of our health services into the kind of health service that many women would see as ideal.  However, we can begin, perhaps we have already begun, the process of transformation to a health service that is woman friendly and that promotes the health of women generally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive reception which the discussion document has received from speakers on both sides of the House. All Deputies who have spoken recognise the value of the document and of consulting women about the health issues which most concern them.  I will respond to a number of issues raised by Deputies in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred to the need for a comprehensive family planning service.  I share the Deputy's concerns in this matter.  Perhaps I could outline to her the steps I have taken so far to ensure that a comprehensive service is available.</P>
    <P>Health boards are responsible under section 8 of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1992 for providing and making available a family planning service.  In March 1995, in response to the policy agreement for Government, my Department issued a set of guidelines to the health boards to enable them to evaluate and expand the current range and level of family planning services available in their areas. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure that in each health board there is an equitable, accessible and comprehensive family planning service.  In this service the key role of the general practitioner in providing family planning services is recognised.  Health boards <Col N="1240" /> have been asked to ensure that a broadly-based programme involving family planning clinics and/or other service-providers is developed so that services are within easy reach of clients and choice of service-provider is available.</P>
    <P>I have received preliminary reports from the health boards on the implementation of these guidelines.  I am awaiting their final reports which should take account of the services being developed by voluntary organisations and have regard to the opportunities presented for pregnancy counselling by the development of comprehensive family planning services.</P>
    <P>The range of services provided free of charge under the GMS has been extended to include spermicidal creams and contraceptive devices.  A total of £730,000 in additional funding was provided to the health boards for the development during 1995 of their family planning services in accordance with the guidelines.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the reference by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn to recent innovations in general practice, relating to provision of minor surgical services in one particular practice in the Western Health Board area.  Since the establishment of the general practice development fund in 1992 and the introduction of the indicative drug target saving scheme, significant investment has been made by the newly established health board general practice units in improvement of general practice premises and in practice equipment. Rota and cover arrangements have been improved and practice support staff such as practice secretaries and practice nurses have been employed in increasing numbers.  These measures have resulted in better services to patients, the majority of whom are women.</P>
    <P>The improvements in the organisation of general practice and the operation of general practice units within health boards provide an effective base from which to address the health strategy commitment to provide additional services within general practice.  My Department requested health boards to <Col N="1241" /> give priority to developing a range of services in general practice in 1995.</P>
    <P>One of the priorities is to extend the range of women's health services in general practice.  These services include those which require special expertise or support on the part of a general practitioner in women's health.  They cover women's health services provided by health professionals other than general practitioners in a general practice setting. Health boards and general practitioners have begun to address these priorities.  I look forward to seeing further development of women's health services in general practice in the near future.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy O'Donnell asked for information in relation to counselling women with crisis pregnancies and about the research which my Department has commissioned on why women with crisis pregnancies seek terminations.  Expert and sympathetic counselling is available to women facing a crisis pregnancy.  The service is available from general practitioners, voluntary organisations and health boards.</P>
    <P>In 1995 my Department provided funds to the Irish College of General Practitioners in respect of their training programme and information pack for general practitioners in response to the Termination of Pregnancy Information Act, 1995.  I also provided £300,000 to agencies such as Cherish, CURA, Irish Family Planning Association, Life, Pact and the Well Woman Centre for the development of pregnancy counselling services.  In addition all health boards have been asked to evaluate the need for pregnancy counselling services, taking account of the services being provided by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>My Department has also commissioned the University of Dublin, Trinity College, to carry out a major study to identify the factors which contribute to the incidence of unwanted pregnancy and those factors which result in the option of abortion.  The research study commenced on 1 September 1995 and is being carried out by <Col N="1242" /> a multi-disciplinary team consisting of representatives from the departments of social studies, sociology and community health and general practice at the university.</P>
    <P>In brief the study will consist of a comparison between pregnant women who proceed with their pregnancies and those who decide to opt for terminations. Pregnant women who proceed with their pregnancies will be selected through GPs, family planning clinics, Well Woman centres and maternity hospitals.  In addition it is intended to interview Irish women who have decided to have abortions.  These interviews will take place in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that this research will take 18 months to complete.  Its results will help the Department of Health develop educational, counselling and other services designed to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and the number of women who have recourse to abortion.  The problem of teenage pregnancies will also be looked at in this context.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to the need to ensure that there is greater representation of women at decision making level in the health services. The health strategy states that one of the objectives of Government policy is greater participation by women in the organisation of the health services both in the more senior positions and at representative levels.</P>
    <P>A report completed last year on women's employment in the Midland and Mid-Western Health Boards suggests that the barriers that are holding women back from senior posts arise in areas such as training, interviews, promotional paths and organisational culture. With the encouragement of my Department, health boards are currently reviewing their employment practices to ensure that obstacles to gender equality are overcome.  When this review is completed, the Department will consider what further joint action is necessary with employing agencies to <Col N="1243" /> ensure that women are fairly represented at senior levels in the health services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred to the importance of the workplace for educating women about health.  I agree with her.  I was pleased that this issue was discussed during the consultative process on women's health at a seminar hosted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with support from my Department. That seminar emphasised the importance of the workplace as a source of health information and education for women in employment.  Proposals made at the conference to develop workplace health for women are being followed up by the Department and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>All Deputies mentioned the threat that cancer, in its various forms, poses to the health of Irish women.  The improvement of cancer services is one of my priorities as Minister for Health. I have appointed a working group in the Department to review our cancer services and, in consultation with experts in the field, to recommend a cancer strategy.  This group is now finalising its report.</P>
    <P>On 6 October last I announced the expansion of the breast cancer screening programme which has been piloted by the Eccles St. project.  The first phase of the expanded programme will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50-64. This will mean that about half of women in this country in that age group will be involved in the first phase.  All the expert advice available suggests that we should proceed slowly to build up the screening programme to ensure that the highest standards are achieved in the detection of breast cancer.</P>
    <P>A working party was appointed by the previous Minister for Health in October 1992 to review cervical screening. Their report was finalised in early <Col N="1244" /> 1995.  The recommendations of this report have also been examined by the group established to prepare a strategy on cancer services.</P>
    <P>Issues which are being considered in relation to implementing the report on cervical screening include the formation of a national database of the target group of women to be screened; an appropriate payment to GPs for smear testing; the training of cytoscreeners to ensure that there is expertise of a high quality in our laboratories to analyse the smears; the most appropriate way of informing women of the benefits of screening; how cervical screening services should be organised, centrally and locally, and the staffing implications of a screening programme.  Given the complexities of the issues, time is needed to plan and develop a screening programme of high quality.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the important Fourth UN Conference on Women which took place in September 1995 in Beijing.  Despite some initial pessimism, the governmental conference was a most successful one.  Representatives of 185 countries agreed a declaration and an important document, <i>A Platform for Action,</i> which commits Governments to take steps to address inequalities and oppression experienced by women.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that the platform is an important step beyond what was agreed at the Third UN Conference on Women in Nairobi ten years ago and will create a momentum in favour of women throughout the world. Not surprisingly, the platform identifies improving the health of women as one of the major priorities for action by UN member states.  The platform calls on Governments to review health policy and legislation to ensure that they reflect a commitment to women's health.</P>
    <P>They are asked to design health programmes, in co-operation with women's organisations, that address the health <Col N="1245" /> needs of women throughout their lives and that take into account their multiple roles and responsibilities.  In particular, Governments are asked to strengthen preventive health programmes for women, to take measures to protect their reproductive health and to promote research and information on women's health.  As you can see, the discussion document, the consultative process and the plan for women's health puts this country in good shape to implement the health commitments of the Beijing platform.</P>
    <P>One cannot think of the <i>Platform for Action</i> agreed in Beijing without thinking of the many problems which women throughout the world face every day. The improvement of women's health in the developing world is one of the most important issues of our times.  I am aware that consultation on this aspect of the discussion document is not yet complete. My Department with the co-operation of the Department of Foreign Affairs, will shortly be organising a forum in which groups concerned with the health of women in the developing world will have an opportunity of identifying steps which we could take in this country to strengthen our commitment to women's health in the Third World. Even the shortest visit to a developing country leaves one in no doubt as to the scale of the problems which undermine the health of women and children and the difference which assistance from even a small country such as ours can make.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions to this debate on developing a policy for women's health. It is clear that all parties in this House share the same objective of promoting the highest attainable standard of health for women.  Although this has been the first debate in the history of this House on women's health, I am sure it will not be the last.  I look forward to further constructive dialogue with members of <Col N="1246" /> the House following the publication of the Plan for Women's Health.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the recent developments in Lebanon.  Ireland has been intensively involved in efforts to end the current violence in Lebanon and northern Israel and to ensure the safety of the Irish UNIFIL battalion.  This involvement stems, on the one hand, from our participation in the EU Troika and, on the other from our role as a UNIFIL troop contributor.  Ireland has also been involved in discussions on the situation at the UN.  The Irish permanent representative addressed the Security Council on 18 April, expressing the Government's strong condemnation of the attack on the UNIFIL post at Qana and our deep concern at the deterioration in the situation in the Middle East, with the consequent strains on the peace process.  In these discussions we have <Col N="1248" /> sought to ensure that priority will be given to the safety of civilians and the UNIFIL contingent.</P>
    <P>The attack on the UNIFIL position at Qana, south Lebanon, was strongly condemned by the Taoiseach and in a statement issued by the Tánaiste on Thursday, 18 April.  An EU statement expressed shock and consternation at the attack and called for the violence to cease.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been centrally engaged in EU efforts to end the crisis.  In the past ten days a senior official in the Department of Foreign Affairs responsible for the Middle East has participated in a series of urgent Troika missions in Beirut, Damascus, Amman, Cairo and Tel Aviv.  Following the Qana attack, a reinforced EU Troika mission, headed by Italian Foreign Minister Agnelli, met with a number of key parties to the conflict last weekend, including Israeli Prime Minister Peres and Foreign Minister Barak, Lebanese President Haroui and Prime Minister Hariri, and President Assad of Syria.  The Troika also visited wounded Lebanese civilians in two hospitals to express the EU's sympathy.</P>
    <P>The Government has also been involved at the bilateral level.  The Israeli ambassador was summoned to the Department of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday, 16 April so that the Government's concerns could be conveyed to his authorities. He was made aware of our views regarding the disproportionate response by Israel to Hizbullah attacks.  In particular, concerns were expressed for the safety of Lebanese civilians and UNIFIL personnel, and about attacks on Lebanese infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Israeli ambassador was called in again on Friday, 19 April to be informed of the Government's condemnation of the Qana attack and to reiterate our very grave concerns about attacks on Lebanese civilians and infrastructure, as well as the great importance we attach to the safety of UNIFIL.  The ambassador was told of the Government's clear view that the military activities should stop immediately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> EU Foreign Ministers considered the crisis at their meeting in Luxembourg on 22 April.  Ireland's position on the need to condemn the attacks on civilians and, in particular, attacks on UNIFIL bases as occurred at Qana was strongly expressed and reflected in the declaration which was adopted.  This declaration deplores the attack on Qana, and confirms the Union's willingness to contribute actively to the search for an immediate halt to hostilities, with the aim of elaborating a lasting agreement between the parties which would not prejudice a global agreement between Israel and Lebanon in the context of the peace process.  It supports the efforts of UNIFIL in trying, in highly adverse circumstances, to alleviate the effects of violence and ensure the safety of the civilian population.</P>
    <P>UNIFIL's mandate is based on UN Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978 affirming Lebanon's territorial integrity and sovereignty and requiring Israel to withdraw its forces.  Ireland remains committed to the UNIFIL mandate and believes successive Irish UNIFIL contingents have made a valuable contribution to security in south Lebanon and have thereby played a role in maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East region generally.  UNIFIL has also made an important contribution to the humanitarian needs of the local population. The request of the UN Secretary General and the Government of Lebanon to maintain UNIFIL was endorsed unanimously by the Security Council on 29 January last.  On 18 April the Security Council called upon all concerned, in a resolution, to allow UNIFIL to fulfil its mandate without any obstacle or interference.  I do not believe that this general agreement on the important role of UNIFIL has been undermined as a result of the current crisis.</P>
    <P>Israel's recent attacks on Lebanon have undermined UNIFIL's capacity to conduct normal operations.  However, I remain confident this is a temporary setback and UNIFIL will be able to fully resume its role in south Lebanon after the present crisis has been resolved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> The Government currently has no plans to withdraw Ireland's UNIFIL contingent.  The Army authorities are satisfied that the danger currently posed to Irish personnel is not such as to necessitate our withdrawal from UNIFIL.  The first phase of the six monthly rotation of the Irish UNIFIL battalion is now under way.  The safety of Irish UNIFIL soldiers remains a paramount concern.  The Government will continue to monitor their situation closely and, as the Tánaiste has already indicated, will take whatever measures may be necessary to help ensure their safety.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Government's concern about the growing humanitarian crisis, the Department of Foreign Affairs has allocated £200,000 emergency aid for Lebanon.  This will be distributed through a number of channels including the International Committee of the Red Cross, UN agencies and our UNIFIL battalion.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a member of the EU Troika and in our capacity as UNIFIL troop contributor, will continue to pursue diplomatic efforts in the Middle East region, aimed at promoting a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response. I send good wishes to the Tánaiste.  I hope he has a speedy recovery and will be ready to join us in battle as soon as possible.  With regard to the massacre at Qana, I join in the condemnation expressed by the Minister of the killing of 100 refugees in the headquarters of the Fijian UN battalion.</P>
      <P>Condemnation is not sufficient, whether of the Hizbullah for firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel or the Israelis for their over the top response in bombing and laying waste southern and other parts of Lebanon, including Beirut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To move the process forward, surely this is a case, if there ever was one, for political action by the Troika and for its presence in the Middle East, not just the Italian Foreign Minister to whom the <Col N="1251" /> Minister of State referred, but each of the foreign ministers who make up the Troika, including Ireland's.  It is not sufficient to leave it to the Americans, despite their influence on Israel; it is a matter for the Troika and the EU with the various interests involved and historical connections in the area, whether in Syria, Lebanon or elsewhere.  Why has there been no political participation by the Tánaiste in this issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was considered and discussed at a meeting of the foreign ministers in the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on Monday last at which I deputised for the Tánaiste.  I also visited the Middle East as part of the Troika about a month ago, again deputising for the Tánaiste.  One of the points considered by the Council was that there were too many foreign ministers in the Middle East.  As one of them put it, there were &ldquo;wall to wall&rdquo; foreign ministers in the area, including the Troika, the Russian and French Foreign Ministers and the US Secretary of State.  The presence of foreign ministers in itself may not necessarily contribute to a solution to the problem &mdash; too many cooks might well spoil the broth. The matter is being kept under active consideration and we will take whatever steps we consider necessary.  It is possible that the Troika may pay a further visit to the area in the near future.  My colleague, the Minister for Defence, is due to leave on Sunday to visit the UNIFIL troops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Minister of State to use the phrase &ldquo;to spoil the broth&rdquo; when southern Lebanon is being laid waste in an artillery bombardment by the Israelis whose response to the Hizbullah attacks has been over the top, is unfortunate.  Does he agree that, given its strength, the EU acting in union through its three representatives in the formal Troika could prove both effective and beneficial in bringing <Col N="1252" /> about a settlement in the area and putting pressure on all sides, Iran in particular given its support for the Hizbullah?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I used the term that the Deputy thought was inappropriate, I was quoting from the content of the discussion that took place in Luxembourg.  Let me put it in terms he, probably, would not find offensive.  If there are too many foreign ministers in the Middle East, it can add to the problem rather than the solution in that different sides may play off one against another.  The Russian and French Foreign Ministers, the US Secretary of State and the Troika were all in the area at the same time.  There was agreement at the General Affairs Council that this could contribute to the problem rather than the solution.  I take the Deputy's point, however, and would not rule out a visit to the area by the Troika at ministerial level if this was merited and it was felt, based on our own judgment having received up-to-date information, that it would contribute to a solution.  I will ensure that the matter is kept under consideration.  If it would prove beneficial, it is a course we would consider taking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue given that we have our own troops in the area with UNIFIL.  I welcome the fact that the replacement operation has commenced.  One group has arrived home with two more to come.  We should acknowledge the role our troops have played with UNIFIL and the role played by their medical team, following the recent massacre in Qana, in trying to save lives.  As a nation, we are proud of the work they have been doing under the most trying circumstances over many years in southern Lebanon.  I wish the new contingent every success.  I appeal to all sides, the Israelis in particular, for the greatest co-operation, and an acknowledgement of and respect for the flag of the UN, the only organisation which offers hope for mankind as we near the end of the millennium.</P>

      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the action, if any, he has taken to support the Irish beef trade during the current BSE crisis.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8286/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for Ireland's external relations, the Tánaiste is fully conscious of the threat which the current BSE crisis presents to the Irish beef industry and of the need for his Department and our embassies abroad to be to the forefront of the Government's actions to protect markets for Irish beef.  At the outset of the current crisis our embassies gave the highest priority to defending the reputation of Irish beef. In this they worked closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, An Bord Bia and other State agencies with responsibility for external promotion of Irish products.  Their objectives were twofold: to ensure continued access to the market and reassure the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so-called &ldquo;third-country&rdquo; markets outside Europe, some of which had introduced prohibitions on imports of meat and live animals, the emphasis has been on direct contact with governments to reassure them in regard to the high quality of the Irish product and the priority attached to animal health in Ireland.  This is particularly relevant in the Middle East and the embassies in Cairo, Riyadh and Teheran have been according the highest priority to restoring confidence in Irish beef.  The <Col N="1254" /> Tánaiste spoke by telephone to the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mr. Velayati, to express Irish concern that existing contracts with Iran be completed and that ships then on route be allowed to unload their cargos.</P>
    <P>Prompt and effective interventions by embassies were instrumental in preventing the imposition of restrictions on Irish beef in some important markets and reopening a number of other markets where bans had been introduced. At an early stage of the crisis, ambassadors were able to meet government ministers and other key decision makers. They arranged for senior officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to meet their counterparts in the importing countries and brief them on technical aspects of the situation. These meetings were to prove vital in convincing national administrations of the safety of Irish beef and persuading them of the commitment of the Irish Government to the highest standards of animal and public health.</P>
    <P>Embassies in the main European markets, working in close co-operation with An Bord Bia, have focused on countering a number of misleading and inaccurate reports which have appeared in the last few weeks in the media.  In these cases ambassadors have written to the offending publications clarifying the issues and rebutting any allegations concerning the safety and quality of Irish beef.  An official Government statement was distributed through embassies to public authorities and the media at an early stage of the crisis.</P>
    <P>Non-meat products derived from cattle, such as dairy products and animal hides, have also been affected by the beef controversy.  The Tánaiste availed of the opportunity of the EU Rio Group meeting which he attended in Bolivia last week to meet his Peruvian counterpart to ask for the withdrawal of a ban on dairy imports from Ireland to Peru. This followed diplomatic representations via our embassies in London and Buenos Aires.  We were successful in having the ban reversed and the Peruvian market is once again open to Irish <Col N="1255" /> dairy produce.  Assistance has also been provided to Irish exporters of non-meat products to a number of Far Eastern countries who were encountering some difficulties with local administrations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The beef sector accounts for about 39 per cent of our £3.5 billion agricultural industry, yet the Tánaiste has been studiously ignoring the crisis and has been unavailable to attend to it although he has been attending to issues in South America and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>If a few jobs were threatened in a factory Ministers would be flying back and forth, but there has been no performance by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this central and crucial industry. There was one phone call by the Minister for Agriculture to his counterpart in Iran, but if ever there was a case for ministerial presence to highlight the safety and quality of our beef and the importance of the industry, this is it. The Tánaiste should have acted on this occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture acted belatedly.  Can the Minister of State give some reason to farmers why the Tánaiste was so lacking in attention to the crisis in the beef industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is good but he cannot lead a troika to the Middle East whenever Deputy Burke wants him to, nor can he be in every country in the world selling Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection of the agricultural industry is primarily a matter for the Minister for Agriculture who has been in those countries representing the Government and pursuing this issue. We cannot have our cake and eat it.  The Tánaiste cannot be asked to be everywhere at once and then faulted when he <Col N="1256" /> is not.  He has other priorities and concerns of State to act upon.</P>
    <P>Where necessary, the Minister for Agriculture has travelled aboard.  At the instigation of the Tánaiste, our embassies abroad have been active in ensuring that Irish interests are protected.  The question of a ministerial visit to Iran is under review and detailed technical consultations are under way.  It is important to concentrate on their outcome before a decision is taken.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government is giving priority to this issue as one of concern not just to farmers but to the commercial interest of the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the general commercial importance of this issue to the country, it was obviously an area for the co-ordinated efforts of the Tánaiste. As far as the involvement of Kerry men is concerned, I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who, unlike the Tánaiste, did make an effort to travel.  Unfortunately, he travelled to Sweden which was a sort of &ldquo;wrong way, Deenihan&rdquo; journey.  However, at least one Kerry man in Government made some effort about this, if not the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage, could the Tánaiste take a leading role in co-ordinating the efforts of our embassies worldwide to tackle this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that the Tánaiste has taken such a role. The Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and other Departments are giving this issue priority.  The Government has made available all necessary resources to deal with this important issue and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I will pass Deputy Burke's best wishes to the Tánaiste for his early recovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 30, 34, 36, 39, 42, 43, 44, 47, 50, 51 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Since the Tánaiste last answered questions in this House on 7 March, he has had four further meetings with the Secretary for Northern Ireland: on March 8, 14 and 20, and on April 3.  At these meetings, the two Governments reviewed our consultations with the Northern parties, and discussed issues related to the launch of all-party negotiations on 10 June.</P>
      <P>In particular, as was envisaged in the communiqué of 28 February, we considered the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of substantive all-party negotiations.  A consultation paper was issued to the parties on 15 March, and subsequently, on April 16, we published the Ground Rules for Substantive All-Party Negotiations.  This paper sets out the best judgment of the two Governments on the most suitable and broadly acceptable ground rules for the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of all-party negotiations, beginning on 10 June 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the British Government published on the same day, 16 April, the Northern Ireland <Col N="1261" /> (Entry to Negotiations etc.) Bill, which provides for elections to be held on 30 May leading directly to the all-party negotiations, and for the creation of a forum in Northern Ireland.  This Bill is currently passing through the Houses of Parliament at Westminster and is expected shortly to become law.</P>
    <P>As stated in the February communiqué, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister agreed that details of this particular elective process were for the parties in Northern Ireland, with the British Government, to determine.  The Government would not wish, therefore, to pronounce on the precise form of electoral system which is to be employed, although we are of course aware of the divergent views of the different parties, and urged the British Government to do the utmost possible to achieve the criterion of broad acceptability.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, both the SDLP and Sinn Féin yesterday announced that they intended to take part in the elections on 30 May.</P>
    <P>The interrelationship between the elective process and the negotiations is of direct concern to the Government. We were determined to ensure that the elections would lead immediately, directly and automatically into all-party negotiations with a comprehensive agenda.  The ground rules paper, and the British electoral legislation, reflect this intent.</P>
    <P>We were equally determined to ensure that there was a clear and rigorous distinction between the negotiations and the proposed elected forum.  Paragraph 7 of the ground rules paper, accordingly, states: &ldquo;The conduct of the negotiations will be exclusively a matter for those involved in the negotiations. Any reference to, or interaction with, the forum to be convened following the elective process held to determine which parties will participate in the negotiations may take place solely by agreement among the negotiating teams to this effect and only at their formal instigation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> The forum is to discuss issues relevant to promoting dialogue and understanding within Northern Ireland.  It will be deliberative only and will have no legislative, executive or administrative functions, or the power to determine the conduct, course or outcome of negotiations. Within these parameters, the activities of the forum will be for its prospective members to decide.  The possibility that it might hear submissions made by political parties in this jurisdiction is a matter for it, and those parties which might be interested, to explore in due course.  The Government, for its part, would have no objection to the forum taking submissions in this jurisdiction, should the Members consider that this would contribute to dialogue and understanding within Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As foreshadowed in the February communiqué, the Secretary of State and the Tánaiste considered on a number of occasions whether there might be advantage in holding parallel referendums, North and South, in conjunction with the elections to be held on 30 May.  While the Government saw potential value in the proposal, and was prepared to support it, we accept that the electoral package put forward by the British Government changed the context from that envisaged when the proposal was put forward, and a referendum prior to negotiations will not now take place.</P>
    <P>In the ground rules paper, however, both Governments reaffirm their intention that the outcome of negotiations will be submitted for public approval by referendums in Ireland North and South &mdash; before being submitted to their respective Parliaments for ratification and the earliest possible implementation.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have, therefore, in accordance with the terms of the February communiqué, mapped out the route to substantive all-party negotiations starting on 10 June.  The Government fully appreciates the concerns and reservations of the Nationalist parties in particular regarding the <Col N="1263" /> potential complications inherent both in the elective process and the creation of the forum.  The Government will do all in its power to ensure that the safeguards which have been put in place, in particular the separation of the forum from the negotiations, are fully maintained. It is also important that the parties participating in the forum make use of its procedures in a manner consistent with its mandate to promote dialogue and understanding.</P>
    <P>It will be for each party to take its own decision as regards participation in the elections and the forum.  I would hope that in doing so all parties will consider carefully the wider picture, the overall package which has been achieved, and the need to promote the climate most conducive to the success of the negotiations, which must be the primary objective for all involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the agenda of the negotiations, the ground rules state that &ldquo;The negotiations will,... in a full and comprehensive fashion, address and seek to reach agreement on relationships and arrangements within Northern Ireland, including the relationship between any new institutions there and the Westminster Parliament; within the whole island of Ireland; and between the two Governments, including their relationship with any new institutions in Northern Ireland.&rdquo; It is envisaged that a comprehensive agenda will be adopted at the opening session of the negotiations and that this should reflect impartially all the key concerns of the participants.</P>
    <P>The ground rules also state that &ldquo;Any participant in the strand in question will be free to raise any aspect of the three relationships, including constitutional issues and any other matter which it considers relevant.&rdquo; I expect that all parties will wish to advance their own analysis of the situation and argue the case for their own preferred outcome.</P>
    <P>The ground rules state that it is common ground that any agreement, if it is to command widespread support, will need to give adequate expression to the <Col N="1264" /> totality of all three relationships.  The paper recalls that the two Governments, for their part, have described a shared understanding of the parameters of a possible outcome of the negotiations in <i>A New Framework for Agreement.</i> We expect and intend that this key intergovernmental document will be on the table and fully considered in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The ground rules for the negotiations make clear that no outcome is either predetermined or excluded in advance. It goes without saying that the parties who aspire to the unity and reconciliation of the Irish people will be free to represent that viewpoint at the negotiating table and can be expected to do so.</P>
    <P>The chairpersonship of Strand II of the negotiations remains to be decided. Strand I will be chaired by the British Government and Strand III negotiations are between the two Governments. The two Governments will be consulting with one another and with the parties with a view to reaching agreement on a suitable candidate well before the opening of negotiations.  It is clearly important that the person chosen should have the necessary qualifications and authority for what will be a very challenging task.</P>
    <P>The position regarding Sinn Féin has been made very clear in this House on several occasions.  The ground rules repeat the hope of both Governments that all political parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations.  It is obvious that the prospects of success in the negotiations would be greatly enhanced by the presence of Sinn Féin.  However, both Governments have also made abundantly clear that the resumption of ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin, and their participation in negotiations, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.</P>
    <P>Only the IRA can take the decision to restore the ceasefire and allow Sinn Féin to participate in the negotiations. If it fails to do so, it will mean that the <Col N="1265" /> republican viewpoint will not be represented in the comprehensive round-table negotiations for which Sinn Féin has been calling since August 1994.  The single step of an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire would permit the entry of Sinn Féin to negotiations without further preconditions.  I regret the placing of a large bomb in London last night which was intended to do serious damage. The restoration of the ceasefire and the entry of Sinn Féin to negotiations is primarily a matter for the IRA.</P>
    <P>Both Governments recognise that in the climate of mutual suspicion and uncertainty which exists, confidence building measures will be necessary as regards both communities.  This was acknowledged by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister in the February communiqué. The ground rules, therefore, state that the agenda for negotiations will need to be in accordance with the communiqué's treatment of these issues, which states in paragraph 12:</P>
    <P>Therefore the opening plenary session will need to ensure that priority is given to these confidence building issues.  The opening plenary session will also adopt, and commit the participants to negotiate, a comprehensive agenda which provides reassurance, both in terms of addressing the report of the International Body and ensuring that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered.</P>
    <P>The ground rules paper also lays stress on the determination of both Governments to ensure &ldquo;that the structure and process of the negotiations will be used in the most constructive possible manner in the search for agreement.  They will use their influence in the appropriate strands to ensure that all items on the comprehensive agenda are fully addressed in the negotiating process and commit themselves, for their part, to doing so with a view to overcoming any obstacles which may arise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my view, the balanced approach set out in the communiqué and in the <Col N="1266" /> ground rules should reassure all participants that the negotiations will be meaningful and should be engaged in fully and seriously.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to use the machinery of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to press for appropriate action on a range of other confidence issues, some of which were referred to by the Mitchell report.  These include prisoner issues, the handling of parades, the review of emergency legislation, the normalisation and reform of policing and continued action to redress socio-economic disadvantage and inequality.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the loyalist parties in the negotiations will also be crucial, and we would hope that they will be enabled to play a full and constructive role in them.  On 6 February the Tánaiste had a very positive meeting in Dublin with a delegation from the Progressive Unionist Party.  Members of the party, in a number of subsequent interviews and statements, expressed disappointment that at the meeting the Tánaiste did not personally brief them on the Government's proposals for proximity talks, which were at that time under discussion with the British Government.  As was immediately explained to the PUP, these proposals had been made to the British Government on the understanding that they would be kept confidential to avoid the pressures of public debate until the resumed meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference on 7 February.  While awaiting the British response, which was due the following day, the Government did not feel able to discuss our proposals with any party.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste subsequently conveyed to the PUP the full background to his decision not to go into this particular point at their meeting.  He also made clear his concern both for continued constructive dialogue with it, and to ensure an appropriate role for it in the negotiations in prospect.  I would hope this has helped to allay any inadvertent misunderstandings which may have arisen.</P>

      <P>This question refers to the need for confidence building measures.  Does the Minister of State agree that the single biggest requirement is that the Government speak with one voice?  Will she clarify the position with regard to the views expressed by the programme manager and special adviser to the Tánaiste, Mr. Finlay, on a Channel 4 programme when he said that all-party talks without Sinn Féin are not worth a penny candle and the fact that the Taoiseach made it clear today that he views that statement as being inappropriate and one that does not reflect his view?  Will the Minister of State clarify the Tánaiste's position on this matter? Does Mr. Finlay speak for the Tánaiste?  Has the Tánaiste a different view from that of the Taoiseach or from Mr. Finlay?  Will she clarify the position and outline what measures are being taken to remedy the breakdown in Government unity on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest confidence building measure in terms of the negotiations on Northern Ireland would be the restoration by the IRA of the cease-fire. All other confidence building measures take second place to that. While I did not see the programme to which the Deputy referred, my understanding is that the remarks made by Mr. Finlay were very much in that context. For a very long time Sinn Féin has called for all-party negotiations in which, given its electoral mandate, we expect will be a renewed mandate, in the context of the elections to be held at the end of May, it would consider its participation to be of the utmost importance. Sinn Fein's participation in the negotiations, however, is blocked by the fact that the IRA has failed to restore the ceasefire.  That is the greatest threat to confidence building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no disagreement among the Government parties on this matter.  My understanding of the programme &mdash; I cannot comment in detail on it because I did not see it &mdash; is that it was a discursive look at the history of the creation <Col N="1268" /> of the ceasefire and the path to negotiations in Northern Ireland.  Mr. Finlay who, with people such as Dr. Martin Mansergh, has been involved in many stages of the negotiations, and others who were interviewed commented on how they saw the process in an historical sense.  Sinn Féin's participation in the negotiations is critical to the historical evolution of the process.  One can envisage negotiations without the participation of Sinn Féin, but negotiations involving one of the parties which has taken the road to violence would have far greater significance.</P>
    <P>The consistent Government view has been that we would like to see Sinn Féin taking part in the negotiations, but the barrier to its participation is the failure of the IRA to restore the ceasefire. Despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated by marching throughout this island, indicating that they want a restoration of the ceasefire, what happened last night in London is an indication that, unfortunately, the IRA is not yet ready to respond to that request.  I hope the IRA leadership will reconsider its position in the context of what the people of this island want and open the way to Sinn Féin's participation in the negotiations.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister hear the comments this morning by my party leader, Deputy Ahern, in condemnation of the Hammersmith bombing last night and will she accept that it is common cause on all sides of the House to call for the restoration of the IRA ceasefire? There is no division in the House on that matter &mdash; there is a very strong bipartisan view in that regard.  The Minister did not reply to the question I asked her.  I agree it is essential that Sinn Féin is present at the all-party talks <Col N="1269" /> and in that context we call for a restoration of the ceasefire.</P>
      <P>The special adviser and programme manager to the Tánaiste expressed a view that all-party talks without Sinn Féin would not be worth a penny candle.  Where there is an obvious difference between the views of such a senior person within the Administration and those of the Taoiseach, Leader of the Administration, does the Minister believe that this matter needs clarification so that there will be one voice from the Government rather than two, one from Iveagh House and one from Government Buildings?  It is crucial that question is replied to.  Is the Taoiseach's view, as the Minister understands it, similar &mdash; I trust it is not &mdash; to that of the British Prime Minister at the time of the Downing Street Declaration, that the Declaration has been agreed so let us move on from there, take it or leave it?  Surely that is not the Taoiseach's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Ahern's comments in condemning the Hammersmith bomb, I am certain that every Member will join in condemning the placing of that bomb last night.  I noted at the weekend when Deputy Ahern spoke at Arbour Hill he said specifically that his party would adhere to the view that the Framework Document provides the essential basis for political settlement. That is a reiteration of the bipartisanship that has existed for a very long period in this House, which is immensely helpful to the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate I did not hear or see a detailed quote of the remarks by Mr. Finlay or the Taoiseach and, therefore, I do not wish to comment on what they said.  There is no disagreement within Government that the essential confidence building measure in maintaining the momentum for peace is primarily the restoration of the ceasefire.  All the other confidence building measures such as the very important issue of prisoners, community participation and development in disadvantaged areas in <Col N="1270" /> both Republican and Loyalist areas, the marching season and how we deal with marches are secondary to the restoration of the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin leadership engaged very successfully in the forum in the Republic, which was to its benefit and to the general understanding of all political parties in the Republic of the issues that divide the two communities in Northern Ireland.  We must send a very clear message to the IRA leadership that it is important to restore the ceasefire so that there will be full momentum in the negotiations for all-party talks, which is what Sinn Féin has been calling for as a primary political objective in the context of its electoral mandate for a section of the Nationalist and Republican community.  There is no disagreement within Government on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the first place to demonstrate bipartisanship is within Government? Will she also agree it is most inappropriate for a programme manager to express views in public, irrespective of what they are about, which may embarrass either or all parties in Government? Will she agree that a statement that negotiations without Sinn Féin were not worth a penny candle was the equivalent of conferring upon the Provisional movement a veto equivalent to the Unionist veto which took so long to dislodge? Will she finally agree that the statements by Sinn Féin leaders that the Governments in London and Dublin need to undergo an attitude change is profoundly mistaken, and that the real attitude change required is one on the part of those who would have set off a bomb under Hammersmith Bridge if they had got away with it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no disagreement among the parties in Government as to our objectives.  We have called clearly on the IRA leadership to restore the ceasefire.  The people of Ireland have demonstrated clearly that they want the IRA leadership to restore the ceasefire. I do not know how many messages must be sent before the leadership of the IRA understands that attempting to explode bombs under Hammersmith Bridge is not the way to build confidence.</P>
      <P>The whole process of negotiation has been about taking the gun and the bomb out of Irish politics.  In the process that took place during the period of the ceasefire, I believe Sinn Féin as a party, its members and supporters gained enormously from the process as did all the people living in Northern Ireland, the Republic and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>In regard to the statements made from time to time by Sinn Féin leaders on the attitudes of the Irish and British Governments, we had entered into a process of dialogue with Sinn Féin until the cessation of the ceasefire.  In such dialogue, Sinn Féin leaders will give their views forthrightly on any and all aspects of Irish and British policy.  That is not to say we necessarily agree with any or all of the views they put forward.</P>
      <P>Mr. Martin McGuinness stated last night that he did not expect a ceasefire before 30 June.  Obviously as a leader of Sinn Féin he may be in a position to have detailed knowledge of the likely outcome of events with the IRA but it behoves him and the other leaders of Sinn Féin to call on the IRA to resume the ceasefire and for Sinn Féin to then enter the negotiations.</P>
      <P>I do not have details of Mr. Finlay's comments or the comments made by the Taoiseach today but my understanding of the programme is that it was a general historical review of the processes leading to the ceasefire.  A statement to the effect that the negotiations would be greatly enhanced by the presence of Sinn Féin goes without saying.</P>

      <P>In relation to my Question No. 51 on the resumption of ministerial dialogue, will the Minister of State indicate the level of dialogue that is taking place with Sinn Féin?  Will she comment on the progress made in the 17 months' peace process with the participation of Sinn Féin?  Is she indicating that the Government is holding Sinn Féin responsible for IRA actions even though Sinn Féin has a clear electoral mandate from the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment on that question and on Question No. 13, which is related, in which the Deputy asks if it is accepted that a united Ireland is obligatory.  In the process, it is expected that parties of a Nationalist and republican view would put forward the view of Nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, the process is about working towards and achieving a broad consensus.  In that context, a series of measures were taken at different levels during the 17 months of the ceasefire.  I do not know if the Deputy wants me to reiterate all the measures, which are well known, but they range from the detailed negotiations, the process of the Forum, the Forum report, to which Fianna Fáil was a party, to the whole process of economic regeneration of socially disadvantaged loyalist and republican areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> The position in relation to dialogue and contact with Sinn Féin has been clearly set out by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and is based on the position taken by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, which was that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation would not commence, nor would Sinn Féin enter into that Forum, until such time as a ceasefire was in place.  Similarly, ministerial level contact between Sinn Féin and Ministers of this Government will not recommence until such time as the ceasefire has been restored.  That policy has been reiterated on a number of occasions.  The contacts, therefore, which are available to Sinn Féin are at official level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point related to Sinn Féin's electoral mandate.  The history of the Sinn Féin party is well known to every Member.  Sinn Féin, as a party, has an electoral mandate which the Government respects.  Sinn Féin entered the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in the Republic on the basis &mdash; as set out by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds &mdash; that the IRA had called a ceasefire.  I do not know whether that means the then Taoiseach held Sinn Féin responsible for the IRA calling a ceasefire.  Sinn Féin's entry into formal contact with the <Col N="1277" /> Irish Government and formal entry into the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was predicated on the IRA calling a ceasefire.  That remains the policy of this Government and I see no good reason to change it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that, in the area of confidence-building, special attention must be given to matters such as the treatment of prisoners, republican and loyalist, particularly Paddy Kelly, the language schools, the meanscoileanna, questions and decisions in relation to marches, and funding for job creation in communities which have suffered major unemployment problems as a result of the bombings and actions over the past 25 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. It is regrettable that during the past two years greater progress has not been made on the question of prisoners. Under the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, some progress may be made in the future.  A number of applications have been received which are being processed by the Department of Justice.  It is unfortunate that changes being made in the British prison system, some of which are not directed at IRA prisoners, have enormous implications for IRA prisoners who are category A prisoners. Changes in British prisons in regard to visits, contact and searches as a result of a review of policy in relation to the widespread availability of drugs in prisons have impacted on IRA prisoners.  I share the Deputy's concern on this issue.  Other Ministers and I have availed of every opportunity to reiterate this view to the British.  There are many long-serving prisoners in the United Kingdom whose parents are now elderly and because of the cost involved in visiting prisoners it is becoming physically difficult for a number of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Paddy Kelly the Government has expressed its serious concern about his health and the desire <Col N="1278" /> that he be transferred.  In regard to the position about disadvantaged areas in republican and loyalist districts in the North, I had the opportunity to visit a number of those communities and a number of community organisations during the past year and a half.  Everything should be done to improve the economic development and prosperity of those areas and the participation of women, who are active in the various community groups and are extremely positive in building confidence and in allowing a more normal type of politics to develop.  I agree that these areas ought to receive as much attention as possible.</P>
    <P>In the case of the prisoners and the marches issues, they need to be dealt with great sensitivity and imagination. In the case of disadvantage, it needs to be targeted and resources provided. In that context the participation and contribution by the European Union and the International Fund for Ireland have been beneficial.  We need as much of that as we can get.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply of 6 February 1996 to Questions Nos. 30, 57 and 75 which details the additional staffing arrangements for the Department of Foreign Affairs for the period of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 100 additional staff will be recruited for the Presidency. Around 85-90 of these will be civil servants recruited by the Civil Service Commission from either interdepartmental promotion or recruitment panels.  The remaining staff will be employed directly by my Department on temporary contracts.  In this context <Col N="1279" /> the reply to Question No. 65 of 24 April is relevant.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a definitive breakdown of the grades of the additional staff at present.  The grades of the officers concerned will depend on the specific requirements of the additional Presidency posts as well as the availability of staff to fill these posts.</P>
    <P>To date 55 additional staff have commenced work in the Department.  This figure includes eight assistant principal officers, nine administrative officers, three higher executive officers, two executive officers, nine clerical officers, 22 clerical assistants, one paperkeeper and one service officer.</P>
    <P>In addition to staff assigned to the Department from outside, approximately 30 officers in the Department will be redeployed for the Presidency period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

We have held that position three times in the past and on each occasion it brought us great honour. Our last Presidency coincided with German re-unification and since then the Germans have recognised the role we played as a nation at that time.</P>

This year's Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs contains a provision of £8.704 million to cover Presidency related costs.  The comparable figure for 1990 was £2.655 million.  Additional costs were incurred in 1995 for this year.  This indicates that the Government is not sparing resources on its preparations for the Presidency.

This is a golden opportunity for Ireland.  We have received approximately £25 billion in net transfers from the European Union since we joined.

      <Quest>if he intends to continue providing funding to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities in view of the fact that it is making large grants to the Chinese Government for population control; if he has satisfied himself that the Chinese Government is not abusing fundamental human rights in its pursuit of its population control policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations Fund for Population Activities &mdash; UNFPA &mdash; provides assistance in the field of population, including family planning and awareness and education programmes, in response to requests from developing countries.  UNFPA is financed from contributions by Governments and private donors.</P>
      <P>Ireland has provided funding support to UNFPA since 1993.  Prior to then, Ireland was the only EU member state not to have contributed to UNFPA. Given the growing importance of the population issue at international level, it was felt by the Government at that time that a contribution to UNFPA represented an appropriate response to the challenges posed by population growth, particularly in developing countries. Since then Ireland has provided a total of £400,000 in support of UNFPA's work in developing countries and a further £250,000 is being provided in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UNFPA is committed by its mandates <Col N="1282" /> to the principle of voluntarism in its programmes of assistance throughout the world.  It condemns the use of coercion in any form or manner in any population programme.</P>
    <P>I am aware of Chinese family policy, which envisages families in urban areas having no more than one child and those in rural areas no more than two children.  I am under no illusions but that there are cases of forceful pressure on women to have abortions but I understand this is contrary to Chinese law.</P>
    <P>We sought and received assurances from UNFPA, most recently in January 1996, that in providing support for family planning activities in China it has carefully monitored its programmes to ensure full adherence to universally accepted standards of human rights. UNFPA has emphasised that its family planning activities, both in China and elsewhere, are grounded on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent.  It has categorically stated that it does not support China's one-child policy and is opposed to targets and quotas to enforce such a policy.</P>
    <P>UNFPA also states that it has maintained a constant dialogue with the Chinese authorities about abuses of human rights in its population programme.  It has also formulated special projects specifically designed to point out the practical advantages of a purely voluntary programme.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern and that of the international community about the allegations of human rights abuses in respect of China's population programme. However, I am satisfied on the basis of the UNFPA's statement and assurances that its projects in China have been conducted in full accordance with its mandates and principles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.  Is she satisfied that UNFPA has not provided funding for activities that I am sure everyone in the free world would find unacceptable?  Furthermore, in funding a population programme in <Col N="1283" /> China through the UNFPA &mdash; even if it does not directly fund unacceptable activities &mdash; is the Minister of State satisfied that organisation is not signalling the support of unacceptable practices of birth control?  Without going into the details, I am sure everyone is aware that two fundamental issues are involved.  One is the question of coercion of people into population control. The other is the use of abortion as a method of population control as opposed to what we normally understand as family planning.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that no such inference can be drawn from the provision of funding by UNFPA to support the Chinese policy of birth control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The UNFPA provides assistance in the field of population control, including family planning and awareness and information programmes, in response to requests from developing countries.  It does not provide support for abortion or abortion related activities.  Its policy as laid down by its governing council, on which Ireland has observer status, specifically states that &ldquo;the UNFPA is not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services or abortion related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of coercion, I agree with the Deputy that it is an extremely important question.  The UNFPA has maintained a constant dialogue with the Chinese authorities about abuses of human rights in its population programme, especially abuses that may be attributed to rigid enforcement of China's one-child policy.  It has also requested China to review and moderate provincial and local regulations which do not conform with international human rights standards.  It is UNFPA policy to take up each report of alleged coercion directly with the Chinese authorities, and I assure the Deputy that when this matter was raised at earlier stages by other Deputies in this House direct contact was made with UNFPA <Col N="1284" /> both from Dublin and through our mission in New York to ascertain and to get oral explanation and written confirmation of the statements I have just made.</P>
    <P>In the context of the controversy which arose about the treatment of children in Chinese orphanages, I contacted all of my partner Ministers for development co-operation in the European Union on the issue of the treatment of girl children and the broader question of the treatment of children in orphanages in China.  I also contacted UNICEF and its director, Mrs. Carol Bellamy.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the very sensitive question of population pressures in China because it is a country of 1.2 billion people and of the question of human rights and people voluntarily availing of family planning services which is a choice to be made by couples.  Ireland has always supported &mdash; and we reiterated this at the Cairo Conference &mdash; voluntary family planning while recognising that in the developing world the pressure of population growth is one of the factors leading to intense poverty and pressure on resources.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her concern in the matter and for her very comprehensive reply.  I accept that the money being given might not go directly to support activities that would be anathema to personal freedom and to the rights of the unborn but it seems slightly disingenuous to say that while our money does not go towards any of those things, at the same time money is going through UNFPA to agencies that are involved in what we would consider to be violation of human rights.  Can the Minister assure us that the agencies receiving money are not involved in such activities?  If they are, does she feel it is right to give money to agencies involved in what we, and the <Col N="1285" /> general mass of people in the free world, would consider to be a basic denial of human rights?</P>

Does she agree there is one part of China, taking a one-China view, where no such abuse of human rights takes place, that is, in Taiwan?  Will she agree also that the Irish Government, if it really does give a damn about fundamental human rights of women in particular and, I suppose, of husbands too, should make strong representations to the Government of the People's Republic of China that we do not accept the standards we know in our hearts it applies in the manner in which it controls its population and tramples down women's fundamental human rights in China as a matter of course and as a matter of internal policy?</P>

      <P>The question from Deputy Ó Cuív was in the context of our funding to the UN Fund for Family Planning Activities.  That is my reading of the question, but I am not a lawyer. We have taken up with the UNFPA on a number of occasions the question of its policy on China.  There is a programme in China which I understand amounts to some $9 million a year, about 5 per cent of the total budget worldwide for family planning.  I support the concept of family planning in China.  There may be a difference between me and Deputy Ó Cuív on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to raise the concerns being voiced by some landlords at the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) regulations, 1996, which come into force on 1 May 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from various statements of the Minister of State that these regulations <Col N="1357" /> will be introduced following consultation with representatives of landlords. If that is the case, why are so many objections being raised?  Was there broad general agreement on the concept of control, or was the £40 charge to be imposed per unit and other conditions specified in their drafting?  While all landlords may not be members of their association, I emphasise the strong objections many of them have to the charge and the amount of detailed information sought.</P>
    <P>There has been broad, general agreement in political circles for some years on the need for regulation of the housing private rented sector.  However, have we moved from one extreme to the other?  Landlords claim they will be badly hit by these regulations &mdash; first, by the passage of information from health boards to the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; approved in last year's Finance Bill &mdash; and by the provision under which tenants can claim tax relief on their rent.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the mere existence of landlords remained unknown over many years, suddenly there is data emanating from three different sources, leading me to question whether we have moved from one extreme to the other.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the need for controls, proper standards, rent books and so on because we have all heard far too many stories of rogue landlords who cram tenants into little cubbyholes in substandard accommodation.  Nonetheless, we must be careful not to tilt the balance too far in one direction as there are many responsible landlords providing good accommodation.  Indeed this and previous Governments recognise that the private rented sector forms an integral part of Government housing policy.  We need people to invest their resources in housing and the system must be seen to offer them an incentive to do so.</P>
    <P>There is great concern being voiced at the proposed charge of £40 per unit. Can the Minister of State guarantee that this charge will remain unaltered because many landlords fear it will rise <Col N="1358" /> to £50 or £100 within a few years?  Can the Minister guarantee that future increases will be linked to the prevailing rate of inflation or to the cost of supervision on the part of the relevant local authority?</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State did not avail of this opportunity to introduce regulations pertaining to the external appearance of rented houses. In many parts of flatland in my constituency and others in Dublin one hears constant complaints from residents' associations whose members are doing their best to compete in tidy towns competitions and the like.  They know that the appalling external appearance of many rented houses drags down their areas &mdash; many are very shabby, curtains hang on windows that appear not to have been washed for five years, there is poor or non-existent paintwork and rubbish bags in gardens to be collected in four or five days time.  I am sorry that issue has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are also rogue tenants. Representations were made to me recently by a landlord in danger of losing all his other tenants because of the misbehaviour of one a couple of nights a week.  That landlord is playing the game by the book, has issued his notice to quit &mdash; which has been totally ignored &mdash; and taken legal advice, although it may take him months to have his case heard in court.  In the meantime his solicitor informed him he must put up with it and not take any rent from that troublesome tenant or he may jeopardise his legal case.</P>
    <P>In recent years tenants have been given many new rights, which is their entitlement, but rights carry attendant responsibilities.  Therefore, the right balance must be struck between the rights of the tenant and those of the landlord. I am nervous that these regulations, with which I fundamentally agree, will be perceived by some as tilting the balance too far in favour of the tenant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> I hope the Minister of State will consider the points I made, particularly the external appearance of rented houses.  I had hoped that aspect would have been addressed in recent regulations.  Perhaps the Minister will bear it in mind when they are next reviewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting a very mixed signal from Deputy Noel Ahern: on the one hand being criticised for being too penal while, on the other, for not being sufficiently penal.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for having raised this matter which affords me an opportunity to clarify a number of issues in relation to these new regulations.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have signalled the desirability of the introduction of a system of registration for private rented dwellings &mdash; and it is fair to say that there is broad support for the principle of registration.  The difficult issue is, of course, to devise a regulation system that is meaningful in helping housing authorities to discharge their range of regulatory functions in regard to standards, etc., but which is, at the same time, not excessively onerous on either tenants or landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it was essential to the preparation of the regulations that representatives of tenants, landlords and local authorities were consulted.  During 1995 there were extensive consultations with the interests involved on specific draft proposals for inclusion in the regulations. However, there was a certain limitation because there is not any one organisation representing all landlords nationwide, which difficulty I expressed to those organisations I met.  Following those consultations the original proposals were modified substantially in the 1996 regulations.  In particular, in deference to the concerns of landlords regarding their personal security, and those of tenants who also expressed <Col N="1360" /> some difficulty with that aspect, the original proposal to include the name of the landlord and tenant in the public register was dropped.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the registration regulations is to underpin standards of accommodation in the private rented sector by assisting local authorities to enforce, in a pro-active manner, compliance with the various statutory requirements relating to the sector, including rent books and minimum physical standards of accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996, require the registration with the local housing authority of houses, including apartments and flats, which are let for rent or other valuable consideration.  There are certain exemptions from this requirement, including houses let by local authorities, approved voluntary housing bodies, universities to students, and certain resident landlords.  In addition, where a house is let to certain relatives of the landlord, registration does not apply.</P>
    <P>The registration system which is to come into effect from 1 May entails three main elements: the supply of information to the local authority by the landlord; a register of rented accommodation which will be available for public inspection, and the payment of an annual fee in respect of each registered dwelling.</P>
    <P>There have been some misleading statements in the media regarding the information which will be included in the public register.  Therefore, I want to make it clear that the public register will contain the following items only: the address of the rented house, a brief description of the house type, and the date of receipt by the local authority of the application to register.</P>
    <P>In so far as the level of the annual registration fee is concerned, Deputies will readily appreciate that it is desirable, when requiring local authorities to carry out additional functions, that they should be given resources to assist them <Col N="1361" /> in effectively discharging the new function. The annual fee is £40 &mdash; a modest sum &mdash; and, of course, is an allowable expense against the landlord's tax liability.</P>
    <P>The fee structure was revised following the consultation process.  The financial implications, and indeed, the administrative burden for landlords which arise from the regulations are, in fact, considerably less than originally proposed. The original proposal that the local authority be notified of each change of tenant and that the landlord pay a fee of £10 on each such change was dropped as being unduly onerous.</P>
    <P>These regulations should not cause undue concern to landlords.  Their views, with those of the other interests involved, have been taken into account in the preparation of the regulations. Overall, we can all be satisfied that the new registration system will be of considerable benefit to the private rented sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the need to expedite the transfer of sentenced persons under the legislation passed last year.  It is almost six months since the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, became operable but not a single transfer has been effected.  There seems to be undue delay in the implementation of the legislation. Surely some prisoners should have been transferred by this time but none has been transferred to either jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I understand 89 prisoners, 20 of whom are republicans, have expressed interest in a transfer from Britain; that the Minister for Justice received 29 formal applications and consented to five. At what stage of the process are the other 24 applications?  Has she agreed to them in principle, are they being processed or has she in fact refused some? Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to that in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> A newspaper report last Sunday stated that one application had been agreed by all sides, that the Minister for Justice referred it to the Home Office which agreed to it.  Will the Minister inform the House on this case?  Is it with the office of the Chief State Solicitor or the Attorney General and will it go to the High Court shortly?</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the legislation was introduced on humanitarian grounds under the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons to facilitate families by having their relative serve the sentence in the jurisdiction of which they are a citizen.  Obviously the legislation was introduced in the context of the peace process.  The situation for republican prisoners in British prisons has deteriorated since the ceasefire began.  The deterioration of conditions in British prisons would have been seen as another reason to speed up the transfer of prisoners but this does not seem to have happened.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on the precondition set by the Home Office that the Minister for Justice &ldquo;respect the integrity of the sentence by our Government&rdquo; and that any sentence would not be substantially reduced when a transfer arose.  I consider that to be a red herring. The legislation outlines the conditions under which the transfer will take place and how it will operate in each jurisdiction.  To put it mildly it is out of line that the constitutional powers of the Minister for Justice to commute the sentence or to allow somebody early release would be interfered with, especially when one considers our track record.  In this country we have 25 per cent remission which is less than in Britain, which is a third, and of course which is only half the 50 per cent remission that exists in Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Justice has been very careful in any instances where republican prisoners have been released from Portlaoise.  They would have <Col N="1363" /> served much more of their sentence than they would have served in any other jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Mr. Patrick Kelly who is serving his sentence in Maghaberry prison has cancer and is seriously ill.  He has applied for a transfer but, to date, has not been facilitated.  His family are based in Portlaoise adjacent to the high security prison for republican prisoners.  What is the reason for the delay in the transfer?</P>
    <P>What is the situation in regard to transfers from prison in the jurisdiction to Britain?  When does he expect a transfer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Deputy's longstanding interest in prisoner welfare issues in general and the particular concerns of Irish prisoners overseas and their families.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that under the terms of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, came into effect on 1 November 1995 between Ireland and the other contracting parties.  Consequently, it only became possible to formally receive and process requests for transfers from that date.  Some of the numerous requests had been &ldquo;on hold&rdquo; for several years waiting for such a legislative instrument.</P>
      <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, provides a mechanism where non-Irish nationals serving sentences in Ireland may apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in their own countries and similarly Irish prisoners overseas to apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Act in facilitating the transfer of foreign prisoners to their home countries reflects international principles by penal policy to lay greater emphasis upon the social rehabilitation of offenders.  It can be of paramount importance that the sanction imposed on the offender is enforced in his home <Col N="1364" /> country rather than in the state where the offence was committed and the judgement rendered.  The policy is also rooted in humanitarian considerations, difficulties in communication by reason of language barriers and aberration from local culture and customs.  The absence of contacts with relatives may also have detrimental effects on the foreign prisoner.  By ratifying the convention this Government has facilitated a procedural framework for such transfers of prisoners to and from the State.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the terms of the convention provide that for a transfer to take place a three way consent is required from the prisoner, the sentencing state and the state to which the transfer is requested.  The Act sets out a mechanism for Ireland to honour its obligation under the convention to communicate such consent and effect transfers.</P>
    <P>I confirm that the Department of Justice is actively processing all requests for transfers of sentenced persons into and out of the State.  Approximately 100 Irish persons serving sentences abroad have expressed interest in transferring into this jurisdiction.  The vast bulk of applications under the convention &mdash; 89 are from Irish prisoners serving sentences in England, followed by the United States &mdash; six &mdash; and Northern Ireland &mdash;four.  Applications are also being processed from 26 foreign prisoners in Irish prisons who have expressed interest in a transfer to their country of origin.  Most of these prisoners are from England &mdash; 16 &mdash; and Northern Ireland &mdash; 7.  The Minister has no objections in principle to these prisoners being transferred but cannot obviously give her formal written consent until there has been an exchange of documentation with the relevant authorities and she is advised of the manner in which it is proposed to administer the offenders' sentences.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Convention, the two states involved in processing a <Col N="1365" /> transfer request are required to exchange information relating to the prisoner.  The information in question includes particulars of the offence, court warrants, sentence administration particulars, etc.  Owing to the complexity of the documentation required the process of information exchange is not one which can be completed quickly.</P>
    <P>However, one case has already been completed and the Irish person concerned was transferred to Ireland from the United States on 31 January 1996. One more person is also expected to be returned to Ireland shortly.</P>
    <P>The Minister fully appreciates the need to expedite the transfer of Irish prisoners.  She has asked me to assure the Deputy that all applications that have been formally transmitted are being actively processed in consultation with other offices, including the Chief State Solicitor's office, and that there will be no undue delay in deciding upon them.  She has instructed her officials to ensure that priority is given to this most important work and that it is completed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Continuing dialogue with the UK prison authorities is at the heart of the matter of the operation of the Convention at this time.  The Deputy can be assured that there is continuous dialogue and communication between the relevant Department of Justice officials and their British equivalents in this matter. It would not be appropriate for me to elaborate on this dialogue at this delicate stage in the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for his attendance on this matter.  It arises from the findings of a recent survey carried out in Cork city which demonstrate that unemployment figures have risen by 2 per cent in the past year.  The survey in question was most comprehensive.  The research is based on figures supplied by <Col N="1366" /> the Central Statistics Office and the work was carried out by a most respected and professional social researcher, Emer O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that unemployment in Cork has increased constantly in the years 1994, 1995 and 1996.  That this should be happening is quite shocking. The Government constantly tells us that there is great growth in the economy with new jobs being created all over the place.  What is even more shocking, however, is that this Government, on its own admission, is totally unaware of the situation in Cork.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter in my contribution on the Finance Bill last week.  It fell on deaf ears.  I raised it again yesterday in the debate on the Irish Steel Bill.  In his response the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said:</P>
      <P>I do not propose to comment on the survey in Deputy Quill's constituency to which she has referred.  I have not seen it and I am not questioning it.  I would like to see it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State went on to say: &ldquo;if it is true&rdquo;.  It is true and I have asked the researcher to forward a copy of the survey to the office of the Minister of State.  It is fair that he should see the full findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appalled that the Minister of State has not seen the survey.  He sits at Cabinet so if he has not seen it, it is obvious the matter has not been brought to the notice of Cabinet.  The Government does not know about unemployment in Cork city, north and south.  This revelation will be a devastating blow to Cork.  That the already high unemployment situation is getting worse on an annual basis is bad enough. However, that the Government knows nothing about it is horrendous.  The findings of the survey were published in <i>The Examiner</i> on 12 March 1996.  I have brought a copy of that newspaper to the Chamber to give to the Minister of State <Col N="1367" /> so that he can bring it to the notice of Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The parties in Government are well represented in Cork city.  They have no fewer than five Deputies in the two constituencies. Can it be that none of these Deputies has raised this issue with their Ministers?  The people of Cork city can ill afford such complacency on the part of the Government.  I warn the Government that the matter must be tackled.  If jobs were being lost and unemployment was rising at the same rate in a neighbouring county, the Cabinet Minister for that county would be sitting on the IDA.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Government does not create jobs.  However, it can create the conditions that lead to job creation. For a start, the Government could ensure that work proceeds immediately on the Blackpool bypass.  I have raised this issue repeatedly with the Minister for the Environment.  That single measure would lead to the type of investment that would create jobs. Moreover, it would enable the IDA to market the northside of the city with some measure of success.  There is a number of other key measures the Government could take and one of them is the policy my party is constantly advocating &mdash; tax reform.  We tax work as if it was a luxury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is the single most important political issue facing this country.  It is the battleground on which the next election will be fought.

      <P>I will be in Cork on Saturday to discuss the serious issue Deputy Quill raised.  I draw her attention to the fact that the start-up phase of the local employment service in Cork is well under way.  I understand the service will be fully operational in the area by the end of May.  This service is specifically geared towards helping those who traditionally have had most <Col N="1369" /> difficulty in finding jobs, in particular, the long-term unemployed.  In an area, such as Cork city, where there is such a high incidence of long-term unemployment, 46.3 per cent or approximately 5,000 of the total, one-fifth of the labour force are unemployed, the LES will have particular relevance.</P>
      <P>A priority of the LES plan for Cork city will be long-term unemployment among males, of whom an estimated 52 per cent or approximately 4,000 are out of work for a year or more and 17 per cent or approximately 1,300 aged 35 or more are out of paid employment for three or more years.</P>
      <P>The LES will not be only a guidance and counselling service.  It is a practical client-centred, career path planning and work placement service for the unemployed person and a professional placement service for employers.  In time it will be of real assistance in helping long-term unemployed persons in Cork to have a greater degree of success in competing for jobs than has been the case up to now.</P>
      <P>In addition, the series of measures announced in the budget this year should make a substantial contribution to increasing the opportunities available to unemployed people in line with the Government's goal of full employment. For example, the part-time integration option under the community employment scheme was introduced as and from 15 April.  The pilot whole time jobs option will come into operation on 1 July and will provide 1,000 additional opportunities for long-term unemployed people in areas of high unemployment in the cities of Cork, Limerick and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planned start-up date for Jobstart and Workplace is May 1996.  FÁS as part of its day to day operational responsibility for both of these programmes has prepared a design brief, the objectives of which are to inform the target audiences the terms and conditions of each programme; to highlight <Col N="1370" /> the benefits of each programme to their primary target audiences; to promote the programmes to employers as being worthwhile measures for their company; and to present all information and material in a simple, user-friendly manner.</P>
    <P>Discussions are ongoing between my Department and FÁS, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed and IBEC on the final details of these programmes.  I hope these will be completed very shortly.  The programmes will be launched in May.  This is earlier than the projected date of 1 July originally proposed.</P>
    <P>Ongoing discussions are also taking place between my Department, FÁS and the Department of Social Welfare regarding the implementation of initiatives which will provide opportunities for 500 young unemployed people at any one time.  It is intended that the programme will apply for those 18 to 19 year olds who are six months on the live register.  The measures will include a youth progression programme for each individual designed to encourage young people into the labour market and to prevent them from drifting into prolonged dependence on the live register.</P>
    <P>In the strategy paper on the labour market, <i>Growing and Sharing our Employment,</i> launched last week, my ministerial colleague, Deputy Bruton, sets out full employment as the ultimate goal of Government.</P>
    <P>While this clearly can only be achieved over time, its firm establishment gives us two clear overall objectives: to set a policy framework to increase employment and the employment intensity of growth; and to bring back into the mainstream of the labour market those who are currently excluded.  By adopting this goal of full employment, the stages we must achieve become clear.</P>
    <P>The transition from school to work must be improved so that young people <Col N="1371" /> do not drift into long-term unemployment before they have even had an opportunity to find their feet in the labour market.  In this area the Government is currently developing a youth progression programme aimed at 18 to 19 years olds to offer them intensive support before they become long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The escape probabilities from unemployment must be very much improved in order to end the cycle of social exclusion through unemployment. Measures taken in the most recent budget have considerably improved the returns from work and I am anxious that this improvement should be maintained for the future.  An effort must be made to improve the flows on to and off the live register to tackle the scourge of long-term unemployment.  We know now that the trickle-down effect does not work.  Economic growth alone is not sufficient to give the long-term unemployed an equitable opportunity to find work.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly we have enjoyed very significant economic success over the first half of this decade and this has translated into real jobs; 4 per cent jobs growth or 49,000 net additional jobs in the year to April 1995 alone, with every indication of equal success this year. Our employment intensity of growth now matches the US and is well ahead of the European Union average.  One of our great strengths in building enterprises has been our well-educated and increasingly confident workforce.</P>
    <P>In Government we are shaping a strong jobs economy by adopting a range of policies to support innovation and to facilitate employment growth. However, the strong annual growth of 1.3 per cent or more in our labour force means that we still have a surplus labour supply.

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht liom. Bhí air fanacht níos faide ná mar a bhí súil aige agus mar sin ní chuirfidh mise faid leis an gcaint.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to listen to what I have to say.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the condition of Cleggan Pier.  That pier serves two purposes, it is the ferry terminal for Inishbofin Island and one of the fishing ports in Connemara.  Outside Rossaveal and Roundstone it is probably the most important fishing port in Connemara.  This 19th century pier is deteriorating rapidly and a good deal of work needs to be done on it.</P>
      <P>Cleggan should be formally designated as a fish landing port.  A significant amount of summer fishing is done at Cleggan and from time to time large boats land catches there.  Inshore fishing, shell fishing and other types of fishing are making a greater contribution to the economy of Connemara.  If we are to develop those types of fishing, piers like Cleggan will be vital.  Cleggan should be recognised as a ferry port, something that appears to pose major difficulties, and appropriate funding should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the islands development programme Galway County Council is in the process of making a submission that work should be carried out on Inishbofin Pier.  As the Minister will realise, if we want to provide a ferry service to an island, not only must we have suitable landing on the island but we need suitable piers for the mainland. The financial envelope of £1 million will be totally insufficient to carry out the amount of work needed on the landing stages or piers which need development to provide proper ferry facilities.  Only when a series of accidents occurs at one of the ferry ports which were not <Col N="1373" /> designed to be ferry ports will there be an outcry as to why something was not done to designate, regulate and provide the necessary infrastructure for these ports.</P>
    <P>There is need for an assessment.  I hope this will be done in the near future and money will be granted by the Department to carry out a long-term development plan for Cleggan Pier. There are huge problems with this pier. It is falling apart.  There are major cracks developing, even in the inner harbour and there is a need for new breakwaters.  On a quiet day the water looks perfectly calm from the pier and one would think the sea could not break there.  Unfortunately, because of the direction the pier faces, the sea hits the strand and comes back up the pier.  For that reason there are gates in the pier to protect boats during the winter.  These are not needed in Inishbofin and Inis Mór because of the way the harbours there are located.</P>
    <P>There is a need for major refurbishment to the pier structure.  The breakwaters on the sea side are badly in need of structural repair as are the pier walls on the inside and the gates.  Ancillary facilities, such as proper car parking and public toilets, are needed.  Somebody recently commented that there were public toilets there in the 19th century but none in the 20th century. Unless something is done soon, they will not be there either at the beginning of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>There is a need for Galway County Council and the Department to make regulations to provide for a harbour master on the pier.  We need to have control over where fishing boats, ferries, cars and other users of the pier are designated. A large number of pleasure craft use the pier and this will increase in the future.  In the interests of safety we need comprehensive development.  I hope the Minister will give me the good news that he has the matter in hand and that it is only a question of sending a <Col N="1374" /> cheque to Galway County Council, so that it can do the work in the near future.</P>

      <P>The outer portion of Cleggan Pier is the responsibility of my Department under the Marine Works (Ireland) Act, 1902 and the inner portion is the responsibility of Galway County Council.</P>
      <P>As the House was informed in a reply to a similar question on 26 March last, I understand relevant parties, including Galway County Council and my Department, were invited to review the infrastructural needs at Cleggan Pier at first hand at a meeting fixed for 20 April and I arranged for the Department's region engineer to attend.  On receipt of his report the identified needs and options will be costed and assessed in the light of available funding and in consultation with Galway County Council and other interests.</P>
      <P>I understand the recent report of the Islands' Committee considered access to offshore islands a priority and relevant local authority island committees, in consultation with islanders and Comhdhail Oileán na hÉireann, have been asked to prepare a programme of works to bring the level of access to offshore islands up to a socially desirable minimum standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome in regard to consideration of the application for investment at Cleggan, I should point out that the level of funding available to me for works at harbours such as Cleggan is very limited and it is difficult to see how any development works can be undertaken <Col N="1375" /> by my Department at this pier in the near future.  However, my Department will liaise closely with Galway County Council and the Islands' Committee to <Col N="1376" /> bring this development proposal to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in Chechnya continues to be a matter of grave concern.  It has been our consistently held view that the Chechen conflict cannot be solved by military means, and our efforts continue to be directed towards the promotion of a negotiated solution.  The Government has been working to this end with EU partners and through the mechanisms of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).</P>
      <P>Early in 1995 agreement was reached to establish an OSCE assistance mission in the capital, Grozny, with a mandate to promote respect for human rights and to support the creation of mechanisms guaranteeing the rule of law; to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and assist in the return of refugees; and to promote a peaceful resolution of the crisis.  The assistance mission played an important role in mediating between the parties and further progress was made in July last with the negotiation of a ceasefire and a range of military agreements.</P>
      <P>In the autumn, however, the ceasefire agreement broke down and fighting resumed.  Since then, we have seen an escalation of the violence, including hostage taking by Chechen rebels in neighbouring Dagestan, the hijacking of a passenger vessel in the Black Sea, a large scale attack by separatists on Grozny and increasingly heavy Russian military actions in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication by President Yeltsin of a peace plan for Chechnya on 31 March, with provision for a ceasefire, a phased withdrawal of troops and mediated negotiations, could represent a basis for talks between the parties. However, fighting continues in the region and following the ambush and killing of approximately 100 Russian troops by Chechen rebels on Friday last, troop withdrawals, begun under the peace plan, have been suspended.  There <Col N="1288" /> have been widespread reports of human rights abuses and numerous civilian casualties.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, has made known to the Russian authorities our deep concerns about these developments.  At UN level, Ireland has consistently supported international action at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and in the Third Committee in New York aimed at the protection of human rights in the Chechnya region.  We have also consistently pressed, together with our EU partners, for meaningful commitments to and respect for fundamental human rights.  This action is continuing at the current session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
    <P>The renewed fighting in Chechnya has exacerbated an already critical humanitarian situation there.  Despite the extremely difficult working conditions, including attacks on offices and personnel, a limited number of humanitarian agencies have remained operational in the area.  These agencies face considerable difficulties in gaining access to the war affected zones and Ireland has been active with EU partners in pressing the Russian authorities to facilitate access on the ground for humanitarian organisations.</P>
    <P>The European Union plans to disburse 8 million ECU to the ICRC, World Food Programme and to a small number of NGOs to assist refugees and internally displaced persons in Chechnya and in the neighbouring republics. The Government has to date disbursed £285,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross and to humanitarian NGOs for victims of the conflict in Chechnya.  We are monitoring the humanitarian situation closely and will shortly announce a further allocation for humanitarian agencies in the region.</P>
    <P>The situation in Chechnya is complex and there is no easy solution.  Clearly, however, the immediate requirement to enable progress to be made towards a peaceful settlement remains the establishment of a lasting ceasefire.  We will work to promote this as an urgent priority and we will spare no effort to <Col N="1289" /> put an end to the appalling loss of civilian lives and the worsening human rights situation in the region.</P>

      <P>In keeping with this policy, the ongoing process of developing the EU's relations with the applicant countries in the perspective of future enlargement will be an important priority of our Presidency.</P>
      <P>In this connection, an extensive series of joint meetings at ministerial level between EU Ministers and their counterparts from the associated countries will be held during the Irish Presidency, under the multilateral structured dialogue arrangements in place between the Union and the applicants.  These arrangements are of central importance to the Union's strategy for preparing the applicant countries for eventual accession.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 16 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has engaged the Chinese authorities consistently, on a bilateral basis, on issues of human rights in the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>I have had lengthy discussions with the Chinese Vice-Premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Qian Qichen, on a wide range of human rights issues in China, most recently on the occasion of the latter's official visit to Ireland in October 1995.  Individual human rights issues are raised on an ongoing basis as, for instance, when I raised with the Chinese Ambassador, earlier this year, the question of the conditions in Chinese orphanages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has also played an active role regarding the question of human rights in China in the framework of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy.  In recent months, the <Col N="1291" /> EU has made representations to the Chinese authorities on a number of specific issues, notably the further imprisonment of Wei Jingsheng; the health conditions of the imprisoned Chen Ziming; and the safety and well-being of the Dalai Lama's choice as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama. Ireland participated as a member of the EU Troika in the ongoing EU/China human rights dialogue meeting which took place in Beijing in January 1996.</P>
    <P>At the current 52nd Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, the EU tabled a draft Resolution on the situation of human rights in China.  The EU proposal recalled the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action which reaffirmed the obligation of all member states to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to fulfil the obligations they have undertaken under international instruments in this field.  I regret to state that, on 23 April, a procedural &ldquo;no action&rdquo; motion was carried and that this prevents further consideration of the EU proposal at the present session.</P>
    <P>China is already a party to a number of international human rights instruments, notably the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, there are other international human rights conventions to which China is not yet a party.  Ireland would welcome China's early accession to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  In addition, Ireland welcomes the forthcoming visits to China by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Director of the UN Centre for Human Rights, and the Chairman of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention with a view to even <Col N="1292" /> more effective monitoring of the human rights situation in China.</P>

      <P>The primary focus of the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland was to ensure that business representatives from the US, Northern Ireland and the Border counties were facilitated in every way possible in making contact with each other so that trade and investment opportunities could be identified and pursued.</P>
      <P>An important element in this regard was the &ldquo;matchmaker&rdquo; programme promoted by the US Department of Commerce.  This enabled selected Irish companies attending the conference to have contact with relevant US companies with a view to co-operation in areas of mutual business interest.</P>
      <P>A number of follow-up activities have taken place since the Washington conference.</P>
      <P>In October 1995, the late US Assistant Secretary at the Department of Commerce, Mr. Clarke Meissner, led a business matchmaker mission to Northern Ireland and the six Border counties of 19 US companies who were seeking Irish partners.  During the visit, meetings were arranged with a range of companies from the Border counties.  It is anticipated that positive results will emerge from this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1995, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, accompanied executives from 26 Irish companies to the US.  Meetings were held with potential US partner companies who were identified on the basis of <Col N="1293" /> the pre-defined specific needs of the Irish companies.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing follow-up programme to develop these contacts involving the appropriate State agencies on both sides and the individual companies. Initial follow-up has indicated that second phase discussions are likely with approximately 60 per cent of the companies involved.</P>
    <P>It would be premature to forecast the final outcome at this point as the development of partnerships often takes a significant amount of time from initial contact to implementation of business arrangements.  I am confident, however, that they will lead to concrete results in terms of increased US investment on the island of Ireland.  In June a further US inward investment mission in the information technology sector is planned.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland last May, it was envisaged that a follow-up conference would be convened to review progress.  During the Taoiseach's visit to Washington in March, it was announced that a follow-up event would be held in Philadelphia in the autumn.  While I am not yet in a position to provide details on what format the conference will take, I am confident that there will be a significant focus on the continued development of business partnerships and strategic alliances between Irish and US companies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The production of a programme for the Presidency is well in hand and will be finalised in the light of the work done under the Italian Presidency.  The Presidency is obliged to place the programme before the institutions of the Union early in July and it will be circulated to Deputies at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the practical organisational issues arising from our Presidency planning, I have lodged with the <Col N="1295" /> Oireachtas Library for the information of Deputies the calendar of Council meetings and the list of Presidency-related meetings in Ireland during our Presidency.  These are being updated regularly.</P>
    <P>The main obligation on any Presidency is to ensure an efficient, effective and impartial approach to the discharge of the business of the European Union and this is a primary objective of our Presidency planning.  Those issues which will be priorities for the European Union and for Ireland during our Presidency are set out in the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  They are likely to include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Intergovernmental Conference to review aspects of the EU Treaties,</P>
    <P>&mdash;preparations for the Third Stage of Economic and Monetary Union,</P>
    <P>&mdash;growth, competitiveness, employment and social inclusion,</P>
    <P>&mdash;agreement on the draft Union budget for 1997,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Third Pillar issues such as drugs, immigration, extradition and organised crime,</P>
    <P>&mdash;implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy,</P>
    <P>&mdash;furthering developing relations between the EU and the applicant countries in preparation for future enlargement of the Union, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the continuing development of relations with other countries and regions outside the Union.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy clearly indicates full Government support for the present moves within the European Union towards the introduction of greater transparency and openness in the decision making process of the Union.  That support will continue during our Presidency and beyond. Transparency will also be addressed in <Col N="1296" /> the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>For the Intergovernmental Conference to be a success, it must be transparent both in its conduct and its outcome. The Government, therefore, attaches importance to the transparency of the Intergovernmental Conference process, including during our Presidency, when we will chair the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations. It is also essential that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference is clear and comprehensible and that the decisions taken at the Intergovernmental Conference result in a significant improvement in the transparency of the functioning of the Union.</P>
    <P>The Government will support the introduction of provisions in the Treaty itself which reflect the importance of transparency.</P>

      <P>My Department has been carefully monitoring the deterioration of the situation in Liberia.  We are aware that 13 Irish citizens were residing in the country when law and order recently broken down in Monrovia, nine of whom were SMA missionary priests.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the European Commission aid co-ordination team in Monrovia ten of our citizens, including six priests, were among a number of EU citizens who were evacuated from the city by the US Embassy in the days immediately following the outbreak of fighting.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission staff and the US authorities for their assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three Irish priests have not been evacuated; they have, I understand, <Col N="1297" /> decided to remain in Liberia for the present.  They are in relatively safe areas some distances from Monrovia.</P>

      <P>The crisis in former Yugoslavia will be a major priority for the European Union during Ireland's Presidency in the latter half of this year.  The objective of the Union, and of Ireland as Presidency, will be to assist the parties in implementing fully the provisions of the peace agreement.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the agreement is first and foremost a matter for the parties themselves.  The role of the international community, including the European Union and its Presidency, is to assist and facilitate the parties, where necessary, through the structures which have been established as part of the peace process and the various international organisations which have a contribution to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, as EU Presidency, will be participating in the work of a number of bodies which have an important role in the peace process, including the International Contact Group and the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council which was established at a conference in London in December 1995 to oversee implementation of the agreement. These bodies will monitor compliance with the Dayton Agreement and will be involved in promoting peace and reconciliation at all levels in Bosnia and Hercegovina.  For example, a key task of the steering board will be to oversee the distribution of reconstruction assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina &mdash; and effort to which the European Union has been making a particularly significant contribution. Ireland will be contributing <Col N="1298" /> actively and constructively to this work on behalf of the European Union as well as continuing to support the activities of the High Representative, Mr. Carl Bildt, the United Nations and its various agencies, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the other international organisations involved in the peace process. The areas encompassed in this work include upholding human rights, promoting arms control, facilitating the return of refugees and displaced persons, rebuilding civil society, tracing missing persons and bringing those responsible for war crimes to justice.</P>
    <P>During Ireland's Presidency, free and fair elections are due to be held in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  These elections will mark a new phase in the peace process and a successful outcome to them will be central to the future of that wartorn country in its efforts to heal itself. Ireland, as EU Presidency, will be making a significant contribution to the efforts of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe to prepare for and supervise the polls, most notably through the European Union Monitor Mission, of which Ireland will assume leadership in July.  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland will be making available some 80 personnel to the staffing of the monitor mission during the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>Following the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the EU will doubtless wish to consider how it can contribute to the future development of economic and political stability in the region.  The principal mechanism through which this could be achieved would be through the development of appropriate contractual relations with the countries of the region.  Depending therefore on the unfolding of events, this may also be a matter which the Irish Presidency will be addressing before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I believe that the European Union, because of its leading position in Europe, has a key contribution to make <Col N="1299" /> to the peace process in former Yugoslavia. Ireland, in its capacity as Presidency of the Union, will continue to work closely with our EU partners to use every means available to achieve this objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, the Government believes that marches in Northern Ireland should be governed by the principle that they should not take place in an area, or along a route, where they are not welcome.  This principle seeks to establish a respect for the right of local residents to object to what they judge to be insensitive and unwelcome parades.  At the same time, it does not seek to impinge on the right of anyone to celebrate their identity and heritage by marching.  Bearing this basic principle in mind, the Government hopes that agreement in advance can be reached by all sides in the small number of parades, a mere fraction of the thousands of parades which are held each year, which result in confrontation and, at times, violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This principle, and its implications for the routing of parades, has been raised consistently through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. I have urged, and will continue <Col N="1300" /> to urge the British Government to consider steps, consistent with this principle, to avoid a repetition of the events last year.  We believe that parades policy must reflect the wider political issues and it should not be considered merely a police matter to be handled one parade at a time, and in particular should not be decided as a function of who can mount the most significant threat to the peace at any given time.</P>
    <P>Even within the limitations of current legislation, the Government holds the view &mdash; and has conveyed it to the British authorities &mdash; that more could be done by, for example, allowing greater time between the RUC decision on a parade route and the actual date of the proposed parade.  I note that the decision on the proposed parade down the Lower Ormeau Road scheduled for 28 April next was announced by the RUC on Monday, 22 April last.  I hope that this example of greater notice will become established practice.  Such an interval can allow for further mediation efforts and dialogue.  A further example is the power of the Secretary of State to ban a parade for a period of up to three months, a power that might be usefully employed in certain instances.</P>
    <P>The suggestion, made by a number of people whose views command respect, of an independent tribunal to arbitrate on parades and parade routes is a welcome addition to this ongoing debate. The Government would support such a proposal but acknowledges that acceptability to the parties involved would be an essential condition for its success.  To date, this proposal has not commanded sufficiently widespread support among those directly involved in the issue for us to say that it represents the solution to the problem.  We would hope, however, that dialogue on this, and other sensible compromise formulas, can develop to the point of agreement, particularly in regard to the handful of parades that prove contentious. The Government will do everything possible to promote that end.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that we will continue to monitor this situation closely on <Col N="1301" /> the ground.  Our ongoing consultations with the British authorities over the coming weeks will continue and intensify as we move toward the flashpoints of the marching season.</P>
    <P>We will continue to urge that, within the limitations of the current law regarding parades, the issues be handled with primary regard for the rights of local residents.  If decisions on contentious parade routes are taken over the coming months on the basis of the principle I have outlined, this will make a significant contribution to the confidence building which is essential to the success of all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>At this early stage in the marching season, I urge those involved in organising parades to consider the implications of further confrontations, the attack they represent on respect for the law, the heightening of cross-community tensions and, not least, the effect on the peace process at a time when we are engaged in an historic endeavour to find a lasting political accommodation between the Nationalist and Unionist traditions.  Restraint and responsible leadership in the coming months will add immeasurably to the store of goodwill and trust which fuels the search for a lasting political settlement.</P>

        <i>A New Framework for Agreement,</i> agreed by both the Irish and British Governments in February 1995, describes the shared understanding between them on the parameters of a possible outcome to all-party negotiations. As agreed by both Governments in the Communiqué of 28 February 1996, these negotiations are due to begin on 10 June 1996.  In paragraph 50 <Col N="1302" /> of the Framework Document, each Government commits itself to undertake the introduction of appropriate legislation in its jurisdiction on the island of Ireland to ensure the further protection of common specified civil, political, social and cultural rights, taking account of their overall responsibilities, including their international obligations.</P>
      <P>Both Governments are ready to discuss and seek agreement with the political parties on this matter.  Given the strong support which already exists among the parties for a bill of rights or a similar concept, I believe that this will be an important issue in the all-party negotiations beginning on 10 June 1996.</P>
      <P>Civil and human rights are, of course, fully protected in this jurisdiction under the Constitution of Ireland and by our adherence to the principal international human rights instruments.  However, I confirm that the Government stands ready to give expression to the outcome of the all-party negotiations regarding the protection of rights by introducing appropriate legislation.  The Government would not wish to pre-empt these negotiations by introducing legislation prior to the conclusion of the negotiations.</P>

Ireland, along with other countries with a tradition of service with UN peacekeeping missions, was active in promoting agreement among member states on the adoption of such an international instrument to address this problem.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Bilderberg Group was formed in 1954, at the Hotel de Bilderberg in the Netherlands, to provide a forum for informal, off the record discussions on political, economic and military issues of mutual concern between politicians, scholars, businessmen and trade union leaders from Europe and North America. It organises an annual conference which takes place in a different country each year.  In recent years the conference has taken place in Switzerland, Finland and Greece, and this year's conference will take place in Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bilderberg Group has no formal structure or developed organisation and invitations to the annual conference are issued by the chairman, whom I understand is currently the former British Foreign Secretary and EU envoy to former Yugoslavia, Lord Carrington.  The chairman is advised by a steering committee and an advisory group which is drawn from approximately 20 western countries, including representatives from countries that are members and <Col N="1304" /> countries that are non-members of military alliances.  I understand that the meetings are off the record and informal.</P>
    <P>Conferences such as Bilderberg no doubt provide the participants with useful opportunities to meet and discuss a range of current issues on an informal basis.  Not having attended the conference myself, I am not in a position to comment further.</P>

      <P>The issue of access to RTE television in Northern Ireland is one on which the Government places particular importance.  Greater availability of RTE television throughout Northern Ireland would make a significant contribution towards the creation of better North-South awareness and understanding and in this way assist in the process of reconciliation between the two parts of this island.  It would also contribute to greater understanding between the two main traditions in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government's objective of greater access to RTE television in Northern Ireland is shared by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference established a bilateral broadcasting group comprising officials and technical experts to examine the issue of RTE television reception in Northern Ireland.  That group identified that the most significant improvement in the short term could be achieved by increasing the power northwards from the RTE transmitter at Clermont Carn in County Louth.  However, the British side maintained that the increase in <Col N="1305" /> power could have adverse effects on the reception of its local service in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the two relevant regulatory agencies, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications in Dublin and the Radiocommunications Agency in London, have had a series of meetings to discuss ways of overcoming any problem of interference which could arise from an increased power output from Clermont Carn.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the broadcasting group will be in a position to submit a report on the outcome of these technical discussions to the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chapter 3 of the White Paper on Foreign Policy sets out Ireland's broad approach to the main issues that are likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference which opened in Turin on 29 March.  There was extensive public consultation in the context of the preparation of the White Paper.  In addition to a series of public seminars, I specifically invited written submissions on any aspect of foreign policy from over 70 non-governmental organisations.  I <Col N="1306" /> also invited any person or organisation to make such a submission.  A total of 64 submissions were received and have been lodged in the National Archives where they are available for consultation.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches great importance to transparency and openness in the conduct of the Intergovernmental Conference.  We will continue to listen carefully to the views and contributions of non-governmental organisations and, indeed, any other interested persons or bodies in relation to the issues which will be discussed during the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference process is, of course, intergovernmental in nature.  It consists of a series of meetings at official and ministerial level.  The Government does not consider that it would be appropriate to set up an NGO forum in conjunction with the conference.</P>
    <P>As regards the nature and extent of the discussions which took place at the opening of the intergovernmental conference in Turin last month, I would refer Deputy Hilliard to the statements made in this House by both the Taoiseach and me on 2 April 1996 which dealt with the Turin European Council and the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the European Council, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House, are intended to help focus the work of the Intergovernmental Conference but are not intended to limit the scope for member states to bring forward proposals. The main topics to be considered by the Intergovernmental Conference fall into three categories: first, making the Union more relevant to its citizens; secondly, enabling the Union to work better and preparing it for enlargement; and thirdly, giving the Union greater capacity for external action.</P>
    <P>The Turin European Council confirmed that the agenda will include, <i>inter alia,</i> a number of topics of direct concern to citizens such as employment, <Col N="1307" /> environment and the fight against international crime including drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Negotiations of the Intergovernmental Conference at Foreign Minister level are taking place once a month.  The work of Foreign Ministers is being prepared by a working party of personal representatives meeting more frequently. The Italian Presidency is expected to make a first interim report to the European Council in Florence in June.</P>
    <P>Chairing the Intergovernmental Conference will be a major priority for the Irish Presidency in the second half of the year and we will seek to advance its work as expeditiously and constructively as possible.</P>
    <P>While the duration of the Intergovernmental Conference will depend on the substance of negotiations, it is expected to run well into the Dutch Presidency in the first half of 1997.</P>

However, one member state indicated that it had difficulties with the proposed dates.  In view of these difficulties and following consultations with all our partners, the dates of 13-14 December were agreed by all member states.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> However, from time to time, the evolution of the Union agenda may demand that a second European Council be convened during a Presidency.  This happened during Ireland's last Presidency in 1990.</P>

      <P>One of the main issues to arise in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference will be how the EU's common foreign and security policy provisions can best be developed to enhance the EU's contribution to European and global peace and security, including through the EU-WEU relationship and the handling of Petersberg tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, the European Commission has joined a number of our EU partners in stating its preference for the eventual merger of the Western European Union with the EU according to <Col N="1312" /> an agreed timetable and its wish to make progress towards that goal at the Intergovernmental Conference.  The Government is studying these and other proposals carefully.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that various possible institutional options for future EU-WEU relations were identified in the Reflection Group report and in the Western European Union contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference.  These ranged from maintaining the EU and the Western European Union as separate organisations, but with enhanced co-operation between them, through to proposals for eventual full merger.  Both the Reflection Group report and the Western European Union contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference accepted that the different positions of member states would have to be respected and that negotiations on the various options were a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference itself.</P>
    <P>The broad approach being pursued by the Government in relation to issues expected to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference, including the question of relations between the EU and the Western European Union, has been the subject of a number of statements by me in this House and elsewhere and was dealt with most recently in reply to parliamentary questions on 7 March last &mdash; Official Report Vol. 462, No. 7, col. 1881-1895. Chapter 4 of the Government's White Paper on Foreign Policy examines the security and defence policy aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference and sets out the underlying principles that will guide the Government's approach to these negotiations.</P>

      <P>The reduction or ending of involuntary emigration has been a policy objective of successive Irish Governments. The only effective solution is the creation of job opportunities in Ireland through the promotion of economic growth.  This objective is at the top of this Government's priorities.</P>
      <P>Our strategy for economic growth is working.  Employment and incomes are increasing and, as a result, involuntary emigration has declined and the number of returning emigrants has increased.  The Central Statistics Office estimates that average annual net emigration since 1991 has been less than 5,000; this compares with an annual average of about 27,000 in the years 1986 to 1991.</P>
      <P>At the same time the Government is determined to support Irish emigrant communities and to reinforce the continuing ties with our emigrants.  In this context the Minister for the Environment recently published a consultation document on the Representation of Emigrants in Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>My Department and its embassies and consulates actively monitor legislative and other developments affecting Irish people wishing to emigrate or who are already abroad.  When necessary, we make our interests known to other Governments and those with political influence in the countries concerned.  Our diplomatic missions also co-operate closely with the voluntary groups in the Irish communities as well as themselves giving practical advice and assistance to emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voluntary groups involved in the welfare of Irish immigrants in the US receive financial support from the Foreign Affairs Vote.  In 1995, £150,000 was made available to such groups.  A total of £180,000 is available this year for organisations in the US and Australia.  This is the first year that assistance has been made available for groups in Australia involved in providing support to Irish immigrants.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, on the advice of the London-based DION Committee, provides financial assistance to voluntary organisations providing practical advice and help to Irish emigrants in <Col N="1314" /> Britain.  There is a provision of £500,000 for such grants this year.</P>
    <P>Ensuring that professional advice and guidance are available beforehand to people considering working overseas is another important way in which the Government assists emigrants.  FÁS, the training and employment authority, provides a comprehensive service in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Emigration, chaired by my Department, co-ordinates the activities of all relevant Government Departments and agencies in this important area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East)</i>): Dental caries &mdash; tooth decay &mdash; are caused by a conjunction of three factors which are: tooth surface &mdash; dental enamel, refined carbohydrate in the diet and specific bacteria in the mouth.  Strategies to reduce the levels of dental caries in people of all ages consist of: fluoridation to strengthen tooth enamel, health promotion and education to reduce the intake and frequency of refined carbohydrate &mdash; sugars and correct techniques of tooth brushing and flossing to control the activities of the bacteria.</P>
      <P>All three strategies are supported and promoted by my Department with the support of the dental profession at home and worldwide and such bodies as the World Health Organisation, the United States Public Health Service, and the other professional and official authoritative organisations in the health field, representing governments, all the health professions and many others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great majority of Irish people have been consuming water fluoridation <Col N="1318" /> at about the optimal level of one part of fluoride per million parts of water for over 30 years.  This has proved not to pose any threat to their health, well-being and safety.  In this, Ireland is not unique.  The experience is exactly similar in all other countries which provide fluoridated public water supplies to their people.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness and safety of water fluoridation in reducing dental caries in Ireland has been factually shown by the results of the many scientific studies carried out at national, regional and local level.  Not only is it effective it is also most efficient, that is cost-effective, in reducing the levels of decay significantly at a very modest cost.  It has been shown repeatedly that water fluoridation is the most effective and cost effective safe method of reducing dental caries in the individual and in the community.</P>
    <P>In Ireland I do not accept that we dispose of industrial fluoride into drinking water.  We supplement the level of fluoride in public piped water supplies to the optimal level of one part per million by using fluoride which conforms to the strictest national and international specifications for this specific purpose. Ireland has some of the lowest levels of dental caries rates for developed countries and these low rates are due to our national scheme of water fluoridation. This scheme is the envy of many other countries which seek to learn from our experience in this area of health protection.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is that the afforestation grant scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has several environmental conditions attaching to it.  One of these is that all works grant-aided under the scheme must be compatible with protecting the environment.  The Forest Service requests the advice of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in relation to the environmental conditions.</P>
      <P>In relation to this particular development the NPWS has investigated the proposal and found that the land in question is upland blanket bog, the afforestation of which would seriously damage the ecology of the area.  The NPWS has transmitted this advice to the Forest Service.</P>

      <P>Since the establishment of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in January 1993 I have initiated two new grant schemes as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  Cultural Development Incentives Scheme 1994-99.

Is é cuspóir na scéim ná spreagadh a thabhairt do theaghlaigh Ghaeltachta, a bhfuil daltaí dá gcuid ag freastal scoile, chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa teaghlach agus sa phobal i gcoitinne.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that Ireland has the same level of representation on the key management committee for the EU Media II Programme 1996-2000 as other member states and that we are effectively and proportionally represented on this committee. Ireland's representation on the management committee comprises an official of my Department and a member of Bord Scannán na hÉireann/the Irish Film Board.</P>
      <P>In addition to the management committee, it has been decided to establish a jury procedure, made up of industry practitioners and drawn from the member states of the Union, which will advise the European Commission in the selection of projects for support under the programme.</P>
      <P>It has been decided that juries will not be standing committees but will be selected by the Commission for each task from national nominees and it is envisaged that there will be five or six members in each case.  While Ireland or indeed the other member states are not assured of representation on every jury, a commitment has been obtained from the Commission that there will be an equitable balance of geographical representation as between large and small member states of the Union in the composition of juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is in the process of finalising a comprehensive list, including professional profiles, of Irish experts for <Col N="1324" /> nomination to the juries, having consulted the Irish film and television production industry widely.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most effective means open to me and my Department to secure improved estate management is to encourage the implementation by local authorities of <Col N="1327" /> better management practices and to provide guidance and incentives to assist them to do so.  The following measures have, accordingly, been taken: local authorities have been required to adopt statements of policy on housing management, taking account of a guidance memorandum which highlighted areas of concern and specified matters which should be addressed, including measures to reduce crime and vandalism and to increase security for tenants; a new housing management grants scheme introduced in 1995 is designed to assist authorities to undertake pilot projects to improve housing management; 16 projects were approved under the scheme last year, 11 of which related to tenant training, and I recently announced a continuation of the scheme in 1996; a housing management group has been established with terms of reference which focus on critical areas in estate management; this will help to put the housing management practices of local authorities on a more professional footing.  In the preparation of its report, I have asked the group to consult widely to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to make their views known; the remedial works scheme, under which some £155 million has been allocated to local authorities, is being reviewed, in consultation with the authorities, to ensure that the objectives of the scheme, which include good estate management, are met.</P>
      <P>While good estate management practices by local authorities have an important role to play in overcoming anti-social behaviour on their estates, incidents of harassment and intimidation of families are primarily a matter for the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>Details of proposed expenditure within my Department for the current year, including expenditure on all grants and services, are contained in the <i>1996 Revised Estimates for Public Services.</i></P>
      <P>I understand, however, that the Deputy is seeking information on new grant schemes which I have implemented or approved since I came into office.  I have introduced a total of ten new grant schemes.  The details of the various new schemes are set out in the following schedule.</P>
      <P Just="Center">1993</P>
      <P>1.  A grant of £200 per pupil to help meet instruction non pay costs is paid in respect of junior education centres for travellers.  These centres cater for traveller children in the 12-15 age bracket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  I initiated the allocation of grants from the disadvantaged areas fund at primary level to alleviate the severe debt burden of some disadvantaged <Col N="1329" /> schools.  Such grants amounted to £221,307 in 1993, £341,831 in 1994 and £159,500 in 1995.  A total of 52 primary schools were assisted in this way.</P>
    <P Just="Center">1994</P>
    <P>3.  I approved a scheme to provide grant aid to potential medal winners to allow them to go into full-time training for the 1996 Olympic Games.  This scheme has cost £150,000 in each of the years 1994, 1995 and 1996.</P>
    <P>4.  I established the early start pre-school programme on a pilot basis in areas of high disadvantage to cater for children in the 3-4 age range.  The early start programme was expanded in September 1995, and a total of 40 disadvantaged national schools now have a pre-school service catering for 1,890 children. Grants paid to early start pre-schools amounted to £88,045 in 1994 and £408,300 in 1995.  These grants in 1995 comprised: start-up grant of £4,500 per pre-school unit; capitation grant of £65 per pupil; and grant for parental involvement of £1,500 per pre-school.</P>
    <P>5.  A once off grant of £36,000 was made available for the installation of telecommunication facilities to all island schools.  The objective of this grant was to provide telephones, fax facilities, modems, computers and printers, and thereby alleviate the sense of remoteness of these schools by providing up to date communication facilities.</P>
    <P Just="Center">1995</P>
    <P>6.  I made additional grants available for materials and equipment purchase for junior classes of primary schools which have early start pre-school projects at a rate of £1,500 per class and a total cost of £84,000.  A grant was also paid in 1995 to 38 disadvantaged primary schools at a rate of £3,000 per school for the purchase of computer equipment.</P>
    <P>7.  I allocated £150,000 for a pilot scheme of grant-aid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services.  Funding under the pilot scheme was allocated to special schools <Col N="1330" /> for physically handicapped children in respect of their daily transport routes and to provide assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for the hearing-impaired and visually-impaired who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.</P>
    <P>8.  To complement the existing Ón nGaeltacht and trí Ghaeilge scholarship schemes and to further promote education through Irish, I introduced a new third level scholarship scheme in the 1995-96 academic year.</P>
    <P>To encourage students to pursue second level education through Irish, 15 scholarships are awarded annually under this scheme based on the leaving certificate results.  Candidates eligible for consideration for this scholarship competition would be those who:</P>
    <P>(a)  had taken their second level education through Irish; and</P>
    <P>(b)  had taken their leaving certificate examination through Irish.</P>
    <P>Winners under this scholarship scheme are funded to pursue one undergraduate and one postgraduate course as approved under the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>9.  A scheme of grants towards the purchase of equipment for the use of pupils with a disability was introduced in second level schools.</P>
    <P>The objective of the scheme is to provide equipment of direct educational benefit for use in schools by pupils who have been diagnosed as having serious physical and-or communicative disabilities.</P>
    <P>Applications for grants with accompanying medical evidence are submitted by school management to the Department throughout the year.  The Department considers and processes the applications as they are received.</P>
    <P Just="Center">1996</P>
    <P>10.  Commencing in January 1997, each national school will receive an annual grant of £2,000 plus £9 per pupil <Col N="1331" /> to carry out minor improvements to school buildings and facilities.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will replace the existing centralised system whereby the schools applied to the Department for grants for individual projects.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 79 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The investigation by Price Waterhouse into the operation of the 1995 leaving certificate art examination has not been completed.</P>
      <P>The current position is that most of the fieldwork associated with this inquiry has been completed by Price Waterhouse and preparation of the report is at a very advanced stage.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the inquiry, it is essential that the principles of natural justice be fully complied with and the procedures being followed by Price Waterhouse are designed to ensure that this is the case.  The position in relation to the review of the appeals procedure is that aspects of this have been looked at in the context of the art inquiry.  Price Waterhouse intends to commence work on the more general areas of the review shortly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in order to fully secure public confidence in the 1996 examinations, I recently announced an interim package of priority measures designed to improve the operation of the 1996 leaving certificate examination.  These measures, which were discussed with Price Waterhouse, are in line with its thinking in preparing its report.</P>

      <P>As part of the ongoing inquiry into the operation of the 1995 leaving certificate art examination and at the request of Price Waterhouse, An Post was asked to assist in tracing a package of craftwork dispatched by post by the Ursuline College, Sligo.  An Post was given a copy of a certificate of posting which was supplied by the Ursuline College. This certificate contained a customer reference number and the address of the Department's examinations branch in Athlone.</P>
      <P>An Post has notified my Department that its records confirm receipt by it of an item addressed to the Department's examination branch.  An Post's records suggest that the customer reference in question was signed for by an employee of a company with premises in Sligo.  An Post has also indicated that there is no conclusive link between the signing of this customer reference and the actual receipt of the package originally posted by the Ursuline College.</P>
      <P>The information supplied by An Post has been communicated to Price Waterhouse so that it may be taken into account in the compilation of its report.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for his second year payment under the REP scheme.  However, under revised monitoring and control procedures implemented by my Department recently, compliance checks are required to ensure that farmers have completed the specific works outlined during the first year of the plan before second year payments can be made. This will lead to some delays but I am seeking to ensure that these are minimised.</P>

      <P>Details of my Department's three grant schemes are in the following schedule.</P>
      <P>Farm Electrification Grant Scheme (FEGS) &mdash; the farm electrification grant scheme is designed to subsidise the installation of electricity to farms which previously had no supply or where supply is inadequate in order to facilitate the development and modernisation of farms in disadvantaged areas of the country.  To qualify for the grant-aid, farming must be the applicant's main occupation and principal source of income and he/she must practice farming on land owned or held on long-term lease.  The scheme is operated jointly by the Department and the ESB.</P>
      <P>Energy Audit Grant Scheme (EAGC) &mdash; under this scheme, grants are provided to energy users in the industrial commercial and institutional sectors towards the cost of hiring consultants to conduct energy audits and to advise on the steps to be taken to improve energy efficiency.  The Irish Energy Centre operates the scheme on behalf of the Department.</P>
      <P>Energy Efficiency Investment Support Scheme (EEISS) &mdash; this scheme is designed to provide grant assistance to energy users in the industrial, commercial and institutional sectors for investment in energy efficiency technologies. The Irish Energy Centre operates the scheme on behalf of the Department.</P>

      <P>Most of the grant schemes for which my Department and agencies under its aegis are responsible are operated under various EU assisted programmes, measures and initiatives.</P>
      <P>Apart from matters relating to such funding, the only schemes which I have approved are: a £400,000 aid package for Pacific oyster growers and rope mussel producers to assist growers to replace lost seed and productive capacity following heavy mortalities due to the unusually hot weather and high seawater temperatures experienced in the summer of 1995, and a subsidy scheme for the shipboard training of Irish marine cadets, at Cork Regional Technical College, to become merchant marine engineers and deck officers and ratings.</P>
