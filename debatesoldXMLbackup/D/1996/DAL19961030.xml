      <P>It is proposed to take No. 29, Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1996, Second Stage; No. 7, motion for leave to introduce Supplementary Estimate [Vote 31]; No. 9, Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996 (from the Select Committee on Legislation and Security), order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 1, Universities Bill, 1996, order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Second Stage of No. 29 shall be decided without debate; No. 7 shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; the Report and Final Stages of No. 9 shall be taken today and, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. today by one Question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice; and Private Members' Business shall also be taken tomorrow between 12 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 34, motion 14 concerning toll roads.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with matters being agreed without debate.  However, why is a large Supplementary Estimate on agriculture being taken in October?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware there are particular problems in this sector relating to BSE, which have involved certain costs.  I suggest that any questions he or other Deputies wish to pose be addressed to the relevant Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 7 gives the House leave to introduce this Supplementary Estimate.  It is <Col N="1326" /> unusual to introduce such a large Supplementary Estimate at this time of year.  I read through it this morning and the majority of its provisions do not relate to the matter to which the Taoiseach referred.  Why is a Supplementary Estimate for agriculture being introduced at this stage, given that a nominal Supplementary Estimate for agriculture was introduced in May to provide assistance to the rendering industry?  This was in order because the industry is the subject of a new subhead.  However, the matter before us concerns a normal Supplementary Estimate being taken at the end of October.  Has the Government decided to bring forward into the 1996 accounts expenditure it hopes to incur in 1997?  What is the purpose of its introduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of introducing a Supplementary Estimate is to allow additional expenditure over and above that which was provided under the relevant heads in the original Estimate.  I am not prepared to provide a justification, subhead by subhead, for the individual additional demands in respect of particular heads concerning the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry because I was not briefed to do so.  I understand the Opposition agreed this matter would be decided without debate.  The Opposition had the option to have a debate wherein questions could be asked and answered about the provisions of the subheads of the Supplementary Estimate.  If such a debate is required, we can consider making time available. However, I understand the Opposition agreed to take the matter without debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Let us not debate this matter now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I only became aware of the Supplementary Estimate this morning and it is not a question of agreeing or disagreeing.  If it merely concerned BSE, I would be aware of the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate. However, it falls under a range of subheads which seem to involve expenditure brought forward from the 1997 figures into 1996.  Why is this Supplementary Estimate being introduced at the end of October, out of line with every other Department?  I am not opposing the Taoiseach but it is within my rights to inquire about a Supplementary Estimate for one Department with vague subheads, which seem to be linked to European moneys.  In the absence of a reply it seems expenditure which would normally have been incurred in 1997 has been brought forward because the Government has access to sufficient funding.  Perhaps our spokesperson at the relevant committee will discover the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in arranging a debate on this matter.  I understand there was agreement between the Government and Opposition Whips that it would be taken without debate.  Where there is agreement between the <Col N="1327" /> Whips that a matter be dealt with without debate, I cannot be expected to engage in a debate on the Order of Business and deal with the reasons a particular item of business is being brought forward.  I have no reason to believe that what Deputy Ahern said about this Supplementary Estimate is not correct.  Equally, I am unable to contradict what he said.  If we are to have a debate on this, it would have been better to have had that signalled in advance, when we could have arranged a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify a point.  As far as I was concerned, there was no agreement on this.  I asked for a copy of the Estimate which I received this morning.  It was as a result of that that our party leader raised the matter.  I did not agree to have it discussed without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding was that the matter had been agreed to, but I accept what the Deputy said.  This matter will now be referred to the relevant committee of the House where all questions Members wish to ask about this Supplementary Estimate can be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that questions have been raised and that there is no objection to this proposal.  I will put the question again, that the proposals for dealing with No. 7 be agreed to. Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 9 agreed to?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with Private Members' Business this evening agreed to?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that since the Central Statistics Office survey a few weeks ago, 10,000 people have signed off the live register and are waiting to see what action will be taken by the Department of Social Welfare.  As no guidelines have been issued to social welfare officers, does the Government intend to bring in any further legislation to deal with social welfare abuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No specific legislative proposal is being brought forward by the Department of Social Welfare in regard to this matter.  There is an intensification of efforts to eliminate social welfare fraud in the light of concerns expressed in the wake of the publication of reports on this matter.  The efforts of the Minister for Social Welfare are obviously meeting with success in that there has been a considerable reduction in the numbers signing on.  This is also linked to the fact that we have had a record level of employment creation and a record degree of employment opportunity for those who, hitherto, were on social welfare.  The fact that many more new jobs have been created than was the case two <Col N="1328" /> or three years ago also assists in reducing the level of employment benefit claims.</P>

      <P>When will we see the legislation providing for a food inspectorate, and will the food inspectorate take over functions of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of a board to deal with food standards is receiving priority attention from the Government.  The preparation of legislation was approved today, and drafting will be advanced on a priority basis.  At this stage I cannot give the precise date of the introduction of the legislation in the House.  However, consideration is being given to making interim non-statutory arrangements so that no time will be lost in taking the necessary measures, even in anticipation, as far as that is possible, of the passage of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business last week the Taoiseach mentioned, in response to questions on the third banking force and the disposal of the TSB, that legislation could be introduced.  Has the Taoiseach received any report from the meeting of the parliamentary Labour Party which will allow him to proceed in this regard?</P>

      <P>The Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is presently before the House and Report Stage will be taken next Wednesday.  Given that it is now generally agreed that the shares in Telecom Éireann have been sold off at a scandalously low price, and that the investors from overseas will have got back almost half of their money within the first six months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions on the matter were taken today.  I cannot give the Deputy a precise timetable.  However, this is an issue of high priority.  It is important that we have all the necessary arrangements in place to give assurances in regard to food quality and ensure that they are respected at every point in the food chain and that people can have the sense of confidence they need as consumers.  That is why the establishment of this board is being treated as a matter of priority by the Government.  I cannot say exactly when the board will be established.  It will be necessary to get a high quality board, to get people who are willing to serve and who represent all relevant interests in society, <Col N="1330" /> including, in particular, consumers.  We want to take the time necessary to get the best people we can to serve on the board.  That process of search is just starting.  I cannot say definitely when we will have all the people we need for the board. We will treat this as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>As part of the policy of openness, transparency and accountability, the Programme for Government promised to examine the possibility of legislation to enable journalists to protect the confidentiality of their sources in certain circumstances.  As the Taoiseach has more or less abandoned all the relevant Bills, when can we expect legislation on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is engaging in a selective presentation of the facts.  As the House is aware, the preparation of a freedom of information Bill is at an advanced stage.  Also, the Government is working on amendments to the Ministers and Secretaries Acts which will have a major effect in changing the structure of Government, making Government more accountable and more open, moving away from the doctrine that Ministers are individually and personally responsible for everything, and allowing more people to be accountable in regard to different aspects of public administration under their care.  So far as the question of the protection of sources is concerned I will make inquiries about that matter and will revert to the Deputy.</P>

Will he confirm that a subcommittee of the Higher Education Authority has been established to draft further amendments to the Bill?

      <P>Before we proceed I would remind Members, in accordance with recent modifications to our Standing Orders, that they may now speak twice to an amendment on Report Stage.  However, the second contribution shall not exceed two minutes.  The Member who moved the amendment retains his or her right of reply.  I invite Members to avail of that facility.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is consequential on amendment No. 8.  I suggest we discuss amendment Nos. 1 and 8 together if that is satisfactory and agreed?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 21, after &ldquo;PRISONS,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;AND TO CREATE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE OF SUPPLY OF CONTROLLED DRUGS FOR SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY REWARD&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of these amendments is to create a new criminal offence of the supply of a controlled drug or drugs for substantial monetary reward. The amendments put forward would provide for a minimum of 10 year sentences for drug pushers or dealers convicted of possession of drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more.  The object of the exercise is to ensure that people found in possession of vast quantities of drugs would have to explain precisely where they obtained these <Col N="1333" /> drugs or, more specifically, why they had this quantity of drugs in their possession.  If they are unable to establish to the satisfaction of the court that they did not have these illegal drugs for supply or sale they could be convicted of the offence of having in their possession drugs for substantial monetary reward in the sense that they would supply same to others.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the fact that there are sufficient sanctions in our criminal law to deal with this kind of offence.  As far back as 1977 there was recognition of the need to increase the penalty for those who were convicted of the sale or supply of drugs.  At that time that Oireachtas provided that a court could impose a sentence of up to 14 years for an offence such as this. Recognising that the situation was deteriorating further the Oireachtas in 1984 decided that the maximum sentence should be increased to life. The Oireachtas did not take that decision lightly but did so on the basis that there was a recognition that the problem was growing.  I submit that 12 years on, the problem has become serious.  In many parts of the country it is out of control.  There are too many dealers and pushers on the streets who often deal in drugs openly, which is a sad indictment of society.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with the imposition of sanctions is best illustrated by the statistics.  The intent of the Oireachtas in providing for a maximum life sentence does not appear to be recognised in the courts.  In 1993 &mdash; the last year for which statistics are available &mdash; 71 people were convicted of possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply.  The sentences of imprisonment imposed were as follows: three offenders received less than three months; six offenders received between three and six months; 20 offenders received between six and 12 months; 29 offenders received one to two years; four offenders received two to three years; five offenders received three to five years; three offenders received five to ten years and only one offender received over ten years. The figures indicate that the majority of convicted drug dealers receive prison sentences of less than two years.</P>
    <P>Given the misery caused by illegal drugs, to deal in these drugs is to deal in death. Accordingly, there is an onus on the Oireachtas to ensure the full rigour of the law will be brought to bear on those convicted of this heinous offence.  The reality is that this is not the case.  In the normal course of events I would not advocate minimum sentencing across a broad range of crimes.  However, I would move to close a loophole in this case.  If an individual deals in drugs for substantial monetary gain he or she should serve a considerable period in prison. Amendment No. 8 proposes that such an individual should spend 10 years in prison as a minimum.</P>
    <P>Unless this problem is contained in the immediate future it will continue to spread.  We will have the urbanisation, so to speak, of the heroin problem throughout the country, which <Col N="1334" /> will have catastrophic consequences for the future of society.  With these amendments the Oireachtas has the opportunity to send a clear message to those who might become involved in the destruction of young lives.  It has a unique opportunity to provide for a minimum sentence for drug pushers convicted of the possession of drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more.  Any individual in possession of such a quantity of drugs must have it in his or her possession for the purpose of supply.  If not the onus of proof should shift to the individual to establish the contrary.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 provides that a court would be entitled to hear in evidence the opinion of any garda or customs officer as to the street value of the controlled drug in question in any case, notwithstanding any rule of law or evidence to the contrary.  In this context, such opinion would be considered expert.  There should not be a prosecution under subsection (1) of the proposed section without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions and this is provided for in subsection (11).</P>
    <P>A further sanction is required for those convicted of dealing in drugs for substantial monetary gain.  Such people should not have the benefit of full temporary release from prison.  We must be serious about dealing with those who deal in drugs for substantial monetary gain and we must provide for a minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment for those convicted.  We must also provide that such individuals will not have the benefit of temporary release unless that release is for a humanitarian reason.  Such a provision would send a clear signal of our abhorrence of such an offence.  This offence must be treated with the seriousness it merits and this twin pronged proposal in the amendment strikes a reasonable balance.</P>
    <P>In the past the Government has put forward academic arguments against minimum sentencing.  The world of academia is often divorced from reality and while it makes a worthwhile contribution to society it is not appropriate to arguments on this most serious problem.  The Oireachtas has the opportunity to respond positively to an urgent and serious problem.  I earnestly request the full support of the House across the political spectrum for this amendment.  There is no point in saying there will be a relentless fight against the scourge of drugs and drug dealing if we are not prepared to put our votes where our mouths are.  There is no point in Members railing against drug pushers and drug barons in the House or on radio unless they are prepared to vote in accordance with their convictions, as expressed.  This amendment gives Deputies the opportunity to express in a tangible way their extremely serious concern about a problem which is getting worse every day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for his comments. Amendments Nos. 1 and 8 were also tabled on Committee Stage.  The Deputy, in his resilient <Col N="1335" /> way, also tabled similar amendments to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act.  The purpose of the amendments is to provide for a mandatory sentence of ten years for persons convicted of possession of drugs with a monetary value of more than £10,000.</P>
      <P>Successive Ministers for Justice have generally opposed mandatory sentencing on the grounds that it is more appropriate for the Oireachtas to provide for maximum penalties and for the court, having heard all the evidence, to impose an appropriate sentence up to the maximum limit.  It is open to the courts in serious drug trafficking cases to impose a penalty of up to life imprisonment.  In a recent case a severe sentence was imposed on a major drug trafficker.  There is also provision in law for an appeal to be made against unduly lenient sentences.  I am not aware of any appeals against the type of sentences referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am not saying this because of some academic argument but because I am saying it because we all want to protect the independence of the Judiciary in terms of the way in which each case is handled and to leave it to judges, having heard the full circumstances of the case, to decide the appropriate penalty.  This is a good policy and I hope we will never reach the stage where we tie the hands of the Judiciary or remove some of its independence.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken many steps to curb this growing problem which is a matter of huge concern to everybody.  It has taken adequate and unprecedented steps to tackle the problem on the supply side, for example, through the introduction of seven day detention and changes in the law to ensure that drug traffickers cannot accumulate assets etc.  It also recently published a major report on the demand side which will be debated tomorrow.  There is no point in pretending we will solve the problem of drugs by locking up every drug addict.  We will only solve it by reducing the demand and educating eight and nine year old children on the dangers of drugs.  The Government is approaching the issue of drug taking, drug abuse and drug trafficking on the supply and demand side.  I refute the implication in the Deputy's comments that unless we impose mandatory sentencing we will not give a strong message to drug dealers that they cannot continue to peddle misery and death to young and not so young people.</P>
      <P>While I understand the purpose of the amendment is to send another message to those involved in drugs, this is not the way to deal with the issue.  The Law Reform Commission's recently published report addresses the issues of minimum and mandatory sentencing.  I am considering the report which I hope will give me and all Members an opportunity to examine the pros and cons of the action taken to deal with this issue.  In these circumstances it would not be correct to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported this amendment on Committee Stage.  I wish to raise again with the Minister the facility on our Statute Book whereby the State can appeal a lenient sentence.  If I recall correctly from replies to questions to the Minister, this facility has been used in only one or two cases since its inception.  Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment highlights the fact that while the courts have the capacity to impose strict and long sentences up to 14 years and life imprisonment for drug related offences, the empirical evidence from the courts is that the majority of sentences handed down are for two and three years.  This is a problem.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the extent to which the capacity of the State to appeal against such lenient sentences is used?  This facility would be a good mechanism for addressing this deficiency in the courts.  Is it a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal a lenient sentence handed down by the courts for a drug related offence?  It is ridiculous to put laws on the Statute Book and not use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is the prerogative of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and not that of the Minister, to appeal these matters. However, the points made by Deputy O'Donnell are correct in that there seems to be a general unwillingness by the Oireachtas to send a clear message to the Judiciary as to what this Legislature wants done by way of a punitive regime in respect of serious crimes.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Law Reform Commission's report on sentencing.  I wrote a few words on the subject in the media and while I did not deal with this proposition I want to make clear where I stand on it.  On the issue of a mandatory life sentence for murder, I totally reject the Law Reform Commission's arguments. It is open to the Oireachtas to provide the penalty for murder, and the public demands a life sentence for murderers.  If anything, the public is dissatisfied at the extent to which the Executive in general terms uses remission, full temporary release and the like to water down and dilute the effect of the mandatory sentence for life prisoners.</P>
      <P>I have never heard any significant body of people, except those whom Deputy O'Donoghue referred to as the occupants of the groves of academe, propose that there should be murders for which lesser penalties of five, ten or 15 years should be handed down by the Judiciary.  I do not agree with the proposition enunciated by the minority in the Law Reform Commission that sentencing is a type of scientific art where one effectively engages in a rehabilitative treatment programme with the accused and that is the purpose of sentencing.  At the very least, the just desserts theory proposed by the majority in the Law Reform Commission is the way we should proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments against minimum sentencing do not stand up to scrutiny.  The public demand a <Col N="1337" /> minimum sentence of life imprisonment for murder and it will not accept anything less. People in the Law Reform Commission, universities or civil liberty organisations who believe that anything less would be acceptable to the public are deluding themselves.  The public want a mandatory life sentence for murder.  They stood by the mandatory disqualification from driving of people convicted of drunk driving. Those of us involved in such cases may sometimes believe it is harsh for a person who is two degrees above the relative limit to lose his or her licence. The reason mandatory provisions were inserted in the liquor licensing laws in respect of the number of convictions one may have before losing a licence &mdash; although that is not a very auspicious example as it is rarely put into operation &mdash; the reason there is a mandatory life sentence for murder and the reason one is automatically disqualified from driving for 12 months if caught driving while drunk is that the public want to direct the Judiciary on what it must do in certain circumstances.  In a democracy they have the right to do so.  I do not believe in the crude American approach of three strikes and one is out.  I do not believe it would be in the interests of justice for this House to set exact tariffs on which everybody must be judged in respect of all offences.  The quality of mercy must always be an element in justice and individual cases must be decided by reference to their facts. However, other considerations, such as public dissatisfaction with the sentences imposed by the courts, must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Apart from making a speech in this House there is no way of conveying the notion to the Judiciary that supplying drugs to others should carry a heavier sentence than the three year average, or even lesser sentences for other offences.  If a judge imposed a two year sentence on a person caught with £100,000 worth of heroin we would be told by the Chair that it is not our business to criticise judgments because of the tradition in this House to respect the independence of the Judiciary.  In a constitutional democracy, whose right is it to determine in the final analysis the span of sentences that should apply to particular cases?  It is the people's right, not the right of the Judiciary.  It is a conceit on the part of the Judiciary to believe its right to administer justice allows it to decide on a range of penalties from zero to life imprisonment for, say, drug pushing.  Some members of the Judiciary believe that because their independence is guaranteed under the Constitution they must have a free hand to act in all cases in accordance with what they consider to be justice.  That is not the law or the constitutional basis of matters. They take the law as they find it and it is the law of the land they declare themselves bound to uphold.  It is open to a constitutional democracy to oppose minimum sentences in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment has a great deal of merit, not merely because it is well drafted <Col N="1338" /> but because it is not necessarily the case that an individual caught with a drugs haul worth more than £10,000 would be prosecuted under this section.  There might be some residual discretion given to the Director of Public Prosecutions to use the provisions of section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act in a particular case and to ignore the £10,000 value of the haul for certain reasons, including plea bargaining in return for evidence against others.  There should be an unequivocal element of Irish statutes which makes it clear that Ireland is no longer a pushover for drug pushers, especially foreigners who come to our shores with drugs in their possession, and that there are certain circumstances in which the Oireachtas lays down to the Judiciary that if these people are prosecuted and found guilty on cogent evidence beyond reasonable doubt they are put away for a minimum period of ten years.  That is a perfectly reasonable law in such circumstances.  It is also perfectly reasonable to impose a life sentence on those convicted of murder.  If it is legitimate to impose a mandatory sentence for murder, it must be legitimate, in theory at least, for the Oireachtas to lay down lesser minimum sentences for offences society believes are sufficiently grave to warrant them.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting there should be a system under which the Oireachtas should administer justice by laying down a huge menu of tariffs or usurping the role of the Judiciary, but it could create an offence for which there is a minimum penalty.  In this case Deputy O'Donoghue wins the argument because he is referring to a serious offence which threatens the very fabric of our community.  His proposal is not ill-considered or an ill-judged intemperate response to a matter; it is well measured.  He proposes that the Director of Public Prosecutions, in serious cases of drug pushing, should be entitled to go before a court and prove that the offence lies within a certain category and demand a minimum sentence of ten years for the pusher.  There is nothing undemocratic, unjust or invasive of the independent role of the Judiciary in providing for such a regime in such circumstances.  It would have only beneficial consequences.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice takes the view that traditionally minimum sentences have not been a part of Irish jurisprudence.  They have not, but they are there for murder, capital murder and certain other cases where the Oireachtas has found it necessary to lay down minimum sentences to get a message across to the Judiciary that if people commit such offences there are certain consequences which follow as a matter of law, not as a matter of discretion.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment. The Minister's response to it is somewhat patronising and banal.  Deputy O'Donoghue is not proposing this as a piece of tabloid, reactionary, knee-jerk headline grabbing politics. He suggests that there are certain categories of offences for which it should be within the remit of the prosecuting authority to establish certain <Col N="1339" /> facts which bring with them certain minimum consequences for those convicted in due course of law.  There is nothing wrong with that in principle and some phoney doctrine of noninterference with the independence of the Judiciary should not stand between us doing what we believe is right and what we consider to be our duty in this House in these circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally support the sentiments of previous speakers and the motivation behind Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment.  Apart from the fact that most of the main drug barons have not been caught or charged, the single greatest encouragement to drug dealers is that when lesser drug dealers are charged and dealt with in the courts they are dealt with leniently.  This is highlighted in statistics presented in reply to various Dáil questions which state that the average sentence for drug dealing is two to three years.  There is no distinction between heroin dealing and murder.  I have attended the funerals of too many young people who died from using adulterated heroin. The individuals who live off that misery and destruction of life are similar to murderers.  A serious attitude should be taken by everyone concerned about heroin, especially the courts.  I have watched many trials before the courts and that has not been my experience.  The one exception was an individual who had already served ten years and had been released.  He was caught again on three or four occasions and got a longer sentence.</P>
      <P>I drew attention to one case in my area where a significant heroin dealer was caught.  He was able to afford one of the most expensive legal teams in the State to defend him although he did not have any source of income.  He got a suspended sentence on the basis that the onus was on the prosecution to prove that he did not have the heroin for his own use.  He never used heroin but he got off because of the expertise of the legal people he was able to afford.  That happened in the past year and since then he has been caught again with a greater amount of heroin.  I have no doubt he is confident that he will beat the rap a second time.  I hope he does not and that one or two reasonably significant heroin dealers from the centre of Dublin who will be before the courts do not get the type of sentence that others similar to them have.  I regret that they may end up getting a six year sentence reduced to three and a half years because they come from a respectable background or have not appeared before the courts before.  They have not appeared before the courts because they have never been caught, but they have wreaked havoc in communities in this city and caused spin-off crimes such as attacks on people by addicts desperate to get money to buy heroin from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Judiciary is out of touch with the gravity of heroin dealing so there is an onus on us to send <Col N="1340" /> out a message that we want this problem taken seriously.  We want sentences of at least ten years for heroin dealing.  It greatly encourages drug dealers to see that those who are caught and appear before the courts get lenient sentences. Examples have been seen in recent weeks of the money that some of them are making.  It becomes worth the risk because of the huge financial gain. Which one of them would not risk two or three years in prison to make that money?  It is not a deterrent but an encouragement to continue and until that changes more people will get involved in drug dealing and take that worthwhile risk.</P>
    <P>I was in this House in 1984 when life sentences were introduced for drug dealers.  It was a big deal at the time and successive Ministers told us that drug dealing had the highest priority.  Has any drug dealer been given a life sentence?  No. Drugs are destroying parts of our capital and the Judiciary is not in touch with that.  One has to legislate based on what has happened, not on what we would like to see.  With one or two exceptions people dealing in heroin are not being dealt with in court with the severity that crime deserves.  Nine times out of ten the severity of the sentence is based on the value of the drug seized. In high profile cases where the Garda captured a yacht loaded with cannabis severe sentences of up to 12 years have been handed down, but when a heroin dealer who is killing people in Dublin is brought before the courts a different attitude is taken.  On average a sentence of two and a half years to three and a half years is given to people who are killing young people or destroying their youth.</P>
    <P>As long as that happens we will not get near to countering the development of drug dealing.  I do not know how the Minister intends to approach this problem but it needs to be addressed because these people make far too much money and are escaping detection.  I told the Minister when others were attacking and criticising her that I would judge her at the end of her term in office if people like the Boxer, the Footballer and the Psycho and others given names by the media were still driving around this city in their fast cars and taking foreign holidays, as they still are. Some of them have taken off to Amsterdam and England while the heat is on.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that the Garda are making great inroads against another major drug trafficker.  I hope they pursue the others in the same way but that has not yet happened.  These people feel they are above the law.  When their middle level operators and organisers are caught they get miserable two year sentences.  I support Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment in so far as it relates to heroin but as it is a blanket amendment I am not entirely happy with it.  It is necessary to get a message out that anyone who deals in heroin and threatens the lives of young people and is caught will go down for at least ten years. It is one aspect of dealing with the problem.  I am well aware of the need for treatment facilities, that heroin is associated with poverty and social <Col N="1341" /> deprivation and that there is a range of other matters that must be dealt with, but as long as heroin is freely available in any community young people will be vulnerable to abusing it and suffering dreadfully as a result.  The problem must also be dealt with effectively from a law and order angle.  Based on experience to date, the only way to do that is in the manner suggested by Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is frightening on occasion to read in the newspaper the sentences handed down by some of our learned judges to those arrested and charged with being in possession of drugs, particularly heroin.  Some members of the Judiciary appear to some extent to be woolly in their thinking when it comes it comes to sentencing major drug dealers.  I made that point recently when known drug dealers were handed down a strange sentence, a jail sentence followed by a sentence in Coolmine Therapeutic Community.  Such sentences do not seem logical and I challenge the thinking of the judges who make them.  Will the Minister confirm if sentencing policy can consist of a three and a half years' jail sentence followed by 12 months in Coolmine Therapeutic Community, if a judge can sentence an offender to serve the first three and a half years of a seven year sentence followed by participation in a drug detoxification programme in the Drug Treatment Centre Board or request the offender to report to the Cherry Orchard centre for drug addicts run by the Eastern Health Board?  There is no logic to sentencing a heroin dealer to such a sentence.  What are the sentences handed down by those judges saying about our prisons?  Such judges sentence drug offenders to serve three and a half years of a seven year sentence after which time the offender will need to be rehabilitated to come off drugs.  The logic of the sentencing policy implemented by a number of judges in the recent past is that drug offenders sentenced to imprisonment in Mountjoy Jail will need to attend a drug treatment centre after their release.  That is proven by such offenders being sentenced to participate in a drugs treatment course in Coolmine Therapeutic Community on their release.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be realistic, but it is a poor reflection of our prison system that we are sentencing offenders to serve time in prison, who on their release, are deemed to be in need of detoxification and rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>What annoys most people in the communities devastated by drug dealing and addiction is the person who grew up in the ghetto and moved out of it a wealthy man.  He may have moved less than half a mile away, bought a site and built a house worth £300,000, never having worked a day in his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> I will support the position adopted by the Minister if this amendment is put to a vote. Rather than a compulsory ten years' sentence being automatically handed down to an offender, the electorate, particularly those living in poverty and suffering from the effects of a major drugs climate, would be more impressed if drug offenders were stripped of their assets.  The Minister should direct judges on sentencing policy.  Rather than suggesting that a person, say, from Harold's Cross, who has a tyre and car showrooms business and is arrested for being in possession of cocaine worth £100,000, might need treatment for 12 months in Coolmine, it would be better if sentence were duly passed and the person's assets seized.  That would go a long way to rebuild confidence in the Garda Síochána, the Judiciary, politicians and politics.  Such assets could include expensive houses built by such offenders or a car showrooms business.</P>
    <P>Mandatory sentencing across the board tends to be the subject of academic debate, but there are valid reasons for having reservations about it. I remember a tragic case of an Irish woman who fell in love with a Palestinian Arab who placed a bomb in her luggage and sent her on an aircraft. Luckily the security forces detected the bomb in her luggage.  That Arab intended to kill her and all passengers on board that plane.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should bear with me while I draw a comparison.  The sad reality of those engaged in the drug culture, dealing in, abusing or addicted to drugs, is that it is extremely easy for clever manipulative drug barons, dealers or pushers to viciously exploit relatively young innocent people.  They use such people to carry material from Great Britain to Ireland on the ferries and to carry heroin and other substances in here from mainland Europe. Many of the carriers are totally innocent in terms of their relationship with those who are exploiting them.  It is not difficult to imagine cases where people unsuspectingly carry goods across Europe to a port here on behalf of an unscrupulous gangster who exploits their innocence. Cognisance must be taken in law of unusual cases that come before the courts.  Some individuals, many unknowingly, are viciously exploited.  If a mandatory sentencing policy of ten years is implemented, it will result in those individuals being sent down as well as drug offenders.  We have read time and again that judges when handing down a relatively lenient sentence often proclaim in open court that the real culprits are not before them and they wish they were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what was said today and much of it was said during other debates in this House.  Valid concerns and worries were expressed about sentencing policy.  I clarify that I cannot give directions to judges.  The <Col N="1343" /> directions the Oireachtas gives to judges are the laws we pass and judges implement them as they see fit when they take each case.</P>
      <P>Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, the Oireachtas wanted consecutive sentences to be imposed but when such sentences are handed down all but one are suspended.  As I indicated, I intend to strengthen that section of the Act to ensure the wishes of the Oireachtas are plain to see.  I cannot comment on what an individual judge does or says in a court case, any more than Members can outside this House.  I listened with interest to the critical comments on judges and I am sure Members have ways of letting people know what they say here.  As Deputy McDowell said, I have no power to direct the DPP to exercise his power to appeal sentences, even if I consider them lenient.  Under the 1993 Act that is exclusively a matter for the DPP.  However, I will indicate to him the tenor of this debate because I am not restricted in that regard as I am with judges.</P>
      <P>There has been a wide-ranging discussion about mandatory sentences.  When the Law Reform Commission report was published I said that while I respected the commission's views, which led to its conclusion that there should be a mandatory life sentence for murder and a minimum 40 year sentence for the murder of a garda, there were cogent arguments for maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> That indicated what I thought of that element of the report.  I believe there is a need for a more constructive debate on sentencing in general.  That is why, with full understanding and without being banal, I believe there is a case for looking at sentencing in its entirely on foot of the commission's report.  I will take on board what has been said when we return to that debate.  However, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>In case there is any confusion, subsection (11) of the amendment provides that no prosecution can be commenced under the section without the consent of the DPP. Even when the section is invoked there is nothing to prevent the court imposing a sentence of greater than ten years.  The Law Reform Commission report on sentencing, referred to by the Minister, does not give great cause for optimism on the question of whether minimum sentences should be applicable, because it comes down in favour of one side of the argument.  As Deputy McDowell said, it goes as far as to say there should not be a mandatory sentence for murder and judges should have discretion. Society would not agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is certain that this House has the power to provide that there should be minimum sentences. There is a provision in criminal law whereby an individual convicted of murder must receive a life sentence.  In the same way, if an individual is found guilty of murdering a member of the Garda <Col N="1344" /> Síochána, he must receive a minimum sentence of 40 years imprisonment.  Why is that the case? Is it that judges are not to be trusted?  I submit that this is not the reason.  These provisions and others of a more minor nature exist because this House, representing as it does the broad mass of the people, wishes to reflect its abhorrence of certain offences and the only cogent, clear way it can do so is to provide for a minimum sentence.</P>
    <P>The only argument left is as to whether the offence of possession of illegal drugs to achieve substantial monetary gain should or should not be an offence attracting a minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.  I argue that it should but the Minister and the Government say it should not.  With the greatest possible degree of respect, they were entirely out of touch with our serious crime problem for a long period and they are equally so in this regard.  If, as Deputy Byrne says, the Judiciary is out of touch also, it is the duty of this House to put judges back in touch.  I am not here to engage in vituperative criticism of the Judiciary, which has largely done an excellent job. However, there are occasions when this House must exercise its authority.</P>
    <P>One may ask whether imposing a minimum sentence will work or has worked in the past but it appears that certain draconian measures passed by the House have worked.  In the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 the House provided for consecutive sentences for people who committed offences while on bail.  There was a discernible drop in the number of such offences until the criminal community received the message that one might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb &mdash; that is, the courts were interpreting a consecutive sentence to mean a consecutive suspended sentence and would insist that the totality of the offence be reflected in the totality of the sanction.  That was known as the totality principle.  Once criminals received this message, there was an immediate increase in the number of crimes committed by people on bail and the figures have crept higher, from approximately 2,500 recorded in 1990 to 5,500 in 1995.  That speaks for itself.  Deterrents work and society has the right to put severe deterrents in place in order to protect itself &mdash; in this instance, to protect its very fabric.</P>

      <Quest>if it is the Government's intention that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation should resume its deliberations if there is a renewal of the IRA's August 1994 ceasefire.</Quest>

      <P>It is a matter for the participants to determine, by agreement, any future role for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  The primary axis of progress is the multi-party talks.  The Government remains open, however, to any role for the forum that might seem appropriate as the situation evolves, following an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that one of the benefits of the forum would be that in the event of a ceasefire Sinn Féin could immediately resume dealings with political parties North and South?  Will he agree the only alternative to violence is participation in political dialogue?  How can we hope to persuade people to give up violence for good if it is clear that others reserve the right to block the path to dialogue for an indefinite period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first and second parts of the question is yes.  There is a clear statement in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules which determine eligibility to participate in talks and as long as those paragraphs are complied with there is no bar to the participation of any party in the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach has the benefit of the discussions last evening.  I note a Government spokesperson stated there was agreement by the British Prime Minister, Sir Patrick Mayhew and others with the Government's position on the talks, but that does not seem to be the case from public comments. Maybe the private position is different.  Is it the case that the British Government is still reluctant to agree to the ground rules as stated and that it has not made clear what would happen in the event of renewal of the ceasefire?  Would Sinn Féin be allowed take up its position in talks?  It is certainly not clear in the public domain that that would be the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 8 of the ground rules states that for parties to participate in the talks they must establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and have shown that they abide by the democratic process.  Paragraph 9 refers to, in the case of Sinn Féin, the requirement of an IRA ceasefire.  It is necessary for both those paragraphs to be complied with for a party to take part in the talks.  For the sake of clarification, <Col N="1346" /> the discussions I had with the British Prime Minister were on Saturday; the only meeting I had last evening was with Chairman Arafat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that if there was a renewal of the IRA ceasefire Sinn Féin would be allowed to make political progress instantly and that within a short period it would be able to take up its position in the talks?  From a number of statements by Sir Patrick Mayhew and the British Prime Minister since I raised this matter two weeks ago in the House it appears they are not answering the question.  Neither are the questions being answered in other contacts.</P>
      <P>The position seems to be that if there were a ceasefire the British Government would still seek a period &mdash; I do not know what that period would be &mdash; before Sinn Féin could take its place in the talks.  Perhaps the British Government would not dissuade others from rerunning the same story that happened before so that we would be in precisely the same position as we were in the autumn-spring of 1994-5 and Sinn Féin would not be able to take its place in all-party all-inclusive talks.  From the Taoiseach's contacts with the British Prime Minister at the weekend, is he satisfied &mdash; the Government spokesperson said last night there is agreement on this issue &mdash; the British Government will allow Sinn Féin to take part in all-party talks as soon as the IRA calls a ceasefire?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, for Sinn Féin to participate in the talks it must comply with paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules.  It must show that its commitment to democratic politics is real and establish that it is committed to exclusively peaceful methods &mdash; that excludes the possibility of using other than political methods to achieve its objectives.  It must demonstrate that that is the case.  As I said in response to lengthy questioning from the Deputy the last day, Sinn Féin must find a way to demonstrate to others its commitment to paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules.  It is important to repeat that any ceasefire must be credible, it cannot be a tactical ceasefire to achieve a short-term purpose.  There must be a credible, unequivocal commitment to exclusively democratic political methods &mdash;&ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; means that all other methods are excluded.</P>

      <P>On the Taoiseach's statement about the preconditions relating to a resumption of activities of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the requirement that everyone should demonstrate their compliance with paragraphs 8 and 9, will he agree that one of the elements in showing an exclusive commitment to peaceful means is a clear indication of the end of punishment beatings? Will he agree that whatever formula is used &mdash; perhaps it is better not to use exact words &mdash; the sense of any ceasefire will have to be that violence is over for good in layman's terms?  Will he also agree that the notion of a limited lifespan for the talks should not in any circumstances be seen as a mandate thereafter to return to violence should the talks fail?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy in respect of all three propositions.  Plainly, the Mitchell principles are in the same sense as the three questions put by the Deputy.  The Mitchell principles clearly indicate that one will accept the result of any negotiations and not seek to use violent methods to overturn it.  They also exclude punishment beatings.  I have no difficulty, therefore, in agreeing with the points made by the Deputy.  Naturally, I prefer to use my own words in matters of this seriousness but I can see no particular reason to disagree with anything the Deputy said.</P>

      <P>The forum was operating when the IRA was not killing people.  It has recommenced killing people.  The situation, therefore, so far as the forum is concerned, has changed.  When the IRA recommenced its campaign I made it clear that political contacts with Sinn Féin would cease so far as the Government was concerned.  That remains the case.  However, I decided that we would not close off an official channel.  Deputy Harney questioned me about this some time ago and I made it clear that this official channel was to be used solely for the purpose of determining whether a credible, non-tactical ceasefire could be obtained, not for any general discussion.  I set this out in some detail in this House and I am repeating what I said then.  I am not aware of any difficulty so far as television appearances are concerned.  They do not fall into the category of meetings.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The text of the speech I made at the opening of the discussions on a new national programme has been laid before both Houses.  That statement dealt with the Government priorities for a new programme in the context of the world we will face in the years ahead.  These were the themes I also addressed in my remarks to the IMI conference at a broader level.</P>
      <P>I was pleased with the outcome of last Wednesday's process.  Some 19 organisations &mdash; the widest ever forum of national organisations brought together to discuss economic and social policy &mdash; availed of the opportunity to set out their priorities for a new national programme. Organisations representing trade unions, employers, farmers, the business sector, the unemployed, the voluntary and community sectors, all made valuable and positive contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> It is clear that the participants support the objective of developing a new national programme and value the opportunity to participate in the discussions.  It is now proposed to hold a series of bilateral and multilateral meetings with these organisations to continue the discussions on the structure and content of a new programme.  The discussions will be based on the priorities set down by the Government and the other participating organisations and will draw on the NESF opinion on a new national programme and on the recently published NESC conclusions and recommendations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general rule, the benefits of tax cuts are felt by everybody who is a taxpayer whereas the benefits of nominal increases in pay are confined to those who receive them.  The more universal the benefit conferred the better, as a general proposition, but as I explained in my address to the social partners, there is a trade-off between the scope for tax reductions and the scope for maintaining or increasing public expenditure programmes to do such things as reducing hospital waiting lists, school class sizes and so forth.  It is important that all the social partners should give their views on where the appropriate balance should be struck between these various and necessarily conflicting demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in regard to public expenditure increases over the next three years will be set out in the Book of Estimates when published.  This year the Government will be producing Estimates of expenditure not just for next year but for a three year timeframe which will, broadly speaking, coincide with the likely period of a new programme, if there is one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the level of wage increases will be provided for in the Estimates which will be published before the programme is concluded or will the level of wage increases be excluded?  Will the Taoiseach agree it would be much more intelligent in all of these circumstances to simply guarantee that over the life of the agreement the real value of public sector pay will be maintained by the State, and to concentrate on achieving tax equity by applying the fruits of economic growth, in fiscal terms, to reducing the tax burden, especially of those at the lower end of the earnings scale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that public expenditure has to be set in nominal rather than in real terms.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Deputy is asking and I am keen to answer his question.  The Government will set out the public expenditure levels in global terms for three years.  These will obviously have to contain assumptions about pay. We hope the agreement will be concluded early in which case it will be possible to include in those assumptions definite provisions in regard to agreed pay increases.  If, however, the negotiations are not concluded it will be necessary to publish provisional figures and to make any adjustments that may be required subsequently if the agreement involves having to make either a lesser or a greater provision for pay.  It would be preferable if we could agree on the pay levels first and then be in a position to publish our Estimates for the three years on the basis of well-founded assumptions about pay developments in the public sector.</P>

      <P>The director general of IBEC said yesterday that public spending was now out of control given that it is running at more than three times the rate of inflation.  Does the Taoiseach believe that comment will make it much more difficult to negotiate reasonable tax deductions as part of the national programme? Given that the Taoiseach has lost control of public spending, will it be much more difficult for him to reach agreement in the talks?</P>

      <P>If my memory does not fail me, and I do not think it does in this instance, public expenditure was running at more than three times inflation when Deputy Brennan last sat at the Cabinet table, but that is obviously not well remembered either by him or by the general public.  The Government had to make additional provisions this year in regard to BSE, both in terms of the cost of Border invigilation and compensation for producers, an issue I doubt Deputy Brennan would oppose.  Also, the Government has made additional public expenditure provisions this year over and above budget to finance the anti-crime package, which again Deputy Brennan would be loath to be seen to oppose.</P>

      <P>The programmes agreed in the past ten years were economic programmes.  They did not simply deal with pay and public expenditure but with the position on the national debt, the Exchequer borrowing requirement and our objectives in regard to economic growth and public expenditure.  Will the same parameters be used in putting together the framework for operating this programme?  My question No. 5 refers to this but the Taoiseach did not answer it in his reply.  How will the NESC and the NESF reports be presented?  They are not necessarily similar reports &mdash; the NESF is correctly focusing on the issue of long-term unemployment.  How will that be built into the structure for dealing with the report?  It is not clear from the various speeches made on the day of the launch to which, regrettably, I was not invited as an interested party, which Minister will be responsible for answering questions on the programme.  In regard to the last three programmes a particular Minister was responsible for answering questions in this House covering various issues concerning the programme.  For two of those programmes the Minister for Labour was responsible while the Minister for Finance had responsibility in regard to the other programme.  If a Minister is not given responsibility in this regard, questions will have to be put down to the various Ministers.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House who will take the lead position in Government for the programme?</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  In so far as the second part of the Deputy's question is concerned, the two reports have been tabled for all the participants to examine as part of their consultative process.  Meetings are currently taking place with the relevant social partners and obviously the contents of the NESF and the NESC reports will be part of the agenda for those discussions.  To answer the third part of the Deputy's question, the responsibility for social partnership in general as an overall Government programme rests with me.  As far as pay negotiations are concerned, the lead Minister is the Minister for Finance, and in regard to departmental responses to programme requirements, those will be the responsibility of the relevant Ministers.</P>

      <P>I said gender equality requires continued advances for women but it also involves a major change in the job prospects and social role of men, an issue that has not yet been addressed in a serious way.  This challenge is most acutely felt by those young men who do not have internationally mobile skills and for whom the traditional roles in society are now less open than they were for preceding generations.  I am glad the Deputy has asked about this because there are two genders, male and female and the changes in our society affect both of them.  It is important that we recognise that many difficulties are currently being faced by young men in society.  For example, 75 per cent of drug abusers are young men; five times as many young men as young females are found to be offenders; and there is 50 per cent more unemployment among young men than among young women.  I think it is also true that young women do better in examinations.  Because their traditional role in society has involved constant change as they adapt to new challenges, they have less hierarchical and less fixed ideas about what they will do in their lives.  They are more adaptable to the challenges of modern society.</P>

They do not have the flexibility or adaptability which many young women have acquired through the educational system and many of the things which have happened in their lives fit them well for the challenges of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important we should recognise that the changes which are occurring in the world involve major changes for men, and young men in particular, in regard to their expectations of life.  That was the point I was making and it has considerable social consequences for the future.  It is something which ought to be addressed in a reasonable way. It is not a matter to be either the subject of dismissive comment or reacted to in a way which does not take account of the reality that the <Col N="1354" /> challenges of modern society are ones which certainly affect women but also affect men, particularly, men who have failed to take up sufficiently the opportunities which education has provided for them and who are less adapted to the challenges of the modern world.</P>

However, it is important to recognise also that problems are experienced not just by those who occupy or aspire to senior positions in society.  There are problems faced by young men and women at other levels.  It is important to bear in mind that there are 33,000 unemployed young men under the age of 25.  That is a concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks at the leaving certificate results, women are doing considerably better in virtually <Col N="1355" /> all subjects because they are probably working harder than young men and we need to find out why that is the case.

These are issues of gender policy which need to be looked at because there are differences in the performances of men and women in society.</P>
      <P>That is not to say that any of the policies which are there to support and enhance the role of women need to be changed; indeed, they need to be strengthened and improved.  We also need to look at other problems in a total and holistic way which genuinely faces the problems as they exist rather than in some idealised version of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that any new programme should cover the wide area of social policy.  One of the reasons this Government and the previous Government put so much emphasis on, for example, the development of local partnerships, particularly in local areas of concentrated deprivation, is to recognise that these sorts of problems exist.  There is a particular problem of young unemployed males who do not have the required qualifications and need extra assistance.  I have been saying as I meet those involved in local partnerships that they need to look at these issues and advise the Government on how it can deal more effectively with them.  I hope the process of social partnership, which is being launched in the current negotiations, will not be confined solely to issues of pay but will look at these wider social questions and, in a consensual way, seek solutions to them without in any way threatening any existing achievements. It must recognise there are many challenges which remain to be overcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the reasons more of the additional jobs being created are going to women, but it is also the case that women probably choose better preparation for the sort of work available.  A study undertaken in Europe indicates that 70 per cent of the new jobs in Europe over the next ten years are expected to go to women, not solely because of educational performance but because women have prepared themselves wisely for the areas where additional job creation is occurring in the financial services sector, the health care area and areas of that type. That is very much to their credit and they deserve to do well as a result, but it has consequences in regard to the education of young men.</P>
      <P>We need to look at the education system as it prepares young men for the real world as distinct from some idealised world in which they imagined they could have lived had they graduated from school in the 1960s rather than in the 1990s or the next decade.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important to debate these issues in a way that does not present this as a trade-off.  The truth is there is no trade-off involved.  It is important for everybody in Ireland to do better and it is important that we recognise this country's successes, particularly the successes which women have created through their efforts. Those who have not been so successful should seek to emanate them in a positive way.  The debate should be a positive focus for a person rather than one which involves negativity or invidious comparison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very interesting and I hope the programme focuses on these issues and helps real debate.  However, I remind the Taoiseach that when he was making those remarks last week the Employment Equality Bill was before the House.  It has now gone before a select committee.  Some of the central equality issues which have been argued by people, whether male or female, for the past ten years have been excluded from that Bill and the crucial issue of the male comparator, which would have addressed many of the issues Deputy Harney raised, has been dropped from the Bill.  If the Taoiseach feels as passionately about it as he is trying to portray here, he might get the Minister responsible to introduce an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage and make something worthwhile of it.  The present Bill is useless and it will achieve nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated he would have the overall co-ordinating position for the negotiations and individual Ministers will deal with their sections. I respectfully suggest that system will not operate. If four to five Ministers are involved in negotiations with different groups &mdash; employers or farmers, for example &mdash; someone must make decisions for the Government and co-ordinate <Col N="1357" /> the process.  I wish the Taoiseach the best of luck in attempting to do so but it is not his job to co-ordinate meetings which often last for long periods or take place at weekends.  Will the Taoiseach give consideration to appointing a coordinator so that everyone will know who is responsible for driving the negotiations? Otherwise, the process will move in various directions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy the negotiations will be conducted in a focused and well managed way.  The Government has made internal arrangements to ensure that regular meetings take place between everyone involved. Clear areas of responsibility have been conferred on individual Ministers and these are coordinated effectively by either the Minister for Finance or me, depending on the subject matter under consideration.  The arrangements will work extremely well.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, the reference was not to a male comparator but to a hypothetical one.  Obviously, the hypothetical comparator has caused some difficulty in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach referred to a real social problem involving the failure of young men to participate in the employment market on equal terms with young women.  What special steps are proposed for the Government and the social partners to assist young males to participate with more success so that perhaps 50 per cent of jobs created in the next ten years will be obtained by males?  To what steps did he refer when introducing this issue to the social partnership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer Deputy McDowell to an article by the late Christina Murphy which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> last June.  Ms Murphy drew attention to the considerable difference in leaving and junior certificate results, at higher and lower level, in virtually every subject.  It is important that we seek to improve young men's academic performance.  If people do not invest in their own education, and are not assisted in doing so, they will face subsequent difficulties in obtaining employment.  There is a close link between achievement in examinations &mdash; be they junior or leaving certificate examinations &mdash; and subsequent achievements in the jobs market.  The statistical tables the Minister for Education will publish in the near future clearly illustrate the difference in performance across the range of subjects.  Young women perform substantially better in this regard.  I could read lists of figures into the record or I will give them to the Deputy later.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy my comments are validated by the facts.  There must be an examination of how, in each individual school and region, educational performance can be improved in those groups &mdash; whether based on geographical or gender considerations &mdash; which are falling behind in academic performance.  The most important action we can take is to discover what can be done to help these groups to improve.  It is often too late to rectify these problems when people have left school.  They must be tackled at an early stage in schools, which must identify the reasons for under-performance &mdash; be they based on social background, geography or gender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Advertisements were recently placed in the national newspapers inviting applications for enlistment in the Army and the Naval Service in 1996 and 1997.  I propose to enlist 200 recruits in 1996 and a further 400 in 1997.  The number that will be assigned to the Navy and the Air Corps has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>At present the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochana and the Revenue Commissioners, while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. During the course of such patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti drug smuggling operations.  Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.  Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to such taskings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, will help to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal <Col N="1359" /> importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 will also increase the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.</P>
    <P>As I outlined previously to the House, the EU has introduced a five year programme of financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the Common Fisheries Policy.  In this context, the question of the resources required by the Naval Service to ensure effective enforcement of the various regulations, taking account of the control measures agreed in December 1995, is being examined.  The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that Ireland will derive the maximum benefit from the available EU support.  The position on the programme for 1997 is that Ireland's submission was passed to the Commission before the deadline of 30 June 1996 and provides for a down payment on an additional Naval Patrol vessel.</P>
    <P>The Commission will consider Ireland's application in conjunction with those of other member states and will decide before the end of the year on the level of funding to be made available in 1997.  Pending the implementation of the five year programme, the Naval Service will continue to carry out its various roles using the existing seven patrol vessels, a number of which, it is expected, will be refurbished under the five year programme.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to the Naval Service for its involvement in the recent drug seizure in County Cork.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of Naval Service personnel have been unable to obtain annual leave and it seems that many are on their last legs?  It is crucially important that the Minister indicate how many additional personnel will be recruited to the Naval Service to allay current fears.  Will the Minister confirm that the Naval Service is unable to man the seven patrol vessels &mdash; it has been quite some time since they were all at sea together &mdash; and that there is an urgent need to provide additional personnel? Could he provide an indication of the numbers involved in the recruitment campaign in addition to the numbers he hopes to recruit next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree there are not sufficient personnel to man the seven naval vessels.  It is not unusual that those vessels are not at sea at the same time because, for operational and maintenance purposes, they come and go. During 1994 and 1995, a total of 130 personnel were enlisted for general service in the Naval Service.  I have already advertised for applications for enlistment in the Army and in the Naval Service in 1996 and 1997.  The reason I cannot give the exact number to be allocated to the Naval Service is that a special study is taking place of both the Naval Service and the Air Corps at my request, the necessity for which became obvious <Col N="1360" /> during the course of the review of the implementation plan and also following the Price Waterhouse report.  This study is ongoing.  I hope to have the recommendations of Price Waterhouse before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>I am particularly conscious that people who enlist in the Naval Service should have a fair deal. I do not accept that there should be uncertainty about having a reasonable period of rest and spending time with families and loved ones.  I have asked in particular that we look at the existing arrangements so that we can, if necessary, change the structures whereby people who go to sea can come back and have a reasonable period at home with their families before going back on duty.  I very much value the excellent service given by the Naval Service and will do my utmost to ensure it gets whatever resources it needs.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the numbers recruited in 1994 and 1995, would the Minister not accept that the overall numbers in the Naval Service are down by about 250 on the complement required to man the ships?  While I am grateful for the understanding the Minister has displayed in ensuring that members of the Naval Service have the necessary time off, it is crucial that he give some indication of numbers. In my contact with the navy, I come across a great degree of frustration.  Given the arduous nature of the work and the necessity to ensure that fishery surveillance and drug interdiction operations are fully manned, will the Minister try as early as possible to give a firm indication of the numbers to be recruited to the Naval Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Naval Service is without adequate personnel.  I do not agree that this is a numbers game.  The Naval Service may require another 100 or 200.  That will be decided on the basis of an in-depth examination of existing structures and future plans.  PDFORRA and RACO, the two representative associations, have met the consultants and have had an opportunity of giving their views.  There is ongoing discussion with Naval Service management.  We have brought in experts from abroad to work with the consultants and the Naval Service.  Depending on the structures recommended, the numbers required will be clearly defined.  We could argue forever about how many people are needed.  One could say that one needs 50 personnel for seven ships. That would total 350.  If the complement per ship were doubled, that would amount to 700.  Given that there are over 1,000 employed in the Naval Service, one could argue that there are enough people to man the ships.  However, it is not as simple as that, and that is why I would not be tempted to give an exact forecast of the numbers needed.  It will depend on the report which will be based on adequate consultation with the management of the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> The Naval Service is recruiting at present.  I sincerely hope that when the time comes to enlist personnel we will have a clear indication from the advisers we have appointed as to the numbers required to provide a proper service to the public, to protect our fisheries, involve ourselves in drug interdiction operations and give those working in the Naval Service a fair crack of the whip.  That is my ambition.  For that reason I do not think it is wise to say whether we need another 200 or 300.</P>
    <P>There has been an ongoing problem of people being recruited to the Naval Service and trained and, after a short time, looking for a transfer to the Army.  Various reasons have been given for this.  However, it would not be satisfactory to allow that to continue, because if 40 or 50 people are allowed to transfer from the Naval Service to the Army, the core of people needed to provide a proper naval service is reduced.  If a figure is established as being required to carry out certain functions, I want to ensure that the Naval Service will be authorised automatically to recruit people to keep that figure at a constant level.</P>

The question of the payment of an allowance to personnel involved with the recent BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.

In the Minister's last answer to Deputy Smith he went to great rounds to say nothing, whereas this time he has dug his heels in and will give no information.  Soldiers are doing an important job which is vital to the economy. However, it is seen by members of the Defence Forces as a cheap way of protecting the beef industry.  We are aware that industry is going through a difficult period and protection is vital, but 30p an hour is an absolute disgrace.</P>

      <P>I will answer any question. However, I would remind the Deputy that it was his party that, when in Government, negotiated these agreements with the representative associations and under those agreements, if a case is raised under the conciliation and arbitration scheme, discussions on the claims are deemed to be confidential.  I cannot breach that agreement, reached in 1990 by a Fianna Fáil Minister.  Please do not try to accuse me of not wanting to answer questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to allowances, a military service allowance is payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special disadvantages associated with military life.  The rates of remuneration of the Permanent Defence Force, including military service allowance and Border duty allowances, were determined by the Gleeson Commission in July 1990.  The commission expressly stated that military duties were clearly in a distinctive category and it would not be appropriate to fix military pay on the basis of a direct comparison with the pay of the Garda.  As a result of the Gleeson Commission which reported in 1990 the military service allowance which is payable to everybody up to the rank of colonel is £2,070 per <Col N="1363" /> annum in the case of officers and £39.10 per week or £2,040 per annum in the case of non commissioned officers and privates with the exception of privates with less than three years service who receive £14.09 per week.</P>
    <P>All personnel posted to Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £49.57 per week in the case of officers and £43.81 in the case of non commissioned officers and privates.  The allowance is paid irrespective of the hours worked on a continuous basis including during periods of annual leave, sick leave etc.  The Border duty allowance is payable to everyone posted to the Border area, in addition to their military service allowance.</P>
    <P>A claim has been lodged and discussions are taking place under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I sincerely hope we can reach some agreement.  Because of what the Gleeson Commission said in 1990 it is not right to compare military pay with that of the Garda Síochána although I know where the Deputy is coming from in terms of recent publicity.</P>
    <P>Full meals are provided in the barracks for those performing Border duty before commencement of duty and on completion of duty.  While personnel are on patrol each individual receives a flask of hot tea or coffee, sandwiches, fruit, yoghurt etc.  There was a suggestion that people were left for hours or days without proper food.  I checked this out.  I would hate to think we had reached a point in this State where people who served on Border duties were left without adequate food for long periods.  I assure the House there has been a great deal of expenditure on mobile canteen facilities and also that hot meals are served before and after duty. If there are examples of people not being served proper food I would be delighted to hear it because I would not tolerate it for one minute.</P>

      <P>I am not aware nor have the regional fisheries boards reported to me that predation on fishstocks by wild mink is a cause of major and urgent concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been complaints by eel fishermen about damage done by mink.  Overall, however, the advice to me by the regional fishery boards is that, while there are mink populations in all the regions, they are not considered to be a serious threat to fish stocks in general.  If the Deputy has particular local information available to him I would be glad to have the matter investigated by <Col N="1364" /> the relevant fisheries board.  If necessary a scientific assessment of the extent of mink predation and possible control measures could be undertaken.  This would be a matter primarily for the Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I am advised that mink is not a protected species under the Wildlife Act and as such a licence is not required to carry out a cull.  Anyone may hunt and trap mink by any means which is permitted under existing regulations of the Wildlife Act.  The extent to which culls or other control measures are required remains to be proven.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled the question because of complaints from fishermen and wildlife people that the mink population in the south has increased out of all proportion.  There are some lakes and rivers in the south where the entire wildlife population has been wiped out.  People from England were called in to control the wild mink.  Reports from the opening day of the mallard season suggest that the mallard population is down at least 60 per cent on last year.  I would be grateful if a survey of fishing and gun clubs could be carried out to ensure we have a proper idea of the destruction being caused by mink.</P>

      <Quest>if he will bring to the attention of the EU Council of Ministers, when deciding on cuts in fish quotas, the fact that Irish fishermen have not contributed to the problems of overfishing and illegal fishing; and if he will ensure that the countries which have caused such problems bear the brunt of these problems.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual negotiations on the setting of total allowable catches takes place at the Fisheries Council of Ministers each December on the basis of a proposal by the Commission based on scientific recommendations and assessments of the state of the stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed scientific advice in relation to fish quotas for 1996 is not yet available and <Col N="1365" /> accordingly the Commission has not yet finalised its proposal.  However, it can be anticipated that due to the state of a number of fish stocks the Commission will take a cautious approach in the total allowable catch which it proposes for those stocks for 1996.</P>
    <P>The perilous state of many fish stocks has already provoked a proposal from the Commission to reduce the size of the European fishing fleet by up to 40 per cent under the next multi-annual guidance programme.  This proposal was based on scientific advice from a committee of independent experts, the so called Lassen Committee, which indicated that many stocks in EU waters were seriously overfished.  The Commission proposals for fleet cuts were discussed by the Fisheries Council, which I chaired on 14 October.  The Council did not accept these proposals on the basis that they were too indiscriminate, did not really tackle the source of the problem and did not take due account of the impact of the cuts on fishing communities.  I am now in the process of meeting Fisheries Ministers individually to see if a more soundly based, sensitive and balanced proposal can be constructed to address the underlying problem.</P>
    <P>From a national perspective, I have repeatedly indicated that the Commission proposals were, from a variety of perspectives, unacceptable to me.  The reductions in fishing effort which are necessary should be focused on the fleets or segments of fleets which are exerting undue effort on critical stocks.  Improvements in control, and conservation must also have a role to play. Tackling illegal fishing and reducing the catching of juvenile fish are part of the answer and I have worked on proposals in both of these areas during the Irish Presidency.  I will continue to pursue this more comprehensive approach to the management of fisheries in European waters in order to ensure that we avoid the scenario of fish stock collapses which we have seen in other fisheries in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern is to ensure that Irish fishermen are not on the shoreline unable to fish as they watch fishermen from other countries plunder Irish waters.  I appreciate the challenge facing the Minister.  The countries that have caused the problems should carry responsibility.  Millions of tonnes of immature fish are being taken out of the water while Irish fishermen have scarcely been able to reach their quotas.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the nature of the changed proposals?  My information is that the proposals are being changed radically.  Fishermen planning to operate their boats next year need to feel confidence for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission's proposals for cuts up to 40 per cent were rejected by Fisheries Ministers at the Council meeting in October.  I have made the case to the Commissioner <Col N="1366" /> responsible for fisheries that the cuts must be targeted on the fleet segments exerting undue effort on critical stocks.  As president of the fisheries Council it is my role to seek a solution to the overall over-capacity problem.  However, that does not compromise my duty as Minister for the Marine to seek the best possible deal for Ireland.</P>
      <P>This problem is being approached from a number of aspects, particularly conservation control and the protection of juvenile fish.  We are trying to include those elements in the package. In the discussions with individual member states we will try to find a compromise acceptable to the Commission.  If not, we will have to go back to the drawing board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that a 40 per cent cut in the Irish fishing fleet would decimate the industry and for that reason I rejected the proposals at the outset.  We were to the fore in ensuring these proposals were not accepted at the Council meeting in October.  We must, however, face the problem of pressure on certain stocks.  I have pointed out that Ireland did not cause the problem of pressure on stocks and we should not be subject to the same level of cuts as others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Ferries informed me by letter on 20 September that it intended to suspend sailings on its Ireland-France route from 3 November this year, resuming in spring 1997.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of meetings occurred subsequent to this announcement by the company, arising from which my Department asked the Labour Relations Commission on 10 October to intervene.  The company wrote to me on 18 October and sought an operating subsidy to allow it to continue sailings during the coming winter.  This request was carefully considered but I decided that the grant of an operating subsidy would not be an appropriate Government response in the circumstances.  I pointed out to the company, however, that I was actively reviewing a number of areas of potential assistance to the shipping sector.  In particular, I drew attention to my agreement with the Minister for Finance to review the income tax and PRSI position of seafarers.  I appealed to the company <Col N="1367" /> and the unions to work together to avoid damaging industrial action and, if at all possible, to maintain sailings during the winter while the issues I have mentioned are pursued.</P>
      <P>I note that agreement was reached between the unions and the company last night which will, I hope, avoid disruptive industrial action.  I regret it is virtually certain now that the route will close for the coming winter.  I note, however, that the terms of last night's settlement will have the effect of maintaining the workforce intact for when the service resumes in March 1997 and provides for the commencement of negotiations early next year, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, on longer term issues.  I intend to keep closely in touch with all concerned over the coming months and to pursue in particular the tax and PRSI issue.  I assure the Deputy I will do everything in my power to ensure these longer term issues are addressed so that the continental route is maintained as a viable operation over the coming years.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Minister's reply is disgraceful.  With the consent of the Minister and the Government, Irish Ferries has decided to isolate this country from the Continent for six months.  This will have devastating effects on tourism and the live cattle trade.  It will also lead to the downgrading of Rosslare with a consequent loss of jobs in a county which already has the highest rate of unemployment in the country.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister square the Government's refusal to pay a subsidy on this route while the Channel Tunnel and Brittany Ferries are subsidised?  The playing pitch in the EU is not level at present.  The Minister has a duty to ensure the shipping service to the Continent is kept running.  He should not allow Irish Ferries to go ahead with the closure.  He should have discussions with the Minister for Finance to secure a subsidy is paid at this late stage.</P>
      <P>When I met representatives of the company last week it was made clear that if a subsidy was made available they were prepared to maintain the route over the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot comment on the assurances the Deputy received but they were not in the letter I received.  A subsidy was being sought by a private company which made a profit of £12 million or £13 million last year and is quoted on the Stock Exchange.  We were asked to subsidise one route of their overall operation on the grounds that one ship would be maintained but without a guarantee over the longer term.  As the Deputy is aware, there are two ships on that route at present.  I resent the indication given that this was a matter for the Government.  Irish Ferries is a private company making considerable profits and it took a commercial decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern to ensure there is a sea link with the Continent through Rosslare.  I <Col N="1368" /> am satisfied the void will be filled if a decision is made to withdraw the service.  However, I make no apologies for not spending taxpayers' money to subsidise one route of one shipping company which is making large annual profits.  I do not know what information the Deputy received but I can only go on the information in the letter I received.  I can make a copy of it available to the Deputy if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>I understand that cattle for export are carried by a number of operators.  If there are difficulties in that area I am sure my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, will ensure we are not stranded.</P>

      <P>I disagree totally with the Minister on the inevitability of this decision by Irish Ferries and his acceptance of it without question. This matter has been referred to the Labour Relations Commission.  The 200 jobs involved are very vulnerable and the workforce is being bought off on the basis that it will receive social welfare.  Does the Minister accept that this is more than a private company issue and is of national significance?  The continental corridor between Ireland and France is a vital sea link and the Minister and his Minister of State should be actively involved in this matter.</P>
      <P>On the issue of taxation and PRSI, will the Minister accept that the UK have used these systems imaginatively in terms of their seafarers? In his reply the Minister said he accepted the decision as a <i>fait accompli</i> but will he endeavour even at this late stage to keep the line open for the winter period?  My colleague referred to Brittany Ferries.  Will the Minister accept that in an EU context we have a case for support and mobile assets as a peripheral island?  There will be no question of a knock-on effect if the matter is dealt with on that basis.  The Minister must become involved in this issue and endeavour to keep the route open to avoid major economic and social consequences.</P>

      <P>I did not decide to close this route; the decision was taken by a private company.  The <Col N="1369" /> Government's policy on the shipping sector seeks to ensure that we can operate on a level playing pitch where either no subsidies are allowed or, where they can be given, it is on the basis of well defined, limited and transparent circumstances. One cannot decide to subsidise a line for no good reason.  There are either no subsidies or Europe must decide the clearly defined basis on which they can be given.

      <P>I appealed to the private company which decided to close down this route for the winter to keep it open in the interests of the employees and to enable discussions to take place in a friendlier atmosphere.  Given the company's strong profitable position, the route could have been kept open for the winter.  There was no need to give six weeks' notice of the decision to close this route and to take off two ships.  The company could have listened to the repeated requests by the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, and me to postpone the decision for this winter to allow for ongoing discussions and to see how matters evolved.</P>
      <P>In this year's Finance Act the Government gave two other concessions to the shipping sector in terms of leasing to make it more attractive to lease new ships.  In addition, we gave a grant to cadets to enable them to complete their training and to compete with their British counterparts. We have also taken up the matter of tax and PRSI with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Some of the Deputies opposite were in Government and they know one cannot say in October what will be in the budget in January. That is the reason I asked this private company to postpone its decision on the closure of the winter service for 1996.  I do not accept that we were negligent in this matter as there was no reference to a subsidy when we first received notification of this proposal.  If he had an opportunity to speak the Minister of State would state that there were clear indications the company did not want subsidies, and this is evident from its decision not to join the complaint against Brittany Ferries.</P>

      <P>Last Friday I left my office at approximately 9.30 p.m. having received a letter from Mr. Hickey of Irish Ferries at approximately 7.30 p.m.  I again asked him to keep the service open for the winter so that discussions could continue and to see what could be done in terms of EU policy on subsidies, a matter of concern to me also.  Europe has to decide whether we can have subsidies and, if so, under what conditions. We cannot have it both ways and Deputies know as well as I do that if we get into competition in terms of subsidies those who can pay the most will eventually win the war.  A small country like Ireland will not win the war and it would be detrimental to fair competition if we reached the stage where subsidies were the dominant factor in deciding whether small companies survived in Europe.  It would be detrimental to our shipping sector if it was a case of the biggest and strongest and who can pay the most money.</P>
      <P>I am in the business of trying to ensure a fair playing pitch for all ship owners in Europe.  In case anyone is under a misapprehension, I wish to state clearly that there was no reason for the company to state in a letter dated 20 September that it was closing this service on 3 November.  The company is not in financial difficulties &mdash; it reported profits of between £12-£13 million last year &mdash; and it should have been possible to keep this route open during the winter.  We are doing our best to deal with the problem of taxation for sea seafarers.  I cannot guarantee I will be successful because, as the Deputy is aware from his period in Government, there could be knock-on effects, but I will do my best.  I again appeal to the company to postpone its decision to close the route for this winter and allow discussions continue so that we can resolve the difficulties.  That would be fair to the workforce and to us.</P>

    <P>The Department's engineering division is not currently undertaking any specific reports into harbour infrastructure in County Donegal. However, I have recently commissioned a separate consultants' report on Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre to assess the capability, and medium to long-term infrastructural requirements, of the port in terms of meeting the needs of the fishing industry in the region.</P>
    <P>A three year fishery harbour capital development programme, 1997-99 is being prepared and requirements in County Donegal are being considered in the context of the programme.  The funding currently available over the lifetime of the fisheries operational programme for harbour works is very limited. Only projects which demonstrate a significant potential return from a fisheries perspective can be contemplated for aid under the programme. In that regard the available technical and other reports together with submissions made by Donegal County Council and local interest groups will inform decisions in due course.</P>
    <P>I have commissioned an independent analysis <Col N="1372" /> of the requirements at the port of Killybegs.  This study will be completed shortly and will inform future funding decisions.  I am satisfied that significant infrastructural investment is needed at Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre to ensure the necessary capability to service the present and future needs of the fishing industry in the north west region.  I will pursue the case for additional funding for the development of fishery harbour infrastructure generally, and Killybegs in particular, in the context of the mid-term review of EU Structural Funds and elsewhere as necessary.</P>

      <P>The fishing industry around Donegal's vast coastline has major economic benefits for the area in terms of jobs and so on. It is not good enough to say resources are limited and that consideration will be given to one pier. Killybegs needs to be upgraded and Greencastle suffers from massive congestion.  I want the Minister to give a commitment to seek resources for not only big piers, but for small ones such as Carrickarory which has deteriorated so much since his visit there that he would not recognise it. Will the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications, Enterprise and Employment and the Marine work together to get money to repair this pier which is falling into the sea?  The pier at Moville has already fallen into the sea.</P>

      <P>In the mid-term review of the EU Structural Funds I will seek additional funds for fishery harbours and the fisheries operational programme in general.  The amount of resources negotiated under the EU Structural Funds was very low.  Funding under the operational programme will be in the region of £1.5 million for each year from 1997 to 1999.  That would not <Col N="1373" /> be sufficient to do a great deal of work at Killybegs.  That is why I need a mid-term review to try to get funds from some other programme.  A number of harbours and ports have been neglected for years.  Vital infrastructure in the fishing, marine, leisure and tourism industries could be used to generate vast sums of money.  There is also a difficulty about who is responsible for those areas.  Local authorities have some responsibility in this area.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine's priority in this area relates to major fishery centres.  That is why I mentioned Killybegs. Greencastle and Burtonport also need care and attention, but the Deputies are aware of the costs involved.  We are not talking about a small amount of money.  I am awaiting the recommendations of the consultants' report on Killybegs which, because of the developments taking place there, the size of the vessels using the port and its infrastructure, must be examined in a three or four year programme.  We need to get investment into the area to ensure the continued operational capacity of Killybegs, Greencastle and Burtonport.  In the meantime, the Department of the Marine continues to give a service to local authorities who have requested inspections to be carried out.  For that reason, people may have got the impression that the Department of the Marine is responsible for these matters, whereas it acted only on an agency basis for the local authority because it had the necessary engineering skills.</P>

      <P>There are no manufacturing facilities in Ireland for military weapons and related items.  When required by the Defence Forces such equipment has to be purchased from sources abroad.  Procurement policy is already subject to careful scrutiny and conducted on the basis of rigorous controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, foreign-based weapons suppliers and manufacturers comprise, or are part <Col N="1374" /> of, extensive commercial organisations.  Within such organisations particular units or subsidiaries may be involved with the manufacture of landmines but my Department has little information in the matter as such equipment is not normally purchased for the Defence Forces. Against that background it would not be possible realistically to regulate the admission of suppliers to my Department's competitions for defensive equipment on the basis of degrees of relationship with companies which may be involved with landmines or parts of them.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to a parliamentary question on 2 October 1996 regarding a policy review on the role of landmines, the Defence Forces will not use anti-personnel mines on any military operation.  The procurement of small quantities for training and research purposes will continue to be necessary from time to time.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the Government is totally opposed to the indiscriminate nature, production, use and trade of anti-personnel landmines and are seeking support for a complete ban on such weapons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 46 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Provision for the payment of pensions by the Department of Defence to the widows and children of deceased soldiers was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for those dependants was introduced.  Soldiers serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.  Benefits under this scheme are additional to the survivor's contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts for which soldiers are insured by virtue of their PRSI contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> In 1985 a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was granted when all soldiers &mdash; as well as pensioners and the representatives of deceased soldiers &mdash; who had opted out of the scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme.  Unfortunately, not all availed of this option.</P>
    <P>At this stage, all soldiers who were serving when the original scheme was introduced in 1978 have had two opportunities to join the scheme. The question of again reopening membership options has been considered on a number of occasions over the past few years but I regret that it has not been found possible to make any concession.  In this regard, I should say that there would be implications for many other public sector areas if membership options were reopened in respect of the Defence Forces' scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a precedent in any other section of the public service where people who opted out of pension schemes were allowed back in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any. Unfortunately, when this option was provided in 1985 not everybody took it up.  I cannot answer for other sectors of the public service.  If this was to be reopened it could have a knock-on effect on the public sector.  Some of those who have been contributing since 1978 and those who joined in 1985 will be annoyed and could argue that their contributions should be refunded because others who join now will get the same benefit.  There are a number of issues to be considered but the gratuity of one year's salary for death in service applies to all members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that of a strength of 13,100 enlisted personnel in early 1978, about 7,700 opted out of membership of the contributory scheme.  There are about 1,600 serving soldiers who are not currently members of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I met a number of the widows involved and had much correspondence with the Minister's predecessor.  Many of them did not realise that their husbands had opted out and had no part in the opt out.  Their husbands did it without telling them and it was a great shock to them when they became widows to find out they were not part of the scheme.  It varied from commander to commander in each barracks as to who joined.  One man who is now a colonel paraded his brigade daily until everybody joined. One person claims that her husband was a chef <Col N="1377" /> in the cooking corps which did not parade and did not know about the scheme.  There is a relatively small number of widows caught in this situation.  Nobody expects that they will qualify for full pension but there is a case for giving them some form of <i>ex-gratia</i> payment so that they are not relying on the ordinary widow's pensions after the long years of service their husbands have given to this nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4. to delete lines 1 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, is hereby amended, in section 4&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the insertion in subsection (2), after `without warrant', of `or pursuant to an authority of a Judge of the District Court under section 10 (1)',</P>
      <P>(b)  by the substitution of the following subsections for subsection (5):</P>
      <P>`(5)  If at any time during the detention of a person pursuant to this section there are no longer reasonable grounds for believing that his detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence to which the detention relates, he shall, subject to subsection (6), be released from custody forthwith unless he is charged or caused to be charged with an offence and is brought before a court as soon as may be in connection with such charge or his detention is authorised apart from this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>`(6)  If at any time during the detention <Col N="1381" /> of a person pursuant to this section a member of the Garda Síochána, with reasonable cause, suspects that person of having committed an offence to which this section applies, other than an offence to which the detention relates, and the member of the Garda Síochána then in charge of the Garda Síochána station has reasonable grounds for believing that the continued detention of that person is necessary for the proper investigation of that other offence, the person may continue to be detained in relation to the other offence as if that offence was the offence for which the person was originally detained.',</P>
    <P>(c)  by the insertion, after subsection (8), of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>`(8A)  Where a person detained pursuant to subsection (2)  is taken to a court in connection with an application relating to the lawfulness of his detention, the time during which he is absent from the station for that purpose shall be excluded in reckoning a period of detention permitted by this section.', and</P>
    <P>(d)  by the substitution, in subsection (9), of `subsection (6), (8) or (8A)' for, `subsection (6) or (8)'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates only to paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) of the new section 2; paragraph (b) is already part of the Bill.  It arises from recent court decisions in regard to periods of detention under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  I indicated on Committee Stage that my Department was reviewing the provisions of section 4 of that Act and that I intended to introduce an amendment on Report Stage on this matter.  Deputy O'Donnell tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage and graciously withdrew it to give me an opportunity to consider the best form of amendment to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) of the 1984 Act provides for detention periods of six hours from the time of arrest and a further period not exceeding six hours if a garda not below the rank of superintendent has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary. Subsection (6) provides for the suspension of the reckonable detention period for rest and subsection (8) provides for the suspension of the reckonable detention period for medical attention.</P>
    <P>The effect of my amendment is that where a person being detained under section 4 attends court to challenge the lawfulness of the detention, the time during which that person is absent from the station shall be excluded in reckoning a period of detention permitted by this section. Paragraph (c) of the amendment is the key provision in this regard and paragraph (d) is consequential.  This new exclusion from the reckoning of detention periods will also apply <Col N="1382" /> where a person is detained following rearrest under section 10 of the 1984 Act, as do the provisions of subsections (6) and (8) of section 4, which relate respectively to rest periods and medical attention.  The purpose of paragraph (a) is to make this explicit.  I am satisfied this amendment is reasonable and necessary so that the effectiveness of the provisions of sections 4 and 10 of the 1984 Act is not diminished.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Donnell for raising this matter on Committee Stage, thereby giving me an opportunity to rectify what turned out to be a lacuna in the law as it arose in a case recently before the courts.  I trust the amendment will be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;Section 8 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1), after paragraph (j), of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>`(k)  an offence under section 112 (2) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 (substituted by section 3(7) of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1984).'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment amends the Criminal Law Act, 1976.  Section 8 of that Act allows a member of the Garda to use reasonable force to compel a person to comply with a requirement to stop a vehicle, including the placing of a barrier or other device in the path of a vehicle.  That power relates to a number of offences specified in section 8 of that Act.  The power does not extend to the offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, of unlawfully taking a vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have been concerned for some time about motor vehicles being taken <Col N="1383" /> without the consent of their owners and used in the commission of crime.  They have been considering means to reduce the amount of damage caused by drivers of these vehicles and they are satisfied from tests they have carried out that a tyre deflating device known as &ldquo;stinger&rdquo; which is in use in other EU countries will prove to be an effective means of addressing the problem.  The use of the stinger in these circumstances is permitted by section 8 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment will be to allow the Garda to also use this new device to stop vehicles unlawfully taken by so-called joyriders. The stinger will be used by trained gardaí under very strict supervision under Garda guidelines.  I am very anxious this amendment is passed so I can be absolutely sure when these devices are in use that there is no risk to the legality of their use.  They are safer than any device previously considered to prevent cars being taken and used, mostly in a very dangerous fashion, not only in the commission of crime but in such a way as to cause potential danger to other road users, including pedestrians.  Sadly there have been many incidents of accidents involving stolen cars and to ensure full legality in the use of these devices I hope the amendment will be accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(7)  Rules made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made, and if a resolution annulling the rules is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the rules are laid before it, the rules shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the <Col N="1384" /> validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that when we discussed the issue of prison rules in Committee a number of matters were raised that were perhaps ancillary to the Bill but a valid point was raised about the role of the Oireachtas in terms of prison rules. This amendment is a standard provision which will require that prison rules made under section 17 be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. I am happy to make this amendment which is in line with the standard form of laying regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Apart from the formal laying of prison rules before the Dáil and Seanad, I intend to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government that the proposed new prison rules shall be referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Members will recall that Deputy Woods asked if it would be possible to make available these rules in the Houses of the Oireachtas and I am glad to meet his request in this amendment.  I look forward to discussion of the draft new prison rules by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security so that I will have available to me the combined knowledge, expertise and wisdom of that committee before finalising the prison rules.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>(2)  Where an accused person is before the District Court charged with an indictable offence the Judge shall, not later than the second appearance by the accused person before the court in respect of that charge, conduct an examination into whether the case is one which will be tried on indictment or by summary hearing.</P>
      <P>(3)  If, on the conclusion of the examination, the Judge is satisfied that the case must be heard on indictment (by reason of the election of the accused or the prosecutor in accordance with law or by reason of a finding that the offence is not a minor offence fit to be tried summarily) he shall forthwith send the accused person forward to the appropriate court for trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  A case which has been sent forward to the appropriate court for trial pursuant to, subsection (3) of this section shall be listed for mention before the court of trial not later <Col N="1385" /> than 14 days from the date of the District Court order returning the accused person for trial.</P>
    <P>(5)  On the date upon which the case is first listed for mention before the court of trial, or on a subsequent date not later than 28 days from the date on which the case was first listed for mention before the court of trial, the prosecutor shall cause the documents specified in section 6 of this Act to be served on the accused.</P>

    <P>(10)  On the hearing of an application of the type mentioned in subsection (9) of this section, the Court shall not grant leave to serve the further statement of evidence unless it is satisfied that there is a good and substantial reason as to why the evidence could not have been served earlier and that the interest of justice requires that the evidence be allowed.</P>
    <P>(11)  Section 20 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 is hereby amended in subsection (3) by the substitution of the following for paragraphs (a), (b) and (c):</P>

    <P>(14)  (a)  A trial of any offence specified in the Table to this section shall commence not later than 90 days from the date of the accused person's first appearance before the District Court unless a Judge of the High Court grants an extension of that period on the hearing of an application by either the prosecutor or the accused.</P>
    <P>(b)  On the hearing of any application for an extension of the time within which a trial must commence the High Court Judge shall not grant an extension unless he is satisfied by evidence presented on affidavit, or orally if directed by the Judge, that there is a good and substantial reason as to why the extension should be granted and that the interests of justice require that such an extension be granted.</P>
    <P>(c)  No extension granted on the hearing of an application under paragraph (b) of this section shall be for a period greater than 30 days.</P>
    <P>(d)  Either the prosecutor or the accused may make more than one application under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
    <P>(15)  Either the prosecutor or the accused may, in respect of any case which has been returned for trial to a Circuit Criminal Court, apply to the High Court for an order directing the transfer of that trial from the Circuit Criminal Court to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>(16)  At the hearing of an application made under subsection (15) of this section the High Court shall not make an order transferring the case for trial unless it is satisfied that, by reason of the seriousness and complexity of the charge or by reason of there being a substantial point of law of public importance involved in the case, the <Col N="1387" /> interests of justice require that the trial be held before the Central Criminal Court.</P>

    <P>1.  Rape</P>
    <P>2.  Rape contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>3.  Aggravated sexual assault contrary to section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>4.  Robbery contrary to section 23 of the Larceny Act, 1916 as inserted by section 5 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>5.  Possession of a controlled drug for the purposes of sale or supply contrary to section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to amend criminal procedure to provide that in future there would no longer be preliminary examinations.  To this extent, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, would be repealed.</P>
    <P>There is unanimity among those who are for and against the bail referendum that there is a need for speedier criminal trials and that, in general terms, the best way of going about this would be to abolish the concept of preliminary examinations which are cumbersome.  They lead to individuals literally snaking through the criminal justice system before finally reaching the court of trial and are expensive.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe, as we approach the end of the 20th century, that an accused person is entitled to insist at a preliminary examination that all the evidence is taken down in longhand by the District Court clerk.  This procedure is not appropriate to a modern criminal justice system and the time has come for change.</P>
    <P>This is set out in the amendment which provides that &ldquo;where an accused person is before the District Court charged with an indictable offence the judge shall, not later than the second appearance by the accused person before the court in respect of that charge, conduct an examination into whether the case is one which will be tried on indictment or by summary hearing&rdquo;.  Having satisfied himself that the case should be heard on indictment the judge would be obliged to return the individual for trial.  At present the judge must be satisfied that everything contained in the Book of Evidence would, if accepted by the jury, entitle it to convict the individual of the offences as charged.  He is then obliged to return the individual for trial.</P>
    <P>The usefulness of the preliminary examination system is best decided by looking at the statistics. In 1995 the preliminary examination procedure was followed in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court in 673 cases, of which only seven were discharged at the preliminary examination stage. <Col N="1388" /> On these figures nobody could make a credible argument for retention of the system.  The Minister for Justice stated that she had referred the matter to a committee which was to meet again on 18 October.  I do not know what the result of its deliberations was but this system has to end.</P>
    <P>In recent times a question was put to the Minister regarding the number of persons charged with offences under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984 in respect of whom orders of discharge were made by the Dublin Metropolitan District Court following the conduct of a preliminary examination.  The Minister stated in reply that in 1995 no orders of discharge were made by that court following the conduct of a preliminary examination in cases involving persons charged with offences under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in only a minuscule number of cases a court discharges a case at preliminary examination stage.  In virtually all cases where the preliminary examination procedure is invoked the District Courts are satisfied that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case.  There is no cogent reason I can think of or which has been put forward since I initiated this debate on behalf of Fianna Fáil for retention of the system.</P>
    <P>The preliminary examination system only serves to delay criminal trials; involves expense, which is sometimes considerable, to the State through the legal aid scheme and is often used by ruthless criminals to ensure that the day of reckoning &mdash; the day of sentence &mdash; is postponed. It appears that the people are not well served by this procedure.  The victims of crime do not applaud it as being of any use to them.  The question can be raised as to whether it serves the criminal justice system or criminals as we approach the end of the millennium.  It is, to say the least, a nonsense.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the Government to act in this matter and to get rid of an arcane procedure which does nothing to edify the criminal justice system.  Nobody would believe it is still permissible for an accused person to insist that depositions in the District Court are taken down in longhand.  That is a nonsense and a joke and reflects badly on the system.  Those who favour its retention do not serve the cause that they expect us to believe they espouse.</P>
    <P>The public have become extremely cynical about delays in criminal trials.  They are outraged that it can take so long for justice to be done in what are often extremely serious cases.  There is considerable truth in the proposition that the reason we have never got around to changing our criminal procedure and speeding up trials is that we do not have sufficient prison places.  For a considerable period I have advocated that this policy be reversed.  If we are to have a modern, coherent criminal justice system, more than the change in our bail laws will be required.  There is an urgent need to speed up criminal trials and to dispense <Col N="1389" /> with procedures which clearly belong to another age.  This amendment does that.  It abolishes the notion of preliminary examinations and provides for the service of documents on the accused person as befits a modern criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>There are no faults of any real import with the amendment as drafted and in those circumstances I cannot think of any good reason it should not be accepted, but since the Minister has already indicated on Committee Stage that she will not be disposed to accepting the amendment at this stage, it behoves me to ask her the reason for that decision.</P>
    <P>Whenever it comes to the reform of the criminal justice system, certainly over the past two years, the Trappist monks of the rainbow Coalition, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, appear to exercise a veto.  On this occasion I do not believe that even these men of sackcloth and ashes could possibly object to an amendment which would bring our procedures into line with many other modern jurisdictions. No so-called civil libertarian principle can be advanced against the proposition put forward, unlike the bail referendum issue when so-called civil libertarian principles were put forward by the same two gentlemen against the concept of a referendum, which principles were scattered to the four winds this year for reasons best known to the two of them.  The fact that there was ultimately a scramble to get on board the referendum shuttle is a matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue constantly amazes me because he always has a new metaphor to add to the debate.  I commend him on his literary term.  Today it is Trappist monks, next week he may leave the area of the Church and go on to something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Deputy once again for outlining to the House his views on preliminary examinations. On every occasion the Deputy has raised this issue I have told him I fully understand his points. We debated this matter at length on Committee Stage and in a debate on another Bill.  We cannot simply abolish something with the stroke of a pen without careful consideration.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I had asked the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure to carry out a <Col N="1390" /> review of the preliminary examination system. That committee was set up in the 1960s to continually examine the procedures as they exist in the courts.  As Deputy O'Donoghue and other Deputies will be aware, the manner in which the courts do their business in this type of procedure is set down under court rules.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure considered the preliminary examination system as recently as the late 1980s and stated categorically that it should not be abolished.  I again raised the issue with the committee earlier this year and asked it to examine the extent of the delay, if any, occasioned by the procedure and to consider whether the preliminary examination procedure should be abolished or replaced.  I received an interim report from the committee which raised a number of questions to which I was not satisfied I had all the answers, and I asked it to consider further aspects of the procedure.  I stated on Committee Stage that the committee was meeting on 18 October.  I have not yet received a report from the committee arising from its 18 October meeting but when I do I will be in a position to decide the reforms, if any, that should be made to the preliminary examination procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue may not be aware that there are lay members on that committee, including Senator McGennis who was appointed to it before she became a Member of the Seanad. The Deputy may wish to discuss this matter with her to see what progress has been made in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Confidentiality rules may apply in regard to the discussion but the Deputy may want to take up the issue in a general way with his party colleague.  The question was raised with me whether it was appropriate to have a Senator on the committee but I took the view that she should complete her term of office.  I did not seek to remove her even though she had become a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate to introduce a preemptive strike here by way of this amendment and I ask Deputy O'Donoghue, under the circumstances, to allow me await the report from the committee.  As soon as I have that I will bring forward whatever reforms are recommended or that I consider appropriate in the report.  I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to mention the extent of the delay about which I am speaking.  A person charged with an offence appears in court on the first occasion and is either remanded in custody or released on bail.  On the second occasion the question of the location of the trial and the preparation of the Book of Evidence arises.  The accused is then remanded for another four weeks to appear again when the Book of Evidence is supposed to be served.  To the best of my knowledge the Book of Evidence is never ready within three to four weeks and the case is again adjourned for another two weeks so <Col N="1391" /> that the accused and his lawyer can contemplate it.  The next court hearing is the preliminary examination stage and this is where the archaic nature of the system becomes all too apparent. The accused person is entitled to insist upon the attendance of all or any of the prosecution witnesses in the District Court so that they can give evidence on deposition.  The accused person is entitled to insist that the depositions be taken down in writing.  After all, the evidence and the depositions having been taken, one must consider that there is a delay in finding courts and the case is again remanded to a date when submissions must be made as to whether, under the terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, there is a sufficient case to answer.</P>
      <P>In general, months are lost in this procedure at present and there is no cogent reason for it.  I do not want to labour the point but I stress that the time has come to terminate this practice.  It is a procedure which has outlived its usefulness and the age in which we live.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who participated in a very useful debate.  A number of other issues which are not handled in this Bill arose in the debate because so many areas in the system require reform and adjustment.  I am glad to have been able to bring this Bill through the House because, as I said at the outset, it started life many years ago.  I think the then Minister's concept was that there would be a fairly regular miscellaneous Bill to bring forward required changes.  Unfortunately, the Bill was stretched continually.  I decided to call a halt and proceed with this Bill even though there are gaps and other matters which people would like to see provided for in it.  In addition, I introduced a system in the Department of Justice where there would be an annual miscellaneous Bill such as this to begin to correct, modernise and deal with issues which Deputies O'Donoghue, O'Donnell, Woods and others raised in this debate.</P>

    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  I know it will introduce many measures which the Garda and others have sought for a number of years.  I am glad to have been able to listen to them and accommodate changes which they requested.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> It gives me great pleasure to propose the Universities Bill, 1996, to this House.  It is the first time in the history of the State that this House has had an opportunity to debate a universities Bill which applies to all the universities.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises the central role which the universities play in society.  This role is part of a great European tradition stretching back to the establishment of Plato's Academy in 395 BC. This academy had as its motto &ldquo;knowledge is a good and worth pursuing in all its forms&rdquo;.  From the medieval tradition which built on the foundations laid by the academy, we have inherited the liberal ideal that education goes beyond the transmission of knowledge and concerns itself with development of the full potential of the human intellect.  From this ideal comes the broad and vital mission of the university, to cultivate the mind, develop human worth and talent, better the individual and better society.  This mission is more necessary than ever in today's world.  Knowledge is the basis of progress to a richer culture, greater social justice and harmony and a better quality of life for all.</P>
    <P>Universities have a wider and more diverse role in the development of society than ever before.  This university legislation recognises the role of the university.  It seeks to provide the framework to enable universities to develop the nation's knowledge, extend the nation's cultural heritage and expand the nation's intellectual development as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>The need for this framework of university legislation has been felt for many years.  The Green Paper on Education published by the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in June 1992 proposed legislation to restructure the National University of Ireland; to modernise the legislative framework for the universities and to rationalise the composition and functions of governing authorities.</P>
    <P>The stated aim was to provide a framework of legislation which would be more compatible with the role, function and operation of universities in modern society.  The White Paper on Education was based on extensive consultation after publication of the Green Paper with all the interests in education, including the university sector.  This consultative process included the National Education Convention held in Dublin Castle in October 1993.  The Bill derives from the principles and approaches set out in the White Paper which was published in April 1995.</P>
    <P>This Bill has three main objectives: the restructuring of the National University of Ireland, provision of revised governance structures, provision of a framework for interaction between the universities and central Government and for accountability to society generally.</P>
    <P>In addressing the first objective, the restructuring of the National University of Ireland, this Bill marks another milestone in the history of the National University.  The campaign <Col N="1394" /> for a university which reflected and promoted the values and traditions of the majority of the Irish people was one of the great educational and political struggles of the last century and the earlier part of this century.  The 1908 Act gave birth to the federal National University of Ireland which went on to forge a distinctive and distinguished role in the international arena.  My proposals for organisational change are based on proposals made by the NUI itself.  Almost 90 years since the NUI was established, each of the constituent colleges will now be placed on the same legal and constitutional basis as other independent, autonomous universities.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to be able to bring to this House my proposal to establish the present áecognised college of the NUI at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth as a university within the new NUI structure.  The college has been one of the great recent successes of university education in the State.  Lay students were first admitted to the faculties of the recognised college in 1966 and since then the student population has grown to more than 4,000.  The trustees of St. Patrick's College have shown great foresight and commitment in developing the recognised college and making it a part of the university and third-level education sector.  Their support for my proposals for the college has been of critical importance to the provisions now in the Bill.</P>
    <P>An important objective of the Bill is to place all universities on a common footing in respect of their relationship with central Government. Under current legislation the State has much stronger regulatory and controlling powers in regard to Dublin City University and the University of Limerick than in the case of the older institutions.  Dublin City University and the University of Limerick have now sought to be placed on a statutory basis similar to the older universities.  Dublin City University and the University of Limerick have shown impressive growth.  Their success has convinced me they should now be placed on an equivalent statutory basis to the other universities.</P>
    <P>We are extremely fortunate to have such a diversity of university institutions &mdash; from the youngest of which I have just spoken, to the oldest, Trinity College, Dublin, the sole College of the University of Dublin.  This university has, for more than 400 years, provided a home for academic endeavour which has attracted national and international recognition.  The Universities Bill has been drafted to ensure that Trinity College can thrive and that its long tradition of institutional autonomy and independent academic achievement can continue and prosper. Because of the ancient tradition of the college, it is proposed that its charter will be amended not by this Bill but by a private Act sponsored by the college, in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Bill.  I will bring forward the necessary amendments to the Universities Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> This Bill gives practical expression to the principle of pluralism expressed in the White Paper.  It provides a statutory framework which affords parity of esteem to all our universities which values their differing history and which has the flexibility to accommodate their differing traditions.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second objective of the Bill, to revise university governance structures.  I draw the attention of the House to three aspects of this issue: the flexible framework for partnership on each governing authority; the extent of Ministerial involvement in each governing authority; and the issue of academic councils and academic freedom.  In addressing the second objective, revised governance structures, the Bill sets out a framework which will allow each university to devise governing authorities which best suit their own interests.</P>
    <P>For the first time, in the colleges of the National University of Ireland academic staff who are not professors, non-academic staff and students, including postgraduate students, will have a right of representation on the governing authority.  In addition, the governing authorities will retain representation from the NUI and from local public representatives, thus reflecting the traditions of the NUI.</P>
    <P>For the first time, the recognised NUI college at Maynooth will have a governing authority, which will be constituted on the NUI model, but will also include representation from the trustees of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, thus reflecting the traditions of the recognised college.</P>
    <P>In Dublin City University and the University of Limerick graduates will have the potential for representation on the governing authority and students and staff, both academic and non-academic will have the potential for increased representation on the governing authority.  In addition, the governing authorities will have representation from the Dublin City University Educational Trust and the University of Limerick Foundation, thus reflecting the importance of these bodies in the emerging traditions of these universities.</P>
    <P>Under proposals at present being considered by the college, for the first time in Trinity College non-academic staff and students will have a right of representation on the governing authority and graduates will have the potential for representation on the governing authority.  In addition, the governing authority will retain representation from the fellows of the university, thus reflecting the traditions of Trinity College.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for membership of the governing authority of each university by senior academics and administrative staff.  It allows for between one and four ministerial nominees on each university governing authority and for outside representation on the governing authority.  Most importantly, it allows each university great flexibility, within a broad framework, to choose the governing authority <Col N="1396" /> which best reflects its traditions and which will best enhance its governance.</P>
    <P>This Bill embodies, in its governance proposals, the White Paper principle of partnership of all relevant interests so that our universities can build on their national and international reputation and success.  This Bill has resulted from a process of consultation and dialogue.  This dialogue continued after its publication and has been valuable, both in raising areas of valid concern, which I can address, and in allowing me to deal with other areas of concern which have no foundation in fact.  In my dialogue with the universities, particularly with the university community at Trinity College, concern was expressed about section 15 (6) which confers on the Government the power to remove the chairperson of the governing authority of a university.  This is a valid concern and I intend to amend this provision.</P>
    <P>However, I assure the House that, as it stands it could not have extended to removing the Provost as chief officer of Trinity, nor was it ever intended to do so.  I further assure the House that, far from limiting the autonomy of Trinity College in respect of its Provost, this Bill will return to the college a power it has not had since the Charter of King Charles I in 1637 &mdash; the power to appoint the Provost.  At present, this power rests with the Government.</P>
    <P>During my consultation with the university communities, a further concern was expressed that the Bill would hugely increase the number of ministerial nominees on university governing authorities.  This is not true, as can be seen from consideration of section 14.  I can assure the community of the NUI colleges that the number of ministerial nominees on the governing authorities of University College Cork, University College Dublin and University College Galway can be exactly the same under this Bill as at present.  I can inform the community at Dublin City University and the University of Limerick that the number of ministerial nominees on each of the governing authorities of these universities will be five fewer than at present.  For the community of Trinity College, I understand that, under proposals at present being considered by the college, the Minister for Education may nominate one member of the board and there would be one representative from the education board, when established.</P>
    <P>I will dispel any impression that this Bill indicates the Minister intends to take control of the universities.  It is my firm intention to ensure that the Bill will not involve one iota more of involvement in the day to day activities of the universities by the Government.  I assure the House that I will give generous consideration, in consultation, where necessary, with my Government colleagues, to any amendments which may be necessary to ensure that universities retain their academic freedom in harmony with their accountability to the wider society.  The issue of academic freedom is <Col N="1397" /> essential and central to the role of the university. Academic freedom lies at the heart of the concept of a university in this State.  The Universities Bill respects academic freedom and contains nothing which would hinder the full expression of that freedom by and in our universities.  The Bill also underpins institutional freedom &mdash; this is the capacity of the universities to conduct their own affairs.  By underpinning these freedoms the provisions of this Bill will enhance the capacity of the universities to serve the cause of scholarship and the pursuit of knowledge and in so doing to advance the welfare of our society.</P>
    <P>That is why I am convinced that sections 23 to 26 of the Bill, which provide statutory recognition of academic councils, are of key importance.  The Bill does provide that every university should have an academic council which will control the academic affairs of the university &mdash; a situation which is already a central feature of university life here.  Enshrining this in legislation provides an important, statutory guarantee of academic freedom.  The Bill further states that the majority of the membership of the academic councils must be made up of the academic staff in the university.  Students are also included, and the details will be determined by the governing authority.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the third objective of this Bill, provision of a framework for interaction between the universities and central Government and for accountability to society generally.  I also wish to address matters of specific importance in the areas of staffing, quality and equality issues.</P>
    <P>In considering accountability, we must remember that in the past universities were the preserve of a privileged minority in society, their role and range of studies were limited and the financial support, if any, was modest.  This situation has altered dramatically in recent decades.  From 4,000 students when the Universities Act was enacted in 1908, student numbers grew to 10,000 in 1960 and to 50,000 in 1996.</P>
    <P>Universities now play a crucial role in society as an integral and mainstream part of our education system and are acknowledged, nationally and internationally, as key contributors to social, economic and cultural development in modern society.</P>
    <P>An independent university sector is also a guarantor of our freedom in our democratic society.  Through their teaching, research and objective and informed criticism, the staff in our universities contribute in a vital way to maintaining a mature democratic society, a society confronted with increasingly complex social, scientific, medical, technological and political challenges.</P>
    <P>This Bill will underpin these vital academic and institutional freedoms and will facilitate the universities to continue to serve individual and social needs in the very changed circumstances of contemporary and evolving society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> Section 22 and Chapters 7 and 8 of the Bill contain the provisions on staffing and budgets. The general scheme of these provisions is that the universities will agree a budget with the Higher Education Authority, as they do at present. Excesses over budget will not be permitted unless agreed with the Higher Education Authority and any unauthorised excess must be offset against the budget for the following year.  These provisions are a reasonable and prudent mechanism to control the Exchequer expenditure, which is over £220 million this year alone for the university sector.</P>
    <P>Section 22 confirms the present situation where the rates for pay, allowances, expenses and pensions of staff are in line with public sector norms.  In the case of staffing, the legislation will state for the first time in section 22 that each university will have the right to make its own operational and management decisions relating to its staffing levels, numbers and structure.  Each university will also decide under section 33 how it should allocate its budget within the institution. Neither the Minister nor the Higher Education Authority will be empowered to lay down detailed instructions and conditions.</P>
    <P>Let me give a further example of how this Bill gives the universities enhanced freedom.  Under section 12 (2) of the Higher Education Act, 1971, the Higher Education Authority has the power to make payments to universities in such manner and subject to such conditions as it thinks fit.  This is a very sweeping provision, whereas sections 22 and 33 of the Bill set out provisions for non-binding guidelines prepared by the Higher Education Authority after consultation with a university or universities.</P>
    <P>As drafted the Bill is already clear that the guidelines are non-binding, but to make it doubly so and to provide reassurance I intend to bring forward a Committee Stage amendment to confirm the position.  The amendment will also make it clear that a departure from guidelines will not result in restrictions or conditions on the payment of moneys made to a university.</P>
    <P>The keeping of accounts and records for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General is provided for in section 35.  This does not change the current situation.  Contrary to some comments, this does not give additional powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the universities, nor does it impose additional burdens on them.</P>
    <P>I have been asked if private university trusts and funds will come under public scrutiny in this legislation.  Will the Higher Education Authority require information on these funds?  Will the Government dictate how they are to be spent?  I assure the House and the university communities that my concern in this legislation is with public funds, State funds, funds which this year alone amount to more than £200 million in the university sector alone.  Under this Bill the Higher Education Authority will not have access to information on the private trusts and funds of <Col N="1399" /> universities.  The Higher Education Authority will have access only to information which is at present provided by the universities on a non-statutory basis &mdash; the accounts of their annual income and expenditure.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a genuine fear, fuelled by rumour, among some university staff that this Bill will worsen their pay and conditions.  I can assert with absolute conviction that there is nothing in this Bill which could conceivably have this effect. However, in response to the concerns which have been conveyed to me about this I now intend to specifically provide in the Bill a provision to the effect that, for the removal of doubt, it is declared that the tenure, pay, allowances and pensions of existing staff will be no less beneficial after the passing of the Act than before it.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 of the Bill, providing for visitation and suspension, provides for a situation where there is a serious breakdown in the management and operation of a university.  I have consulted members of the university communities whose views I respect and who see in these powers a risk to university autonomy, despite the safeguards which are built into this section.  I accept their genuine concerns.  I assure Deputies that I am giving further thought to this section and I am disposed to bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage which would deal with these concerns expressed to me.</P>
    <P>The White Paper lays great emphasis on quality in education.  There is general agreement that universities need to have an effective process for evaluating academic standards.  These processes exist already.  There is a long and honoured tradition of peer review among our universities.  There is a tradition of promotion of quality in research and in student education.  The approach in section 31 of this Bill is to recognise and support this tradition while specifically recognising certain features in the evaluation of the quality of teaching and research at the university.  Those features include evaluation of all departments and facilities of the university by the university itself and by external experts not less than once every ten years.</P>
    <P>Student assessment is also a reasonable requirement of an evaluation system.  The universities will be required to implement the findings of evaluations where it is practical to do so.  The role of the Higher Education Authority will not be to conduct the evaluation.  That is a function of the university.  Nor will the HEA's role be to implement the findings of the evaluations.  That is a matter for the university. Rather, the role of the Higher Education Authority will be to review the procedures established by the universities.  This section reflects my view that self assessment in quality assurance is the most sophisticated and appropriate way of promoting development within an institution and nowhere is this more appropriate than in the universities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> The fundamental White Paper principle of equality is reflected in section 32 which provides for the preparation and giving effect to a policy in each university relating to equality of access for under-represented sectors of society and to gender equality.  Both these issues have been matters to which universities are already devoting attention and since the Bill was published, I have been advised by many within the university communities of their welcome for this measure.</P>
    <P>The key objectives of this Bill are to restructure the National University of Ireland, to revise university governance structures and to provide a balance between autonomy and accountability. The key principles which underpin this Bill are those of the White Paper: pluralism, partnership, accountability, quality and equality.</P>
    <P>Last Monday an editorial in a national newspaper stated:</P>
    <P>Ms Bhreathnach should not lose sight of her original objective of greater accountability.  The mechanism by which this is achieved may be a matter for debate, but the principle is not contested.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been framed in the context of continuing dialogue with the university communities.  The dialogue aimed to achieve the key objectives which I have just stated and was informed by the principles which I have just declared.</P>
    <P>My Department has continued this dialogue, after the publication of the Bill.  On the basis of continuing communications and dialogue, and other views expressed by concerned interests, and having consulted where necessary my colleagues in Government, I expect I will be in a position to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  Before reaching a final decision on any amendments, I will listen carefully to the views of Members and give them full consideration.  Members can be assured I will listen intently to their contributions and I look forward to responding on the issues raised at the end of the debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  We have reached a farcical state because we have had a number of position papers on the governance of universities and the future of universities as we move into the next millennium.  The first position paper which did not see the light of day contained some fairly draconian measures.  At that time the Minister was giving herself the power to appoint the chairperson of universities.  That measure was diluted last year as a result of considerable debate in the universities and throughout the country.  A position paper published in November was a considerable dilution of previous proposals. Many people accepted the Minister's word on that occasion while on the publication of the Bill they were extremely disappointed that it contained provisions which were not in the <Col N="1401" /> position paper, which were clearly interventionist, and involved a far greater degree of operational interference in the day to day running of universities.  We now find the Minister has engaged in a considerable retreat brought about by political pressure, pressure from the universities, staff of universities, the university communities and people who are genuinely concerned about the impact this Bill will have on their academic freedom and future.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that she intends to bring forward a number of amendments to key areas of the Bill dealing with pay and conditions of staff, section 33 and the question of suspensions and dismissals.  Why were these provisions in the Bill in the first instance?  Before we even begin to discuss Second Stage why is the Minister talking about substantial amendments to her Bill?  We will monitor the situation carefully on Committee Stage because we have learned that the Minister's rhetoric does not match reality and that rhetoric is no substitute for tightening up the law and for dotting the is and crossing the ts in terms of the legislation that is ultimately passed.</P>
      <P>It is clear the Minister was under political pressure and that is why we now have the announcement that she intends to introduce a range of amendments on Committee Stage.  We also had the surprising development today of the Higher Education Authority taking out advertisements in the national newspapers to state its position.  The last sentence in the HEA's advertisement is significant.  It describes how the Higher Education Authority and the universities have been working well under the 1971 Act and puts forward the view that: &ldquo;it has not sought and would not wish that any change in this process would be reflected in the legislation&rdquo;.  We could read that in a number of ways but to me it is a coded way of saying that section 33 and the other sections of the Bill that represent a duplication and enhancement of the powers which the Higher Education Authority already has under the 1971 Act should be deleted.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the redesignation of University College Cork, University College Dublin, University College Galway and Maynooth as constituent universities of the National University of Ireland.  Few people have any difficulty with that.  It also marks the first overall legislative assessment of our universities since the Irish Universities Act of 1908.  As such it affords the House another opportunity to consider the role of third level education in our changing society.  However, this Bill also proposes to lay aside university charters and to supersede existing contracts of employment.  It has an importance above and beyond the sectors to which it is specifically directed.</P>
      <P>If it is accepted, as drafted, the Bill will set precedents that can be applied to both the organisation and the terms and conditions of employment that apply in other places of work, regardless of existing agreements.  It cannot avoid creating a legal minefield in industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> As for our universities, Fianna Fáil believes this Bill gives little credit to either their role or potential.  The Minister has chosen to reject the contributions of the past, ignore the difficulties of the present and put the future in a straitjacket.  In short, the Universities Bill is a worthy metaphor for the current situation of the Labour Party in Government.  The Bill rides roughshod over the contractual rights and conditions of university workers, retrospectively cancels the status of existing agreements and proposes arbitrary powers for suspension and dismissal.  In this respect the Bill reveals all the flaws and internal contradictions of a Labour Party that has lost its soul and abandoned the working man and woman.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, on its return to Government, will repeal this legislation.  In Government we will develop a new partnership with our universities based on mutual respect and trust.  Such a partnership will be proactive and dynamic.  It will acknowledge the outstanding contribution made by our universities to the academic, artistic, cultural, economic and social life of the nation. When in Government, Fianna Fáil will trust those working in Irish universities to lead this sector with vision and commitment into the next millennium.  We will jealously guard their historic right to the academic freedom vital to a healthy democracy and guarantee their independence and freedom of action to plan their future with confidence.  In this context Fianna Fáil will oppose the Bill, which tramples on the terms and conditions of employment of those who work in our universities.</P>
    <P>The preliminaries of the Bill designate all those who work in our universities as &ldquo;employees&rdquo;, be they academics or any others who are &ldquo;employed by the university in any capacity&rdquo;.  This change of designation will come as a surprise to the many university lecturers who now find that with a stroke of the pen, the Minister proposes to disregard their existing contracts and statutory rights as &ldquo;officers&rdquo; of the university.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember this is 1996, not 1926, and that not even a member of the Labour Party in Government can retrospectively cancel the terms of employment of any person as if she exists outside the law or outside social partnership.  With respect to domestic law and the current EU legislation on employment, the illegality of these particular aspects of the Bill is evident.  The relevant sections are an affront not just to natural justice and the rights of those who will be affected by the Bill, but to the security of workers who think that agreed terms and conditions with an employer are agreements that will be secure and honoured by all parties.</P>
    <P>On this point, has the Minister told the staff of the NUI colleges that their status and rights will be affected by their proposed transfer from office in the National University of Ireland to simple employment in the newly designated universities? Has she told them the protection they currently enjoy under the 1908 Act will be explicitly taken <Col N="1403" /> away?  Has she told staff at the University of Limerick that a similar protection they enjoy under the 1991 Act will be taken away and that, therefore, what is proposed in this Bill represents a change in status?  I doubt it, since she did not see fit to meet personally the unions involved with respect to these proposals when either the position paper or the Bill was being drafted.</P>
    <P>Although requested to do so, she also refused to meet personally the staff associations of the various universities despite the fact that, as a petition from the staff of the University of Limerick put it, &ldquo;a number of the measures in the Bill are significantly worse than those contained in the Minister's position paper of November 1995&rdquo;.  It was not a rumour that motivated the staff in articulating their concerns about the Bill with regard to their pay, conditions and terms of employment.  The Minister would have done well to have met the staff associations to hear their concerns at first hand.  It is little wonder the Minister is running for cover and that the openness and transparency of which she speaks has a hollow ring to it.  As with so much that emanates from the Labour Party, it is rhetoric masquerading as reality.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Minister's attempts to undermine the statutory contract of existing professors and lecturers and to set out a different position for those who are to be appointed in the future are in stark contrast to the provisions of the National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996.  It is regrettable the Minister did not examine that Bill prior to drafting this legislation.  With reference to the directors of the National Museum and National Library, section 28 (5) of the National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996, states that the present directors, that is, the officers, &ldquo;... while in the service of the Board of the Museum, [shall not] be brought to less beneficial conditions of service (including conditions in relation to tenure of office) ... [than those] ... to which he or she was subject immediately before the establishment day&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister for Education disagree with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht?  Can she explain this internal division within the Labour Party in Government in defining the terms and conditions of workers? Will she explain why she was so keen to list one set of terms for one set of workers and another for those who work in our universities?</P>
    <P>For all its pretensions, the rhetoric of the Labour Party is not the law of the land and it will not protect any university employee from dismissal.  In the event of staff dismissals and where they could be contested, a university worker would not be able to proceed at law under the terms of this Bill except by way of an expensive and lengthy constitutional action.  A similar point is highlighted by the current action of workers at CIE.  Regardless of who is right in law, it is precisely because established rights were guaranteed when the company was restructured <Col N="1404" /> that the workers can contest what they regard as new conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>This House has a duty and responsibility to ensure that the workers covered by this Bill will not be deprived of their existing terms and that as universities develop, they can contest the introduction of new conditions which they consider detrimental to their situation and, especially as provided for in this Bill, if they can be introduced in a non-consultative and arbitrary way.  Instead of changing the current terms and conditions of our university staff this Bill should protect whatever they have and are entitled to keep.  The Minister does not want to give university workers such protection.  The Bill supersedes the relevant sections of the 1908 Act and accords her the ability to challenge the charters of other universities.</P>
    <P>Section 22 (5) states baldly: &ldquo;A university may suspend or dismiss any employee&rdquo;.  The staff of our universities may think they will continue to enjoy the protection of existing legislation but security of status for future staff will be even more invidious with consequent implications for academic freedom.  Section 29 (3) states, with all the authoritarianism and austerity that pervades this Bill, that all statutes which conflict with these proposals &ldquo;... are hereby repealed ...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister's cavalier attitude to the role and status of those who work in our universities also compromises the independence of the universities in respect of their own freedom of action, freedom of expression and freedom to evaluate their goals.  Who is to say that the simple way in which grounds for dismissal are outlined in this Bill cannot or will not be tied to freedom of expression?  Who is to say that the independence of a chief officer will not be questioned by the kind of &ldquo;super HEA&rdquo; proposed in this Bill?  Who but the Minister is to interpret the so-called &ldquo;stated reasons&rdquo; the Minister will have to suspend governing authorities who in the case of Trinity College, for example, have been governing independently for over 400 years?</P>
    <P>The concept of academic freedom is central to the role of a university in a healthy modern democracy.  Since the foundation of the State, universities have nurtured and fostered independent and critical thinking among their staff.  Many great university figures have not been afraid to challenge either the conventional wisdom of the day or to disagree vigorously with the Government of the day.  Many campaigns to bring greater equality to Irish life, to improve civil rights and to achieve greater social progress have been developed from within the campuses of our universities.</P>
    <P>Academic freedom and intellectual life must never be compromised by subservience to a political order.  It must never be undermined by overbearing regulations and legislation which will make it more difficult to confront the establishment without fear of censure or dismissal.  The Provost of Trinity College made this point when he said: &ldquo;Universities must stand <Col N="1405" /> as centres of independent thought, free without fear or hindrance to pursue truth, to question and criticise established orthodoxies, to create and express ideas and to communicate knowledge&rdquo;. Above all, academic freedom must be protected from political control.  The Bill fundamentally threatens this concept and will create an atmosphere in Irish university life that will be antipathetic to the unhindered flowering of academic and intellectual freedom.</P>
    <P>Such unwarranted intrusion is evident throughout the Bill.  For example, it allows for changes in pensions schemes.  The Fifth Schedule specifically requires each university to &ldquo;... prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme or schemes for the granting of pensions...&rdquo;.  Is the Minister suggesting that the current schemes are in some way unsound?  I have no explanation for these overbearing and unsupportable changes to university pension schemes except to suggest that, as with so much else in the Bill, the Fifth Schedule seeks to give unwarranted and new controls to the Ministers for Finance and Education and, in so doing, seeks to undermine the legal status of the current trustees.  This is another legal minefield, proposed without any discussion or consultation with the staff, trustees or unions.</P>
    <P>The Bill suggests, like the position papers in advance of it, that our universities had not been doing their job well enough.  There is a clear implication in this exercise.  I reject the Minister's assumptions on this score and agree with the recent OECD report on the Irish economy which stated that in terms of economic benefits both to individuals and society as a whole the returns on higher education are high in Ireland.  Moreover, in adapting to change, and especially to the dramatic changes which have taken place in recent years, none of our universities had to wait for directives from Ministers or Governments or for diktats from the Higher Education Authority to inaugurate the kind of broad mission statement detailed in section 11.  Instead of hindering universities on this score and restricting their freedom of action, if the Government is seriously interested in promoting this broader agenda it should look at its chronic underfunding of research and development in universities.  Despite appeals to the contrary, since 1994 the Government committed only £36.5 million out of the £7 billion allocation under the Structural Funds to university expansion.  The reality of the Government's record on third level education is there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Ireland is near the bottom of the OECD and EU tables in terms of investment by the State in research and development.  As a recent Higher Education Authority report concluded, despite this relative disadvantage it is &ldquo;quite remarkable that since 1981 Irish universities have managed not only to improve the output of the research sector but to expand it by 51 per cent as opposed to 35 per cent in the UK&rdquo;.  One university <Col N="1406" /> president recently told me that some of the equipment in his science laboratories is more than 30 years old and it was notable that even with these handicaps the research output of his university was well above the EU average.</P>
    <P>Trinity College has 800 research contracts with local, European and global industry and this is reflected in the profile of the college's research earnings which increased from £1 million in 1981 to over £11 million in 1993.  Over the past five years UCC has earned more than £50 million in funded contracts from Government and EU sources as well as from Irish and international business and industry.  During 1993-4 it brought in £12.1 million of contract research money as opposed to £1 million ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The idea which the Minister has been trying to peddle for some time that our universities are behind the times and need somehow to be updated and controlled and made accountable is as injurious as it is insulting to what they have done, are doing and are capable of doing to enhance our society and economy in the broadest possible sense.  Their contribution to the cultural and artistic life of the nation has also been immense and cannot be overstated.  As such, section 11, in which the Minister outlines her idea of the mission and function of the university, is a complete nonsense.  She is certainly no match for Cardinal Newman.  The Labour Party's manifesto for higher education, as reflected in the Bill, will not outsell his idea of universities which he saw as communities of scholarship, centres of research and creativity and as academies of teachers whose independence and sense of critical inquiry had to be protected.  The quality and independence of university education must be kept inviolate from the hands of Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister's desire to corral universities and undermine their independence is also reflected in the way in which the Bill proposes to deal with the governance of the seven universities which have different histories and backgrounds.  In November 1995 the Minister in her position paper on proposals for university legislation acknowledged this difference and stated that the principle of the right of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its own ethos and traditions is of central importance, as is an expression of academic, operational and management freedom consistent with the effective and efficient use of resources and accountability.  At that time I welcomed what I regarded as the recognition of an obvious point. However, the Minister had a change of heart during the past year and has decided to smother the independence any university needs to operate effectively.  Mysteriously and without explanation, this provision has been omitted from the Bill.  Why was it decided to omit this fine statement?  This decision was ill thought out, added insult to injury and caused concern among all those involved in the university sector.</P>
    <P>No Deputy believes that universities should be exempt from public scrutiny given that the public <Col N="1407" /> purse is involved.  This is provided for in the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, and the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.  Under the 1993 Act a university's accounts are verified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The president or provost is already the chief accounting officer and the accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts.  Under the 1971 Act the Higher Education Authority already exercises extensive external controls on salaries, curricular development, student entry requirements, staff numbers and structures and campus development.  It is already entitled to any information or records it requires from any of the universities, to attach whatever conditions it wants to university budgets and to demand that budgets be adhered to.  Why are these powers being duplicated and strengthened in the legislation?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that these powers are being strengthened as the basis for reducing universities to a common landscape regardless of their different traditions and irrespective of the Minister's assurances last November.  Instead the Bill proposes a superlative bureaucracy which, to use the words of the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, will give the Higher Education Authority &ldquo;virtual complete dominance over every aspect of the universities at the expense of the autonomy which has always been a crucial element of their role in Irish society&rdquo;.  We should pay due regard to this statement by a former Taoiseach who has considerable experience of the political realities of life, as they emanate from Government, and of the university of life.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes we should celebrate and protect the diversity of our educational institutions.  Different universities, each with a different ethos and outlook and operating in different ways are a good and healthy thing in society.  It is in this context that I wish to deal with the constraints the Bill will impose on universities, principally through a reinforced HEA, and its implications for State funding.</P>
    <P>The State grant for each university is based on a unit cost mechanism.  This is based on student contact hours and takes no account of the service provided to the industrial sector and society generally beyond the provision of well trained and educated graduates.  If the Minister wants to impose on universities the kind of detailed brief set out in section 11 then the unit cost system must be changed.  Is this what she has in mind and does she plan to alter the basis of the current unit cost formula to accommodate section 11?  If the Government is not willing to do this then all the fine rhetoric in the Minister's mission statement is a complete farce.</P>
    <P>A similar fuzziness appears in section 33 where the Minister proposes to give the Higher Education Authority the power to issue so-called guidelines to the universities.  What does this <Col N="1408" /> mean in legal terms?  True to the letter and spirit of the Bill, does she intend these guidelines to be compulsory?  If the chief officer refuses accommodation can the Minister use the sweeping powers she has assigned herself under the Bill to dismiss the president, etc., of the university?  She played around with words in her speech in so far as she said universities will not suffer or be punished in any way if they do not agree with the guidelines issued by the HEA.  The Minister should delete this section given that the Higher Education Authority has indicated in its advertisement today that it is happy with the powers it has and she has said she intends to amend it in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>A ridiculous provision in section 33 states that if a university has departed from the guidelines the Minister can publish the Higher Education Authority report in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> As far as I am aware this kind of provision does not exist anywhere in the public service except in one case, where the Revenue Commissioners publish the names of those who settle outstanding taxes.  Is the Minister trying in all seriousness to associate university presidents who want to stand up for the independence of universities with tax evaders?</P>
    <P>A similar democratic deficit is reflected in the alterations proposed for the internal governance of universities.  I am glad the Minister has recognised that the ethos of Maynooth and Trinity College should not be overwhelmed by external representation on their governing bodies.  This principle should be extended to the seven universities.</P>
    <P>We welcome the commitment to gender balance on governing bodies and increased representation for students and non-academic staff, as well as the recognition of separate constituencies for post-graduate students and for junior and senior staff who are not professors or associate professors.  However, as with so much of the Bill, this is another missed opportunity.  It is one matter to argue that all those who live, learn and work in a university should have representatives, it is another to argue, as this Bill does, that they should not have the stated right to elect their representatives as they see fit.</P>
    <P>Such democratic action is denied here.  Instead, the Bill proposes that internal governors can be appointed by the governing authority as it thinks fit, and not elected by the relevant constituencies. This type of dictatorship is unacceptable to us. We will oppose those sections which provide for the appointment of all internal representatives and insist that a method of election is spelt out in the body of the Bill.  In a similar vein, graduates should have the right to elect whoever they choose and the representative, if he or she happens to be an employee or a student of the university, should not be subject to the scrutiny or to the waiver, of the governing authority to deem him or her duly elected.  Democracy is not a two-tier process and it is regrettable that the Minister has seen fit to include a screening <Col N="1409" /> process that flies in the face of the very basis of freedom of choice.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil welcomes the proposals on outside representation from employers, trade unions, agriculture, the professions, business and industry, we believe the power to appoint these representatives should not lie with the chief officer of the university.  As the proposals stand, the Bill breaks new ground in regard to appointments to public-sector authorities.  While I am sure the House will have its own opinion on this, they are all the more important because they make a nonsense of the separation of powers between the executive and the governing body, that should exist in any authority of this kind. Given the number of nominees involved the Bill could have the effect of reducing the governing authority to a kind of rubber stamp.  How can there be accountability if the people who are supposed to oversee the chief executive owe their positions on the board to him or her?  The whole business pokes a finger in the eye of modern companies legislation.</P>
    <P>It is much more important that the governing body is transparent.  She must specify the number of governors for each governing body.  Otherwise, distortions will arise that will make a nonsense of the internal balances of those bodies.  The Bill is unrepresentative enough as it stands in that it proposes to reduce academic representation within NUI colleges from its current level of about half to, at most, between one-third and two-fifths.  There is no reason it cannot provide that at least 50 per cent of the governors should be drawn from inside the university or why alumni are not represented.  Moreover, given that student numbers have, in most cases, increased by more than 50 per cent since 1988, a strong case can be made for increasing, not reducing, the number of governors.  As it stands, the extension of representation into other areas of Irish life, at a time when the numbers inside the university have increased, will merely marginalise internal representation.  Here again the Minister rejected reforms that some universities wanted to introduce in this regard.  In Trinity College the internal reform process, the Duncan-Murray report, suggested that four students should become full members of the board, and this was agreed.  If the Bill is accepted this will not be possible.  It is a case of the Minister not only assuming universities have not been open to reform but of ensuring that true reform will not be possible under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also provided for such arbitrary actions in section 28.  This section gives her the power to override university charters if they are deemed to be in conflict with the proposed Act.  In the following section, she goes down the same road and wants to repeal the internal university statutes where they are in conflict with the Bill as it relates to terms and conditions, governance, and so forth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> Aside altogether from the legal and constitutional ramifications of these proposals &mdash; they are currently being considered by a number of universities &mdash; even the administrative connotations of these provisions are seminal. Implicit in the provisions of any new charters is that the Minister can turn down a charter or a statute if she is not satisfied with what is proposed.  With all these new powers and presumptions in the Department of Education, I can only wonder how Trinity College has survived to take its place among the great universities of the world under what the Minister obviously regards as the dark and baleful government of its present charter.</P>
    <P>As with charters, university staff have also had the protection of the visitorial system.  The powers proposed for the Minister in section 17 are nothing short of draconian.  We would prefer to turn the visitor into an office that could make a positive contribution to university life, rather than have it operate as a kind of modern inspector general sent out to do the work of an autocratic tsar.  It should be permanent and, as the experience of TCD shows, it can provide an effective mechanism for addressing complaints and settling grievances that would be open to the Minister and all members of faculty.</P>
    <P>There is one principle of the Bill which I broadly welcome, the commitment to quality assessment in terms of accountability.  However, I am disappointed the Minister wants to override the initiatives universities have already in place in this regard.  Section 31 also pre-empts discussions that are currently in progress between the Higher Education Authority and the universities.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil calls on the House to reject the Bill and its proposals to supersede the terms and conditions of current staff, to create arbitrary and summary powers for suspension and dismissal and to repeal protective legislation already on the Statute Book.  We also reject the Government's attempts to interfere with the university's right to independence and freedom which is historically based and socially responsible.  Any dilution of this age-old right could be used to justify further changes in the future, leaving our universities vulnerable to political interference, political expediency and political curbs on its freedom to make decisions in an autonomous way.</P>
    <P>Universities must be allowed to continue to challenge conventional wisdom with the independence afforded to the Judiciary and the media.  A state-controlled university, as distinct from a healthy State-protected one, will become listless, unproductive and intellectually sterile. With this Bill, the Minister has dealt the House a very poor hand from a very weak seat.  If it is passed, the future of our universities is at best very precarious.  I await the constitutional and other legal tests.</P>

      <P>I wish I could say, as I often do at the beginning of a Second Stage speech, that I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill.  Its <Col N="1411" /> publication at least gives us an opportunity to note the important role universities play in our social, cultural and educational life.  It provides us with a rare and valuable opportunity to discuss the current performance and future outlook of the university sector.</P>
      <P>It is worth focusing on the importance of universities in public policy terms.  Universities cater for a total student population of more than 63,000, including part-time students and distance learners.  They currently absorb some £250 million of taxpayers' money each year, a figure that will increase further when free tuition fees have been fully phased in.  They also play a major role in determining our social and economic future by turning out engineers, doctors, accountants, lawyers, scientists, teachers, politicians and administrators, upon whom our quality of life and our ability to create wealth depends.  The Bill will chart the future course of universities well into the next century, at least for the next 20 or 30 years, unless we can do something to repeal it in the meantime.</P>
      <P>In considering legislation it is important to adopt the right approach, but this Bill does not do that.  I am sure all Members would agree there is a definite role for Government in providing university education.  In every liberal democracy Government provides a substantial part of funding for the university system and assists students through tuition fee subsidies or maintenance grants.  What role should Government, as a paymaster for the university system, play in regard to the universities that is commensurate with the concepts of academic independence and freedom.  Essentially, the Bill endeavours to provide a new answer to that question in an Irish context, but I do not agree with it.</P>
      <P>We must start from the premise that political interference is anathema to the very idea of a university and Government should seek to content itself with an overall regulatory role for the university sector.  This means the State has a vital, but limited, range of functions to carry out in terms of the country's universities.  It should protect the interests of the taxpayer by ensuring that State moneys are properly and lawfully spent by universities.  This stewardship role is already being carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Higher Education Authority.  It should protect the interests of the taxpayer by ensuring as far as possible that Government money is well spent by the universities.  This value for money auditing role is also being carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It should seek to monitor and protect academic standards across the university system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This function is currently carried out through the external examiner system and no Government agency is directly involved.  It should seek to maintain a reasonable balance between student numbers in different institutions so that some do not grow into large and unmanageable <Col N="1412" /> bodies while others lack the critical mass to sustain high academic standards.  This function is currently carried out by the Higher Education Authority in its role as adviser to the Department of Education on university funding.  It should monitor and assess the comparative performance of different universities and in the interest of openness, transparency and accountability publish the results.  This will give public policy makers and prospective students an idea of how individual institutions perform in terms of examination results, academic distinctions and the career choices of their graduates.  There is no reason this latter duty, for which no body is responsible at present, could not be carried out by the relevant division in the Department.</P>
    <P>I have outlined a minimalist approach. Bureaucracy and Government interference in the running of the universities is kept to a minimum. Effectively this approach has been used for the management and oversight of the university system since the foundation of the State.  The establishment of the Higher Education Authority on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in 1968 and a statutory basis from 1972 provided a mechanism to improve the financial accountability of the universities but was achieved with a lightness of touch which did not impinge greatly upon the administrative autonomy of universities.  The Minister in this flawed Bill adopts a different approach and one which will not command the support of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister intends to put forward amendments because she knows she will not get it through the other House in its current form.</P>

      <P>Reality strikes.  Much of public policy in Ireland in recent times has been characterised by a tendency to centralise, a preference for State control and a passion for creating more bureaucracy, usually with more places to be filled by political patronage.  This approach is being pursued ever more vigorously at a time when other countries are taking the opposite approach &mdash; less centralisation and Government control with more devolution and autonomy.  The Universities Bill is an attempt to extend this statist philosophy into the area of third level education in an aggressive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively, the Higher Education Authority, a centralised, Government appointed quango, is to be assigned major new powers in running our universities.  I refer, as did Deputy Martin, to one distinguished commentator, the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who has described this centralising, &ldquo;quangoising&rdquo; approach as Thatcherite, and I agree with him.  In many ways, Mrs. Thatcher shared the same passion for central control and the minimisation of local responsibility as her declared enemies in the command economies of Eastern Europe.  It is <Col N="1413" /> richly ironic that a Labour Party Minister should be tarred with this brush as it is a word that the Labour Party's own handlers like to use freely as a term of abuse against their political opponents.</P>

      <P>The powers of the Higher Education Authority will be expanded if this Bill is enacted.  It will acquire power, under section 33(2), to determine how individual institutions allocate their budgets across their different activities and may issue guidelines to them.  The Higher Education Authority will, under section 22(7) and (8), be entitled to demand details of the staffing structure in each university by grade, remuneration and number at the end of each year, and to examine the books if it is not satisfied with the information supplied.  Under section 22(9), the authority will have power to issue guidelines to the heads of individual universities relating to staff numbers and grades, thereby impinging on one of the key areas of management autonomy in the system.  Section 30(1) requires the chief officers of the universities to submit strategic plans to the Higher Education Authority for their institutions and it will have power to review these plans.  The Higher Education Authority will have power, in cases where individual universities do not comply with its wishes, to report them to the Minister for Education, who can then have that report officially published.  The Higher Education Authority will have power to determine the terms and conditions on which universities may borrow money, while any borrowings can only be undertaken with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education.  This list is not exhaustive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions give an idea of the regime which the Minister is endeavouring to construct for the governance of our universities.  The new powers being given to the Higher Education Authority under this Bill must be viewed in the context of the powers it already has.  At present the Higher Education Authority plays a key role in determining the level of Government grant aid for each of the universities.  As this is the major source of income for all the universities, it puts the Higher Education Authority in a very strong position in this sector.  It will be difficult for the universities to defy the wishes of the Higher Education Authority under the new scheme of things.  They could find themselves punished the next financial year by having their grant cut or their staffing structure questioned.  In practice, this new Bill transforms the Higher Education Authority into a state universities board, a <Col N="1414" /> centralised body that will exercise increasing power and influence over the country's university institutions.</P>
    <P>Essentially, this Bill proposes that our universities be given the status of subsidiaries in a very large and bureaucratic semi-State company. This fits in neatly with the kind of perverted, post-colonial administrative system that has developed in this country, which operates on the belief that no public body, whether it is a county council, health board, or even a local dog track can be trusted to run its affairs properly without direction and guidance from a Government office in Dublin.  This outmoded administrative thinking might have some chance of working for dog tracks but it has no chance of working in the world of the modern university because the principle of academic independence is widely respected throughout the developed world.  It is accepted that university institutions should be funded to a large extent from the public purse, but that they should remain independent of national and local government provided they satisfy reasonable conditions of public and financial accountability.  This principle was fought over as long ago as the Middle Ages when disputes between &ldquo;town and gown&rdquo; were a feature of the political landscape.  This Bill is a determined attempt to throw out this historical legacy and to turn the Irish academic world into yet another agency of central Government.</P>
    <P>Its provisions will bear down particularly heavily on Trinity College, Dublin, the oldest university on this island and an institution with more than four hundred years of independent academic tradition behind it.  Perhaps more than any of our university institutions, Trinity has shown that it has the capacity to prosper and develop as an independent body and the confidence and the ability to carve out an international reputation for itself in several fields of academic discipline.  Over centuries, the college has turned out giants of literature, of politics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and science, including Nobel Prize winners.  Among its most distinguished graduates were Burke, Goldsmith, Beckett, Berkeley and Swift.  In recent years the university has been successful in forging links with industry. For the past ten years Trinity has operated a programme for joint university/industry projects and has established partnerships with leading companies such as Elan in the pharmaceutical area and Hitachi in the area of electronics.  Who decided that Trinity was suddenly in need of more Government intervention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trinity College is perhaps the one institution in the Republic to which the Unionists of the North have strong loyalties.  The college has traditionally drawn a large number of its students from the North and continues to do so.  Why is there such keenness to deprive Trinity of its traditional independence and bring it firmly <Col N="1415" /> under the control of the Dublin Government? What signal does the Government want to send to the thousands of Trinity alumni who live in the North?  Does the Minister think that this constitutes respect for their tradition?  Does she think that her centralising initiative will be perceived as a gesture of reconciliation by them? They will view it as the opposite, an insensitive southern State clamouring for parity of esteem in Northern Ireland, but prepared to ignore blindly the claims of longstanding tradition on its doorstep.</P>
    <P>Legal questions arise also.  Has the Government the legislative power to limit Trinity's independence?  The Minister should indicate if she has taken legal advice on this matter and, if so, its import.  Why did she say she will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to allow provisions to incorporate the amended charter for Trinity?  Why can we not see those provisions now?</P>
    <P>I also note that the Bill fails to distinguish properly between Dublin University and Trinity College Dublin.  Trinity College may well be the only constituent college within the University of Dublin, but that does not change the fact that they are separate legal entities.  It is amazing that the University of Dublin should have successfully maintained its independence without interruption through wars and rebellions, changes of Government and changes of flags since 1592 only to fall foul of the Labour Party 404 years later.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a shameful and misguided attempt to destroy the independence and autonomy of one of our oldest and finest academic institutions.  In considering the Universities Bill I am tempted to raise the old maxim: &ldquo;if it aint broke, don't fix it&rdquo;.  I do not believe any of us were aware of any impending crisis in the university system, any breakdown of financial controls&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What the Minister is presenting this evening will of course be amended by her.  That is something she stated in the vaguest possible terms because she knows it will not get through the other House.  No malpractice came to light in relation to the universities.  All the indications are that nothing of that kind could possibly have happened and that our university system is running with reasonable smoothness and efficiency.  Some changes were needed but not to the extent the Minister has laid before us this evening.  It seems as if we are to start vastly increasing the level of central Government surveillance on a sector which has given no evidence that it is in need of it.  Contrast that with the beef industry where there is a clear and urgent requirement for immediate Government action to radically improve our system of quality assurance and consumer protection in the food industry but nothing happened until consumer confidence reached such an all time low that the Government was forced into action.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Government is getting its legislative priorities seriously wrong in bringing forward this type of Bill which is heavy-handed and bureaucratic.  It raises obvious questions about the provenance of this legislation.  On an almost daily basis in this House we hear that important legislation has been put on the long finger for the umpteenth time and will not be brought forward until the next session or maybe not even until the next Dáil.  In some cases we have been waiting years for the introduction of major Bills.  We are awaiting the introduction of the litter pollution Bill, the juvenile justice Bill, a charter for the victims of crime and a school attendance Bill, which we really need.  The list is longer and I could continue.  There is no sign of those important, badly needed Bills concerning social legislation being introduced.  Yet the Government is able to devote its scarce drafting resources and equally scarce Dáil time to consideration of a Universities Bill, which by the admission of the Minister, is fundamentally flawed.</P>
      <P>Why is this type of Bill being brought before the House?  It was not part of the programme for Government for which the rainbow coalition signed up and it is not the type of legislation which has been sought.  I can only surmise the impetus came from the bureaucrats in the Department of Education and that the Minister was only too glad to seize on something that fitted in with the Labour Party's passion for increased State control and increased opportunities for political patronage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already displayed her considerable appetite for greater bureaucracy in the area of education.  In her White Paper on education she set out plans for a national network of regional education boards.  She gave us no idea <Col N="1417" /> of the cost of operating them when they are up and running, but some estimates put the additional cost to the Exchequer at £40 million per year.  There is no public demand for the establishment of the regional education boards. They will be yet another layer of expensive bureaucracy, another bunch of agencies which the Minister can add to her patronage list.  I suppose we should not be all that surprised that the regional education boards found their way into the Universities Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 14(3)(b) provides that the regional education boards, when established &mdash; of course we do not know when that will be &mdash; will have power to nominate one or two members to the governing authorities of universities in their areas.  That is the most remarkable example of quangos appointing people to quangos.  Surely this is not the type of model we want to follow for the development of our education system.</P>
    <P>History has given us a strange and incongruous university structure.  One of our universities is a centuries old institution which owes its origin to the denominational considerations of an earlier age.  Another is a modern, secular institution, less than ten years old.  One of the basic functions of any universities Bill should be to cope with this diversity, to rationalise and modernise Government's relationships with different institutions while still respecting their separate traditions.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the proposals before us tackle this problem in a sensible way &mdash; I am fairly sure they do not.  For example, the National University of Ireland might have made some administrative sense when it was originally established almost 90 years ago.  Today, it makes little sense that a single university body in Merrion Square in Dublin acts as a sort of holding company for different colleges spread hundreds of miles apart around the country.  This Bill proposes that the NUI structure be preserved though each of the constituent colleges would be elevated to the status of university.  I do not see how that makes administrative sense.  Under the Bill DCU with 6,000 students is set to become a fully autonomous institution while UCD with more than 16,000 students is to remain trapped within the outdated NUI structure.  How do we justify a situation whereby one of our oldest and largest third level institutions is condemned to subsidiary status?</P>
    <P>UCC, UCD, UCG and St. Patrick's College have been functioning successfully and efficiently as university colleges for one and a half centuries. St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, has more than two centuries of distinguished academic tradition behind it.  Surely those institutions are now mature enough to be constituted as independent entities in their own right and more than capable of pursuing an independent existence at this stage?  It appears that preserving the NUI is doing no more than preserving an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.  The Bill assigns two main responsibilities to the NUI.  It is charged with <Col N="1418" /> reviewing academic standards in its constituent universities and with establishing matriculation requirements for them.  Why can those functions not be carried out by the institutions?</P>
    <P>There is no longer any need for an intermediate layer of bureaucracy, such as the NUI.  If the Bill will grant all the constituent colleges university status, why can we not go the whole hog and give them full autonomy?  Under the arrangements set out in the Bill, university colleges in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Maynooth will find themselves at the bottom of a very tall bureaucratic pile.  Yet each of these is supposed to become an independent university in its own right.  Each of them will be subservient to the NUI in Dublin, which in turn will be subservient to the Higher Education Authority, which in turn will be subservient to the Minister for Education. Do we really need to have three separate layers of bureaucracy sitting on top of our university system?</P>
    <P>Those are various criticisms of this legislation. However, parts of it are good and welcome.  The Bill provides for gender balance on the new university governing authorities and that is a step in the right direction to opening up new opportunities for women to make a contribution to public life.  The provision for the increased representation of students on the governing authorities is an admission that they are the life blood of any university, but the manner in which that is to be done must be examined.  Why can they not be elected?  The university colleges in Cork, Dublin and Galway are to be finally given their long overdue full university status, albeit within the framework of the NUI.  The position of Maynooth is being regularised within the university system for the first time.  They are positive developments, but those changes could have been catered for in a much shorter and less contentious Bill.  This Bill represents an unwarranted intrusion into university life by politicians and central Government bureaucrats and my party will oppose it on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she will amend the Bill.  It is extraordinary that she introduced a Bill which she admits is fundamentally flawed.  We often hear Ministers say they will listen intently to all our contributions and look forward to responding at the end of the debate to the issues we have raised. The Minister knows this debate is ongoing and is trying to put on a brave face by saying the Bill has been framed in the context of continuing dialogue with the university communities.</P>

      <P>To put this in context, we must remember what universities are all about.  A document called the <i>Magna Carta of European Universities</i> was signed by the rectors of European universities at the celebration of the 900th anniversary of the University of Bologna, the oldest university in the world.  It states:</P>
      <P>The University is an autonomous institution at the heart of society, differently organised because of geography and historical heritage.  It produces, examines, appraises and hands down culture by research and teaching.  To meet the needs of the world around it, its research and teaching must be morally and intellectually independent of all political authority and economic power.</P>
      <P>I commend that statement to the Minister for Education.  The Progressive Democrats will oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> The charter of Trinity College, Dublin was given in 1592 and last amended in 1911, the NUI colleges were set up in 1908 and Maynooth College, which I attended, first operated under a British statute of 1795.  There was legislation in 1989 to set up the excellent universities of DCU and Limerick but in the debates at the time it was recognised that those Acts were limited in their extent and scope and the matter would have to be re-examined when the overall sector was being considered in a legislative framework.</P>
      <P>Apart from quoting history in support of my case, I must also consider the changes in what universities are doing, particularly those in the last 30 years, to see that the provisions under which they govern themselves and their relationship to the wider community need to be brought up to date.  Only 4,000 people were in university when the NUI was set up in 1908; this year there are 50,000.  The contribution of the wider community to universities to assist them in running their affairs amounts to £228 million.  I do not suggest the taxpayer should dictate what universities do, but that underlines the extent of the relationship between the wider community and the universities and the community's legitimate interest in being involved and having a say in how universities organise and govern themselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister has rightly engaged in a lengthy process of consultation in respect of this legislation.  For want of proposals of its own the Opposition is trying to portray consultation as weakness but I commend the Minister for it.  Far too many Ministers come to this House with rapidly drafted legislation on which little consultation with outside bodies has taken place.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> While they may say they are open to suggestions and amendments from all sides of the House, in practice few of them are.  I commend the Minister on her approach.  Contrary to what Deputy Keogh said, not everyone in the wider community is against this Bill.  Many groups within the <Col N="1421" /> universities who have not been represented to any great extent before are glad to see provisions which will advance their position.  I urge her to continue this process of consultation in both Houses and I am satisfied that ultimately we will have a Bill which will be flexible enough to meet the various needs and traditions in our universities while providing an overall framework for their modern governance.</P>
      <P>I commend the provisions on St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  Since the 1970s we have heard various promises to bring this recognised college of the NUI up to university status.  To correct Deputy Keogh, it is a recognised rather than a constituent college at present.  I welcome the provision in the legislation to make St. Patrick's College, Maynooth a constituent university of the NUI to be known as the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  This is another milestone in the distinguished history of that college.</P>
      <P>I am also glad it is gaining university status while remaining within the NUI framework.  I am an NUI graduate and NUI degrees are widely recognised and respected throughout the world. In response to Deputy Keogh's remarks on the NUI, the proposals in the Bill show the extent to which consultation has taken place and NUI graduates are glad the university from which they received their degrees, which has earned such wide respect throughout the world, will continue in existence.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the system of government of the colleges which currently constitute the university, plus the recognised college in Maynooth, will be greatly improved.  Maynooth will have a governing authority for the first time. At present there is no legislation underpinning the recognised college at Maynooth.  Under this Bill, the National University of Ireland, Maynooth will be established on the same statutory basis as the other three constituent universities of the NUI.  Accordingly, it will move from the status of a recognised college of the NUI to a full university.  Of all the university institutions affected by the Bill, the change of status is greatest in the case of Maynooth, which will now become the seventh university in the State.  I hope when the Bill is enacted, as quickly as possible, through these Houses, the recognition as a university in its own right, for which Maynooth has worked so hard for so long, will be accorded to it.  I compliment the efforts of senior staff, academic staff, students and the trustees of the college to consult the Minister and her predecessors to ensure the long-promised upgrading of status is delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of Maynooth the Bill affirms the core values of the university to be the same as those of other universities in the State, that is to advance knowledge through teaching and research, to promote learning among students and society generally, to promote cultural and social life while fostering and respecting the university's tradition, to contribute dynamically <Col N="1422" /> to social and economic development and to promote the highest standards and quality of teaching and research and facilitate life long learning.  I have no doubt that Maynooth already meets those objectives and will continue to do so when the legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>The university at Maynooth has evolved in a unique way, from a clerical base to what is now one of the most diverse universities in the country.  As it is situated on the periphery of the Dublin region it has a unique combination of students from rural and urban areas.  Long before it was fashionable, it made particular efforts to involve adults, people who had left the education system many years previously, in further education through initially its centre for adult and community education and latterly the provision of non-graduate courses not only in the university but in many diverse locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision whereby for the first time there will be student representation on the governing bodies of NUI universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> It is now provided for on a statutory basis, which is very important because for too long students have been fobbed off as second class citizens and lip service has been paid to their supposed membership of the university community. Compared to students in many of the longer established universities in Europe and more recently established universities in Africa and Asia, students here have not been given a central part in the governance of the university.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill non-academic staff in Maynooth and other NUI universities will be given statutory rights to representation on governing bodies. Similarly, in the case of NUI universities non-professorial academic staff will be represented. These are vital provisions if we are to put into practice what we state about the university being a community made up of many diverse parts.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in section 31 that students be included in the evaluation process. Methods of evaluation in universities vary widely. There is need for variation but it is important to ensure that evaluation is conducted on an ongoing basis and that the necessary procedures are put in place.  Unfortunately that has not been the case in all colleges.  As an undergraduate and postgraduate student I found that some colleges are better than others in terms of providing opportunities for students to contribute to evaluation of courses.  I welcome the provision in section 31 which states that the procedures for evaluation shall provide for assessment by students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 32 relating to equality.  Those of us who have been lucky enough to go to university realise that our education system has not provided the same level <Col N="1423" /> of educational opportunity to everybody, and nowhere is this more evident than in the third level sector.  I am glad that trend is changing. From studies undertaken of participation in third level education it is clear that for people who are members of certain socio-economic groups, have certain categories of disability, are members of minority groups or, particularly from a staffing point of view, for women there is no equality of treatment, a stated objective which is not put into practice within colleges or in legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 32 whereby a governing authority shall prepare a statement of the university's policies.  I do not think that can be construed as unwarranted State interference. What is proposed is that universities consider this matter, as many of them have done.  I am aware of courses in a number of colleges which have sought to involve lone parents, social welfare recipients and people with disabilities, but much more needs to be done in that regard.  I hope that when this legislation is enacted and universities have had time to put it into practice there will be greater accessibility to university education by economically and socially disadvantaged people and people from sections of society significantly under-represented on the student body.  It is important that there be equality, including gender equality, in all activities of the university.</P>
    <P>The Opposition criticised the Minister for bringing forward the legislation and said it is not necessary at present.  In my short time here I have rarely detected such a note of conservatism. There is no need to be conservative in respect of our universities.</P>

      <P>I hope universities address the problem of the rat race &mdash; this is experienced by students in second level education and more recently in third level &mdash; which results from semesterisation and academic pressures, to the detriment of many activities in which students have traditionally been involved, particularly clubs, societies and organisations which in many respects allowed them to gain skills and experience which benefited them in later life.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the £1.5 billion contribution made by motorists to the Exchequer,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the fact that taxpayers in Ireland and Europe have already paid for the provision of a proper road network,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the huge social and environmental consequences for local residents,</P>
      <P>calls on the Government to clearly state its opposition to the imposition of tolls on the remainder of the Dublin C-Ring and the Lee Tunnel.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to give all Members an opportunity to make clear to the general public where they stand on the tolling of the remainder of the Dublin C-Ring and the Lee Tunnel.  While the Minister may try to tell the House he has a quasi-judicial role in approving a toll scheme and, for this reason, does not intend to show his hand, no other Member can hide behind that excuse.  For the past 12 months members of the three parties in Government have done their best to convince their electorate that they are opposed to tolls on the roads mentioned.  Tomorrow, when a vote is taken on this motion, the general public will be in a better position to judge who is for and against tolling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> According to the annual report, the National Roads Authority made it clear in August 1995 that it would toll sections of the Dublin C-Ring and the Lee Tunnel.  It commissioned W S Atkins, in association with the ESBI and the Newcastle University Transport Research Group, to prepare a report on the tolling of motorways in the Dublin area and late last year invited tenders for the tolling of the Dublin C-Ring.  Shortly afterwards it had to revise its advertisement and extend the date for the submission of tenders. Apparently, someone in the NRA had forgotten that part of the M50 is already tolled and subject to contractual arrangements.  This caused a legal difficulty.  When the advertisement was corrected a number of firms made detailed submissions. Each and every one of them went to great trouble and expense to present their proposals which included details of toll schemes and possible fall-out of such schemes.</P>
    <P>The NRA sat on these submissions for six or seven months.  According to the annual report, it eventually decided last July, either on its own initiative or with some prompting from a higher authority, that it needed more information, particularly from the Dublin Transportation Initiative group, before it could make a decision on the proposals before it despite all the information it received in the submissions from the firms interested in tolling the motorway.  It also needed the opinion of the experts to whom it has access, the information contained in the report prepared for it by eminent and internationally recognised experts and the expert opinion of the Minister who at one stage rubbished the findings of research conducted by an independent research company on attitudes to tolling.</P>
    <P>According to the annual report, the reason for the delay in announcing a toll scheme is that the NRA wishes to consult with the DTI on the diversion of traffic which would result from tolling.  Is someone or everyone in the NRA telling us it invited tenders for a toll scheme without first consulting the DTI?  Is it telling us that internationally renowned firms of consultants which prepared a report for it on the tolling of motorways in the Dublin area did not at any stage consult the DTI or consider fully possible traffic diversion rates and the fall-out of such schemes?  Is it telling us that, as a body, it did not consider the social implications?  I find that hard to believe.</P>
    <P>The NRA used a traffic model developed by the DTI to make predictions and assumptions.  If what it is telling us is true, it has been grossly incompetent in handling the issue.  Is it telling us that it put three companies to the huge expense of preparing tender documents and making submissions for a toll scheme and then decided to study the social implications?  If so, the Minister should consider its future.  It is unbelievable that it should go so far down this road and then out of the blue start to consider the social implications. <Col N="1426" /> I find it difficult to believe that it would be so unprofessional and incompetent but someone may convince me otherwise.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the NRA is following a political agenda, probably by direction, to postpone making a decision until after the next general election.  It is difficult to believe it would have been unaware of the major objections to the tolling of the M50 and the social and environmental effects of the diversion of traffic until it had received submissions from the companies interested in tolling the motorway. These implications are nothing new.  They were spelled out clearly to the NRA and to the Minister when it was first announced that tolling would take place.  They were highlighted not just by Fianna Fáil Members in this House during Question Time and on another occasion but also by many reputable motoring and environmental organisations.  In addition, many residents' groups in the affected areas made their fears known.  We are now asked to believe that the NRA decided to consider these matters last March when the Minister allegedly expressed concern in this House about the implications of tolling.  I cannot find any reference to that in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe this level of incompetence exists in the NRA and the only logical conclusion I can come to is that the NRA, by direction or otherwise, decided it would be politically unacceptable to attempt to put in place a toll scheme before the next general election. Lest anybody has any doubt about the intentions of the NRA it made them very clear when it announced in its report that it wanted to study the social implications of proceeding with a tolling scheme.  Two or three weeks later, however, its chief executive made it quite clear to the Committee of Public Accounts that he is confident the NRA will have a tolling scheme in place which will have the full backing of the Government and that the Government fully supported the implementation of tolling on the roads in question.  He stated also that the NRA supported tolling on these roads.  If anybody is in doubt it is in the Official Report of the Committee of Public Accounts, and I am putting it on the record of this House, that the NRA is confident it will have a tolling scheme in place.</P>
    <P>Nobody need be under any illusion but that the decision has been made to toll the C ring and the Lee tunnel and it is only a matter of time before that occurs.  The crucial time for this Government will be after the next general election but this motion gives Members the opportunity to state clearly their opposition to such a scheme.  I hope Deputies on all sides of the House will avail of the opportunity to make it clear not just to the NRA but to the Government and to the Minister that they are opposed to the concept of tolling these roads.</P>
    <P>One may ask why Fianna Fáil is opposed to a toll on these roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that the taxpayers of Ireland, and indeed Europe, have already paid for these roads.  Motorists have paid substantially over the years for the provision of proper roads and if successive Governments choose not to use the enormous amounts of money already paid by motorists in taxation to finance these roads, that is not the fault of the motorists and they should not be penalised.  Motorists should not be asked to pay again and again for the same stretches of road.</P>
      <P>Motorists currently pay £1.5 billion in various taxes and that figure is increasing.  Less than one third of that amount is returned to road investment.  It is extremely unfair to ask a section of the community which is paying huge amounts of money in taxation for the provision of reasonable roads to pay to use them once they are provided.  It is akin to asking somebody who has paid £60,000 or £70,000 to build a house to pay for the use of it.</P>
      <P>To put this matter into context, we consider £6.6 billion or £7 billion from the EU over a six-year period to be a staggering figure but during that period motorists will contribute £10 billion to the national Exchequer.  That is an extraordinary figure and it is higher per capita than in any other EU country.  We believe motorists should not be asked to pay more.  Motorists in this country, relative to the indirect tax sector, are similar to the PAYE worker in the direct tax sector.  They are the first to be targeted and are the least respected but they contribute the most.</P>
      <P>In addition to the £1.5 billion in annual taxation it has been calculated that it would cost a motorist using the new sections of the M50, if they are tolled, approximately £1,000 extra per annum.  A PAYE worker would have to earn an additional £2,000 per annum to cover the extra motoring cost.  Such a proposal is totally insupportable.  When one considers that the State coffers this year will benefit to the tune of an additional £120 million from increased car sales, it is clear that motorists are paying enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and the NRA are not persuaded by arguments about the huge tax burden carried by motorists, perhaps they will give careful consideration to the problem of diversion and the damage it will cause, environmentally and socially, in various areas.  It is well known that diverted traffic which avoids paying tolls uses unsuitable alternative routes, frequently through housing estates and residential areas.  Along the stretch of the M50 under consideration for tolling by the NRA residential areas such as Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan, Blanchardstown, Finglas and Ballymun and, on the southern section, Rathfarnham, Dundrum, Leopardstown, Shankill and Bray will be adversely affected by this diverted traffic.  The quality of life for residents in those areas is seriously curtailed because of the inadequacy of the existing roads system.  Major congestion problems arise every day.  The motorway is supposed to provide a solution to <Col N="1428" /> these problems but if it is tolled it will only add to them.</P>
    <P>In any toll scheme there is a diversion rate.  The diversion rate in the case of the M50, according to the NRA, will be one-third.  That figure is regarded as conservative by experts but, assuming it is true, it means that 15,000 vehicles will divert off this road into residential areas in Santry, Whitehall, Finglas, Blanchardstown and other areas including Lucan, Walkinstown, Clondalkin and Tallaght.  Such a diversion will cause an unacceptable level of social and environmental damage in those areas.  This has been recognised not just by Fianna Fáil but by the elected representatives in those areas.  Already Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council have voiced their strong opposition to the scheme and local residents and community groups have recognised that it will cause huge problems.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister not to under estimate the strength of local feeling.  The proposed diversions will mean residential areas will become rat runs for people wishing to avoid paying tolls.  They will cause terror in many residential areas and undoubtedly increase the number of fatalities and injuries on our roads.</P>
    <P>The imposition of tolls will mean extra transport costs for businesses and manufacturers and will add to the already high cost of transport and the competitive disadvantage suffered as a result of Ireland's peripherality.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate on this important subject.  I also look forward to the Minister's response and to Members of this House making their opposition to these tolls clear and unequivocal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  We, in Dublin, are opposed to any further tolls on ring-roads. There are no tolls on the ring-roads around Paris or Rome.  There are tolls elsewhere in Europe but there are none on ring-roads for a very good reason, that is, they want the traffic to use the ring-roads.  They do not want the traffic diverting into housing estates and built up areas.</P>
      <P>We want a free run around the major cities to avoid forcing heavy traffic into residential areas. The people of Dublin already pay two tolls &mdash; one on the East Link and the other on the West Link.  We are prepared to pay those tolls, which were built into those developments from the outset, but we are opposed to further tolls.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, the Minister might ask the local authority and the people who run East Link bridge to mend the potholes on Embankment Road where the new industrial estate is situated. They are highly dangerous and thousands of cars pass over them every day.  I cannot understand how the road was left in that condition when the new industrial estate opened onto Embankment Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two tolled crossings in Dublin is enough.  Extra tolls would be counter productive.  No doubt Dubliners will drive through estates instead of <Col N="1429" /> making use of the motorway.  It has been estimated that some one-third of motorway traffic would go through estates instead of making use of the motorway.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has had representations from Fingal Chamber of Commerce, which is totally opposed to a toll on the Northern Cross Route, and the Automobile Association, which is opposed to further tolls in Dublin.  Indeed, the Fianna Fáil Party is opposed to further tolls in Dublin.  The Northern Cross Route is to open on 6 December.  We look forward to that development which will make a big difference to congestion in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say he must wait until the authority makes its decision.  He stated in reply to an earlier parliamentary question that his only functions related to the approval or otherwise of toll schemes, by-laws and agreements made by the National Roads Authority or local authorities and that the legislation gives the NRA the power to make proposals for a tolling scheme, acceptance or rejection of which would ultimately fall to him.  In this case, I call on him to state that the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Democratic Left are against additional tolls on the Dublin ring-road and, if the authority comes forward with such a proposal, he will make it clear he will not support it.  That would save much time, energy and money in preparing programmes which would not be approved ultimately by the Government.  He should not wait until after the election.  That has been suggested and it is a real fear at this stage.</P>

It was designed primarily to divert traffic away from the city centre, suburban estates and the general internal ring of the city.</P>
    <P>If we place tolls on the Lee tunnel, it will defeat the purpose for which the tunnel was built and it will have very damaging social and environmental repercussions.  It is estimated, for example, as Deputy Dempsey said, that tolling can cause a diversion rate of about one third of traffic.  It is estimated that even a modest toll in Cork would lead to a diversion rate of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent, and that is a conservative estimate.  If there was a high toll, that diversion rate could increase to 40 per cent.  Once we introduce and accept the concept, there are no limits in terms of the degree to which such charges could be increased year by year.  A high diversion rate will inevitably lead to rat running through residential housing estates.  Areas such as Douglas, Mahon, Beaumont and Ballinlough, on the southside of Cork city, and Glanmire, Mayfield and Dillon's Cross, on the northside, will suffer enormously as a result.  The residential amenity of people living in these suburbs would be destroyed because of the rat running.  The Minister is laughing but if he were to travel along the Low Road at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  A high diversion rate will mean that traffic will pass through residential estates in Mayfield to cross to the other side of the city.  Likewise, people travelling from Douglas or west County Cork will drive through Ballinlough or Mahon if a toll road is put in place.</P>

If the Minister is that concerned, he should inform us regarding his future plans for the funding of local authorities.  I will then know whether Cork Corporation will be in a position to maintain the tunnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot help but heckle because I am pressing my point home.</P>
      <P>Road safety is a key aspect with regard to residential areas and has not been given the necessary degree of priority.  If rat running occurs as a result of the introduction of a toll road, safety will be at risk and will be a casualty of this phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Various environmental and amenity schemes within Cork city centre will be undermined because of a high diversion rate.  The idea behind the Lee tunnel is to divert heavy traffic from the city centre and suburbs.  In tandem with this, the streetscape and aesthetic quality of the city will be significantly improved in line with projects currently being implemented by Cork Corporation and plans already in the pipeline. The historic city action plan is one such project which will bring enormous benefits to the North Main Street-South Main Street access to the city and the general area thereabouts.  The improvement of Patrick Street, and the plans the corporation has to make it more pedestrian friendly and more attractive to shoppers, will be undermined if we do not allow the original function of the Lee tunnel to take effect and if there is a significant diversion rate because of road tolling.</P>
      <P>Therefore, tolling will have a negative impact on the future of the city.  It will defeat the purpose and traffic function of the tunnel and undermine the residential amenity of suburban estates as a consequence of rat running.  It will also have undesirable environmental repercussions.  A toll on the Lee tunnel would represent another tax on the hard-pressed motorist, who has already made a major contribution to the project.  I accept the points made by the AA that it is an unjustifiable extra tax and would do more harm than good. Clearly the motoring public have had enough and the Minister should take a more proactive approach on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Martin for sharing time.  I support this important motion and congratulate Deputy Dempsey for bringing it before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> I am against the toll road as a concept because we have one of the smallest car owning populations in Europe and commercial vehicle numbers are lower than the average.  I am particularly concerned about the Cork city area. The original proposal involved the construction of a tunnel or overhead bridge.  The tunnel was chosen as the best option to help traffic coming into the city from the Dublin Road and rural areas of County Cork.  It is also designed to aid the development of Ringaskiddy as the second major national port and relieve traffic problems at Cork Airport.  The introduction of the tunnel would also result in more efficient motoring and encourage motorists not to travel through densely populated areas of Cork city.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the comments of Democratic Left's representative in Cork North Central, Deputy Lynch, because she usually represents the taxpaying public.  However, she has not made her views known on this issue.  Therefore, it is obvious that she believes in increasing taxation on hard-pressed motorists.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the tunnel is aimed at alleviating the problems of commuter traffic in the Cork area but there can be no argument in favour of tolling.  The annual cost of maintaining the tunnel will be in the region of £250,000, which is very substantial.  The tunnel will be only 600 metres in length which is very small in a European context.  If the motoring public must pay this cost, it will defeat the purpose of the tunnel.  The NRA budget for the maintenance of national primary roads is £26 million per annum. Tunnel roads are more expensive to operate and why must the motoring public pay for such a grandiose facility?  Car users pay £1.5 million in tax but only 25 per cent of that figure is reinvested in our roads.  Therefore, 75 per cent of motoring tax is paid to the Exchequer, which is very unfair.</P>
    <P>A toll payment is a blunt instrument if one is a regular road user.  Toll roads and bridges are popular on the continent but in France, which is a major user of toll roads, there is much lower taxation.  Approximately 87 per cent of Irish people claim that cars are too heavily taxed. Therefore, two out of three members of the motoring public are not in favour of toll roads which should send a message to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Why has there been a reduction in the development of roads and by-passes in the Cork area?  After last weekend, the Minister must be aware that action is required to help the motoring public.  It was reported on national television news programmes that there was a five mile tailback in County Kildare which is very frustrating to taxpaying motorists.</P>
    <P>Roads passing through towns are becoming very dangerous because of the huge volumes of traffic being created by the development of ring roads and by-passes.  Government revenue will exceed £1.7 billion in 1996, which represents 16 to 17 per cent of total revenue.  The average family car has a 1.5 litre engine and costs in the <Col N="1433" /> region of £15,000.  Families are often hard-pressed to provide the money to purchase a car and why should breadwinners be further levied with the highest motoring taxes in the world?  Toll roads are popular throughout Europe and lower petrol prices are not the answer for Irish taxpayers and road users.</P>
    <P>Roads in County Cork have deteriorated substantially in the past two years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann noting</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, sets out guidelines on the tolling of national roads which are similar to those adopted by successive Governments since 1985;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that these guidelines were endorsed in the Operational Programme for Transport, which was launched on 9 November 1994 by Deputy Michael Smith, then Minister for the Environment, and Deputy Brian Cowen, then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the Operational Programme for Transport indicated that it was anticipated that up to £100 million might be raised from tolling national roads;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the initiative in deciding which national roads, if any, might be subject to tolls rests with the National Roads Authority;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" />&mdash;that the procedures which must be complied with before a toll can be imposed on any road include the making of a toll scheme, the giving of public notice and the submission of the scheme for the approval of the Minister for the Environment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that where there are objections to a scheme, a public inquiry must be held before a final decision can be taken on the scheme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the Minister for the Environment, because of his quasi-judicial role in making the final decision under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993 on toll road proposals, is not free to comment on particular proposals in advance of such decision; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the concerns expressed by the Minister in his reply to Parliamentary Question No 108 of 27 March 1996 in relation to any scheme to toll the Dublin C Ring Road and the range of issues to which he will have regard in the assessment of toll proposals;</P>
    <P>endorses the Minister's view that the submissions made in the public consultation process provided for under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993 and the effects of traffic diversion on residential and other areas should bear heavily on any decision which he may be called upon to make should toll proposals be presented to him for decision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This motion is a classic example of the inconsistencies shown by the Fianna Fáil Party, a classic example of how policies vigorously pursued by it in Government are jettisoned as soon as it find itself in Opposition.  The terms of the motion, and the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party to the tolling issue generally, are quite extraordinary, given that party's long record in promoting tolling, both in principle and in relation to specific routes.</P>
    <P>The motion is another illustration of the Fianna Fáil Party's willingness to jump on every bandwagon, respond to every headline and, generally, try to be all things to all men.  I do not think that the plain people of Dublin or of Cork, or the motorists of Ireland, will be fooled by Fianna Fáil's new-found concern to protect them from tolls.  I want to put a few simple facts on the record to explain why I make this claim.</P>
    <P>Since the late 1970s various administrations, but particularly Fianna Fáil-led Governments, have indicated a willingness to consider the use of toll-financed private sector capital for road development.  That is why the moving of a motion at this time opposing tolls on the Dublin C Ring and the Lee Tunnel is, to say the least, somewhat surprising, given that party's record in promoting the use of tolls.  One might go further and suggest that the sudden conversion of Fianna Fáil can only be described as blatant opportunism.</P>
    <P>A review of the last 15 to 20 years or so will show that Fianna Fáil Ministers developed the <Col N="1435" /> statutory basis for tolling and adopted a policy of tolling key sections of the national road network as a mechanism to raise funding for the development of that network.  Specific initiatives to extend tolling on the Dublin C Ring were developed and pursued by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate some of their specific initiatives on tolling.  In December 1978, it was a Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment, Sylvester Barrett, who introduced the Local Government (Toll Roads) Bill, 1978, which was subsequently enacted in December 1979.  This provided a statutory basis for the charging of tolls on existing or new roads and provided mechanisms to enable road authorities to make schemes for the establishment of toll systems or to enter into agreements with third parties for the establishment of toll systems.</P>
    <P>In May 1979 the same Fianna Fáil Minister, Sylvester Barrett, presented the Road Development Plan for the 1980s to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In relation to tolls, this clearly said, in response to approaches from the private sector, that the Fianna Fáil Government of the time was open to the idea that suitable road projects, including motorways and river crossings, might be built on a toll basis, and it said that the Fianna Fáil Government was open to the involvement of interested private enterprise in the design, construction, financing and operation of such projects.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the Fianna Fáil Government submitted an operational programme for EU assistance and, once again, confirmed its interest in obtaining toll-financed private investment for national roads.  That application for assistance included a technical annex spelling out four road projects thought suitable for tolling.  These included the Dublin Ring Road and the downstream crossing of the River Lee.</P>
    <P>In December 1990, the Operational Programme on Peripherality was launched by three Fianna Fáil Ministers, Deputy Séamus Brennan, Padraig Flynn and John Wilson.  This programme stated that the Government was anxious to obtain toll-financed private investment for the development of national primary roads and had identified three major improvement projects which might be potentially suitable for tolling by private investors.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Ministers did not simply issue major policy statements on tolling.  They went further.  In March 1989, the then Minister, Padraig Flynn, now EU Commissioner, oversaw the issue of an invitation on an EU-wide basis to submit proposals for toll-based investment in the Dublin Ring Road.  On foot of this, as construction of the Western Parkway was drawing to a close, an exclusive negotiation mandate was awarded to a consortium.  Heads of agreement were negotiated and submitted to Dublin County Council, as the then tolling authority, but the council rejected the proposal in October 1990.  Notwithstanding this <Col N="1436" /> rejection, the Fianna Fáil commitment to consider toll-based private sector investment remained and was reiterated in the Operational Programme on Peripherality launched by the Fianna Fáil Ministers in the following December.</P>
    <P>The current statutory provisions for tolling are contained in the Roads Act, 1993, introduced by one Fianna Fáil Minister and enacted under another.  This transferred to the National Roads Authority the tolling powers in relation to national roads which were clearly seen by Fianna Fáil as a logical extension of the Authority's overall responsibilities in respect of national roads.</P>
    <P>In the National Development Plan, published in October 1993, the Fianna Fáil-led Government, with Deputy Michael Smith as Minister for the Environment, indicated that it wished the National Roads Authority to undertake a thorough review of the scope for tolling national roads and it suggested a target of up to £100 million which might be raised in this way.</P>
    <P>Following this, the Community Support Framework, launched on 15 September 1994 by the then Minister for Finance, now Leader of Fianna Fáil and a signatory of this motion, explicitly and positively stated that private finance mechanisms would be actively sought to support the development of transport infrastructure.  Did Deputy Ahern expect that private financiers were going to contribute, without any reward or return, but just in the public interest, to the roads programme?  Was it not the case that he, like all the other Fianna Fáil Ministers, planned that private investment would be repaid by tolls?</P>
    <P>The most recent tolling initiative involving Fianna Fáil Ministers occurred less than two years ago.  On 9 November 1994, very close to the last time Fianna Fáil held office, the Ministers for the Environment and Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputies Smith and Cowen respectively, formally launched the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999 which pointed out that, at the request of the Government, the National Roads Authority was conducting a thorough review of the scope for tolling national roads and that it anticipated up to IR£100 million might be raised in this way.  I think I have done enough at this stage to demonstrate the glaring inconsistency of the Fianna Fáil Party and its last-minute conversion to new beliefs, like St. Paul, on the road to the next general election.  If Fianna Fáil, in Opposition, can do no better than to renege on what it stood for in Government since 1979, I suggest that the only road it will travel will be a cul-de-sac, or the road back to the Opposition benches, after the general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of the Fianna Fáil motion refers to the contribution made annually <Col N="1437" /> to the Exchequer by the motoring public &mdash; and the extent of this contribution must, of course, be acknowledged.  There seems to be an implication in the motion that all the revenue derived from the motoring public should automatically be ploughed back into transport infrastructure.  That would suit me very well, as the Minister responsible for road development.  Fianna Fáil is practical enough to know that is not a sensible proposition.  To suggest that all the revenue received from taxation on motor vehicles should be restricted solely for funding of the roads sector is to ignore the consequences for a whole range of other Government services, such as health and education, which benefit the needy and less privileged in society, and which cannot be financed by the assignment of related revenue sources.</P>
      <P>Another rather peculiar aspect of the wording of the Fianna Fáil motion is its reference to the fact that &ldquo;the provision of a proper road network&rdquo; has already been paid for.  Are we to take it from this that Fianna Fáil is satisfied that the national road network is now fully up to standard, and that no further investment is needed?  Obviously that is not the case.  Is Fianna Fáil telling the House that a proper network of county roads has already been paid for &mdash; if so, I would like to know where the money went. Judging by the condition of the network when I took office, I do not believe my Fianna Fáil predecessors invested the billions to which it refers in the county road network.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the Progressive Democrats amendment which wants the House to recognise what it describes as &ldquo;the lack of progress in improving our national roads&rdquo;.  Our national road network is not yet fully up to standard, but real progress has been made, and is continuing to be made.  The Government is continuing the task of creating the transport infrastructure necessary to underwrite our social and economic progress and is allocating unprecedented levels of investment to the task.</P>
      <P>While the Transport Operational Programme is an integrated one, covering all modes of transport &mdash; road, rail, sea and air &mdash; the development of the national primary road network remains a key priority.  We need good roads if we are to create sustainable economic development.  We need them for trade, tourism, development of the food industry, local development, etc., and they are essential to meet our employment targets &mdash; targets which would be shared by all sides.</P>
      <P>The national primary roads measures under the Operational Programme for Transport focus on four key strategic corridors: North-South: Belfast-Dublin-Rosslare-Waterford-Cork; Southwest: Dublin-Limerick/Shannon and Cork; East-West: Dublin-Galway and Sligo; Western: Sligo-Galway-Limerick-Waterford-Rosslare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement with the European Commission requires that at least 70 per cent of the total expenditure on national primary roads will be on <Col N="1438" /> these corridors, with priority being given to investments which yield the maximum economic benefit.  Special emphasis is being placed on a network approach to the implementation of the development programme, combining major and smaller improvements with road pavement improvement.  Evidence of this programme is widespread and the litany of major project completions, such as bypasses of Athlone, Cahir, Longford, Mullingar, Bray-Shankill, Roscrea and major projects such as Sliabh Riach, Mulcon Valley, Cork Southern Ring, Bolton Hill, Enniscorthy-Wexford, Bandon Road, etc., if listed in full, would exceed the time allocated to me this evening.</P>
    <P>The overall target is to complete the development of the national primary road network by 2005 and to provide an inter-urban travel speed on completion of 80 kph.  At the end of 1993, 35 per cent of the network was adequate or improved, and this had increased to 42 per cent at the end of 1995 with the completion of projects such as the Lucan-Kilcock, Mullingar, Newbridge and Roscrea bypasses.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to my time constraint I would prefer to finish my speech but when the Deputy speaks I will take note of his comments.  The target is to extend this standard to 53 per cent by end 1999, with the improvement of a further 11 per cent under way.  We are well on the way to achieving that ambitious target.</P>
      <P>As regards county and regional roads, my term of less than two years in office has been marked by the adoption and implementation of a major restoration programme, with an unprecedented level of funding.  To get that programme under way, additional grant allocations of £20 million were made to county councils in July 1995.  This money financed almost a thousand roadworks schemes, and upgraded nearly 1,600 kms of road. The special additional provision for the restoration programme was increased substantially in 1996, bringing to £73 million the total grants available this year for works under the programme, and to £146 million the total State grants for non-national roads this year, an unprecedented sum.</P>
      <P>The restoration programme is now producing the required results, both in terms of value for money and outputs, and local communities are beginning to see the fruits of increased expenditure by the Government in this important area.  Our ten year programme will transform the network, and the lives of all those who depend on these roads for economic or social purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £73 million available for the programme in 1996 financed completion, by the end of August, of 3,500 road schemes, with 5,800 km of road <Col N="1439" /> benefiting.  This is an unprecedented assault on the potholes which have been the butt of jokes for decades.  The Government is doing something about it.  It will finance completion, by the end of the year, of a total of more than 4,000 road schemes across the country, with over 6,600 km of road &mdash; or nearly 8 per cent of the entire network of regional and county roads &mdash; benefiting from the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>Progress has undoubtedly been made in road development in recent years, but Deputies on all sides will recognise that the needs are still great, in relation to both the national and the local networks.  We should look at the case for tolling in this context, and take note of the procedures which must be followed before a toll can be imposed on any public road.  We cannot afford to close off totally the possibility of raising extra funds for road development, especially as we look to the period after 1999 when our receipts from the Structural Funds may not be as great as they now are.  Neither should we rush into particular schemes, without full consideration of the consequences.</P>
    <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993.  Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads.  The initiative in deciding which roads, if any, should be subject to tolls rests with the NRA or the county authority, as appropriate.  However, before a toll can be imposed on any road, a number of procedures must be complied with. These include the making of a toll scheme, the giving of public notice and the submission of the scheme for the approval of the Minister for the Environment.  Where there are objections, a public inquiry must be held before a final decision can be taken on any scheme.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan 1994-99, sets out guidelines on the tolling of national roads. The guidelines provided, among other things, that any funding obtained from tolls would be regarded as additional to the planned State investment and used to accelerate the development of the national road network; private investment should generally meet at least 20 per cent of the capital cost of the toll road, with the exact level being determined by negotiation in each individual case; and that the assessment of all toll proposals would have regard to the diversion of traffic likely to be caused by tolling and the probable impact on adjacent residential areas.</P>
    <P>I have no quibble with these guidelines under which the National Development Plan envisaged the development of toll proposals to generate the revenue to which I referred.  As the Minister responsible for road development, the House would expect me to be among the last to turn away from any new source of revenue which would enable us to accelerate the much desired <Col N="1440" /> road building programme.  There are other factors relevant to tolling.  For instance, with unrestricted access to the route, traffic volumes on the Dublin C Ring could quickly reach capacity levels; with this in mind, the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative specifically identified road user charging as one of the measures which could be considered to control the growth in traffic on the route and obviate the need for heavy additional investment in expanding its capacity.</P>
    <P>Tolling of ring roads must be tailored to local circumstances.  Any tolling proposals must be considered in the context of implementing environmentally sound traffic management and urban planning policies, as well as in the context of infrastructure financing.  I reiterate that those environmental considerations will bear heavily should any decision fall to me to be made.</P>
    <P>Arising from comments I made last March, the National Roads Authority decided in conjunction with the Dublin Transportation Office to give the matter further detailed examination and I understand that examination is under way.  At this stage, no toll scheme in respect of the Dublin C ring, the Lee tunnel or any other road has been submitted to me.  If such schemes are proposed, they will be processed in accordance with the provisions of the Roads Act, 1993, which provides for a full and rigorous assessment of any such proposals and will give all interested parties a full opportunity to comment.</P>
    <P>I have a quasi-judicial function in relation to tolling procedures and, because of this, it would be wrong of me to comment on the merits or otherwise of specific proposals which may be submitted to me for final decision.  I do not intend to depart from this convention which has been observed by all my predecessors.  However, I assure the House that any proposals submitted to me will be carefully assessed.</P>

I am acutely aware of the problems of traffic congestion.  Many areas in my constituency have problems with rat running.  All the main roads are seriously congested and all the junctions overloaded.  The only reason the residents are not engaged in open revolution is because the M50 is soon to be complete and will bring some relief.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the M50 is to remove traffic from residential areas and to improve access to various parts of the city and county.

If residents are aware beforehand that there are plans to toll a road and it is clear that a road will be built on that basis there will be general acceptance, although that acceptance may not be enthusiastic.

A sham investigation is being carried out by the National Roads Authority and there will be further detailed examination of the question.

      <P>Northside Dublin TDs will have an opportunity tomorrow to vote against the imposition of a toll on the M50.  My constituents are anxious to see this road opened at the earliest possible date, which I understand will be early in December.  Motorists have already paid by way of car tax for this road, which is also being funded by the EU.  Less than half of the £1.5 billion paid by motorists by way of various taxes is returned to them through investment in roads.  Motorists who use the M50 are being asked to pay more and the clear message we want to send from the House is that they should not be required to do this.  I accept that the Minister has a quasi-judicial role in this area.  I do not mind if he sits on his hands but he should take the leash off northside Government Deputies and let them vote against the imposition of tolls on the M50 and the Lee Tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> Motorists in my constituency are not prepared to pay more for this road.  If the toll is imposed it will place an additional burden of £1,000 per year on hard pressed PAYE motorists in my constituency who use this road.  I am not prepared to stand over this.  The Minister referred to the problem of diverted traffic.  My constituents in the village of Saint Margaret's, Baskin, Cloghran, Santry, Turnapin and other areas know all about this problem.  The traffic must be diverted off already over burdened roads.  An estimated ten million people use the airport, with all the welcome business that brings to my area, and if a toll is put on the M50 motorists will continue to use the already over burdened narrow roads instead of this superb new road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister asked that question as I wish to address that point.  The toll was imposed on that bridge on the basis that it was built with private sector funds.  It was understood and accepted by people well in advance of the completion of that marvellous facility that it would be tolled.  This was regarded as a necessary sacrifice to ensure the completion of this essential link between the north and south of Dublin and between the north and south of my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The part of the Dublin C Ring which will be opened on 6 December was not funded to any extent by private funds.  The Minister said that private investment should generally meet at least 20 per cent of the capital cost of the toll road with the exact level being determined by negotiation in each individual case.  That guideline was set out in the National Development Plan, 1994-99, which was adopted by Fianna Fáil in Government.  If this guideline means anything then there will not be a toll on the Dublin C Ring. I do not understand why the Minister did not say this instead of waving a fig leaf and saying he is a quasi-judicial personage who cannot open his mouth in the House because he sits on a notional judicial bench in the Custom House.  I would remind him that he also sits on a Front Bench in this House where according to the canons of political correctness, which his party has propounded in recent years, he is strictly accountable to us.

      <P>We are opposed to the imposition of tolls on the remainder of the Dublin C Ring and the Lee Tunnel.  However, the Minister has not dealt with this issue.</P>
      <P>The Dublin C Ring runs from the airport through Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Lucan, Palmerstown, Clondalkin and Tallaght.  One third of a million people live in close proximity to this road and there will be hundreds of thousands more living near it when the Southern Cross Route is completed.  It is absurd to suggest that there will be further tolling on this road.</P>
      <P>A key aspect of the problem is further tolling. Substantial moneys were allocated by the European Union towards this road and it would be a breach of EU law for the Minister to sanction any further tolling on this road.  If he is going to act as a quasi-judicial personage I hope he takes this point into account in making his decision.  The reality is that these moneys were given by the European Union on a particular basis and it is highly discriminatory to have two tolls on such a short stretch of motorway.  If the Minister imposes a toll on the C Ring I will make a complaint to the European Commission in Brussels and request it to consider whether this State is in breach of its international obligations.</P>
      <P>For all those reasons I am amazed the Minister did not clear the air on this issue.  The section of the C Ring to the airport will be opened on 6 December.  No booths will be constructed between now and 6 December and I hope the Minister will confirm on that day that there will be no tolls.  I am surprised the Minister did not avail of the opportunity this evening to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>Since the question of private investment was raised, are there proposals before the Minister on the extension of the transportation scheme or will we be told again that he is a quasi-judicial personage and does not know anything about planned investment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of clear-cut reasons the Government should dismiss without reservation a proposal to impose tolls on the Dublin ring road or the Lee tunnel.  These extremely important components of the overall national roads network have been added to improve traffic flows in and near Cork and Dublin, our two major centres of population.  The imposition of a toll collection system, irrespective of how efficient, could have only a detrimental effect on overall traffic flows on each facility. Such an eventuality would be at variance with the overall objective of both schemes.  On the grounds of efficiency alone, it would be counterproductive to impose tolls on these two facilities.  There is a nuisance aspect to the imposition and collection of road tolls.</P>
      <P>Government revenue statistics illustrate the extremely high tax contribution of motorists. When one combines the cost of vehicle purchase and related taxes, road tax and fuel duties, approximately £1 in every £6 collected by the Government each year comes from motorists.  In this context, can anyone seriously suggest that a further burden should be placed on their backs?</P>
      <P>In modern society the use of a car is almost essential in everyday life.  It is required to travel to work, to bring children to and from school, for shopping, commercial purposes and recreational use.  The car has become a core part of life for the majority of family units.  It is argued from time to time that people should make greater use of our public bus and train transport facilities and such a view may be valid to some extent.  I support the concept that public transport is often an ideal way to travel and that it should be encouraged where possible.  However, even with a far greater level of development, the public transport system can only realistically aim to cater for a minority of the travelling requirements of our population.  The use of cars and other vehicles on our roads system plays a central role in everyday life.</P>
      <P>As legislators our focus must be firmly on taking all possible steps to ensure that the roads system operates efficiently, continues to develop to the highest international standards and, above all, provides the highest possible level of safety for travellers.  It is important to recognise that much has been achieved in each of those areas. Our overall roads infrastructure continues to improve, with a number of notable achievements in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>A greater emphasis on the need for responsible driving has made a positive contribution to at least controlling the rate of road accidents.  Similarly, the gradual improvement in the overall quality of our road stock can lead only to improved safety standards. Taking the overall position into account, there is no justification for the imposition of tolls on these vital new additions to our road facilities in Cork and Dublin.  The average motorist has made more than a fair contribution to the State's coffers, whether through purchase duties, road or fuel tax.  It would be an unjustified imposition for the Government to foolishly decide to twist the motorists' arms that bit further.  Whatever gains might be achieved in revenue would be more than offset by the inefficiency and nuisance value associated with road tolls.</P>
      <P>I fervently hope the Government takes this opportunity to line up behind the Fianna Fáil proposal on this matter.  It is superior to any form of toll imposition which might be suggested.  If the Government fails to support this motion it will make two major mistakes.  It will send out a message of total indifference to the needs of all motorists and needlessly throw away some of the benefits of traffic flow efficiency that will automatically come from opening these two exciting additions to our national transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Shortall was vigorous in her protest at tolling in an area which affects her, she was critical of Fianna Fáil for doing likewise.  In our motion we refer specifically to two areas.  The Minister stated that the people of Cork would not be misled by Fianna Fáil on this matter.  He must not have his ear to the ground.  He should talk to his colleagues in Cork &mdash; although he does not have many &mdash; because the people of Cork are totally opposed to the imposition of a toll on the Lee tunnel.  We have waited for this facility for years and are conscious of the contribution it will make to the roads structure in Cork.  I acknowledge that vast sums of money have been provided for the Cork area by the Minister and his predecessors, but the area around the Blackpool bypass has been neglected for many years.  I was pleased the Minister acknowledged on his visit to Cork that money was available when I had responsibility in this area but, unfortunately, local efforts stifled development because of a demand for a public inquiry.  If tolls are introduced on the Lee tunnel, the area to which I just referred will suffer most.  The Minister talked about what Deputy Smith and his Fianna Fáil predecessors did while in Government.  I am pleased to note that one of the Minister's colleagues opposes the introduction of a toll on the Dublin ring road.  A toll on the Lee tunnel would also be unfair and unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motorists are contributing £1 in every £6 to the Exchequer and we now want to place a further imposition on them.  If tolls are introduced motorists will not use the new facilities, they will <Col N="1448" /> simply travel through estates and the other parts of our cities from which we are trying to divert them.  It is pointless for the Minister to shake his head.</P>

We are not against the concept of tolling, but it is not in the best interests of Cork or Dublin on this occasion to introduce tolls.  The people of Cork are not on the Minister's side in this matter.  I am here tonight to tell him not to proceed with the introduction of tolls.  He should withdraw his opposition to the motion.</P>

That might not be earth shattering, but the traffic travelled through the school which paints a different picture.  A regional road divides Allen national school.  The junior classes are one side and the rest on the other.  The school is situated close to a Roadstone quarry which creates enormous traffic problems as well as health problems for the children as they journey to and from school.</P>
      <P>In the late 1970s the case for a new school was first put by the people of Allen.  There were certain difficulties in the early stages and successive Ministers refused to provide the finances to allow the school to go ahead.  There were planning permission problems also which were overcome recently.  At a recent meeting with the Minister the delegation told her about the difficulties it had, particularly with planning permission.  Planning permission has now been granted and parents, pupils and teachers want the Minister to give the green light for the provision of the school.  There are serious health and safety problems for the children because of the school's location and the accommodation in the school. The area medical officer's report on the school raised a number of concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not ideal that the junior school should be located on the opposite side of the road to the senior school.  Junior schoolchildren have no shelter on wet days and no supply of drinking water which is essential for young children.  It is virtually impossible to prevent them drinking from an unsuitable supply and this poses a risk to them.  The senior school, both building and grounds, is deficient in many ways.  The toilets are inadequate and the floors when wet create a <Col N="1449" /> dangerous, slippy arena.  There is no indoor supply of drinking water and this poses the same risk to these children as has been highlighted in the junior school and it is almost impossible to prevent children drinking from an unsuitable supply.  One would expect a hot supply for handwashing and this is not available.  The heating system continues to fail.  It is no longer cost effective to spend money on maintenance there.  The sewerage system is overloaded.  It would appear that because of uneven sloping yard surface, surface water flows into the system and during recent flooding raw sewage was about to flow freely but for the intervention of school staff.</P>
    <P>Teachers in the school have given many years of dedicated, conscientious instruction to the pupils and have been working from rapidly deteriorating conditions.  They have lived in silence for too long but the parents have had enough.  The Minister is presently drawing up her list for capital expenditure next year and I call on her to ensure money is provided for a new school in Allen.  A better case can hardly be made anywhere else in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to this House the current position regarding Allen national school and I thank him for his words of encouragement.  The school has a staffing level of principal plus five assistant teachers, one shared remedial teacher and one resource teacher.  The school's enrolment was 188 pupils on 30 September 1996.  A building project at the school was included in the Department's 1994 capital building programme.  The inclusion of the project in the programme enables the project to progress through the architectural planning process.</P>
      <P>The school is currently located on a split site. The main building consists of two permanent classrooms and a prefab.  There are three prefabs on another site across the road from the main building and it is planned to construct the new school on this site.  The plans provide for the construction of four classrooms, a GP room and ancillary accommodation.  The school will continue to use three prefabs as classrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position on the project at Allen school is that all the planning work has been completed and the contract documentation is ready.  The Deputy will appreciate that a decision on the timing of the tender process must be taken in the light of contractual commitments for 1997 and the funds which will be available in 1997. Both these matters are under consideration.  I expect this process will be finalised shortly and I would then hope to take a decision on the tender process for this school.  I confirm that the planning process is finished.  Now is the time to put the case for Allen school on to the list for funding and I assure the Deputy and the other Deputies and Senators in the area who have been in touch that every effort will be made to ensure <Col N="1450" /> the project is progressed at the earliest opportunity.  I thank him again for the pleasant way in which he put his case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter on foot of a letter I received.  A copy was sent to the Minister.  It outlines the matter in graphic detail and is better than any speech that I could make.  The woman in question has a child aged eight and states that the child knows the difference between right and wrong and is generally well behaved.  His previous school teachers expressed concern regarding his concentration and his ability to start, follow through and complete a task.  She goes on to state that his teacher said in the past that the child had difficulty getting information from blackboard to brain to hand to copybook.  His vision and hearing were tested and found to be fine and the child's health is generally good.  In September 1996 the child returned to school and on 10 September, seven days into the new term, his teacher demanded an educational assessment for a learning difficulty.  There were difficulties in trying to get this done.  The woman was referred by her doctor to the Eastern Health Board in Naas which referred her to a child guidance clinic which refused to see the child because it deals with behavioural difficulties and not learning difficulties.  She then contacted the psychological assessment unit in the Department of Education, but due to cutbacks there is no child psychologist for north Kildare even though one is available in south Kildare.  There are child guidance clinics available to some of the major Dublin hospitals, but as the child does not live in the catchment area of those Dublin hospitals those clinics are unable to help.</P>
      <P>She subsequently contacted the director of community care in the Eastern Health Board in Dublin and he informed her that if the board dealt with one child from north Kildare it would have to deal with all the children from that area and his budget is already overstretched.  She then contacted the director of community care in the Eastern Health Board in Naas and he advised that he would request an assessment and a school teacher's report and depending on the position he might be able to arrange for the educational psychologist in south Kildare to deal with this case.  She subsequently contacted the community welfare officer to see if it would be possible to send her child to a private psychologist, but the supplementary welfare allowance does not nearly cover the cost involved.  She got a sympathetic hearing from the Minister's office, but little else. She then contacted a primary education psychologist who told her the fee would be approximately £130 to £150.  That parent is living on deserted wife's benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final paragraph in her letter is significant and sums up the matter.  It states that the total result so far is that a child is desperately unhappy, <Col N="1451" /> confused and who, while trying his hardest, cannot seem to cope with the regular school workload and curriculum for an average eight year old.  The letter goes on to state that one frustrated hardworking teacher with 36 children in her class can only spend so much time on her child.  It also states that one school principal cannot put the child into a remedial class without an educational assessment as it is already overcrowded and under-resourced for the population of the school.  It also states that one upset and angry mother would like to do the best for her child but she is not a qualified teacher.  I followed up that letter and what it states is correct.</P>
    <P>It is upsetting that in the past year I have read that the numbers employed in the Civil Service have increased dramatically and the number of teachers employed by the Department of Education has also increased significantly, but the increase in the number of primary teachers and others employed in that area is minuscule.  The greatest increase has been in the numbers employed in the third level sector.  In the four years prior to June 1996 there has been an increase of 22.7 per cent in the numbers employed in the third level sector.  I have continually berated Ministers of all shades to prioritise in their Departments.  What priorities has a Government that decides to allocate £40 million to cover the abolition of third level education fees while it cannot employ a few educational psychologists at primary level?  Surely a proper psychological service at primary level would be more beneficial to our people, particularly our children.  Has it not been proved time and again that early intervention is far more beneficial to everyone in the longterm, not least to the taxpayer because it solves all types of difficulties?  This sector was the first to be hit.  As a political society, we appear to have a strange set of priorities in that we do not put resources into the primary level but concentrate them in other areas.  This case speaks for itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCreevy for raising the matter.  At present, the lead Department in supplying a psychological service to national schools is the Department of Health. Assessments are provided by health boards, voluntary agencies funded by health boards or by the Department of Health.  Responsibility for arranging assessments for pupils rests with the director of community care of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, <i>Charting Our Education Future</i>, states the Government's intention of expanding the psychological service provided to schools by the Department of Education.  Provision of the psychological service will be a function of the new education boards and expansion will proceed as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, progress has already been made.  The Department of Education currently employs 37 <Col N="1452" /> psychologists in the schools' psychological service.  Of these, 20 are deployed in post primary schools, 14 in national schools and three work in a senior supervisory capacity.</P>
    <P>The Department has provided a psychological service to post primary schools for a number of years, including those in north Kildare.  In September 1990 a pilot project providing a psychological service to national schools in west Tallaght/Clondalkin and south Tipperary was initiated.  The pilot phase has now been successfully completed and the four psychologists employed in the project have been confirmed in permanent appointments.</P>
    <P>In 1995 ten additional psychologists were appointed to develop further the service provided to national schools.  In expanding this service priority was given to schools in disadvantaged areas.  Psychologists are deployed in national schools in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick as well as in the original pilot areas mentioned.</P>
    <P>Any further expansion will take place within the context of the general establishment in the public service.  In assigning psychologists in the future, account will be taken of the needs of particular areas and of groups of pupils.  The needs of north Kildare will, of course, be included in that consideration.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter which I tabled last Friday, the day after the significant Supreme Court decision in this case.  I heard, with some glee, the Minister's contribution in the Seanad. Like many of the Senators who contributed to the debate, I very much appreciate the work the Minister has done on this matter and the manner in which he addressed the Fianna Fáil amendment tabled today in response to an amendment from the Labour Party which was more or less welcoming the decision.</P>
      <P>The four residents who have taken this case over the past number of years have put their houses and livelihoods on the line.  The time has passed for congratulating and welcoming the decision, it is now time for action.  I made the point during the past week or so that the Government had an opportunity for the past two years to have an each way bet on this issue and now it is time for decisions.  I compliment and thank the Minister for the manner in which he addressed the Fianna Fáil amendment, which he acknowledged strengthened the deliberations of the Seanad in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised this issue last Thursday I made a point about the costs borne by the litigants to date.  I am thankful they were awarded their costs in the High Court and the Supreme Court, but as the Attorney General will know they are party and party costs, the costs of the court action. There have been a great deal of additional costs that they might not be allowed in the normal court action, which will also have to be borne by <Col N="1453" /> them and I hope the Minister will be able to meet those.</P>
    <P>The matter has moved on.  The four litigants are willing to meet the Government or anybody to ensure that this case is taken over, with some venom, by Government action.  It is vital &mdash; the Minister touched on this in his response in the Seanad tonight &mdash; that the Minister and his representatives attend any meetings and that they also have in attendance the Attorney General or a representative of his office so that the legal teams of both sides can come together.  The Minister dealt with the issue in that manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Ryan, Deputy Helen Keogh and I visited the THORP installation some years ago. After that visit I was more worried than ever about the Sellafield issue.  The scale of the procedure there is mind-boggling.  An incident like Chernobyl gives us a horrible insight into what is possible when a major accident occurs.</P>
    <P>The final straw, not just for the four residents but for many people on the east coast, occurred on the same day as the joint declaration on the peace process.  That was an historic day for our country but it was also the day on which a British Minister announced in the House of Commons the authorisation for the commissioning of THORP.  Government and Opposition in this House protested about that decision on the following day.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have an extremely difficult decision to make but now is the time to make it.  We have learned more about Sellafield in the last few years than ever before. That plant was called Windscale originally, its name changed but we still got no information.  In this era of more available information, the Minister, the Government and their legal advisers should know that there are more reasons to take a case on Sellafield and they should use every opportunity in that regard.</P>
    <P>A number of reputable people and reports might help the Government in this matter.  About a year ago the former company secretary of BNFL, Mr. Harold Bolter, said there had been an unreported build up of plutonium gases in the Sellafield complex in 1990.  Some weeks ago a leading British scientist, Mr. Peter Taylor, referred to the danger of overground storage tanks at the complex.  The Minister mentioned this when I raised the issue with him some days ago and also in his Seanad speech tonight.  The British geological survey on seismic problems in the Irish Sea and on both islands must also be taken into account in any further expansion of Sellafield.  There were recent revelations on the BBC and in <i>The Scotsman</i> about ten previously unreported serious incidents in the British nuclear industry on the west coast of Britain.  The Dounreay plant is in a critical condition.  The Sellafield authorities have sought authorisations to emit other gases into the air and the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>In a recent parliamentary question I asked the Minister to use his good offices to ensure the British authorities properly complied with EU <Col N="1454" /> Council Directive 96/29 EURATOM, issued on 30 May 1996, which lays down revised basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.  The Minister said that each member state has until 30 May 2000 to bring into force laws under this directive.  This is a further point in favour of our bringing a case against Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for accepting the Fianna Fáil amendment in the Seanad.  It strengthens the Seanad's deliberations and reflects the view of all sides of this House also. It is important that from now on that the legal representatives of the Minister and the litigants come together as soon as possible so that this matter can be progressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to address this issue in the House.  In the Seanad this evening a motion welcoming the Supreme Court judgment of last week and commending the Government for its continuing efforts to monitor the activities of the UK's nuclear industry and on the steps the Government is taking to minimise risk from that industry was universally supported.  In the course of the debate, in the spirit of bipartisanship, I indicated that I did not oppose the Fianna Fáil amendment which I suggested enhanced the original motion, thereby reflecting the thinking of the Seanad and the Irish public.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court was unanimous in its decision to uphold the 1995 judgment of the High Court establishing the jurisdiction of the Irish courts to hear the substantive case.  The judgment confirmed the entitlement of the four County Louth residents to sue for damages arising in Ireland through the Irish courts.  The extent to which they could pursue their claims, based on European law, was considered to be a matter for the trial judge.  I wholeheartedly welcome this significant decision which confirms the right of access by citizens, in this case the four County Louth residents, on issues of concern to them in the courts of their own country.  The plaintiffs were also awarded their costs against BNFL.  The State was ordered to pay its own costs.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the four people who took this action &mdash; namely Ms Constance Shortt, Ms Mary Kavanagh, Mr. Mark Deary and Mr. Ollan Herr. I pay tribute to these brave people who have selflessly stuck to their guns with no possibility of personal gain and the potential for great personal loss.  Their stand has been compared to that of David against Goliath.  While the Government was criticised by that comparison, we know the result of that contest and I hope for a similar one in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plaintiffs have now been given leave by the court to serve summons on BNFL within four weeks of the date of judgment.  The substantive case taken by the plaintiffs will then be scheduled <Col N="1455" /> for hearing in the High Court.  It is not possible at this stage to state when the case will be heard. Notwithstanding that the Government and the Attorney General are named as co-defendants in the substantive case which is to follow, counsel for the State has supported the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court in opposing the appeal of British Nuclear Fuels.  The State gave the fullest backing it possibly or legally could to the group in establishing the right to take the case in the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department, other Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are making available, on a voluntary basis, to the solicitors of the four Dundalk residents all the relevant files and documentation concerning Sellafield and related aspects relevant to the substantive case.  My Department has already disclosed to the plaintiffs the nature of the documentation available within my Department concerning Sellafield and other related aspects relevant to the substantive case.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions since the court's findings that the State should join the residents and support them in their substantive action against BNFL or take over responsibility in the legal action against BNFL regarding Sellafield. The Deputy will be aware that I am favourably disposed to the ultimate objective of the County Louth residents, which is the cessation of activities at Sellafield.  However, consideration of these matters is complex and needs time and detailed examination by the Government, with the assistance and advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I have offered to meet the plaintiffs involved in the court case because it was indicated publicly, on their behalf, that they were anxious to cooperate with the State towards shared objectives of both parties.  The latest correspondence I have received from the plaintiffs' solicitors &mdash; which arrived today &mdash; points out that they would prefer a meeting on this subject with legal representatives attending on both sides.  I have sought urgent comments on this modified suggestion from the Attorney General.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is calling a meeting of the Committee of Ministers on Sellafield tomorrow at which this subject will be discussed.</P>
    <P>Time constraints do not allow me to elaborate further but more information is available on the record of the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Government to commission immediately an independent review of the tunnel option for the Luas light rail project. The Minister, Deputy Lowry, has acknowledged that the cost of putting Luas underground in the city centre is estimated at between £130 million and £300 million.  These figures appear high and there should be an independent assessment of the <Col N="1456" /> costs.  Such an independent review could examine underground route options and sources for any additional funding which may be necessary, such as EU and cheap loan funds.</P>
      <P>The former Fine Gael leader, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, has estimated that the cost of putting Luas underground in the city centre may be less than £160 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He proposed that if the Tallaght line went via Harold's Cross and Kimmage it would have to operate for between six and seven and a half kilometres in an underground tunnel.  This would cut the length of the Dundrum/Tallaght route by four kilometres, almost halving the Luas journey time between O'Connell Street and Tallaght from 38 minutes to 19 minutes.  Tunnelling from Heuston Station would probably cost much less.</P>
      <P>Dr. FitzGerald proposed that by tunnelling from Ranelagh inwards the Luas time between Dundrum and O'Connell Street would be reduced by a quarter to 15 minutes.  To undertake tunnelling from Harcourt Street where the line at present ends would make the cost of tunnelling much cheaper and would cut the requirements for the number of vehicles from 31 to 19.  The capital saving from shortening the route is estimated at £85 million.  Because fewer drivers and inspectors would be required with fewer vehicles, operating costs could be cut by about £1.2 million.  The £250,000 saving on vehicle technicians and supervisors would probably be eliminated by the requirement for security in each underground station.  Operating profits would, however, probably double under this formula, from £4.5 million to almost £9 million.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that to build a Luas underground tunnel would cost not more than £10 million per kilometre, rather than the £13.1 million per kilometre assumed by the light rail promoters.  A sum of £16.8 million has been estimated for each underground station, but that is extremely high.  The figure of about £12 million per station, estimated elsewhere, seems closer to the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimates for traffic on the Luas route are based on out-of-date assumptions about an increase in population, employment and car ownership between 1991 and 2001.  Half way through this period the 2001 estimates have already been surpassed.  The traffic by then is likely to be 40 per cent higher than the assumptions on which the Luas estimates are based.  Dr. FitzGerald, a transport economist, has estimated that the on-street Luas would not be able to cater for about one third of the likely peak hour demand on the Cabinteely-Dundrum route in the year 2011.  A Luas operating in a tunnel could double capacity in peak periods, with one driver operating two coupled vehicles, as in the case of DART.  An on-street Luas with very long <Col N="1457" /> carriages would play havoc with traffic on the streets.</P>
    <P>There is need to address the capacity deficit of the on-street system proposed for the city centre. It would be disastrous to build an on-street system in the city centre and later, because of inadequate capacity as suggested by Dr. FitzGerald and others, have to scrap it in favour of an underground system at an extra cost of hundreds of millions of pounds.  I agree with Dr. FitzGerald that a refusal by public authorities, from the Minister down, even to seriously debate this issue would be indefensible.</P>
    <P>A review, independent of CIE and the Minister, of the underground option should be immediately and urgently commissioned and brought before this House.  The review should consider the best underground routes and funding sources for any additional costs.  This side of the House is fully in favour of the light rail project but not in the city centre unless a full study, independent of CIE, is placed on the floor of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Within one day of publication of the Oscar Faber report, which cleared the way at EU level for the construction of the Tallaght-Dundrum light rail line, the Deputy is calling for yet another study.  Oscar Faber spent the last four months studying the proposals for a light rail line to Tallaght and Dundrum.  That report confirmed the wisdom of the Government's proposals to proceed with Tallaght-Dundrum as the first phase, proposals which were announced by the current Fianna Fáil leader when he was Minister for Finance.  No sooner has that report been published than we are being urged to start another.  This time we are being asked to revisit the decision to opt for an on-street system.  There is such a passion for studies by Deputies on the other side of this House that they seem prepared to postpone action indefinitely while study after study takes place and the traffic gets worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not as if the underground issue has not already been looked at in two separate reports. The recent report prepared for CIE was the second one to recommend against the underground option for Dublin.  Many people tend to overlook the fact that the Dublin Transportation Initiative also recommended against an underground DART option on the grounds that it would not make economic sense. The DTI also rejected the underground option because it did not fit in with its overall vision for Dublin which sees a sharing of road space by various types of traffic and emphasises the movement of people rather than vehicles.  Indeed it is interesting to contrast the DTI's vision of Dublin with the Deputy's vision.  The DTI vision is one in which Dublin will be a cleaner, calmer, safer and more attractive place to live and work <Col N="1458" /> in, or visit.  The Deputy's vision would mean that the car would continue to dominate our citystreets and noise, pollution and accident levels would continue to rise inexorably.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, given the number of questions raised during the public consultation process, the Minister, Deputy Lowry, asked CIE to have the underground options evaluated further.  The results of this evaluation were published last August.  As the Minister pointed out during Question Time last Thursday, the evaluation identified the additional cost of putting light rail underground in the city centre as being in the range from £124 million to £300 million, depending on the length of the tunnelled section. He said then, and I repeat, that these findings confirm that the strategic and cost advantages of an on-street light rail system make this the best option for Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition to the technical studies, an MRBI market research survey commissioned by the CIE project team indicated that 64 per cent preferred on-street light rail as against 26 per cent for underground.  Some 60 per cent cited violence, danger and the concern for personal safety as the main reasons for not having an underground system.  There is, therefore, a perception that an underground would be less safe from a security and crime perspective, especially at night.</P>
    <P>Given all this, I was bemused that the Deputy decided to raise the underground issue yet again. Indeed I am at a loss to understand what the Deputy believes yet another study into the underground option will achieve.  It is becoming clearer all the time that there appears to be one fundamental difference between the approach to the light rail project advocated by him and that promoted on this side of the House.  We are committed to taking definite action quickly to alleviate Dublin's chronic and worsening traffic congestion whereas the Deputy is committed to little more than navel gazing &mdash; some might say he has tunnel vision.</P>
    <P>Now that the EU Commission has confirmed its support for the Tallaght-Dundrum route and indicated that it will also support the Ballymun route, every effort must be concentrated on delivering that project.  The CIE project team must get on with finalising its application for the necessary statutory powers.  The choice now is between debate and delivery.  It is worth recalling that the transport strategy recommended by the DTI, of which an on-street light rail network is a critical part, has been accepted by this Government and the last Government.  That strategy is soundly based.  Its findings in relation to the underground option have been upheld by a second report.</P>
    <P>I am sure many people will be disappointed that a former Minister for Transport understands so little about the seriousness and complexity of transport in Dublin.  He has already suggested <Col N="1459" /> that the light rail routes should be built only as far as the canals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;leaving the city centre sections for further study.  That is about as useful as a wheel without an axle, interesting and decorative, but it will not get one very far.  People will not understand why the Deputy has reacted so <Col N="1460" /> negatively to the implementation of an on-street light rail system which has proved so popular that more and more people are clamouring to have their area served by this form of public transport. On-street is what the public have indicated they want.  On-street can best meet the needs of Dublin.  In short on-street is the only realistic option.</P>

      <P>On foot of the report of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development, new mechanisms have been established to deal with the development of access and infrastructure on the offshore islands. The need to develop access services in a strategic and integrated way which reflect the needs of island communities was identified in the report as a priority issue.  Prioritised programmes of work to improve access services and related infrastructural work have been prepared by the relevant local authorities.  These programmes of work have been assessed by the inter-departmental co-ordinating committee and recommendations regarding funding subsequently made.  Funds were made available on the basis of need and the quality of proposals submitted, as prioritised by the local authorities islands committees in consultation with Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann.  Individual projects were assessed not only on their own merit, but particularly in the context of the overall strategy for islands as set out in the report.</P>
      <P>I recently advised Galway, Donegal and Mayo County Councils of funding for projects included in their programmes of work.  I expect to be in a position shortly to confirm funding to Cork County Council.  A total of £242,250 has been made available to the relevant local authorities to date, for projects submitted to the co-ordinating committee.  Decisions regarding a number of other projects submitted in the programmes of work are still under consideration and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce further funding from the financial envelope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provision of helicopter services, in accordance with the priorities drawn <Col N="1462" /> up by the islands committee of Mayo County Council, I have recently made funding available to Clare Island for the provision of a helipad and lighting and also for improvements to the helipad facility on Inishturk.  Furthermore, a proposal to upgrade the helipad facility on Inishbofin has very recently been received from Galway County Council's islands committee, for consideration by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee. These priority projects will greatly improve emergency access to these island communities. Emergency helicopter services are currently provided to these islands by the Marine Search and Rescue Service and the Air Corps, subject to normal operational requirements.  As I said previously, funds have been made available for priority access projects and will continue to be made available on the basis of proposals agreed by the local authorities islands committees.  All proposals with the objective of achieving an acceptable level of access services to offshore islands will be considered by the inter-departmental co-ordinating committee.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of owners of RSW pelagic vessels in the fleet have plans to replace them <Col N="1463" /> with new vessels.  Such proposals will be dealt with as they arise in line with stated Government policy which is clear and unambiguous and has been reiterated in this House on a number of occasions by myself and my predecessor.  Any such new vessels will only be permitted to enter the fleet on condition that equivalent one hundred per cent replacement capacity has been withdrawn from the RSW pelagic fleet in advance of their introduction.  Compliance with that precondition will be fully ensured.  The Deputy will be aware that under European Union fleet policy the capacities of member states' fishing fleets are constrained by decisions taken in the context of fleet Multi-Annual Guidance Programmes. Against this background, sea-fishing boat licensing policy is designed to maintain strict control on proposed introductions into the fleet.</P>
      <P>It is the case that within existing fleet capacity constraints there has been significant private investment in the Irish pelagic fleet in recent years and the fleet is now among the most modern in Europe.  Any plans for further investment by pelagic vessel owners will, of course, have to take account of emerging opportunities and constraints and, in particular, the economics of realising available fishing opportunities and developments in EU policy to address the overall EU fleet overcapacity problem.  In that context the Deputy will be aware that the Commission has proposed further across the board cuts of up to 40 per cent in EU fleet capacity over the next few years.  The Commission's proposals were deemed unacceptable by the Council of Ministers on 14 October last and, in my capacity as President of the Council, I am now consulting intensively with member state colleagues and the Commissioner to see whether we can find solutions which are acceptable, appropriate, fair and soundly based.</P>

      <P>Developments in the Irish fishing industry will be influenced by the outcome of current policy developments both nationally and at EU level. Critical decisions at EU level on improved control and conservation measures will, for example, have positive impact in the short to medium term.  EU and national support for investment in the industry will continue under the Operational Programme for Fisheries with consequent benefits for improved safety quality and modernisation and for levels of landings and exports.  I would also expect continued growth in the fish processing and aquaculture sectors.  The <Col N="1464" /> scope for expansion of the fleet will continue to be influenced by existing constraints and opportunities in terms of fishing opportunities for quota and non-quota species, market factors and economic considerations.  Decisions at the end of the year on the level of total allowable catches for quota species for 1997 together with an agreement on overall EU fleet capacity objectives currently being discussed by Council will in particular set the framework for developments in the catching sector over the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>During August up to 30 vessels from the Japanese blue fin tuna fleet fishing in international waters just outside the exclusive economic zone were subject to continuous monitoring by the fisheries protection service.</P>
      <P>Two Japanese vessels were detained during the period on charges of illegal fishing and illegal entry and the cases will come before the courts in due course.  Pending the hearing of those cases the Deputy will appreciate the need for circumspection in any statement to guard against prejudicing the proceedings.</P>
      <P>The north Atlantic blue fin tuna fishery is a highly specialised year round activity conducted in international waters.  It should not be confused with the albacore tuna fishery in which a number of EU fleets including Ireland participate to varying degrees in the summer months.  It is targeted in particular by a dedicated Japanese fishing fleet which is highly integrated in terms of fishing, processing and delivery of the tuna product back to the lucrative Japanese market. The presence, for a short period this summer, of that fleet at the edge of the EEZ was untypical and reflected the particular migratory pattern of the tuna this year.  I should note that the scope for developing Irish participation in the international blue fin tuna fishery is very limited given the highly specialised techniques and logistics involved and the long range nature of the fishery. This was confirmed in the past in experimental trials carried out by BIM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am much more directly concerned with the need to ensure the conservation and protection of fish stocks within our waters to secure the future of the resource and the viability of the <Col N="1465" /> Irish fishing industry.  Ireland has been at the forefront in Europe in pressing for effective conservation and control measures and I am giving every priority during the Irish Presidency to making concrete progress on both these fronts. Our air, sea and land-based fishery protection services are fully committed to the monitoring and enforcement of fishing regulations.  I am building on that track record to date to ensure that existing resources are applied effectively to the considerable task of conservation and protection.  I am also committed to enhancing those resources as necessary with the maximum EU support available under the financial package agreed by member states last year the terms of which recognised Ireland's particular responsibilities and needs.</P>

      <P>Up to quite recently the piers at Moville and Carrickaroary were the property of Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners.  A few years ago Donegal County Council purchased the piers from the commissioners for a nominal sum.  Both piers, Carrickaroary in particular, are in a very poor state of repair.  The repair of these piers is a matter for Donegal County Council.  The Department of the Marine does not grant aid repair works.  The Department does however, provide grantaid, subject to available funds, for the development of fishery harbour facilities. Only projects which demonstrate a significant potential return from a fisheries perspective are grant-aided.  It would be difficult, to make a case for fisheries related investment at Carrickaroary pier.  Future possible investment strategies in the area might more realistically focus on the infrastructural needs of the mussel fishery in Lough Foyle and might involve investment at Moville.  A three year fishery harbour development programme 1997-99 is being prepared and the infrastructural needs of the fishing and aquaculture industry in the Moville area will be assessed in that context.</P>

      <P>Almost 70 projects around the country, involving total investment of over £7 million, have been approved to date under the Tourism Angling Measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism.  Applications may be made by fisheries boards, other State agencies, community groups, angling clubs, private bodies and individuals. There is no specific earmarking of funds under the measure for the fisheries boards or for particular regions.  All applications are assessed on their merits and compliance with the criteria under the measure.  Project approvals under the programme in 1994 and 1995 did not include projects submitted by the eastern board but to date in 1996 two projects submitted by that board, involving investment of £40,000, have been approved.  The projects involve the provision of sea angling signposting along the east coast and the development of Loughs Bracken and Castle in counties Louth and Cavan respectively.</P>
      <P>Total investment to date under the tourism angling measure in the Eastern Fisheries Board area, including projects sponsored by groups other than the fisheries board, amounts to £116,000.  I hope, and expect, that the present low level of investment in the eastern region will increase over the remainder of the programme but it is the case that the actual allocation of funding to a board or any other organisation or group will depend on the quantity, quality and nature of project applications made.</P>

The contract will commence on 1 January 1997, on the expiry of the existing contract with Irish Helicopters Ltd., and will be for a minimum period of two and a half years with an option to extend for up to five years.

      <P>Evaluation of the tenders was a complex process involving consultation with tenderers, manufacturers of auto-hover equipment, helicopter manufacturers and the Irish and UK aviation authorities.  It is not the function of the Government Contracts Committee to evaluate tenders of this technical nature.  Its function is to provide sanction to deviate from normal contract procedures, for example if the lowest cost tender was not accepted.  As this competition followed strict tender guidelines the need to involve the Government Contracts Committee did not arise.</P>

      <P>The service of members of the Permanent Defence Force with UN and other overseas missions is entirely on a voluntary basis.  Our ongoing commitments to UNIFIL and to other missions are met regularly through this voluntary system.</P>
      <P>With regard to UN commitments generally the position is that recent experience in the UN highlighted the need to reduce the time which it takes to deploy peacekeeping missions.  In order to enhance the UN's capacity to plan for and respond more quickly to emergency situations the Secretary-General asked member states to indicate specifically the forces which they would be prepared to designate for use in peacekeeping operations under the United Nations Standby Arrangements System.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Government recently agreed to Permanent Defence Force participation in UNSAS up to a limit of 850 personnel.  This participation could be fulfilled by the reassignment to UNSAS, at a level determined by Ireland, of personnel currently serving with UNIFIL or other overseas missions such as the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) in the former Yugoslavia.  Troops pledged under UNSAS could be deployed anywhere in the world under UN Security Council resolution and would not necessarily be confined to the European area.</P>
      <P>There is no immediate proposal to call up members of an Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil for UN service.</P>
      <P>The current strength of the First Line Reserve is 541 all ranks.</P>

      <P>Furthermore I would like to emphasise that the reorganisation of the Defence Forces has as one of its main objectives an increase in the number of troops available for operational duties.</P>
      <P>The implementation plan which the Government approved in February of this year was not the Price Waterhouse report which was extensively leaked in July of 1994, and gave rise to much unhelpful rumour and speculation, but rather a plan prepared by the Efficiency Audit Group which drew on the recommendations of the consultants.  This plan has the support of the military authorities.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of the implementation plan is to create a more efficient, well structured and better organised Defence Forces capable of fulfilling the roles which were redefined by the Government in 1993.  In doing that we will tackle the issues identified in the course of the examination of the organisation such as the high age profile problem, inadequate collective training, excessive numbers in civilian-type jobs and the serious imbalance between pay and non-pay spending.  When the revised organisation is in place we will have a three brigade structure of 11,500 all ranks which will be better trained and equipped to carry out its operational tasks.</P>
      <P>I have discussed the reorganisation of the Defence Forces with the Select Committee on Legislation and Security in the course of the debate on the Defence Estimates.  The representative bodies have made presentations to that committee on the subject of the reorganisation plans.  It is my intention to return to the committee to discuss the reorganisation process further and also to address the issues and concerns raised by the representative associations in that forum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress the importance of the FCA to the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces <Col N="1470" /> and the esteem in which it is held by the Government.</P>
    <P>The FCA is a voluntary organisation.  The commitment and dedication of its members cannot be commended too highly.  The contribution of FCA personnel to the community is considerable and is recognised and valued throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the House before that as part of the restructuring and reorganisation process a special study of the Reserve Forces, including the FCA and An Slua Muirí, will be conducted.  I expect that this study will commence in mid-1997.</P>
    <P>Currently there is a consultative process in train which, it is expected, will elicit the views of serving members of the FCA on the future development of the organisation.  The representative bodies are also involved in this process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>The ages for retirement for officers of the Permanent Defence Force are prescribed in Defence Force Regulations A.15.  With the exception of technical officers, the normal retirement age for officers in the rank of captain is 54 years, commandant 56 years, and lieutenant-colonel 58 years.</P>
      <P>Schemes for the retention in service of officers of the Permanent Defence Force beyond their normal age for retirement were introduced in the 1970s in the context of conserving the numerical strength of officers at that time.  Under the terms of the schemes officers in the ranks of captain, commandant and lieutenant-colonel could apply to be retained up to age 60 years.</P>
      <P>In the context of negotiations under Clause 2 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> under the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and, by way of a <i>quid pro quo,</i> agreement was reached with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO) on the abolition of the schemes for the retention in service of officers on a phased basis up to 2001.</P>

      <P>Consultation with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association on the continuation in service criteria is ongoing and to date a very useful exchange of views has taken place.</P>

      <P>The role of the Defence Forces Training Centre will be to provide military training and education for Defence Forces personnel and to provide support to the director of training in the assessment of training requirements.</P>
      <P>Phase I of the reorganisation and restructuring of the Defence Forces will continue until the end of 1998 and it is envisaged that the Defence Forces Training Centre will be established by that time.  The training centre will have its headquarters at the Curragh.  However, it may be some time after 1998 before all of the different elements of the centre are physically relocated there.  The objective is to centralise a training infrastructure which is capable of imparting the full range of military expertise and skills. Consequently it will be necessary, as outlined in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, to relocate certain existing training facilities.</P>
      <P>There will be cost implications in the relocation of certain establishments.  While it is not possible to quantify costs at present, such costs as may arise will be met within current Defence spending limits.</P>

      <P>The preliminary results of the 1996 labour force survey show that the number of persons at work increased by 45,000 to 1,284,000 in the year to April 1996.  A feature of the results is the increasing labour force participation of women, with 33,000 more women at work; and the participation rate of women increasing from 36.4 per cent to 38.6 per cent between 1995 and 1996.</P>
      <P>These preliminary labour force survey results are based on the advance processing of selected details from the labour force survey.  The details selected for advance processing include the principal economic status classification and the broad sectoral classification of those at work. More detailed information on questions such as part-time work only becomes available at a later stage, after the full details of the survey have been processed and published by the CSO in the annual LFS report.</P>
      <P>The detailed annual LFS report includes information on part-time employment and on the breakdown between regular and occasional jobs. The LFS report for 1995 was published in May 1996 and it is hoped that the corresponding report for 1996 will be published in the first quarter of 1997.</P>
      <P>No information on wages or earnings is collected in the labour force survey, as such questions may adversely affect the response rate to household surveys.</P>

      <P>On the recommendation of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development, the Government made available an additional £1 million for the development of island access services to the offshore islands.  A new mechanism has been put in place whereby island access projects are selected and prioritised by the islands committees of the relevant local authorities.  These projects are assessed by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee and recommendations made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date £242,250 has been allocated to the local authorities involved for island access projects of which £157,250 has been allocated to Donegal County Council.  The assessment of <Col N="1476" /> further projects is continuing and I hope to be in a position to allocate further funding shortly.</P>
    <P>While it is the objective of the local authorities to complete the development of their projects by the end of the year, they have indicated that, in certain cases this may not be possible, particularly with regard to those phases of a project which are subject to weather and tidal conditions.  This would mean that the total amount of funding which has been allocated to a project may not be drawn down this year.  In such cases I am endeavouring to ensure that, within the normal Government accounting requirements on the allocation and expenditure of funds, arrangements will be made to ensure the completion of these projects.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to relate the above live register figures to appropriate labour force survey categories, either on a principal economic status (PES) or ILO basis.  This is because: (a) the labour force survey does not provide results for counties or Social Welfare Office catchment areas; and (b) it is known that persons on the live register are not always classified as unemployed in the labour force survey and therefore, it would not be meaningful to express the live register as a percentage of labour force survey categories.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.58 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 13 December 1995 to Question No.60 for details of consultancy costs in the Department of Foreign Affairs and <Col N="1481" /> the Office of the Tánaiste in 1995.  There have been a number of changes from this position since then:</P>
    <P>Vote 38 &mdash; Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; The final cost of the staff training consultant was <Col N="1482" /> £350.00.  No expenditure was incurred by the Department in 1995 in respect of a study on staff appraisal.  This gives a total cost for consultancies in the Vote for Foreign Affairs for 1995 of £65,722.36.  This represents 0.14 per cent of the net expenditure within this Vote.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 63 together.  Ireland intends to accede to the Convention on the Safety of UN and Associated Personnel as soon as the process of enacting the <Col N="1483" /> necessary domestic legislative measures to give effect to the provisions of the convention has been completed.  I place great importance on progressing this issue as quickly as possible.  In this regard, officials in my Department have been in contact with the Department of Justice with the aim of expediting this process.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel represents an important milestone in efforts to increase the safety and security of both military and civilian personnel serving on UN peacekeeping operations.  Specifically, the convention makes it a crime to attack, kidnap or murder UN and associated personnel or to attempt to do so, punishable by penalties appropriate to the grave nature of such crimes.  Ireland, as a country with a long and distinguished tradition of service on UN peacekeeping missions, was very active in promoting agreement among member states of the UN on the adoption of this international instrument.  In particular, Ireland co-sponsored UN General Assembly Resolution 49/59 which adopted the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that all parties, including Sinn Fein, which claim to be committed to the achievement of peace and to the negotiation of a comprehensive political settlement, would welcome the unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  That is certainly the position of the Government.  Nevertheless, as I have made clear in this House on several occasions, it is for the IRA itself to make that decision and thus to make possible the entry of Sinn Fein into the multi-party talks.  While I am not prepared to speculate on the IRA's thinking, it has been generally recognised that as stated in the February Communiqué, &ldquo;confidence building would also require that the parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the multi-party negotiations currently proceeding in Belfast have the potential to provide such reassurance, in particular when the way is clear to launch substantive negotiations in the three strands.  I am confident that the negotiations can be made truly meaningful and can lead to a lasting political settlement. <Col N="1484" /> However, it is up to the IRA to determine whether they can also become truly inclusive.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, made by the ad hoc group established by the Special Conference of States parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention; the priorities which he has identified in the context of the fourth review conference due to take place in November 1996; when a draft verification Protocol will be ready for adoption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to a similar question from the Deputy on 30 May 1996, I indicated that the period of the Irish Presidency of the EU could be crucial to the efforts to strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, BTWC.  We have worked intensively during our Presidency to achieve progress in the negotiations in the <i>ad hoc</i> group which has been established to negotiate an effective legally binding verification Protocol to the Convention.  The Fourth Review Conference of the BTWC beginning on 25 November will provide an opportunity for States Parties to the Convention to take stock of this progress and to give a further impetus to the negotiations.</P>
      <P>As I anticipated in my earlier reply, the EU on 25 June 1996 adopted a common position concerning preparations for the Fourth Review Conference.  The objective of this common position is to encourage and support the efforts to strengthen the BTWC by promoting its universality, seeking the endorsement by the Fourth Review Conference of the results to date of the <i>ad hoc</i> group, supporting the intensification of that group's work irrespective of other priorities on the international disarmament agenda and promoting a successful conclusion to these negotiations no later than the middle of 1998.  President Clinton, in his address to the 51st session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September, also supported a target date of 1998 for the completion of the negotiations and I welcome this development.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to the common position, the EU Troika carried out démarches in over 30 countries during August and September to canvass their support for the Union's position in advance of the Fourth Review Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the July and September meetings of the <i>ad hoc</i> group, the Irish Presidency took a series of initiatives aimed at consolidating the strong contribution of the Union to the group's work. Six technical papers setting out the EU's position on key elements of the verification regime under negotiation were tabled by the Union in July.  At the September meeting, which <i>inter alia</i> focused on the group's work programme for 1997 and on its report to the Fourth Review Conference, the <Col N="1485" /> Presidency actively promoted the EU's view that the work of the group needed to be intensified.</P>
    <P>Following protracted discussions, the <i>ad hoc</i> group agreed to intensify its work in 1997, and has scheduled nine weeks of negotiations in the first nine months of 1997.  This compares favourably with a total of eight weeks of substantive discussions since the group was established in 1994.  In addition, the report of the group to the Fourth Review Conference notes that the group has now identified the potential framework and elements of a verification Protocol.  These are attached to the report of the September session of the group and will form the basis of the negotiations in 1997.</P>
    <P>In the lead up to the Fourth Review Conference the Irish Presidency will continue its strenuous efforts to make further progress towards the aims outlined in the EU's Common Position.</P>

      <P>The Humanitarian Liaison Group has been established and met on a number of occasions.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> The principal focus of the group's work to date has been on streamlining the arrangements for the release of public servants to take up assignments related to emergency assistance programmes in developing countries.  It is envisaged that the group will operate as a clearing house to facilitate the release of public servants to take up such assignments if and when the need arises in the context of a major international emergency.</P>
    <P>Preparations for the establishment of the Rapid Response Register, RRR, are at an advanced stage.  It is envisaged that the core membership of the register will be comprised of individuals who have undertaken assignments in developing countries and who have received specialised training in the management of emergency assistance programmes.  The Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, has undertaken a number of pilot training programmes and is consulting the nonGovernmental organisations, NGOs, regarding the arrangements for future training activities. The detailed arrangements in respect of the operation of the register will be completed in the light of the outcome of the consultations and the pilot training programmes.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my written replies to Questions No. 135 of 15 October and No. 31 of 24 October in which I outlined the current steps being taken by the European Union in order to help bring about an early return to democratic rule and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.  The EU General Affairs Council on 15-16 July 1996 stated, <i>inter alia</i>, its intention to continue its identification and examination of possible further measures in relation to Nigeria, and to do so with other interested countries and bodies.  This exercise includes within its remit consideration of a possible oil embargo.  As I confirmed in my earlier replies, the Irish Presidency is actively engaged with EU partners and other interested parties in this process.</P>

      <P>Following applications by the prisoners in question to be temporarily transferred to Northern Ireland to enable them to receive accumulated visits, the Embassy in London raised this matter with the British authorities.  In June, 1996 these requests were refused by the Home Secretary on grounds of security, possible disruption of a prison establishment and, in the case of one prisoner, insufficient links.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the prisoners concerned have subsequently made further requests for temporary transfer to Northern Ireland for accumulated visits.  On my instructions, the Embassy in London has raised the matter of these prisoners' further applications for temporary transfer to Northern Ireland to <Col N="1488" /> receive accumulated visits with the British authorities.  The British authorities have advised that these requests are currently under consideration.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the increase in DIRT tax in last year's budget is a disincentive to elderly people to use financial institutions; and whether he will introduce a reduction in this tax to encourage people over the age of 65 to lodge their savings without having quid pro quo reductions in their social welfare entitlements.</Quest>

      <P>Deposit Interest Retention Tax, DIRT, is generally paid on deposits at the standard rate of income tax, currently 27 per cent.  Since 1993, DIRT satisfies the depositor's full liability to income tax in respect of interest income, even if the depositor marginal rate of income tax is at the higher 48 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>The DIRT rate on special savings accounts, SSAs, which was introduced in 1993 was increased last year from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  This measure was designed to strike a more appropriate balance in the tax treatment of deposit income and income from other sources &mdash; especially riskier equity investment in Irish businesses.  The need for the maintenance of this balance remained an important consideration in the preparation of the 1996 budget and it was concluded that the 15 per cent rate should remain.  However, I should emphasise that SSAs still provide attractive tax benefits for small and medium-sized depositors.  A final-liability tax of 15 per cent on SSA interest income compares very favourably with the tax rate of 27 per cent and 48 per cent.</P>
      <P>In terms of administration and collection, DIRT is an efficient and effective tax which currently yields about £120 million annually.  From an equity viewpoint, it is appropriate that interest income is taxable just as other income is taxable.</P>
      <P>Certain individuals who are not liable or fully liable to income tax, such as the elderly and the disabled can avail of a refund of DIRT up to a maximum of their tax allowance.  In addition, there are savings media to which DIRT does not apply &mdash; such as credit unions, and the tax-free savings certificates, savings bonds and national instalment savings schemes run by An Post. Therefore, I do not believe that the present DIRT regime acts as a disincentive to the elderly to use financial institutions and consequently, I have no plans at present to amend this tax.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issue of social welfare entitlements, this is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare in the first instance.</P>

            <entry>In general, it is the policy, as far as possible, to make car parking spaces available on a first come first served basis.  Spaces are reserved for disabled staff and in some cases for staff who are required to use their cars for official business.  Allocations are generally made on a seniority basis only where spaces are in short supplu and access to car parks must be limited to designated vehicles for security or other reasons.</entry>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's programme of renewal indicated that the future of residential property tax would be considered in the context of a professional study of local government financing undertaken by the Minister for the Environment.  As part of the study process a report, <i>The Financing of Local Government in Ireland</i>, was published by that Minister on 27 June this year.  I will as previously stated, evaluate all aspects of RPT when this study process is completed.</P>
      <P>It is important to keep RPT in perspective. This year, the tax will be paid by about 23,000 households out of the total stock of approximately 900,000 owner-occupied houses in the country.  Furthermore, over half of those 23,000 will be able to reduce their tax bills by claiming either marginal relief &mdash; where household income is between £30,000 and £40,000 &mdash; or child relief &mdash; a 10 per cent reduction for each dependent child.  While most of the revenue raised comes from houses in Dublin, this reflects the reality that most of the country's higher value residential property is concentrated in the capital city.  In addition, Dublin incomes tend to be higher than the national average which means that fewer households can claim income exemption or marginal relief.</P>

    <P>There are a number of points of clarification which I wish to bring to the attention of the Deputy.  The expenditure percentages relate only to the cost of administration of the Department. The 1985 figure does not include any expenditure relating to health promotion, which was then a matter for the Health Education Bureau, whereas the 1990 and 1995 figures include the appropriate consultancy elements of health promotion.  The 1995 figure is higher than the figure of £414,245 included in reply to a similar question put down by Deputy Callely on 21 May 1996.  The figure of £569,000 includes a number of additional elements such as the cost of studies and research on pregnancy, mental handicap, nursing and sudden infant death.  It also includes expenditure of about £40,000 on contract technical staff employed in certain areas of the Department.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Adoption Act, 1991, contains a comprehensive legal framework for the regulation of adoptions effected abroad by Irish residents and for the recognition of such adoptions.  The Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, which was considered by the Select Committee on Social Affairs on 2 October, <Col N="1502" /> provides for certain amendments of the 1991 Act. The purpose of these amendments is to introduce greater flexibility into our statutory system for the recognition of adoptions effected outside the State.  However, the Bill makes no provision for changing the pre-adoption assessment procedures set out in the 1991 Act.  These procedures, which are in compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, provide an important safeguard for the welfare of children who are available for intercountry adoption.  Under the procedures Irish residents proposing to adopt a child abroad must have their eligibility and suitability to adopt formally established by the Adoption Board before the adoption is completed in the foreign country, otherwise the adoption will not qualify for recognition here.  Prospective adopting parents should accordingly contact their local health board for further information about the procedures.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Board has a central role in the administration of the 1991 Act including examining the adoption laws of various countries to establish whether adoptions effected under those laws are entitled to be recognised here.  In the context of the adoption of children from the Belarusian-Chernobyl area, I understand from the board that it has sought copies of the adoption laws of both Belarus and the Ukraine with a view to determining whether adoptions granted in those states qualify for recognition under Irish law.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have been advised by the Mater Hospital that the person referred to by the Deputy was placed on the waiting list for trans lumbar aortogram under the care of Mr. Corrigan on 9 September 1996.  The patient was allocated a date for this procedure on 7 October 1996 but this appointment was cancelled.  This was due to the need to carry out major surgery on in-patients who were admitted through the accident and emergency department.  Such cancellations take place from time to time as emergency cases must be given priority.  However, the Mater Hospital has indicated that the person concerned has been given a new appointment and is scheduled to be admitted for surgery on 18 November 1996.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The first report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, which has been approved by Government, was published on 10 October last.  The task force based its report on 123 submissions which were received from all over the country and also from discussions with the Health Research Board, which had compiled details of treated drug misuse in the greater Dublin area and with the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board.  The first report concentrated on the heroin abuse problem and identified ten priority areas in the Dublin area, but Dún Laoghaire was not listed among these areas.  The task force will continue to meet and to report on various aspects of demand reduction for drugs.  The issue of service provision in Dún Laoghaire will be dealt with by the relevant agencies in the light of the task force recommendations.</P>

As part of the preparation of a national cancer strategy, I set up a cancer strategy group last year to advise me on the future direction of services.  The cancer strategy group held wide-ranging consultations with many organisations and received written submissions from a number of them.  The organisations consulted included the relevant professional bodies with an interest in all aspects of cancer, as well as individual haematologists, radiotherapists and rehabilitation specialists.  The group also consulted organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and Turning Point.  While discussions were not held specifically with the Foyle Hospice, the group met two representative bodies interested in hospice care &mdash; the Irish Hospice Foundation and the Irish Association for Palliative Care.  I have taken full account of the recommendations of the cancer strategy group views in drawing up the <Col N="1504" /> national cancer strategy.  I hope to be in a position to publish the strategy in the near future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 106 together.  The subvention scheme which accompanied the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, came into operation on 1 September 1993 and ensures that those most in need of care in a nursing home, and without the means to pay for it receive assistance towards that cost.  Since the introduction of the scheme to 31 December 1995 a total of £31.2 million has been expended on subventions and this year, just over £16 million has been allocated to the scheme.  It should be noted that since the implementation of the Act, the Western Health Board has received £5.82 million to fund nursing home subventions.</P>
      <P>Seven of the health boards are processing applications for nursing home subvention in the usual manner and no delays are occurring in the payment of subvention, except those delays caused by applicants furnishing incorrect or incompleted data to the boards.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Western Health Board that there are currently 550 individuals in receipt of a subvention from the board.  At 30 September a further 111 applicants had been approved for subvention and were awaiting payment of same. However, it should be noted that a number of these applicants will not, in fact, avail of payment for various reasons.  I would like to assure the Deputies that discussions are ongoing between officials of my Department and representatives of the Western Health Board regarding the funding of the nursing home subvention scheme and I will advise you of the outcome of these discussions as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the great difficulties facing people with disabilities in obtaining employment and my department, together with the National Rehabilitation Board (NRB), operates a range of measures to improve employment prospects for people with disabilities.  One such measure is the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities.  This programme which was set up for a three year period in 1994 provides for the employment of people with disabilities in viable business enterprises.  One of the conditions of participation was that at least 50 per cent of the employees were people with disabilities.  There are currently seven enterprises participating in the programme employing 177 people with disabilities.  This programme is currently being evaluated.  On receipt of this evaluation which will be completed shortly, I will be in a position to make a decision regarding the future of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment support scheme which was set up in 1990 also assists people with disabilities to obtain open employment.  The scheme offers financial support to employers to encourage them to employ people with disabilities whose work productivity levels are less than average.  There are currently 392 people with disabilities in employment with the assistance of the employment support scheme.  The National Rehabilitation Board which administers the scheme has recently carried out an evaluation of the scheme.  This evaluation will be considered by the NRB board at its meeting on 7 November 1996.  The NRB also launched a new &ldquo;Positive to Disability&rdquo; symbol in May, 1996.  An initial twelve companies were awarded the symbol in recognition of their commitment to the employment of people with disabilities. Discussions are on-going with a further group of companies and it is intended to award the symbol at six monthly intervals to eligible companies.  A conference on employment of people with disabilities &ldquo;Making the most of your Workforce&rdquo;<Col N="1507" /> which was organised jointly between the Department of Health and the NRB in May addressed some of the concerns of employers in relation to both the retention of employees who acquire a disability and the employment of persons with a disability.</P>
    <P>The NRB also operates general support services to people seeking employment.  These include the workplace equipment adaptation grant whereby the NRB provides employers with a grant towards the costs of adapting the workplace to accommodate people with disabilities and job clubs which provide a range of supports free of charge for people with disabilities who are seeking employment.  It is also recognised that the availability of high quality and appropriate vocational training is essential to enhance the employment potential of people with disabilities.  To achieve this a range of high quality training courses which lead to nationally recognised certification is available.  The NRB currently employs a number of employment coordinators to review the relationship of current training provision to labour market needs.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures to assist people with disabilities obtain open employment and supported employment, sheltered work enterprises provide work places for people with disabilities who are unable to obtain or retain open employment.  These places are provided by statutory and voluntary agencies and by health boards.  Day activity services are also provided as an alternative to sheltered work where appropriate.</P>

Work on the preparation of the plan is well advanced and I expect to publish it later this year.  The database has identified the needs of children, such as those attending the Burren View centre and other similar services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Western Health Board region, the provision of services to persons with a mental handicap is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.  Issues relating to <Col N="1508" /> the planning and co-ordination of services to persons with a mental handicap in the Western Health Board area are dealt with by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee.  The committee's role is to identify priorities for service developments, agree plans for the development of services for each region and recommend the provision of services as resources become available.  The co-ordinating committee is representative of the health board, the voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap.  Details of the precise services to be put in place in the Western Health Board area resulting from the provision of any additional funding which may come on stream would be agreed by the board with the co-ordinating committee and within any guidelines which may be issued by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 94, 95, 96, 97 and 104 together.  Because of the present temporary difficulty in exporting healthcare risk waste for incineration in the UK, my Department has, on 24 October, confirmed its acceptance of the proposals made by an Irish waste management company to have this waste exported to the Netherlands for incineration.  The implementation of these arrangements will involve the health agencies entering into agreements with the company for the disposal of their healthcare risk waste from a current date to the end of February, 1997.  Under the terms of the proposed agreements, the destination can be changed to the UK, if the current ban is lifted by the UK authorities and it is cheaper to send the waste for disposal there.  The estimated additional cost of these arrangements is currently being assessed by the agencies, and I am not in a position at this stage to give a precise figure.</P>
      <P>My attention was first drawn to the fact that the Eastern Health Board was processing waste from some of their other hospitals at James Connolly Memorial Hospital by a statement issued by the board on 22 October 1996.  The information which the Deputy is seeking in relation to the inventory and origin of the waste is being sought from the Eastern Health Board.  I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board and the position is that the microwave plant at James Connolly Memorial Hospital is now treating only the waste arising at that hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the conditions attaching to the planning permission are a matter for the board and Fingal County Council.  However, I have had inquiries made of the board, and I understand <Col N="1510" /> that, at the time when the letter of 4 July from the health board to the county council was written, the board was in compliance with all planning conditions.  There is no question of the public health having been at risk during the present temporary difficulties, and action has been taken by my Department to deal with the matter.  In these circumstances, I do not propose to institute any public inquiry.</P>
    <P>The joint North/South group on disposal of healthcare waste was established in June 1995. The group comprises technical and purchasing specialists representative of my Department and the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland, health boards, voluntary hospitals and trusts.  The group reported to the two Ministers for their meeting in December 1995 and recommended a joint approach to the market in order to secure better prices and security of service.  This recommendation was accepted and approval was given to tenders being sought through the EU purchasing procedures.  The output of the group has been a set of tender documents, comprising technical specification, principal agreement, subsidiary contract, form of tender and price schedule.  The reliable treatment of health care risk waste to a high standard requires the use of sophisticated and expensive equipment, properly maintained and operated by well trained staff.  My Department is of the view that it would be expensive to provide such treatment in each hospital site.</P>

      <P>The board has advised me that discussions are currently taking place with the Galway Branch of the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland on the provision of a day service for Alzheimer's sufferers in Galway city.  The proposal is that the day service will be run and funded by the Galway branch of the Alzheimer's Society.  The board has informed me that, to date, the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland has not applied to them for funding for this project.  However, the board is considering a request to make suitable accommodation for the centre available to the society.</P>

Under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, health boards are empowered, where there is reason to believe that a probable source of infection exists, to carry out an investigation and take such steps as are necessary or desirable for investigating the nature and source of such infection, for preventing the spread of such infection and for removing conditions favourable to such infection.</P>

However, it is my intention to request <Col N="1513" /> the health boards to visit tattoo parlours and for this purpose my Department is drafting a guide to good practice for tattooing.  This guide will principally deal with the prevention of the spread of infection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general principle, I believe that the existence of incentives for film production in other states offers the potential for Irish producers to engage in film co-productions with producers in those states and, therefore, that such incentives elsewhere have the potential to benefit the Irish film industry.  A typical co-production arrangement of this sort would involve the producers in Ireland and in the co-producing state exploiting the film incentives available in both states.  As a result, pre and post production work on the film might be undertaken in the partner country, while all or a significant element of the film shoot might be undertaken in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Irish film producers have traditionally entered into co-production arrangements with British producers most often.  To illustrate this point, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that of the 11 feature film co-productions with an Irish involvement which have been supported by the Council of Europe's Co-production Fund, EURIMAGES, ten have involved a British coproducer. Moreover, Irish producers have co-produced with British partners in such major television dramas as &ldquo;Ballykissangel&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Governor&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Hanging Gale&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, the introduction of additional incentives for film production in Britain is a welcome development for the Irish industry, which is well placed to benefit through <Col N="1521" /> co-production mechanisms from these incentives. Such a process also offers the potential for the making of better quality films.  I would emphasise to the Deputy in this regard that the existence of a comprehensive range of incentives for film production in Ireland up to 1999 is an essential aspect of the potential for Irish producers to enter into worthwhile co-productions with British producers and, indeed, producers elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The Burren National Park study, which was commissioned by me, was set in the context of a strategy for the wider north Clare area and published in February last as a discussion document for public consultation over a 12 week period in which a wide range of views were welcomed and received.  It recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> a limited level of visitor facilities within the national park.</P>
      <P>To that end, a planning application was lodged with Clare County Council on 24 October 1996.</P>
      <P>This application, made by the Commissioners for Public Works in Ireland on my behalf, is for permission for an entry point at Crag Road (CR 103), Gortlecka and Knockaunroe, to the Burren National Park, comprising covered waiting area, toilets, ranger accommodation, ancillary parking, storage and signage.  The application proposes the removal of elements, including the equipment building, treatment plant (part), landscaping (part) and the retention and completion of elements, including landscaping (part), reservoir and treatment plant (part), of a previously proposed visitor centre which will otherwise be backfilled and the land reinstated to its previous condition.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Closing off&rdquo; a Cohesion Fund scheme is an administrative arrangement between the national authorities and the European Commission whereby the Commission limit their commitment to co-financing a scheme, or stage of a scheme, at a given level of expenditure.  The procedure has not been used to date but two schemes that have been delayed at planning stage, namely the Westport and Tramore sewerage schemes, are currently in the process of being closed off.  The Westport and Tramore sewerage schemes, are currently in the process of being closed off.  This procedure does not, in itself, affect future applications for the co-financing of further stages of the schemes nor does it affect the overall level of Cohesion funding available in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Cohesion Funding of £2.2 million was approved by the European Commission for stage 1 of the Westport sewerage scheme in March 1994; to date, a total of £912,000 has been received from the Commission towards expenditure on Stage 1. The final level of eligible expenditure for Stage 1 has yet to be agreed with the Commission.</P>

      <P>The interest rate on local authority fixed rate house purchase loans is related to the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and is fixed for the life of the loan.  It is not possible to reduce the interest rate on these loans as the cost involved would be substantial and would have to be borne by the Exchequer and local authorities. However, borrowers of these loans may redeem them without penalty and refinance in the private sector, if they consider it advantageous to do so.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at this stage to indicate when a site will be purchased for Gaelscoil Thomáis Dáibhís.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the overall accommodation situation in the Mallow centre.  Where there is existing surplus primary school accommodation, as in the case of Mallow, options for housing a gaelscoil, other than the provision of a new school building, must be given serious consideration.  The Deputy will appreciate that the most effective use of public monies must be made by my Department, particularly at a time when the demand for capital expenditure exceeds available resources.</P>
      <P>As soon as this examination is completed, the question of making funds available for the acquisition of a site for Gaelscoil Thomáis Dáibhís will be considered.</P>

      <P>The process of implementing the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee is taking place on a planned basis and as available resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has already been made in improving the level and quality of service across the entire spectrum of special needs.  Measures which have already been implemented include a very substantial increase in special capitation rates payable to pupils attending special schools in special classes; a one unit improvement in the pupil teacher ratio for all special schools and classes in the 1995-96 school year; the upgrading of specialised equipment required in special schools and classes; a pilot scheme for the provision of escorts and safety harnesses on certain school transport services to assist pupils with special needs; the counting of pupils enrolled in special classes in ordinary national schools in determining the overall enrolment of the school <Col N="1543" /> for staffing purposes; the recruitment of additional psychologists to the school psychological service; the appointment of an additional 241 remedial teachers and 36 resource teachers, bringing the total number of such posts in the primary sector to 1,188 and 36 respectively; and the appointment of an additional 150 child care assistants to special schools, bringing the total number of such posts to 232.</P>
    <P>In the current school year, I am continuing this process with the appointment of an additional ten resource teachers.  I am also appointing an additional five teachers to the visiting teacher services.</P>
    <P>Also in the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have outlined and which are in line with the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee, are contributing to a significant improvement in the level and quality of service available to special needs pupils.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers and another adjacent school submitted a joint application to my Department seeking the provision of a resource teacher post, a special class for mildly mentally handicapped children, and a special class for children with moderate mental handicap. In the current year, a total of ten resource teacher posts were available for allocation to primary schools dealing with children with disabilities on a fully integrated basis.  The needs of all applicant schools, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, were considered in this context.  Schools were selected for receipt of these posts on the basis of priority of need.  Unfortunately, the school mentioned by the Deputy was not successful on this occasion.  The needs of the school will again be considered when I am next in a position to allocate resource teacher posts. However, I should point out that my Department has recently sanctioned the establishment of a special class to cater for children with mild mental handicap from the Dunmanway area.  My Department's inspectorate is also currently examining the educational needs of children from the area who suffer from moderate mental handicap.</P>

      <P>I regret that it is not possible to provide figures on the details sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Primary schools with adequate resources, both teaching and accommodation, generally admit all pupils who seek entry.  Accordingly, most parents are able to have their children enrolled in the school of their first choice.  The managerial authorities of schools not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry normally implement an enrolment policy.  Local circumstances may be such that, from time to time, the board of management of a particular school may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. The majority of Irish primary schools are denominational in their governance, structure and operation.</P>
      <P>I do not envisage that a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio would have any overall impact on the enrolment arrangements made by such schools.</P>

      <P>Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 &mdash; the provisions of which were continued in force indefinitely by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1987 &mdash; provides for a special procedure for the vesting of a fee simple in dwellinghouses.  A separate and self contained flat in premises divided into two or more such flats is not a dwelling within the meaning of the Act and, accordingly, the special procedure contained in <Col N="1551" /> Part III of the Act does not apply to such premises.  The question of acquiring the fee simple in relation to such premises is dealt with in other aspects of the landlord and tenant code &mdash; for example, provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>I understand that the primary purpose of Part III of the 1978 Act was to provide that owner-occupiers of dwellinghouses would have a special procedure available to acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property.  Dwellinghouses which are let for commercial purposes give rise to different considerations.  I am satisfied that Part III of the Act has worked well in practice &mdash; as evidenced by the number of householders who have availed of the scheme to by out their ground rents &mdash; and, in the circumstances which I have outlined, I have no plans at present to widen the categories of persons who may avail of the procedure under that part of the Act.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a commitment in the Government Policy Agreement to reform the law relating to the administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the report of the Committee on Fundraising Activities for Charitable and Other Purposes, which included recommendations in relation to lotteries.  Work on the preparation of this legislation is proceeding and it is hoped to introduce the legislation early next year.</P>
      <P>To assist this process, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Joan Burton established an advisory group on charities comprising representatives of a number of organisations working in the area.  The report of the group is expected shortly, and any changes to the cap on lottery prizes will be considered in the context of the subsequent charities legislation.</P>
      <P>The cap on lottery prizes should, I believe, be considered in relation to the wider circumstances which relate to the regulation of lotteries.  I do not propose to review it in isolation from all the other very relevant factors.</P>

      <Quest>the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees criteria according to which asylum applications are currently evaluated; when the Refugee Act will be fully implemented; if she will undertake that all outstanding asylum applications will be dealt with under the terms of the Refugee Act; if she will suspend all deportations of asylum seekers until full implementation of the Act; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications for refugee status in the State are currently dealt with in accordance with the terms of an arrangement entered into with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees &mdash; UNHCR &mdash; in December 1985.  This arrangement provides that (a) applications for refugee status may be made to an immigration officer on arrival in the State or directly to my Department if the individual is already in the State; (b) immigration officers have been provided with written guidelines indicating, <i>inter alia,</i> that a person should not be returned to a country where his personal safety might be seriously threatened as a result of the political situation prevailing there; (c) asylum seekers will not be refused entry or removed from the State until given an opportunity to present a case fully; (d) every application will be examined in accordance with the UN Convention and Protocol; (e) every facility, including interpreters where possible, will be provided to help an applicant in making a case; (f) the need for confidentiality and privacy is given high priority; (g) an applicant is informed that he may contact UNHCR or a local representative; (h) each applicant is given a personal interview; (i) nothing will prevent humanitarian considerations being considered which might justify permission to remain in the State; (j) the UNHCR may be consulted on each application, and will consult when a negative decision is proposed &mdash; they are consulted on all applications.</P>
      <P>This formal procedural arrangement with the UNHCR has been found by the courts to be legally binding.  Since November 1993 an appeals mechanism has been in place.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, will be implemented as soon as all the necessary implementing regulations are in place, the requisite staff for the new determination bodies are recruited and trained and appointments as Refugee Applications Commissioner and members of the Refugee Appeal Board are made.  While work is ongoing on all these issues in my Department at present, I do not envisage that the new system will be in operation before April 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, puts into statutory form our obligations as parties to international instruments in the field of refugees.  While the Act is not in force all persons involved in the determination process in my Department, <Col N="1556" /> including the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and myself, operate within the spirit of the Act.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is suggesting that no more cases be processed under the existing arrangements, but that all applications await the implementation of the Act, I would have to say that this would be an unreasonable proposal.  We are currently receiving on average about 100 applications for refugees status each month and a serious backlog in the processing of these applications has developed.  If we were to hold over processing applications until the new bodies are in place they would find themselves in an impossible position <i>vis-à-vis</i> processing current cases along with a significant backlog.</P>
    <P>In so far as the deportation of asylum seekers is concerned, I would advise the Deputy that asylum seekers are not deported.  However, if at the end of all procedures a person is not found to meet the criteria as laid down in the UN Convention relating to the status of refugees the logical consequences is to inform the applicant of this and ask them to leave.  However, in practice, many applicants seek leave to remain and may be granted it depending on their particular circumstances.  The UNHCR, the guardians of the convention, have advised that a vital element of any effective asylum procedure is a fair process followed by the return of unsuccessful applicants.</P>
    <P>Instances have also arisen of persons seeking to make applications in this State where those applications should, in accordance with customary international practice, have been dealt with in another state.  In instances such as this, applicants will not be admitted to the asylum process and will be returned to the state which should appropriately deal with their requests for refugees status.  Such return will always be preceded by a clarification and confirmation that the other state is willing to accept back the person in question and to process his or her application.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 213 and 225 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered since January 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>I would accept that there are anomalies in the pensions area that need to be addressed.  The yearly average condition can give rise to particular problems for people with gaps in their insurance records, including women who give up employment to work in the home and then return to work at a later time.  A number of these problems have been addressed by the Department in recent years, including the introduction of the Homemaker's scheme in April 1994, which allows for periods of time spent out of the workforce caring either for children aged up to six years, increased to 12 years from 6 April 1995, or incapacitated people to be ignored or disregarded when calculating a person's pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>The matter also arises for consideration in the context of the final report of the National Pensions Board &mdash; NPB &mdash;&ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo; which recommended a pro-rata pension scheme, which, in its view, would resolve the problems arising from gaps in coverage in a more comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NPB report recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> a wider range of pro-rata pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime, where, for example an average of 45 or over, as against 48 at present would qualify a person for the maximum rate of pension while a minimum 30 per cent of full rate pension would be payable for an average of ten to 14 contributions.  They also recommend that the number of paid contributions to qualify for retirement and old age contributory pension be increased from 156 &mdash; three years &mdash; to 520 <Col N="1560" /> contributions &mdash; ten years.  As such proposals could lead to a reduction in entitlement for future pensioners, when compared with present arrangements, they have to be evaluated very carefully.</P>
    <P>The report and its recommendations are being studied within the Department at present with a view to bringing forward proposals in a budgetary context.  Any such proposals would also, of course, have to take account of the future financing of pensions generally.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for an old age contributory pension on 14 April 1994, although he was 66 years of age in September 1989.  This pension was awarded with effect from 14 January 1994, three months prior to the date of claim receipt.</P>
      <P>Information recently to hand indicates that the person concerned had contacted the Department in January 1994 in relation to another benefit claim, On this basis, it has been decided to backdate pension entitlement to him for a further six months period from that date &mdash; that is, nine months in total &mdash; to the end of July 1993. Arrangements have been made to issue a cheque to him, covering the additional pension arrears due from 30 July 1993 to 13 January 1994 inclusively.  There is no basis in legislation for any further backdating of pension entitlement in this case.</P>

      <P>One of the recommendations of the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly was that my Department introduce a £2 million grant scheme to provide grant-aid to voluntary groups in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  The recommendation, which I accepted, was for a scheme of grants to voluntary and community groups, and not a scheme of payments to individuals.  Making the funds available through voluntary organisations, with their local knowledge and expertise, ensures that the available funds are targeted on the most vulnerable older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subsequently established a National Advisory Committee, on which the National Council for <Col N="1561" /> the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out Campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána &mdash; Neighbourhood Watch &mdash; are represented, to advise on the implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided that funding could be provided for: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems.  Grants towards the cost of conventional burglar alarm systems are not available under the scheme.  The strong advice available to me from the advisory committee and the Garda Síochána is that conventional burglar alarms are of limited use to vulnerable elderly people living alone.</P>
    <P>As the scheme came about as a direct result of the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly, it was intended to provide funding for older people, which for the purpose of the scheme includes anyone over the age of 65 years living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people or older people and other vulnerable and dependent people.  Anyone wishing to avail of this scheme could contact any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable or older people, who would make an application to my Department on their behalf.</P>
    <P>As funding under the scheme is provided to voluntary organisations, not individuals, the question of a means test does not arise.  However, the intention is that resources are targeted at the most vulnerable older people.</P>

      <P>The conditions for receipt of the third level allowance requires a person to be in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months, attending an approved course at an approved third level institution and aged 21 years or over at the commencement of the course. These conditions are outlined in the Department's Information Leaflet SW 70 entitled <i>Education Opportunities for Unemployed People and Lone Parents.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned made her application for the third level allowance scheme on 7 October 1996.  The application was refused on 21 October 1996 as she had already completed three years of <Col N="1562" /> the course, which commenced in 1992.  In 1992, the conditions for receipt of the allowance required a person to be aged 23 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for 390 days.  The person concerned did not satisfy the conditions that prevailed at the commencement of the course.  She was informed of the decision on 22 October 1996.</P>

      <P>The free electricity and free TV licence allowance, and the free telephone rental allowance are available to people aged 66 years and over and to certain disabled people under age 66 who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and who are either living alone or would otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In July 1994 the living alone condition was eased to allow pensioners aged 75 or over who were entitled to the allowance to retain them when another person came to live with them.</P>
      <P>Any reduction in the current age limit, leading to a further easing in the living alone condition, would have cost implications and could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Subject to fulfilling certain contribution conditions, a person under 66 years of age who ceases to be compulsorily insured under the PRSI system may opt to become a voluntary contributor and pay voluntary contributions in order to maintain his or her entitlement to retirement and contributory old age pensions, contributory widows, widowers and orphans pensions, deserted wife's benefit and death grant. I should mention that credited contributions, awarded in a variety of circumstances to people leaving the compulsory PRSI system, also serve to maintain the social welfare entitlements referred to above and, consequently, they obviate the necessity in such circumstances to pay contributions on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gaps in a person's record of PRSI contributions can, of course, effect entitlement to contributory pensions at a later date.  In that context, I am concerned to ensure that PRSI contributors are aware of the voluntary contributor option where it may be of relevance <Col N="1563" /> to them and the position in this regard is kept under regular review.</P>
    <P>Where a person notifies my Department of having ceased compulsory PRSI, he or she is informed of their options in relation to the payment of voluntary contributions.  In addition, detailed references to voluntary contributions are included in my Department's main information literature which is also published on RTE's Aertel services and on the Internet.  The information leaflet dealing specifically with voluntary contributions is currently being updated and will be available shortly through the network of social welfare local offices, citizens information centres and other voluntary sector information providers.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether persons on a contributory pension should be entitled to a free fuel allowance in view of the fact that such an allowance is currently means tested; the plans, if any, he has to examine this provision under the review of the national fuel scheme currently being undertaken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  In addition applicants must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right.</P>
      <P>Persons who apply for a non-contributory pension are subject to a means test whereby any income, investments and savings will be assessed as means.  As a result, the fuel allowance is granted automatically to non-contributory pensioners in order to avoid a double assessment of means.  As contributory pensioners can have income in addition to their contributory pension from my Department, they must satisfy the means test under the national fuel scheme in order to qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>A recipient of a contributory social welfare pension is regarded as being unable to provide for his heating needs if he, and members of his household, have a combined income of less than £15 per week in addition to the social welfare pension.  This was increased from £10 per week since the start of this year's fuel scheme on 14 October.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme has recently commenced to ensure that the scheme is operating effectively and equitably.  Independent consultants have been engaged to carry out this review and the adequacy of current rates of payment will be examined in this context.  The consultants are due to report to this Department in December.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that out of some 27,500 casual workers on the live register, 12,600 are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Such persons can qualify for unemployment assistance for days not worked subject to the means test which takes account of their earnings from casual employment.  Under the present method of assessment, a person is entitled to earn a sum equal to his-her daily rate of unemployment assistance plus £15 for each day worked without affecting his-her means.</P>
      <P>No definitive figures are available on the number of such workers who are assessed solely with means from insurable employment. However, it is estimated that approximately 4,400 casual employees have means from various sources assessed against them for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be announcing changes to the method of assessing earnings from insurable employment in order to give people a greater incentive to take up casual and part-time employment.  The new provisions simplify the method of assessment and will enable a person contemplating casual or part-time work to more readily determine its effect on his-her unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, every person in the State, whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant, has an entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance, SWA.</P>
      <P>People in full-time education, full-time employment and those involved in a trade dispute are generally excluded from receiving assistance under the SWA scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation provides for a number of exemptions to these excluded categories and students participating in a vocational training opportunities scheme, a second level initiative scheme, a third level allowance scheme, and a part-time education initiative scheme may continue to receive their full weekly social welfare payments and retain any secondary benefits, such as diet supplements under the <Col N="1565" /> SWA scheme, which they may have been receiving prior to their participation on one of these schemes.</P>
    <P>The definition of a qualified child has been extended, for the purposes of diet supplements, to include children between 18-22 years of age in full-time education who are dependent on their parents.  Such child dependants are treated as adults for the purpose of calculating the amount of diet supplement to be paid.</P>
    <P>The amount of supplement paid in respect of an adult or child dependant between the ages of 18 and 22 is either £27 or £35, depending on the type of diet, less a proportion of the applicant's weekly income.  The amount of any benefit or assistance paid in respect of a child dependant is not assessed as income when calculating a diet supplement in respect of an adult.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards under the provisions of S.I. 382 of 1995, as amended by S.I. 190 of 1996, which specifies the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid.  The main considerations in determining entitlement to a diet supplement are the type of diet prescribed, the household income and whether the person in respect of whom the diet supplement is payable is an adult or a child.</P>
    <P>A person, eligible for SWA, who wishes to apply for a diet supplement on behalf of a child dependant should contact the community welfare officer at his or her local health centre.</P>
    <P>Any further extension of the scheme would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The disabled person's maintenance allowance &mdash; DPMA &mdash; was transferred to my Department on 2 October 1996 and renamed disability allowance.  Regulations made in May 1996 provided that where a couple were both entitled to disabled person's maintenance allowance and had no other means, they would each receive a weekly personal rate of £64.50 i.e. a total payment of £129.  This provision was made following a High Court judgment in July 1995 which found that the articles in the disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations which limited the amount payable to a married couple who were both eligible for disabled person's maintenance allowance to be <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
      <P>Similar provision for the payment of two personal rates of disability allowance in such circumstances is made in the Social Welfare Act, 1996 which gave legislative effect to the transfer of the scheme to my Department.</P>
      <P>Where one of the couple is entitled to disability allowance and the other is entitled to invalidity pension and they have no other means, the amount payable is limited to the total amount which would be paid if one of the couple were in receipt of invalidity pension, in this case the higher rate of payment, which would include an increase in respect of the other person as an adult dependant.  The amount involved is £109.80.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy is one of a number being considered in the context of future provisions for people with disabilities.

      <Quest>the reason the newly introduced grant for twins excludes twins who reached 12 years late in 1995, but starting second level school on 1 September 1996, in view of the fact that these children are only 12 years old; if he will change the criteria for eligibility for this grant to include all twins starting second level schooling on 1 September 1996; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children up to age 16 and up to age 19 in respect of children who are in full-time education or physically or mentally handicapped.  Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents of twins, I made provision in the 1996 budget for increasing the grant in respect of the birth of twins from £200 to £500 and for the introduction of a new grant of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the ages of four and 12.  While these improvements were announced in the context of this year's budget, they were backdated to apply to all new born twins and those reaching the ages of four and 12, respectively, on or after 1 January 1996.  To date, over 1,400 families have benefited at a cost of almost £700,000.</P>
      <P>In addition to the improved grants, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased to £29 for the first two children and £34 for the third and subsequent children.  When taken together with the increases provided for in the 1995 budget, these rates represent an increase of 45 per cent in the rate payable for the first two children and 36 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of other children.</P>
      <P>Assistance with back to school expenses is also provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards and funded by my Department. This year, I increased the back to school clothing and footwear allowance to £43 in respect of children from two to 11 years of age and £58 in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years of age.  This allowance benefits some 114,000 families with 270,000 children.</P>
      <P>I will be considering further improvements in the system of child income support in the context of formulating proposals for next year's budget.</P>

      <P>The activities of investment intermediaries are regulated by statute.  The Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, which was signed into law by the President on 4 July 1995, sets down a regulatory regime for all investment intermediaries and establishes two supervisory authorities to oversee the process.  The regime established under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995 provides for a system of both direct regulation and self-regulation.</P>
      <P>I have ordered my Department to carry out a review of the approach to regulation, with particular regard being had to the role for self-regulation. Until that review is completed, it would be inappropriate for me to come to any judgment as to whether self-regulation has failed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>To date in 1996 a total of eight new firms were established in County Donegal.  Of these, five were assisted by the county enterprise board in the manufacturing, specialist services and crafts sectors.  They are located in Carndonagh, Ramelton, Letterkenny, Burtonport and Donegal town.  The projects have resulted in the creation of eight full-time and two part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>The other three firms were only recently established with Forbairt assistance.  Two are in the food sector and one in the engineering sector. When fully established it is expected that they will create 46 jobs.</P>
      <P>While to date in 1996, no new overseas companies have established in Donegal, IDA Ireland also stimulates and supports the expansion of existing companies in the area.  A number of firms like Unifi and Abbott Laboratories continue to expand and new jobs have been created in these companies in 1996.</P>
      <P>To date, in 1996 two overseas assisted companies closed in Donegal as follows: Donegal Rubber Ltd., Ballyshannon, and Strongbelt (Ireland), Letterkenny.  At their peak these companies employed 160 and 13 people, respectively.  Both companies were engaged in the manufacture of rubber components for the automotive industry.</P>
      <P>Forbairt, IDA Ireland and Donegal County Enterprise Board are continuing to work hard to promote industrial development in County Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for support of enterprise establishment and expansion is a delegated function of the industrial development agencies which operate under the aegis of my Department.  I have been in touch with these agencies and none is aware of any project for the Gort area currently in the pipeline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forbairt, which is responsible for indigenous <Col N="1571" /> industry, identifies and works with both small and medium-large companies throughout Ireland, including the west, by providing a comprehensive range of financial and development supports to Irish industry.  Successful companies in Gort which have been assisted by Forbairt in the past include Duffy Meat Exports, Top Form Ltd. and Dawn Components.  It would welcome new projects from local entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>Under its community enterprise development programme, Forbairt assists community groups to provide enterprise centres in areas where suitable work space is in short supply.  The agency's director in the west region met, only last week, with representatives of the Gort and South Galway Traders and Development Association to discuss what assistance, if any, Forbairt could provide towards the establishment of an enterprise centre in Gort.  Forbairt, which is committed to working with and providing assistance to local enterprise organisations, will continue to assist the group with its development proposal.</P>
    <P>Forbairt also works in close co-operation with the Galway County and City Enterprise Board. Since its establishment in 1993, the board has supported 19 projects in the Gort area in a range of sectors including glass, jewellery, furniture, equestrian tourism, heritage and pottery.  Grants approved for the projects amount to almost £100,000 of which over £50,000 has been drawn down.  The projects have resulted in the creation of approximately 35 jobs in the area.  It is the intention of Galway CCEB to continue to promote local enterprise throughout all areas of the country, including Gort.</P>
    <P>While IDA Ireland actively promotes the location of overseas industry to the west region, the Deputy will understand that the number of greenfield manufacturing projects attracted to Ireland in any year is limited.  Many of these have specific locational requirements which means they are not mobile within the country. Ultimately, the choice of location is made by the company taking account of competitive advantages such as infrastructure and business environment.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland owns a site of 5.68 acres in Gort which the agency is actively promoting to potential investors.</P>
    <P>In addition to seeking new investors, IDA Ireland also works closely with existing industry to encourage development and expansion.  Last year, for example, Lisk Ireland Ltd. announced a major expansion to its facility in Gort; the extension to the firm's premises is currently under way and recruitment of extra personnel commenced some time ago.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will note from the above table the positive net change in employment in Forbairt-IDA Ireland assisted companies in County Louth in each of the years 1993-95.  Current indications suggest that the figures for 1996 will also show a net increase.  In addition, Heinz has just commenced recruiting for the recently approved Custom Foods Weight Watchers facility in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Also, Louth County Enterprise Board, which was established in late 1993, has been very active in the promotion of small and micro-enterprise projects in the county.  During 1993-94, 21 full-time jobs were created in enterprises supported by the board.  The figure for 1995 was 70 full-time jobs.  In addition, 37 part-time jobs were created in 1995 in CEB-supported enterprises.  To date in 1996, 59 full-time jobs have been created in enterprises supported by the board.</P>

      <P>I have not appointed a second set of consultants to examine any aspect of the deflector issue.  The only consultancy that is in place on this subject is the one referred to in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 215 and 216 of 8 October last.</P>

      <P>Ryanair is seeking adjustments to the airport charges regime at Dublin Airport in connection with the airlines proposals for the introduction of services to Europe.</P>
      <P>My Department has asked Aer Rianta to examine Ryanair's request.  I understand that this examination will be completed very shortly and my officials will then report to me on the matter.</P>
      <P>I should point out that in examining this request Aer Rianta has to take account of the position of all airlines, not just Ryanair.  The Deputy will also be aware that under European Union Single Market rules in the air transport sector, all licensed EU air carriers are free to provide services on any international route within the Community without Government control. However, the question as to whether an airline wishes to inaugurate services on a particular route is, of course, entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises the social importance of public transport services, including those serving rural communities.  Accordingly, an annual Exchequer subvention of approximately £100 million is paid to Córas Iompair Éireann in respect of a wide range of socially-necessary services which cannot be operated on a fully commercial basis.  The allocation of this subvention between the three operating companies within the CIE group and its application in support of particular services are matters exclusively for the boards of Córas Iompair Éireann and of the operating companies, respectively.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Exchequer subvention provided to CIÉ is applied in conformity with the relevant EU Regulations and the group's statutory mandate to provide reasonable, efficient and costeffective transport services throughout the country having due regard <i>inter alia</i> to the board's social role and the financial resources available to the group.  Within that broad framework, decisions on service levels and all other operational arrangements are matters entirely for the boards and management of the CIE companies and I have no function in that regard.</P>

    <P>Note: (The 1995 figure for consultancy costs is the cost in that year of all consultants engaged by my Department, including consultations whose costs were met by the Dún Laoghaire Harbour (Finance) Board.  The 1990 figure is the cost in that year of engineering consultancies and those consultancies whose costs were met from subhead A7 of the Marine Vote. While the cost of some other consultancies would have been met from other subheads of the Vote, this figure reflects the bulk of the consultancy costs incurred in that year.)</P>

      <P>The strict demarcation between the deep sea sector of Dublin Port and the other areas of the port no longer exists.  Trade passes to and from the deep sea terminals and the other terminals in line with competition and availability of ships and services.  Trade in Dublin Port is buoyant and continues to increase and I see a very successful future for the port.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280, 281 and 282 together.</P>
      <P>There is acknowledged potential for further development of the Irish seaweed sector in terms of primary production and value added products. Arramara Teoranta, which is 51 per cent owned by the State, is the major player in the sector with an annual turnover of over £2 million employing 30 people full-time at its two production facilities in Connemara and Donegal and over 500 workers on a seasonal basis along the western seaboard. Arramara Teo. has recently prepared a three year corporate strategy plan, at my request, which is being considered by my Department at present, and which envisages incremental expansion in production over the medium-term.</P>
      <P>There has been a welcome and growing increase in entrepreneurial activity generally in the seaweed sector in recent years which has led to the establishment of the Irish Seaweed Industry Organisation which is pursuing further development opportunities for the industry. Future sustainable development of the seaweed resource will depend primarily on the extent and nature of that resource and, to that end, a comprehensive national scientific survey of seaweed resources around the coast is currently under way.  This major project is a joint initiative by Arramara Teo., the Irish Seaweed Industry Organisation, UCG and UCC and is being funded under the Marine Research Measure of the Operational Programme for Fisheries.  The survey is due for completion next year and the data obtained will critically inform future sustainable development strategies for the seaweed sector throughout coastal regions.</P>

      <P>Licensing of shellfish growers in Trawbreaga Bay has been held up by a longstanding, though to date unproven, claim lodged, on behalf of certain individuals, to ownership of fishery rights in the Bay.</P>
      <P>The Department has been pressing the claimants for some considerable time to substantiate these entitlements.  The claimants have recently submitted documentation purporting to support their claim and this has been referred to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for assessment and advice.  The Department will continue to pursue the matter with a view towards resolving the impasse.</P>

      <P>Current policy developments at EU level, as well as nationally, will continue to have an impact on developments in the Irish fishing industry over the next three years.  EU and national support for investment in the industry will continue up to end 1999 under the present Operational Programme for Fisheries with consequent economic benefits for the sector.  Decisions at EU level on improved control and conservation measures are expected to have positive impact for fishstocks in the short to medium term.  Fleet development will be influenced by existing constraints and opportunities.  Annual EU agreements on total allowable catches for quota species together with the outcome of present discussions on overall EU fleet capacity objectives for the next three years will in particular set the framework for developments in the catching sector up to 1999.</P>
