    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I paid an official visit to Poland from 24 to 26 April last.  This was the first official visit by a serving Taoiseach to Poland and it was most successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the visit I had detailed discussions with President Kwasniewski and Prime Minister Cimoszewicz.  These discussions covered bilateral relations, enlargement of the European Union, the Intergovernmental Conference, international crime and drug trafficking, <Col N="1378" /> the security situation in Europe and other issues on the European agenda of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with the President and Prime Minister I emphasised Ireland's support for Polish membership of the European Union.  I also touched on Irish concerns that would arise in the context of enlargement, especially in the areas of agriculture and the Structural Funds.  I made it clear that in Ireland's view enlargement must be accompanied by a deepening of European integration.</P>
    <P>Arising from my discussions with the Prime Minister we agreed the following specific follow-up measures: the Minister for Justice and her Polish counterpart will meet at an early date to discuss action at bilateral and European level against international crime, particularly drug trafficking.  There will be a bilateral meeting at appropriate political level to discuss how Ireland and Poland can best pursue the issue of nuclear safety at international level.  Ireland and Poland have somewhat similar interests in this area as neither country uses nuclear power for energy purposes and both are concerned by the proximity of nuclear powered installations in neighbouring states.  The Irish Presidency will, in accordance with the conclusions of the Madrid European Council, keep Poland fully informed of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference. The meeting in July next between the Tánaiste and the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs will afford an opportunity to raise Polish views on Intergovernmental Conference issues. There will be close liaison between both countries at diplomatic level in Brussels in advance of the Association Council meeting with Poland during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>During my visit to Poland I also had discussions with the Deputy Speaker of the Sejm &mdash; Lower House of Parliament &mdash; the Speaker of the Senate and with the Polish-Irish Parliamentary Association. I also addressed the College of Europe.  Natolin on the theme &ldquo;Challenges facing the European Union &mdash; an <Col N="1379" /> Irish perspective&rdquo;.  I attended a reception hosted by the Irish Ambassador to Poland at which the attendance included members of the Irish community in Poland and members of the Government and Opposition parties in Poland.  Finally, I attended a state dinner hosted by Prime Minister Cimoszewicz.  In my address at the dinner I paid tribute to the role Poland played throughout history and to its successful graduation to democracy after so many years of suffering and oppression.</P>
    <P>Prior to my departure for Poland on Wednesday, 24 April I had a meeting with the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Constantine Simitis.  The meeting was a friendly and productive one.  We had a wide ranging exchange of views on issues of interest to both countries, including the forthcoming Irish Presidency, the Intergovernmental Conference, bilateral relations, the situation in Cyprus and relations between Greece and Turkey.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to note that the meeting confirmed that Ireland and Greece agree on a large number of issues which will be addressed at the Intergovernmental Conference.  On issues such as the role and composition of the European Commission, the decision making procedures of the Union and the need to preserve the broad institutional balance and the balance between the member states our positions are similar.</P>
    <P>As regards Greek-Turkish relations, I indicated to the Prime Minister that we, with our EU partners, wished to see a reduction in tension between Greece and Turkey and informed him that the Irish Presidency would seek to be as helpful as possible in this regard. Finally, we both agreed that the European Union should continue to play an appropriate role in support of efforts to bring about a political settlement in Cyprus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his detailed reply and agree with him <Col N="1380" /> on the importance of Poland, one of the countries in Eastern Europe whose economy has made immense progress in recent years.  He mentioned that he had detailed discussions on enlargement and the Intergovernmental Conference. Does he agree there is a need for a systematic study of the possible effects and implications for this country of accession of a number of Eastern European countries which will affect practically everything, certainly the CAP, the Structural and Cohesion Funds and a range of other matters?  Does he consider this would be a suitable job for the NESC or the ESRI?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it was agreed at the Madrid summit that, after the Intergovernmental Conference, a report would be prepared for the following summit on the effect of enlargement on the financial perspectives for the European Union.  Obviously, finances are a very important consideration.  It is somewhat difficult at this stage to do a meaningful exercise on the impact of enlargement for a number of reasons.  First, the negotiations have not commenced and therefore, the terms of accession are not known.  Second, the negotiations are not likely to commence until after the Intergovernmental Conference and we do not know when that will be.  It is not possible to make projections when one does not have a precise date.  Third, there may well be transition periods which vary as between different countries and even within countries in regard to particular sectors of their economies or types of eligibility for EU aid.</P>
      <P>Any exercise carried out by NESC at this stage would be general and might not be as useful as a later one.  I agree with the basic thrust of the Deputy's comments that we need to study what is happening in these countries with a view to protecting our interests in an intelligent way while showing, at the same time, that the EU is open to new members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach think countries such as Poland and the next five countries will join the EU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have decided that negotiations will not commence until after the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know when that will end.  The most intelligent guesstimate of when the Intergovernmental Conference will conclude is mid 1997, so it is likely that negotiations will commence in the second half of that year.  Such negotiations will be influenced by decisions on the financial framework which will not be taken until after the Intergovernmental Conference. For sound political reasons, we should move forward with enlargement as quickly as possible.  It is noteworthy that Poland, more than any other east bloc country, has made more progress in returning its GDP per head to the pre 1989 level and is at 105 per cent of its GDP per head in 1989.  That indicates it has made the most progress in adjusting to the market economy.  For that reason, it is likely to be in the first tranche of countries to be admitted but the terms of admission have not been settled and much work remains to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it might be academic to carry out a study at this stage.  However, if we discuss the budgetary issues at the end of the Intergovernmental Conference &mdash; presumably we will argue for enlargement of the budget and that CAP should not be diluted and others will oppose them &mdash; it will be too late to put a case forward. We need to examine what enlargement of the budget will mean as far as Structural Funds and other matters are concerned prior to such debate. The issue should be examined over the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1382" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out the problems and the fact that the study would not be complete but that is not to say that such a study should not be carried out.  The Institute for European Affairs rather than NESC might be the best body to undertake that.  There is need for as much preparation as possible in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that if CAP were extended to Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary it would cost an extra £10 billion per year?  Does he accept that if this happened Irish agriculture would have to move to a more market based system as we would not get the kind of subsidies we receive at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Although those countries are mentioned in public comment, it is too early to assume that such countries will accede at a particular time. Agriculture in those countries is going through a major adjustment and in three or four years' time may well be different from what it is now.  As the economies of eastern Europe expand the demand for food products will increase dramatically.  Historically, the availability of food has been one of the big deficiencies in the economies of the east bloc countries, even prior to transition to the market economy.  There is slack to be picked up in terms of demand for food produced domestically in these countries and traded between them. One cannot make the assumptions the Deputy makes.  I agree with Deputy Ahern that prudent preparation is wise and it is important to recognise that, independent of enlargement, CAP reforms are bringing agriculture in this and other countries closer to the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach discussed with his Polish counterpart the problems we face from the use of nuclear power in adjoining nations.  Will he elaborate on the other security issues that were discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1383" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, will meet his Polish counterpart to discuss how to seek improvements in nuclear safety procedures not just in the EU but internationally. Poland faces problems from some countries which are unlikely to be in the EU.  We need to strengthen international norms, IAE norms and so on. We had a general discussion on security and discussed Poland's relationship with its neighbours and the considerations that arise therefrom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that there is need for an independent inspectorate at European and international level to examine problems with nuclear plants and that it is in the interests of countries such as Ireland and Poland to lobby for such?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I raised the issue with my Polish counterpart. Poland and Ireland have a common interest in this area and we are more likely to make progress together rather than separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach favour an independent inspectorate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and so does the Government.  Previous Governments also favoured it.  It makes sense from our point of view.  Obviously there will be problems getting other countries to agree to it but one way to move in that direction is for countries such as Ireland and Poland to work together.  I broached the matter with the Prime Minister and he readily agreed to my suggestion that our respective ministerial colleagues have a more detailed bilateral discussion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that in his discussions with the Greeks there were many areas of common ground.  How do they view European Monetary Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Greeks are in favour of the existing criteria and of the <Col N="1384" /> European Monetary Union proceeding. The Greek Prime Minister is particularly active in seeking to put the economy and public finances in such a position as to ensure Greece will be a member of European Monetary Union in due course.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding further with Question Time I am sure Members would wish to join me in welcoming a parliamentary delegation from Turkey, led by his Excellency Mr. Mostafa Kalemli, President of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues I wish to extend to him, his wife and all the members of his entourage a hearty céad míle fáilte to Ireland and to express the ardent hope that their stay with us will be very happy and successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there are sound political reasons for enlargement of the EU, but will the Taoiseach agree there are major unresolved issues among the existing 15 members, such as the future of CAP, which has been referred to, monetary union and the relationship with the Western European Union, and that those issues must be resolved before rushing to further enlargement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first, second and third parts of the Deputy's question is yes.  On the latter question, that is precisely the approach we are taking.  We do not propose to commence enlargement negotiations until the Intergovernmental Conference is over, by which time we will be on course for European Monetary Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I assume that Deputy Ahern's question refers to comments made by President Clinton when we met on 15 March.  This was a particularly useful meeting in the run up to the all-party negotiations fixed for 10 June.  The President said that the US involvement in the peace process &ldquo;presumes the integrity of any agreement which would be made&rdquo;.  He added that it would be very difficult for that agreement not to be carried because the United States would have placed its good faith in the process and because the whole world is looking at this.  The Government has always valued greatly the constructive and even-handed involvement of the US Administration &mdash; and of President Clinton particularly &mdash; in our efforts to bring about lasting peace and political agreement in Northern Ireland.  We will continue, as we have always done, to encourage this positive engagement on the part of the United States.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Harney's question on the comments I made on the peace process since yesterday week, I do not believe that it would be the best or most efficient use of Question Time to simply repeat every utterance I make outside this House on any given issue.  I will, of course, continue to answer specific questions as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> Regarding my meeting with the Federation of Irish Societies on 24 April, we had a useful and wide-ranging discussion, particularly on matters relating to the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in thanking the President of the United States for his continued interest in Northern Ireland.  He made a statement on this matter again recently.  What is the Taoiseach's opinion of the view of the Tánaiste's special adviser that talks without Sinn Féin are not worth a penny candle?  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware, although he was in Poland at the time, that the former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Peter Brooke, expressed a similar opinion when he stated in an interview for the latest book by Mallie-McKittrick that no great progress could be made unless the IRA engages in a ceasefire, that without a ceasefire there could be no negotiations. Will the Taoiseach give his view on both those comments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was dealt with extensively last week on behalf of the Government by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and her replies on that occasion were very fair and accurate in reflecting the Government's view as a whole.  She said:</P>
      <P>One can envisage negotiations without the participation of Sinn Féin, but negotiations involving one of the parties which has taken the road to violence would have far greater significance. The consistent Government view has been that we would like to see Sinn Féin taking part in the negotiations but the barrier to its participation is the failure of the IRA to call a ceasefire.</P>
      <P>That answers the Deputy's question in a balanced way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Question Time to the Taoiseach and the reason my <Col N="1387" /> question on Northern Ireland is so vague is that it is almost impossible to get a question down to the Taoiseach on Northern Ireland.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the comments of the Tánaiste's programme manager effectively give Sinn Féin a veto over the talks process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the person to whom the Deputy referred would purport to do anything of the kind.  No party has a veto over the talks process. I made that very clear in my public comments on this general matter not just last week but on many previous occasions.  No party has a veto, either by its absence or by what it does at the negotiations, on what others may wish to agree.  It is, however, important that we do everything possible to get all the parties to the talks.  There is no question that talks with all the parties would be much more valuable than talks with only some of them; that stands to reason.  Equally, we do not wish to see a position where people can veto progress by others simply by not turning up. Such an approach would be difficult from every point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On Mr. Ancram's statement on Sunday, will the Taoiseach state whether willingness to accept the Mitchell principles is a precondition to entering talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The communiqué agreed on 28 February between the Prime Minister and myself is absolutely clear on that point.  There are no preconditions for participation in the discussions other than in the case of Sinn Féin in terms of the reinstatement of the cessation of violence that applied from August 1994 until comparatively recently.  That is the only precondition. It is clear, however, in the communiqué that the Mitchell report is to be addressed at the outset of the negotiations, as are other matters which would need to be addressed to satisfy <Col N="1388" /> parties, including Sinn Féin, that the discussions will be comprehensive and that there is a willingness to negotiate across the entire agenda.  That is set out clearly in the communiqué and a matter to which I have repeatedly referred.  It is an approach which has widespread support and which provides the necessary assurances to all parties that their concerns will be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my understanding of the communiqué and I support it.  Is the Taoiseach concerned about or has he received clarification of the statement by Mr. Ancram, who is usually very precise in what he says, that he believes that the signing up to the Mitchell Commission is a precondition to talks and that that should be discussed in advance.  When asked the question a second time by the interviewer he made the exact same statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the commitment made by the Taoiseach to the Ulster Unionist delegation on 11 March regarding proposed legislation on decommissioning, what is the status of that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that for decommissioning to take place certain changes in legislation would need to be made in both jurisdictions in regard to, for example, the carrying out of forensic tests, the possible use of weapons as evidence in prosecutions and the issue of the legal liabilities of people who engage in decommissioning of weapons. These legal questions need to be addressed so that decommissioning can occur.  The issues concerned are quite complex, particularly in regard to people who might wish evidence based on particular weapons to be used in <Col N="1389" /> their defence; it is possible to envisage such evidence being used by the defence as much as by prosecuting authorities. Obviously there is a fine balance to be drawn here to ensure the rights of citizens to defend themselves from accusations are also vindicated in any legislation.</P>
      <P>This Republic has a written Constitution which means that any matters of this nature cannot be dealt with by regulation; original legislation cannot be made in this jurisdiction by regulation.  In countries without a written constitution &mdash; there is only one in the world of which I am aware &mdash; it is possible to do that and to have a short Bill stating, &ldquo;The Government may make such regulations as it deems fit to provide for the decommissioning of arms&rdquo;.  However, it is not possible to do that here.  The actual detail of the legislation involving the rights of the various parties affected has to be set out in statute.</P>

    <P>When I met the members of the Unionist Party delegation I told them there would be no block to the negotiations arising from any absence of legislation in this jurisdiction.  In other words, we will make sure that our legislation is in place in such a way as to ensure that no delays occur in decommissioning because of absence of legislation which could in any sense cause difficulties in the negotiations.  Since my discussions with the delegation, officials in the Department of Justice and in the Attorney General's office have been working almost full time on the preparation of this legislation.  It is at an advanced stage at this juncture.  The actual date of enactment, however, will not be decided at this stage.  I would be quite happy &mdash; I made this offer to the Unionist delegation and I repeat it now &mdash; to provide a detailed briefing for them on all of the legal aspects that have to be considered in this matter so that they will be assured we are dealing with this matter seriously, as we are dealing with all matters seriously that affect the addressing of the concerns of <Col N="1390" /> both sides of the community in Northern Ireland in regard to the talks commencing on 10 June.</P>

      <P>It will be necessary to have clarity prior to 10 June on how we will deal with decommissioning-related matters.  This is something that is of concern to both sides of the community in Northern Ireland.  Both sides agree from their very different perspectives that they do not want this issue to prevent other issues being dealt with.  It is one of the issues that needs to be dealt with as far as possible and in as much detail as possible prior to 10 June and it is in that spirit that the Government is devoting so much time to it.  As to whether the legislation will be introduced here or the extent to which that would be useful, that is a matter currently in discussion but I have given the assurance that the matter is being dealt with very seriously and that it will not be a block to progress on other issues.  That is the extent of the assurance I gave to the members of the Unionist delegation when I met them and I repeat that assurance now.  I further offer a briefing to any party, in particular the Unionist Party, that wishes to have one on the issues to be dealt with in that legislation.</P>

Does the Taoiseach believe that the SDLP, as well as Sinn Féin, should be briefed in relation to the Government's thinking on this crucial issue?  Will the Taoiseach agree that the loyalist parties, who also have a crucial interest in this matter, should be aware of the thinking of both Governments in this regard?

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The informal meeting in Verona earlier this month provided EU Finance Ministers with the opportunity for a general discussion on a number of topics, including economic and monetary union; taxation in the Union, the economic situation in the Union and employment.</P>
      <P>The focus of our discussions at Verona was on European Monetary Union issues and, in particular, on the mandate from the Madrid European Council meeting last December which requested EU Finance Ministers to report on the range of issues which arise from the fact that not all member states will adopt the euro from the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the European Council's mandate and also with the existing provision in the Treaty which requires member states to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common interest, Ministers agreed at Verona that work needs to be progressed on a new arrangement to govern exchange rate relations between participating and non-participating member states.  The new arrangement will provide continuity with the present ERM. Ministers were also agreed that, in framing the new arrangement, priority must <Col N="1394" /> be given to safeguarding monetary stability in the Single Market.  Also, the new arrangement should be so designed as to encourage member states which seek to join European Monetary Union after its 1 January 1999 commencement to develop closer links with the euro area. There was wide agreement that currency stability requires a strong commitment all round to convergence and strengthened surveillance procedures.</P>
    <P>Verona also provided political impetus for further study of another important policy issue raised by the Madrid European Council; that is, ways to ensure budgetary discipline in stage three of European Monetary Union, following German proposals for a stability pact among participating member states.  The rationale behind the stability pact idea is that in favourable economic periods, member states should aim for budget deficits lower than the Treaty reference value of 3 per cent of GDP, in order to ensure that the 3 per cent figure is respected even in less favourable conditions.  It is envisaged that work on the development of a new exchange rate arrangement and on the stability pact will be reviewed by EU Finance Ministers prior to the European Council in Florence in June.  Finally, there was agreement among Ministers on cent as the appropriate name of the sub-unit of the Euro.  We also gave authority for the holding of a competition to select an appropriate design for the new coinage.</P>
    <P>We also considered a wideranging paper on taxation in the European Union, prepared by the EU Commission, which was circulated by Commissioner Monti just before Easter.  The paper covered both direct tax and indirect tax issues and it focused on stabilisation of member state tax revenues, the smooth functioning of the Internal Market and the need for tax measures to play a role in promoting employment.  It was decided that further work on these topics would be facilitated by the establishment of a high level working party, under Commission auspices.  The Commission also promised to come forward with certain new <Col N="1395" /> proposals, notably in relation to the definitive VAT system.</P>
    <P>As regards the economic situation in the Union, there was general agreement among Ministers that, even though the rate of growth towards the end of 1995 and in early 1996 was disappointing in certain member states, the conditions exist for an upturn in growth later in 1996.  There was agreement that, while confidence has declined, the fundamentals remain positive.  World trade is buoyant, inflation in Europe is exceptionally low, the financial situation of firms is broadly favourable, monetary conditions have improved markedly and exchange rate distortions have been partially corrected.</P>
    <P>On unemployment, there was agreement that in order to combat the problem effectively, sound macro-economic policies must be complemented by practical and effective structural reforms. These reforms should be aimed at promoting a better functioning of goods and services markets and greater flexibility of the labour market.  In addition, it was recognised that effective and appropriate training, and the reduction of non-wage labour costs at the lower end of the wage scale &mdash; as we have been doing in Ireland in recent budgets &mdash; can contribute to a reduction in long-term unemployment.  Finance Ministers will, of course, be dealing with this issue at future meetings, and the whole subject of employment and unemployment will be a priority of the Irish Presidency starting in July.</P>

      <P>It was decided at the Verona summit that a new ERM would be established to govern relations between those inside and outside the European Monetary Union.  It was also decided to undertake studies into the problems involved in tightening multilateral supervision of countries' convergence programmes and in creating new sanctions for those who are insufficiently disciplined in that regard.  What will be the terms of reference for those studies and who will conduct them? <Col N="1396" /> What sanctions will be put in place in those areas and will they be binding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to answer definitively the questions posed by the Deputy.  The studies will be undertaken by the Commission, either by the monetary committee on its own or with the assistance of the European Monetary Institute, which is, as the Deputy knows, the forerunner of the emerging European Central Bank.  The type of sanction which might exist, the way it would be imposed and how it would be enforced are all matters for consideration. No definitive decisions have yet been made.  I have made the point that any developments in this area should be within the framework of existing Treaty provisions.  In other words, we would have the rule of law on our side and we would have access to the courts in the event of a dispute.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties which the British Prime Minister faces in his party on this matter, which have been brought to light in the past 48 hours, the British Chancellor, before the meeting in Verona, forcefully expressed his opposition to any further mechanisms for multilateral surveillance of the economies of other member states.  Given the problems which will face the Irish economy, particularly if the UK stays outside the European Monetary Union, how will these sanctions be put in place since the British Government does not want to participate in any future ERM or to take the road advocated by the other Finance Ministers at Verona?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution made by the Chancellor, Mr. Clarke, at the Verona informal council is well known. He prefaced his remarks by stating they were not views which he shared but that, nevertheless, they were perceptions and views which were widely shared in the United Kingdom.  He stated &mdash; I hope my summary does not do him an injustice &mdash; that there are many people in the United Kingdom <Col N="1397" /> who regard membership of the ERM as the cause of the major recession in the early 1990s.  They saw the departure of the United Kingdom on black Wednesday in September 1992 as a heaven sent opportunity and there was rejoicing and celebration in those quarters. The subsequent upturn in the United Kingdom economy was attributed by these people to the fact that they had left the ERM.  He restated this was not a view he shared or an analysis with which he agreed, but he said it was prevalent.  For that reason, he said it was politically impossible for the present British Government or, he proffered the view, for any British Government to take Britain into any form of ERM.</P>
      <P>He went further and said it was probable that Britain would be in the single currency before it would join the ERM. He concluded &mdash; I hope I am doing justice to the gentleman in question &mdash; by saying that notwithstanding this particular political problem, which he recognised was unique to the United Kingdom, the work should proceed.  He did not attempt &mdash; nor did the British delegation &mdash; to prevent the furthering of the studies to which my formal reply referred.  He recognised it was desirable, in the context of the function of the internal market, that there would be a stable relationship between currencies that decided, by choice or circumstances, not to become members at the outset of the Euro currency and currencies which qualify for membership.</P>

      <P>This is the reason I can speak <i>ex cathedra</i> on this subject.  Given this unusual position will the Minister for Finance agree it is vitally important that the rules be cast in stone given <Col N="1398" /> Ireland's trading position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United Kingdom and that we cannot allow a situation to develop or ensue post European Monetary Union, where the British can do what they like?</P>

      <P>The Government, through the Department of Finance, commissioned a fairly comprehensive study in this general area by the ESRI and we are on course to have it completed by the end of June.  As the House will be aware from replies to previous questions, it is my intention that the study will be published as it will help to inform debate on this important issue. The question of price stability is central to the efficient functioning of our economy and the assurance that that economy would perform in an effective and even manner and thereby avoid shocks. We can have price instability through currency fluctuations of an unforeseen kind and, therefore, any system that will minimise the possibility of unforeseen currency fluctuations is desirable.  For that reason the monetary committee and the EMI have been asked to conduct studies based on the report which they gave at the ECOFIN meeting in Verona.  It is anticipated that a more detailed report will be presented to the June meeting of ECOFIN prior to the June conference in Florence.  I anticipate that detailed work will proceed and it is probable, as indicated at the Verona meeting, that the Dublin Summit will be presented with the definitive proposals for the new exchange rate arrangement or ERM Mark II.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 19 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The tax burden on people in employment is of particular concern to the Government.  Consequently in my two budgets I have focused relief towards lowering the tax burden, particularly of those in low paid employment.  This has been achieved through significant improvements in the income tax and PRSI areas.  In the 1995 budget, personal allowances were increased by £150 for single persons and £300 for married couples, and the standard band was widened by £700 single and £1,400 married, respectively.  The general income exemption limits, below which no income tax is payable, were increased by £100 single and £200 married. Further significant gains accrued to those in employment, especially the low paid, from the introduction of the allowance of £50 per week for full rate PRSI contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures were underpinned in this year's budget by further increasing the personal allowances by £150 to £2,650 for a single person, and by £300 to £5,300 for a married couple.  The general exemption limits were increased by £200 to £3,900 for a single person, and by £400 to £7,800 for a married couple. The standard band was widened by £500 to £9,400 for a single person and by <Col N="1400" /> £1,000 to £18,800 for a married couple. In addition the PRSI-free allowance was increased to £80 per week.</P>
    <P>The increase in the PRSI-free allowance to £80 per week full rate contribu-disregarded when calculating their PRSI contribution.  The measure, on its own, is worth up to £228.80 per annum, or £4.40 per week, for such workers.  When combined with the non-renewal of the PRSI income tax allowance, it still results in significant gains, especially for those on low pay.  For example, low income workers exempted from income tax or taxed under the marginal relief system enjoy the full relief of £228.80 per annum, as they did not benefit from the PRSI income tax allowance in the first instance.  The net gains can be up to £152 per annum, or just under £3 per week, for those on the standard income tax rate, and up to £92 per annum for those on the top rate.</P>
    <P>As regards the point at which a single industrial worker will begin paying tax at the 48 per cent rate, in the current tax year the figure is £12,850.  A single worker on the average industrial wage, which is estimated at around £14,800 for 1996, and having only the basic personal allowances, will pay £3,474 in income tax, £585 in PRSI, and £333 in levies in the current tax year.  This gives total deductions of £4,392, representing 29.7 per cent of gross income.</P>
    <P>The improvements I introduced in my two budgets mean that a single full rate PRSI contributor will not be liable to pay tax at the higher rate, as I have indicated, until their gross income exceeds £12,850 this year, as compared to £11,636 in 1994-95, and a married couple, one earner, until their earnings are in excess of £24,900 this year, as compared to £22,186 in 1994-95.  This represents increases in the thresholds for the higher rate of 10.4 per cent and 12.2 per cent respectively, which are more than twice the expected rate of inflation. Furthermore, the total tax and PRSI take for a single worker on the average industrial wage has fallen by slightly <Col N="1401" /> over 1.5 percentage points of gross income as compared to two years ago.</P>
    <P>The improvements made over the last two budgets are significant.  The measures introduced have been aimed primarily towards reducing the average tax take rather than at cutting tax rates. Clearly, however, further progress is needed in reducing the tax and PRSI burden, thereby improving the competitiveness of the economy.  There are, of course, different views as to the form further reductions in taxation should take, and the groups towards whom relief should be targeted.  I hope, within responsible budgetary parameters, to consolidate and build on the type of measures introduced over the past two years in the 1997 budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As recently as this morning, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment admitted, in response to a question on radio, that the lower paid pay inordinately higher rates of tax.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's reply outlining the virtuous performance of the last two budgets, will he agree that the general body of taxpayers has been singularly unimpressed and that this is one of the reasons for the difficulties in getting any form of realistic negotiations for another national agreement?  Will the Minister agree that there is an opportunity to do something now regarding tax reductions at a time of high economic growth?  Given the restrictions which will be imposed as a result of European Monetary Union in a few years' time, such as the reduction in EU Structural Funds, an opportunity has been wasted in the past two years to do something positive about tax reform and tax reductions for the majority of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the statements by the Deputy.  The last time taxpayers were considerably impressed was in mid-summer 1977.  They have been paying the price since.  While there has been an improvement in workers' take <Col N="1402" /> home pay, it is not as great as I or anyone else would wish.  I do not believe a Minister for Finance will ever be able to say taxpayers are satisfied with the amount of tax they pay.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's assertion that there were difficulties in negotiating the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> he should not confuse the commentaries of one or two individuals with the prospect of a new agreement. In so far as it affects the public sector, the agreement has approximately 14 months to run, until the end of June 1997.  The private sector component of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> expires at the end of December 1996.  Preliminary work is ongoing on the parameters of a new agreement and it is inevitable that various comments will be made on the positions adopted in the run up to such discussions.  I am positively disposed to entering constructive negotiations for a new <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> should that be the wish of the social partners. However, while there are some difficulties, the Government must be satisfied that the agreement meets the requirements of all sectors of the community. We are not prepared to accept an agreement at any price.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> indicated that the future of residential property tax would be considered in the context of a professional study of local Government financing <Col N="1403" /> which is at present being undertaken by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.</P>
    <P>I will evaluate all aspects of residential property tax in light of the findings of the study when completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the section of my question dealing with local taxation and charges was ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that three-quarters of yield from the residential property tax is paid by a small number of people in the Dublin area and that it is grossly unfair, anti-family and arbitrary in its application?  Does he also agree that one of its most unfair consequences is that because of a fluctuation in house property values the residential property tax of a person with a house worth £110,000 could double this year because of factors outside his or her control?  Does he agree it is time to get rid of this tax rather than postpone consideration of its merits until local government finances are dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed in its programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to examine the question of local government taxation and, consequently, residential property tax, but it would be prejudicial to say anything in advance of the publication of the study being carried out by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could take this opportunity to say the residential property is grossly unfair and that it is paid by people in Dublin who live in similar circumstances and pay the same income tax as people who live elsewhere but do not pay the property tax.  He could also take this opportunity to say the characteristic of the tax, which could involve doubling one's liability in a given year due to circumstances outside one's control, make it a fundamentally unfair tax.  Irrespective of local government taxation, will the Minister agree that the residential property tax is <Col N="1404" /> anti-family in that it affects people whose sons and daughters live in the family home but on whose incomes the parents do not have a claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be surprised if parents did not have a claim on the incomes of children for whom they provide shelter and sustenance.  I could think of nothing more corrosive to family values than a relationship between parents and children such as that described by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Any taxation system would not improve the position if the people involved do not assume some liability for the upkeep and maintenance of the properties in which they live.</P>
      <P>Residential property tax has existed since 1983.  The Deputy's party was in Government for a considerable period during that time and, as far as I am aware, was remarkably silent on the issue.  It found no anti-family bias in its operation when Deputy O'Malley was busy in the Department of Industry and Commerce or when Deputy Molloy was busy in the Department of Energy.  This new found conversion to its opposition by Deputy McDowell, which is not necessarily shared with a similar vehemence by some of his parliamentary colleagues, strikes me as somewhat odd having regard to the extraordinary silence during the time his senior colleagues were in Cabinet and he was their commentator and cheer leader before being elected to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that we sought to involve all the parties in this House in a multi-party consultation to get rid of the residential property tax and that the Minister's party agreed to participate, but his senior partners in the rainbow coalition refused to do so?  Does he agree that was the reason progress was not made on this issue between 1989 and 1992?</P>

Given the alterations in the amounts of money to be provided for other aspects of Government policy and in view of the vehemence of the Progressive Democrats Party in proposing to remove this tax, it is extraordinary that its new found enthusiasm for its removal is in marked contrast to its acquiescence and silence while in Government.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to procure and publish a cost-benefit analysis of existing tax relief schemes.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All tax reliefs are kept under regular review.  In the months preceding the 1992 budget there was a detailed review of virtually every tax relief.  Since then the Tax Strategy Group has examined most reliefs in the context of the preparatory work for the 1994, 1995 and 1996 budgets.  For the 1996 budget and Finance Bill, indepth studies were carried out into the section 35 relief for investment in film, the BES and the patent royalties relief.  At present, a consultancy study is being carried out under the auspices of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment in respect of the urban renewal scheme.  In all these studies, the evaluation of the costs and benefits is the key aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the publication of these various studies, the consultancy study of the section 35 film relief has been published. Also the findings of other <Col N="1406" /> reviews are made public in response to parliamentary questions about tax reliefs and in the context of Finance Bills and budget proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree such studies should be published in booklet form?  Does he also agree it is perceived that only ordinary PAYE earners pay the full rate of tax and the use of legal tax avoidance tax measures, such as the BES and urban renewal schemes, gives the somewhat correct impression that higher income earners can legitimately reduce their income to avoid paying tax?</P>
      <P>Would he consider an amendment to a future Finance Bill to restrict the use of such tax avoidance measures and ensure that at least the ordinary level of PAYE tax is borne by everybody?  Not to do so gives the impression that the rich can legally avoid most of their taxes.  Some rich people foolishly proclaim they do not pay any income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle I am open to publishing these kinds of studies because it helps to inform public debate. I will examine the level of publication of the existing study and I will certainly bear it in mind for future studies.</P>
      <P>It would be misleading the House and the general public to refer to, for example, the urban relief scheme as a tax avoidance measure.  Most cities and towns have been transformed by the urban relief taxation measures.  At the same time people who have invested their income and received tax relief have, in some cases but not necessarily all, obtained some gain for themselves. However, the community at large has an overall benefit which it would not otherwise have experienced had we left it to market forces alone to rejuvenate and revitalise urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could argue that the picture is not as clear with regards to the BES but there are many companies which would not have been able to raise the necessary capital to ensure either expansion or, in some cases, survival had it not been for the BES.  That said, the <Col N="1407" /> impression some people are giving, to which the Deputy referred and on which he elaborated on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, is counterproductive and does not lead to fiscal solidarity among all taxpayers.  If that is the thrust of his comment, I agree with him wholeheartedly. In so far as the publication of any studies might reduce or eliminate that perception, it would be positive and I will certainly examine it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour the use of tax breaks to encourage investment and have no dispute with it or anything the Minister has said about the benefit of such schemes to the economy in general. My point is that the use of them in any one tax year should not allow a person with a high income to write off his total income tax liability.  Some restriction should be considered in the context of a Finance Bill to limit the use of such relief by the individual taxpayer so he would pay at least the standard level of PAYE.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, the widespread legal use of such schemes enabling some taxpayers to reduce their total liability to nil, does not augur well for social solidarity among all workers. I advocate that the Minister consider a limiting measure in future Finance Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to looking at that and will consider it in the context of next year's Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there a cost benefit analysis of the scheme for certain resorts and tourist areas?  If so, how was it done considering that the scheme was only brought into effect from 1 July 1995 and what was the result of any such analysis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A specific cost benefit analysis was not undertaken.  However, a certain use of the seaside resort scheme &mdash; taxation use of an aggressive kind which was perfectly legal &mdash; was brought to our attention.  The level of taxation relief which could be levered <Col N="1408" /> using the scheme as legally enacted was in excess of anything that existed currently. The precedent for the seaside resort scheme was, by and large, the original section 23 and related urban renewal type schemes.  The view was &mdash; and we will deal with it on Report Stage of the Finance Bill tomorrow &mdash; that the taxation code should be amended to bring it back to the level intended originally. A transitional relief was allowed for those projects which were in train and had properly and legally commenced. A cost benefit analysis in the normal sense was not undertaken because the scheme was not in operation for a sufficient period to enable such analysis to be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Tax shelters and other such schemes, many of which are very worthy, have grown enormously in the past number of years.  Would the Minister agree that in talking about serious tax reform, the removal of such special category reliefs will play a central part in achieving a much lower rate of taxation? We have created all of these tax shelters in response to the penal taxation system.  Is it not time that we got down to real reform?  It will admittedly affect many people who will not like to see many of the reliefs disappear but it is in the interest of an overall reform of the taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a coherent point of view behind the opinion expressed by the Deputy that would argue for the elimination of all tax breaks and the establishment of a flat rate, allowing people to spend their money if and where they wish.  The presumption is that expenditure of that money will result by and large in a positive outcome for everybody involved.  Our experience with regard to the urban renewal scheme would not lead us to have faith in market forces for urban renewal. Some form of balance must therefore be struck between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as we have high rates of marginal taxation, tax investment schemes such as BES and urban renewal will be <Col N="1409" /> attractive for some people.  However, there is probably an attitude or culture, certainly in some sectors, that if there is not a grant for an activity people will not engage in it, even if it is highly desirable from both personal and public economic points of view.  We may very well be moving from a grant culture into a tax allowance culture.  It is a question of trying to find a balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that Deputy Cullen's point goes further?  By allowing all these schemes and tax breaks to build up, we have taken the steam out of tax reform. Many people who would have to hand over their money in taxes find they can avail of these schemes, even to the extent mentioned by Deputy McCreevy and avoid any tax liability whatsoever. The attraction of these schemes is largely based on our high rate of taxation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy's point is that a person availing of them should not be relieved to a greater extent than an ordinary PAYE worker, by which I presume he means such schemes should be standard rated rather than allowed against all tax.  Would the Minister agree the reality is that these schemes are driven by an attempt to avoid high tax and the real problem is that many of the activities in which people invest are an indicator that the investors have more money than judgement and invest outside their own area of competence? Would he agree that what is really needed is a scheme to get people to invest in their own businesses?  We should have a situation whereby if I make £50,000 from my business, I will put it into my business and not give it to somebody to make a film about which I could not give a tinker's curse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all matters which must be reviewed.  I could give a long extensive reply but in deference to <Col N="1410" /> the other Deputies who tabled questions on the Order Paper I do not propose to give it.  The combination of tax allowances and incentives is well tailored to meet the needs of the economy at present.  Notwithstanding that, there clearly is a desire, as well as a commitment, to reduce the level of personal income tax.  What people do with their disposable income is a matter for themselves.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy McCreevy, as I understand it, for somebody to get the level of tax relief to which he is referring he would have to engage in substantial borrowing or live a very meagre lifestyle.</P>

      <P>The provision of funding to assist the victims of the recent flooding in the south and south-east was the subject of an application by me to the EU whom I visited in January of this year and from whom a response is awaited.  In the meantime, I have already stated that I will be allocating funding to the flood victims by way of humanitarian aid from the existing resources in the Office of Public Works.  I have also requested the Irish Red Cross Society to assess the extent of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross Society has already publicised its involvement in this humanitarian aid scheme and has sent out application forms to interested parties.  I understand it will very shortly be placing advertisements in the national and local newspapers regarding <Col N="1411" /> the scheme.  Pending its assessment of the situation and the decision by the EU on the question and the extent of its assistance, I am not in a position to be more definitive about the level of Exchequer assistance which will be made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is complex. I will try to outline it.  In January I met a Mr. Williamson, Secretary General in the Office of the President of the Commission. He said he was impressed with the arguments put forward by both Ireland and Portugal which also suffered flooding and that he would make a recommendation to the Commission and the Parliament on the subject.  He explained then, and the problem still exists, that there was no budget line in the 1996 budget for humanitarian aid of this kind, contrary to the situation in 1995 when there was a budget line from which my predecessor was able to obtain some funds for the west.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the budget committee of the Parliament, Mr. Samland, was not disposed towards introducing a budget line for this purpose, but I met him last week for a general discussion about the 1997 EU budget with which we will be very involved.  I spoke to him and to the rapporteur, Mr. Brinkhorst, at length about this, and they have promised to look at the matter again. They are coming here on 15 May for a general meeting about next year's budget and have undertaken to give me some feedback about whether they can introduce a budget line to deal with this by 15 May.  That is the current position.</P>
      <P>I am not aware exactly how many people have made inquiries to the Red Cross, but I understand it is in excess of 100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>

The Government, which added funds to those, used the same mechanism and will be following that precedent this year.</P>

    <P>To try to assemble all this information on a geographic basis would be an enormous task.  It should also be remembered that much assistance from the lottery surplus is given on a national basis &mdash; for example to a national organisation &mdash; so geographic breakdown is hardly relevant.  It can, however, be said, <Col N="1413" /> given the wide variety of lottery schemes operated by a number of Ministers, that all areas of the country benefit significantly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is a separate one and I hesitate to answer it in any definitive way because there are so many issues surrounding it.  The question of the allocation of lottery moneys is determined by the legislation under which the lottery was set up.  A proportion of moneys goes to different categories of activity.  The relevant Departments such as Health, Education and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the sports section of the Department of Education make their own decisions based on applications for lottery funds in the first instance and on their own view of the priorities that should inform those allocations.  The suggestion that we should further exacerbate divides between people of one religion and another, people from one region and another and people from urban as against rural areas is not the kind of subdivision this country needs &mdash; quite the contrary.  I can understand the Deputy's sentiment, but it is totally counterproductive and very unprogressive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's comments are interesting because his party colleague, Deputy Pat Upton, has gone to great lengths to expose the degree of disadvantage experienced particularly in the Dublin area and has gone so far as to call for a Minister for Dublin.  Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that.  The Minister mentioned the legislative basis for the disbursement of lottery funds.  Would he agree that there is a need to thoroughly overhaul the national lottery legislation to incorporate new procedures for advertising the grants and placing a ceiling on the proportion of funds which can be spent to plug gaps in State spending? Would he not agree that there is a greater need for democratic accountability and transparency, and that, rather than attempting to drive a wedge between rural Deputies and those who represent urban areas, I am doing the opposite in trying to redress the present imbalance in the spending of lottery funds in favour of rural Ireland?  The <Col N="1415" /> Minister's party colleague has been to the fore in denouncing the degree of spending away from Dublin in favour of other regions.</P>
      <P>I am merely seeking the equal treatment or fair share that Dublin and other urban areas deserve which is not the case at present.</P>

      <P>Deputy Eric Byrne referred to a study undertaken by my friend and colleague, Deputy Upton on the Department of the Environment's allocation of national lottery funding. The sample was not of the total national lottery allocation but rather that component distributed by the Department of the Environment to which I omitted to refer in my original and supplementary replies.  On the basis of his analysis, the Deputy concluded that Dublin received 68 per cent only of national average allocations from the national lottery to the Department of the Environment based on a per head of population criterion.  One would have to compare like with like and examine the uses to which those moneys were put in other parts of the country.  For example, some people could take the view that already many sections of the Dublin community are reasonably well endowed with certain aspects of environmental development.  On the basis of the study as I know it, the Deputy's conclusions are incomplete.  It was for that reason my Department undertook a much broader, more detailed analysis of the issues.  I hope to be in a position to return to this subject at a future date.</P>

      <P>No doubt the Minister is also aware of a very detailed study undertaken on the expenditure of surplus national lottery funds which manifested a lack of democratic accountability, specifically highlighting the inability of health boards to present relevant figures.  I am very disappointed that to date we have not been given a breakdown of the moneys retained for <Col N="1416" /> spending by State and semi-State companies and that proportion being allocated to the voluntary sector since the national lottery was established to assist the voluntary sector.  Would the Minister agree that political bureaucrats have their hands on the levers that control the spending of surplus national lottery funding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced in my budget speech that budget submissions should in future be made to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs. That committee will evaluate the contents of such submissions, will meet with representative groups and will submit a report to me with their recommendations.</P>
      <P>It must be appreciated that in excess of 250 pre-budget submissions are made each year.  It is not possible to comply with requests from all groups for meetings and, even where meetings have been arranged, the process has been unsatisfactory with groups simply stating the list of measures which their organisation want included in the budget.</P>
      <P>The revised procedure will allow for much more in-depth consideration of budget proposals by interested groups. Proposals can be developed in consultations between groups and the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, the Dáil Committee which specifically deals with taxation and budgetary matters.  The recommendations arising from this consultation process will constitute a valuable contribution to the formulation of the budget package.  I am confident that the interests of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployment will be well served through their contribution to this process.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's reluctance to have 257 pre-budget submissions visited on him, does he agree the solution is not to transfer them to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs?  Furthermore, does he agree that the decision he announced in his Budget Statement &mdash; not to meet any group in regard to such pre-budgetary submissions &mdash; was a bad one?  Does he agree that some ideas advanced by Ministers originated from lobby groups?  While some 90 per cent of what the Minister might hear by way of a pre-budget submission might be of little or no relevance, how can any Minister for Finance &mdash; the political head of his Department &mdash; expect to know what is occurring in the real world if he does not meet some lobby groups before budget day?  Like his predecessors, I am sure his experience has been that, notwithstanding the good advice he receives from his civil servants, from time to time he must take a dip into the real world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be very clear about this, I meet people regularly. Each Thursday morning I meet five people for over an hour from what Deputy McCreevy described as the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, from the world of business, professional organisations and anybody else operating within our economy, when I meet the senior management of my Department, a practice I initiated in the Department of Enterprise and Employment and carried on into the Department of Finance. Frequently such discussions refer to economic policy, taxation measures or to specific sectoral interests and, from time to time, include suggestions or ideas subsequently explored in detail at bilateral level between my Department and relevant individuals or organisations. In addition, as any former Minister will know, my diary is permanently full of visits to and meetings with such individuals or organisations.  The concept of any Minister for Finance being locked up in Upper Merrion Street, <Col N="1419" /> pouring over legislative books, is a myth.</P>
      <P>I wish to explain what was in my mind in regard to the suggestion I made which will, ultimately, be determined by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  The pre-budgetary practice has exploded in volume terms in recent years with in excess of 250 submissions being lodged.  While not all of them are accompanied by a request for a meeting with the Minister, approximately 50 groups would want to meet me, not in the month of June, July or August but some time between the end of November and beginning of January when I or any Minister for Finance will be in the process of formulating the annual budget.  In many such cases what individuals or groups want is a photo call, simply to present their shopping list, have their photographs taken without engaging in any dialogue whatsoever. Other deputations present to me in private &mdash; as they would have done to my predecessors &mdash; a shopping list of their demands from the taxpayer in the budget without indicating what it is they or their organisation propose to offer in return, how the general taxation system should be improved or how taxpayers in general would benefit from accommodating their sectoral interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the view that the evolution of our budgetary process inexorably will move in the direction of Parliament having a much greater say in the formulation of the annual Book of Estimates and budget in a manner similar to that which takes place in other continental democracies such as France, Spain and so on.  That is a good thing.  Anybody seeking a tax break from the budgetary system, through the Finance Bill or the budget, should be accountable to this House.  Holding a private meeting behind closed doors with any Minister for Finance &mdash; the parties involved, rather than the Department of Finance, issue the relevant press statement to the effect that they made a very strong case on behalf of this or that group to which <Col N="1420" /> the Minister is presumed to have acquiesced by his silence &mdash; is not in accordance with the spirit of democracy that should obtain in this State.  I made the suggestion in my Budget Statement for reasons of democratic accountability, transparency and efficiency because civil servants' involvement at that juncture is enormous.  Ultimately it is for the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs to decide whether it wants to engage in this process, whether, a group advocating a change in the tax law should be permitted to present its case and be questioned on it thus giving some idea of the overall economic benefit of any suggested change in the taxation system as distinct from a very articulate presentation on behalf of some lobby group.</P>
    <P>Finally, by way of a postscript, of course I will meet pre-budget submission groups from the social partners at any time, subject to diary constraints. The reality is that the bright ideas for budgets seem to come into existence between late November and early January when it is simply impossible for the current system to digest or integrate those ideas, some of which are very good and some of which I have used in budget proposals.  The scrappage idea for the car industry, for example, was one such an idea which came from a pre-budget submission.  It was an excellent idea, which I was happy to accept and give full credit to the SIMI organisation which promoted it.</P>
    <P>The system cannot allow the inexorable growth of pre-budget submissions and the demand for meetings in the time-frame of the period to which I refer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there is an air of unreality in his attitude to this matter?  He is asking 20 Members to be polite to people putting forward uncosted suggestions for inclusion in budgets.  If he wants the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs to examine these proposals, the least he might do is have his officials prepare a counter document on the <Col N="1421" /> costs involved in any particular proposal. I cannot say to the cider industry, the SIMI or the ICMSA what I think of their proposals if I must work out the cost implications and all the down sides.</P>
      <P>With respect, what the Minister seems to forget is that these 20 Members or so of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs will be victims of a deluge of people making uncosted assertions when we will not even have his advantage of having somebody beside him at a desk to say that the proposal would cost £30 million, for example, and is not possible.  We will be in the firing line asking foolish questions and making foolish approving remarks with regard to schemes about which we know little in terms of their practice.</P>

      <P>In deference to the Chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs with whom I have had discussions, the points which Deputy McDowell raised have, in fact, been raised in principle and in some detail.  Certain suggestions and proposals have been made to the chairman of that committee to address the issue which Deputy McDowell has, understandably and rightly, identified.  It would be an impossible task for the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs to undertake the task in the manner which has just been described, and that was not my intention.  In deference to the discussions which we have already had, I suggest that the parties represented on that committee meet its Chairman to discuss how they wish to proceed.  I am happy to resort to the original practice of the last two years &mdash; although I regard it as very unsatisfactory from everybody's point of view &mdash; if that is what the committee decides. Clearly, resources and assistance, including assessments of costs, are needed and that would not be denied in principle but its detail is properly a matter for the chairman and the committee in consultation with my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Finance is not aware that the Select <Col N="1422" /> Committee on Finance and General Affairs decided off its own bat last autumn to invite groups to attend pre-budget discussions on various Wednesdays.  It heard submissions from the various groups as to what they wanted in the 1996 budget.  Furthermore, because of the good ordering of affairs by the chairman, he decided which groups he wanted to invite before the committee and which to leave out. It is our intention to invite other groups next year so that there will not be any overlap.</P>
      <P>Surely it is possible for the Department of Finance with its vast resources to order its affairs to enable them to have the same type of operation.  I am well aware of the problems leading up to the budget and that every lobby group in the country wants to visit the Minister at some stage.  I do not expect the Minister to have 257 separate organisations visited upon him in the months of December and January but it should be up to him to pick relevant groups on alternate years.  If he confines himself to the social partners,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, first and foremost that is what we do.  It was the practice initiated last year which suggested to me that this was a way in which the two processes could be merged into one.  The unique difference between such a group making a submission to the Select Committee of Finance and General Affairs and a deputation to the Department of Finance is that the committee meeting is on the record, people can ask questions and the lobby group must be <Col N="1423" /> accountable because what its representatives say is in the public domain.  It is, therefore, open to ordinary citizens to see what is being said as distinct from what is contained in the submission.</P>
      <P>There is clearly an increasing demand for access to the decision-making process. My concern is that it should be accountable, transparent and well informed before decisions are made.  I believe the process which I suggested and offered to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs is the way forward but it is in the hands of the committee and its Chairman to decide if it wishes to engage in that activity.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Until 6 April 1995, where an individual made an enforceable maintenance payment to an estranged spouse, PRSI contributions, health contribution and employment and training levy were chargeable on the paying spouse's income at the time it is earned and again on the maintenance payments on their receipt by the receiving spouse. In 1994, a review of the treatment of maintenance payments for the purposes of levies and PRSI was undertaken by officials of my Department, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>Following that review it was agreed that the health contribution and the employment training levy should not be imposed on that part of the payer's income which is paid to his or her separated spouse under an enforceable maintenance agreement.  The appropriate changes in the law were included in Social Welfare Act, 1995, and had effect from 6 April 1995.  This brings the treatment of maintenance payments for the purposes of the levies into line with their treatment in the income tax system.</P>
      <P>The review also concluded that there should be no change in the PRSI treatment of maintenance payments.  The payment of separate PRSI contributions enables each spouse to build up a social insurance record in their own right, and they can both, in due course, qualify for a pension.  Entitlement to a social insurance pension is a valuable right and affords protection to separated spouses. It is, therefore, important for the protection of their individual pension rights that social insurance contributions be made by the recipients of maintenance payments.</P>

Will he agree it is utterly wrong to penalise a family whose parents have separated by taking a 5 per cent cut out of the wife's money simply because she is living apart from her husband &mdash; that is 5 per cent out of the mouths of the children?

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the two questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I already informed the House on 14 March 1996, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, and I had a meeting on that date with Packard management.  At the meeting, the management indicated that, as business prospects for 1996 remained poor, a redundancy programme would have to be implemented and in accordance with the June 1995 <Col N="1428" /> agreement between the company and the unions, details of the programme, including its impact on the workers laid off, would be communicated to the employees by 15 April 1996.</P>
    <P>For the information of Deputies, the company's agreement with the unions, covering the situation that arose last year when, on 23 June 1995, 400 employees were laid off, provided that:</P>
    <P>The Company will advise the Unions by 15 March, 1996:</P>
    <P>(a)  of business prospects for 1996.  If prospects are such that a majority of those laid off will be reengaged over the first half of 1996, no redundancies will take effect until June 1st, in accordance with previous practice.</P>
    <P>(b)  if business prospects at 15th March indicate that a majority will continue on layoff over the first half of 1996, then a phased redundancy programme, again in accordance with previous practice, will be on offer from 15th April for those on layoff for whom a return to work date has not been determined.</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of either (a) or (b) above, the period of layoff will be included in reckonable service for redundancy calculation and minimum notice calculation purposes.</P>
    <P>No further details of the likely programme were available at that stage.  The company reiterated its commitment to increasing the competitive position of the Tallght plant with a view to winning new business.  Indeed, that same day, 14 March the managing director, Mr. Ferreira wrote to all employees &ldquo;to reiterate that we are all committed to increasing the competitiveness of the Tallaght plant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 2 April, I wrote to union officials stating <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>We ...stressed the necessity for the June 1995 agreement to be scrupulously implemented.  We further expressed puzzlement that nine <Col N="1429" /> months later there was no clear statement about the future direction of the Tallaght plant.</P>
    <P>However, the company advised us on 4 April that, due to difficulties in obtaining final details of its future business, it would not be in a position to inform the workforce of the proposed redundancy programme by 15 April 1996 as agreed.  Having regard to the position outlined by the company at the meeting with us on 14 March, the Minister, Deputy Bruton and I were extremely concerned at the failure of the company to honour its commitment on this issue.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, apart from voicing serious disquiet at developments, we requested Packard management to meet the union representatives immediately in order to ensure there was no further breakdown in communication.</P>
    <P>It was again impressed on the company that information and consultation are cornerstones of our industrial relations system and that the Labour Relations Commission was available to assist in promoting a resolution and to enhance productivity and performance in the Tallaght plant.</P>
    <P>In response to our request the company met the unions on 12 April and indicated they expected to be in a position by the end of May 1996 to make an announcement about the redundancy programme and plans for the future of the plant.  The unions were dissatisfied with that meeting and again sought a meeting with me which took place on 16 April.  They said they could not get meaningful answers from the European or local management, that morale was low and sought my intervention with senior executives of the company.  We discussed at some length the tactics of such an intervention and ultimately we agreed to the union request and accordingly wrote to the company setting out the dissatisfaction and urging the earliest meeting with the unions to provide the fullest possible information.</P>
    <P>We did not receive a reply from the <Col N="1430" /> European or local management but contact was made with us from Delphi-Packard headquarters in the US.  We responded immediately and on the same date, 19 April, Mr. Battenberg, President of Delphi and Vice-President of GM returned my call.  He told me he was aware of our representations, that he had stark news for us but that he wanted to come to Ireland to meet me directly and asked if I could arrange for him to see the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I wrote to him the following Monday and set out the dissatisfaction with the way the plant was functioning and reiterated our arguments for the future of the plant at Tallaght even after a redundancy programme.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that in the history of industrial relations in Ireland Packard is unique.  Since late 1994 there has been a continuous and constant involvement in the affairs of this private company by Ministers and civil servants. This was done not because we wished to be involved or that it was always necessarily considered a good idea that Government become involved; it was done due to an evident gap between the real managers of Tallaght based in Europe and Coventry and the employees at Tallaght.  Indeed not only were the workers at Tallaght not informed of company plans but local management seemed to be in the dark.</P>
    <P>We, most uniquely, felt an obligation to help both sides to bridge that confidence gap.  We tried to do so, because since we first became involved in December 1994 there had been many written and oral statements from the management of Delphi-Packard stating its commitment to Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Yesterday afternoon, Monday 29 April, I met the US President of Delphi-Packard who is also US Vice-President of General Motors with responsibility for autmotive components.  Subsequently, the Taoiseach met him, representatives from the IDA and myself.</P>
    <P>At the meeting I reiterated the Government's serious disquiet at the continuing uncertainty facing the Tallaght plant and workforce and again <Col N="1431" /> stressed the need to clear the air on the future of the plant.  Resolution of this issue without further delay was essential in the interests of the workforce and the image of Ireland as a centre for foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>The US and European management advised me that, after considerable market and other analysis it had reluctantly concluded that the Tallaght plant did not have a viable future.  This situation had to be seen in the context of the continuing substantial overcapacity in the automotive component sector, especially cable harness, in both Europe and world-wide, and a much more favourable cost environment in competing locations, particularly in Eastern Europe.  This had very adversely affected market prices for this labour intensive product and recent further price reductions had compounded an already difficult situation.  As a consequence the Tallaght plant was incurring substantial losses and projections for 1996 and 1997 showed considerable acceleration in those losses.  In the parent company's view there were no further remedial measures, even on the basis of a reduced plant workforce, which could be taken to put the plant on a viable basis.  Accordingly, it had decided reluctantly to phase out operations at the Tallaght plant by the end of next July.</P>
    <P>The Government had no prior indication of the scale of the current and projected financial losses at the Tallaght plant.  We are naturally shell-shocked at the proposed closure, its catastrophic effect on the Tallaght area and the manner in which the workforce learned of its future.  Management advised us that it was its intention to inform the workforce of the position on Thursday next, 2 May at 10 a.m.  The Government and its agencies have done everything possible to assist the company, including the provision of assistance to the technical advisory group which was established to facilitate measures to improve competitiveness. However, in the final analysis the company was responsible for its <Col N="1432" /> operations, including any implementing action arising out of the group's report.</P>
    <P>We are now facing a very serious jobs situation at Tallaght and in order to address this the Government today approved a proposal that I establish a local task force.  Its membership will be announced later, but I can confirm that it will be chaired by local industrialist Mr. Dan Tierney, chief executive of the Cross Group, and will include county manager Mr. John Fitzgerald and representatives of the IDA, Forbairt, FAS, the Tallaght-South Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the chairman of Packard Shop Stewards' Committee as well as a person nominated by Tallaght regional technical college.</P>
    <P>In discussion with the Vice-President of General Motors yesterday I have been assured that every assistance possible will be given to ensure an orderly wind-down of the Tallaght plant and that full co-operation will be forthcoming to assist IDA Ireland in finding a replacement industry.  In this context, also, IDA Ireland will be discussing with senior General Motors management the potential for alternative investment projects in Ireland.  The best way forward is for the company to work closely with IDA Ireland in making the plant available to promote new investment.  I am concerned that this represents the single most important infrastructural resource in the area, comprising over 15 acres and 120,000 square feet of a modern factory complex.  There have been several examples of such marketing approach, the most recent being Digital in Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us are of the opinion that the manner in which the workers in Packard learned of their fate was brutal and savage.  To be in your kitchen and, on turning on your television, to learn from the 9 o'clock news that you were shortly to lose your job must have been shocking for those concerned. The closure of this plant will affect not only the 800 who will lose their jobs but their partners or spouses and other members of their families, notching up to perhaps 3,000 people <Col N="1433" /> who stand to be severely affected. Before putting what I hope will be constructive proposals, I wish to record my abhorrence of the manner in which the news of the closure of the plant was related to the workers.  It should never have been broken in that way.  Irrespective of whether it was part of an all over, drip-drip plan, it was disgusting, abhorrent and has no place in Irish life in terms of dealing with employees.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the possibility of setting up a task force, a proposal I put forward also on radio this morning but I suggest that this should be in a somewhat different vein from the task force set up in the case of Digital. On behalf of my party I wish to put forward the constructive proposition that the Tallaght Regional Technical College, a project which I was glad to give the go-ahead and which is up an running and a significant facility in the region, immediately puts in place a properly focused retraining programme to bring to another level of competence the semi-skilled workers involved who have an electronics base.  Such competence could then be used in trawling a replacement industry.</P>
      <P>There were three wise men to whom the Minister of State referred as the technical advisory group.  I have never seen its report and I am not aware of its recommendations for Tallaght, but if that group has ideas, it should put them forward now.</P>
      <P>The workers employed in Tallaght were making one product for one buyer. They have vast skills many honed over 21 years.  If their product were upgraded and remarketable on a wider international scale, it could find a ready sale.</P>
      <P>Regarding this mishandled sorry saga, only two weeks ago the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, told me to stop interfering in the Tallaght operation, that I had no right to put forward propositions for it as is on record, I responded that I had every right to do so and I will continue to do so because I take seriously my job as party spokesperson on enterprise and employment.</P>

      <P>I assure Deputy Harney that is not the case.  I agree totally that the manner in which the workers at the Tallaght plant heard of their future should not be tolerated.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, it was brutal and savage. Given the previous 18 months' experience of industrial relations at the plant, it is inconscionable that the workers should have heard the news in that fashion.</P>
      <P>Regarding the task force and its composition, I assure the House that there will be a nominee, Ms Eileen Foulds, from the regional technical college to the task force.  It is acknowledged that the upgrading of skills and retraining are an essential part of preparing this workforce for the prospect of alternative employment in their area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the truth and, as the Minister knows well, sometimes it can hurt.  Did the IDA give grant aid to this company over the past 18 months and, if so, how much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the serious part of the question, the IDA gave no aid to the company over the past 12-18 months but it paid for the study put in place arising from the meeting in Coventry in January 1995.  The three consultants appointed to perform that study in terms of the re-engineering of the plant, the reorganisation of the work methods, the installation of world-class manufacturing, the introduction of the cell system, etc. were paid for by the IDA.  That is the only grant paid by the IDA over the past 18 months.  However, the IDA held out clearly at the Coventry meeting and subsequent meetings that it would be willing to entertain a proposal from this company for any alterations or changes it wished to make in terms of getting the plant up to a certain competitive level of performance.</P>
      <P>I do not know if there is much merit in dealing with Deputy Kitt's question about my being conned by, or having been a dupe of, General Motors.  This seems unlikely and I do not know what the Deputy is getting at.  No recent example in the history of industrial relations has attracted so much involvement by the agencies of the State, senior civil servants and two Ministers as this plant.  Within three days of the Government coming to office we were confronted with this problem.  On 22 December 1994 the Minister, Deputy Bruton, issued the following statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> I have been in touch with the company and I understand that the contract which accounted for up to 80 per cent of the company's production had been lost.  If this position is not reversed then there will be catastrophic consequences for Tallaght in terms of jobs.  I am keeping in touch with the situation but I must admit that the outlook is bleak.</P>
    <P>Looking back on that statement &mdash; and Deputy Kitt, in splendid isolation, can look back on it with the benefit of hindsight &mdash; it may well be the case that this company intended to withdraw from Ireland in December 1994.  Our direct intervention at that time was successful in rescuing the plant over the past 18 months but I agree that since then the commitment by the plant in terms of written and verbal undertakings given have not been seen to be implemented at shop floor level by the workers concerned. It is a nonsense and waste of time to talk about any Minister having been a dupe of the company.  What was a Minister expected to do?  This is the largest company in the United States and it gave us written undertakings.  If one cannot accept written undertakings from a company of that calibre then it is very difficult to do business.  We proceeded on the basis of those written undertakings and yesterday's decision unfortunately seemed to be the inevitable outcome of the economics of the situation as the company sees it.</P>

      <P>This is an area of very high unemployment which Deputy Harney and I have the honour of representing. Last year a substantial number of new enterprises opened in the Tallaght region.  For example, UPS, which employs 200 people, is expected to increase this figure to 900 in the near future, Xilinx, which employes 120 people, is expected to exceed the promised figure of 180, while Saturn, which <Col N="1438" /> employs 95 people, is expected to increase this figure to 165.  Last week I announced the opening of the GEA plant at City West which will employ 170 people.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Harney will agree, there is much good news in the Tallaght region.</P>
      <P>On the specific question of Baldonnel, this is much more complex than the context in which it has been put here.  It is perhaps inevitable that there will be some element of civilianisation of Baldonnel in the near future.  It is inevitably the case that an airport has a clustering effect and as a result employment is generated in the area.  However, there are wider consideration and these were gone into in great detail by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in his assessment of the situation, the implications for Dublin Airport, etc.  No project which is likely to contribute to economic activity and employ people in the area will be ruled out and I will be happy to look at it.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise an extremely important matter, the reports of the public sector review body set up by Government to review the pay of Members of this House, the Judiciary and other senior people, such as the executives of semi-State companies.

      <P>Competition can only succeed where the playing field is level.  We have already seen major reductions in handset costs and I want to see call prices drop too.</P>
      <P>The question of confidentiality needs to be fully understood because it is relevant to various aspects of the matter. The way the competition was structured gave interested parties who had paid a deposit of £5,000 an opportunity in the first four weeks to ask questions in writing about the process.  It was agreed at the outset that these questions would be addressed in a memorandum to all competitors a couple of weeks later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nine parties posed written questions. Of these, four who eventually became <Col N="1598" /> applicants raised the subject of confidentiality of information supplied in applications.  It was clear that confidentiality was an important issue for interested parties.  Indeed, it is somewhat ironic that Persona, which has been the most vociferous in relation to disclosure, was one of the consortia which originally sought a commitment to confidentiality.  Failure to respond adequately to these questions on confidentiality carried the serious risk of frightening away consortia anxious to secure the licence.</P>
    <P>The responding memorandum from my Department which was sent to all interested parties on 28 April 1995 stated:</P>
    <P>All applications for the GSM licence, including data provided in electronic form and any data sought during the course of the evaluation of submissions will remain permanently confidential to the Department and its consultants, Andersen Management International.</P>
    <P>This was not a clever device invented by me or my Department before or after the event as a block on transparency. It came, as I said, by way of widespread concern by potential applicants before submitting applications and a considered response from those managing the competition.  It is understandable why confidentiality was necessary.  Any competent application was certain to contain enormous detail on business strategy, marketing philosophy, pricing proposals, company ownership, financial standing, etc. Deputies can get some idea of the sheer volume of information when I tell the House that the applications ran to 350 pages plus appendices and supporting documentation.</P>
    <P>I also want to make it clear that I have a duty to protect the confidentiality of the strategy of ESAT Digifone. To make such information available to Eircell would undermine the impact of the entry of the second operator to the market and run directly counter to the <Col N="1599" /> spirit of my intention to create a competitive market based on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>There is a second angle to this which I want to mention briefly.  Comparative bidding procedures for mobile licences did not start and finish in Ireland.  Such procedures are now common worldwide. Many of the members of the consortia which applied in Ireland will be competing against each other elsewhere. If a Minister in any country was considering the outcome of a similar competition and he or she was aware that the apparently successful applicant had come last out of six in a recent competition in another country and that this was public knowledge, what would he or she think?  That angle alone would have to give disappointed applicants cause for reflection.  I am not saying this in any menacing way; I am just stating the obvious.</P>
    <P>Putting together a detailed application for a mobile licence is an expensive business.  The total cost of the six applications which we received was probably in the region of £10 to £15 million.  That is a large sum of money leading to a lot of disappointment but it was always known that there could be only one winner.  The disappointment is understandable but the way it is manifesting itself in terms of innuendo is a problem.  This is something that the interested parties, and I do not exclude certain sections of the media, need to reflect on.  How long will they keep this campaign going?  What do they expect to gain?  I again emphasise that I fully uphold the conduct and integrity of the public officials and consultants who conducted this exercise.</P>
    <P>I now propose to recite at some length the history of the GSM competition. The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has been working seriously on a GSM competition since late 1993.  The preparatory phase included an &ldquo;open door&rdquo; consultation process with interested parties. This, to a large extent was a learning <Col N="1600" /> phase for the Department where various options in relation to the process as a whole were canvassed with consultants and interested parties.  London-based consultants had a limited low-cost input in the design phase of the competition 1994.  My predecessor as Minister will know all about this initial preparatory phase of the competition.</P>
    <P>It fell to me as a newly appointed Minister to move the process forward. The style of the competition and the rules which applied were approved by the Government and made known following the announcement of the competition to all interested parties.  All parties accepted the rules.  This is important because it shows that it was the Government who set out the rules for the competition; the parameters are a political matter.  Once that decision was taken and announced by me on 2 March 1995 the conduct of the operation of the competition within these parameters was carried out by the Civil Service, in other words, officials of my Department and the Department of Finance, with the aid of consultants.</P>
    <P>My announcement of 2 March 1995 is interesting.  I am sure copies of my statement are readily accessible for those who care to read them, but to assist those who are not apparently interested in following up the facts I will cite a few short quotations from it as follows:</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this is not an auction where the biggest cheque will win the licence regardless.</P>
    <P>My aim is to see real competition and a good deal for consumers.</P>
    <P>The fee proposed must leave room...for a credible business plan to develop the market and provide effective competition for Eircell, choice of service and a good deal for consumers.</P>
    <P>In view of the controversy which followed, I want to remind the House of this starting position with which I have been consistent ever since.  At an early stage I became acutely aware that rumours were circulating within the <Col N="1601" /> industry that the outcome of the competition was a foregone conclusion.  I have no idea whether this was true, but I and my officials moved to assure all interested parties that it would be a clean and open competition.</P>
    <P>We set out at the beginning clear selection criteria which were fully known to all parties.  Applications had to pass the first hurdle of demonstrated financial and technical capability.  The criteria, which were clearly stated to be in descending order of priority, were as follows: credibility of business plan and approach to market development; quality and viability of technical approach; approach to tariffing which had to be competitive; and the licence fee.  There followed a series of lower priority criteria, notably, timetable for achieving roll-out of the system, international roaming plans, performance guarantees and spectrum efficiency.</P>
    <P>I have now made the full list of eight selection criteria publicly available, together with the weighting formula used.  This clearly reflects the fact that market development, technical quality, call charges and monthly rentals were the principal deciding factors.</P>
    <P>I will deal fully with the licence fee in due course, but I want to make it absolutely clear at this point that the fee never ranked higher than fourth in the order of priority in the selection criteria. The weightings fully reflected the descending priority order and are consistent with everything which went before.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Deputies also that all the rhetoric is based on a few countries who charged high fees.  The fact that the majority of European countries charged no fees or minor fees is constantly ignored.  As far as we can establish, countries that charged no fees or insignificant administrative fees include Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It was clear from the outset that the process of evaluation of the applications would be complex, would require specialist expertise and would have to <Col N="1602" /> be carried out to a high degree of objectivity. An international competition was held to recruit appropriate consultancy advice.  The contract was awarded to a Danish firm, Andersen Management International.  Andersens had substantial relevant expertise in similar processes in Europe and demonstrated in its tender a highly developed approach to evaluation.</P>
    <P>When I announced the competition for this second GSM licence, I was determined to put in place a selection process that would be fair, impartial and objective.  An evaluation team, led by my Department, was set up which included the consultants and officials from my Department and the Department of Finance.  This team was given responsibility for the conduct of the entire process and to make a recommendation regarding the award of the licence.  The group incorporated special technical and financial and management expertise from the Civil Service as well as the expertise of the consultants.</P>
    <P>It was also recognised that interested parties would require clarification of some aspects of the original tender documentation and to raise questions. Parties were allowed to pose questions both to the Department and Telecom Éireann which would be responded to in a composite memorandum issued to all interested parties.  This was the same memorandum in which the confidentiality aspect was dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Department and Telecom Éireann issued the memorandum on 28 April.  The Department followed up with a further memorandum on 12 May with further points of clarification, guidance on assumptions for the preparation of applications and an initial draft of the licence.  This information process was designed to ensure to the maximum extent possible the success of the competition would not be undermined by any needless deficiency of information; and to ensure absolute uniformity in the information available to all of the interested parties.</P>
    <P>On this latter point, I would like to emphasise that following the launch of <Col N="1603" /> the competition the chairman of the project team set out ground rules for contacts with interested parties which would ensure that no consortium could gain any advantage in terms of information.</P>
    <P>The competition documentation was made available to the European Commission as soon as it was announced. The original tender document envisaged that applicants would declare the amount that they were prepared to pay for the licence but that Eircell would not pay any fee.  The closing date for receipt of applications was originally set as 23 June 1995.  However, on 3 May I received a letter from Commissioner Van Miert dated 27 April wherein the Commissioner raised questions and in particular objected to the auction element of the licence fee.</P>
    <P>The Commission's difficulty with the fee requirement was based on a legal argument stemming from the competition rules of the Treaty.  The Commission considered that a high fee paid by the second GSM operator and not by Eircell would contravene the competition rules of the Treaty unless there were other compensatory measures.  It was decided quickly that it was far too risky in terms of legal and financial exposure to complete the competition with the possibility of Commission action after the event.  Imagine what would have happened and what Deputies would say if we had announced a winner, issued the licence and then had to change the ground rules, scrap the competition or pay out heavy compensation.  Representatives of the project team and consultants had detailed discussions with the Commission on 2 June 1995 and explored ways of relaunching the competition on an agreed basis.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to speculate that we could have opted for a high fee approach and levied the same fee or something close to it on Eircell.  This solution is being followed in some cases, although the Belgians have still not settled the fee for Belgacom and the <Col N="1604" /> company is threatening litigation against the Government and the EU. We opted for a moderate approach to the fee.  It was, of course, consistent with my starting position.  I was simply not prepared to impose a high tax on mobile phone users and I make no apology for protecting the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Following the discussion with the Commission, I wrote a five-page letter to Commissioner Van Miert dated 22 June.  This letter effectively answered the concerns of the Commission in terms which reflected the discussions on 2 June.  My letter stated:</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the matter carefully I believe imposing a once off fee on Eircell in the sum of £10 million tied to a cap on the amount any prospective licensee can offer of say, £15 million guarantees, in concrete terms, that my desire not to penalise Eircell and at the same time charge a fair &ldquo;once-off entry fee&rdquo; to the new provider will be seen to be fair and proportionate to all parties' interests.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Van Miert responded on 14 July.  I wish to quote the relevant paragraphs relating to the fee and other points of clarification which I had provided:</P>
    <P>In view of these circumstances and assuming these measures are effectively implemented, the Commission deems that the granting procedure followed by the Irish Government does not favour the extension of the current dominant position of its public telecommunications organisation, Bord Telecom Éireann, to the new GSM market, which would constitute an infringement to the Treaty competition rules.</P>
    <P>For this reason, the Commission considers that it has no grounds for action under Article 90 (1) in conjunction with Article 86 in respect of the auction fee imposed on the second operator.</P>
    <P>I am told the jargon for this is negative clearance.  It could not, however, be <Col N="1605" /> any clearer that the Commission agreed to the revised free structure which I proposed. The Commissioner's letter also contained a series of other conditions which have now been complied with.</P>
    <P>When it was clear that the discussions with the Commission could not be finalised and taken on board by applicants ahead of the original closing date, my Department wrote on 16 June to interested parties postponing the closing date.</P>
    <P>There were no surprises in the Commission's letter of 14 July and we were able to relaunch the competition by letter on that date and set out the revised rules to all participants with a new closing date of 4 August.  I want to state also that between 14 July and the closing date no interested party raised the slightest objection against the new fee basis and the cap on the licence fee.</P>
    <P>Six applications were received by the closing date and details of the applicants and the consortia members have already been well publicised.  The fact that six applications were received was in my view an endorsement of the success of the first phase of the process and of market confidence in the approach which had been taken.  All six applications were from consortia which demonstrated the necessary financial and technical capability.  In the event each applicant proposed the maximum fee of £15 million and, therefore, it did not impact on the comparative analysis.</P>
    <P>As I said, each application contained an immense amount of detailed information in regard to financial, technical and business development matters.  All this material was examined exhaustively by the evaluation team, which worked intensively over a period of more than two months after the closing date.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell for a moment on the requirement that applicants provide full ownership details.  The ownership structure of all of the applicant consortia was examined by the project team.  Four others along with East Digifone, envisaged that the project would be financed, apart from debt financing, through equity participation going <Col N="1606" /> beyond the original consortia members. This wider equity participation involved unidentified stakeholders arising either through private placement or through a stock market flotation.  The consultants and the project team saw nothing exceptional in this for a project of this size. Andersens had clearly been down this road before.  It is impossible to accept that something envisaged by five of the six applications in some way damaged their applications.</P>
    <P>These equity arrangements were not considered, and rightly so, to be a negative factor in relation to any application. Indeed, if the evaluation process had marked down any application on these grounds it would be impossible to defend, and I have already made it clear that this process can be fully defended.</P>
    <P>In the case of Esat Digifone, the intention of the consortium partners to arrange a private placement with blue chip institutional investors was disclosed. Letters of commitment from the investors for specified amounts were submitted.  In addition, strong expressions of interest in loan and equity participation in the consortium were available from other leading international institutions.  Because of the confidentiality constraint I cannot name any of the institutions concerned.  The situation would be no different if any other consortium had won.  The project team established that all of the consortia were capable of funding the project.</P>
    <P>The evaluation process is fully documented in the consultants' report.  This report was approved by the project team which came unanimously to a single result based on the analysis.  The following is clear from the report: the evaluators, including the consultants and the relevant officials, settled their approach to the evaluation, including the weighting to be applied to the criteria, in considerable detail well in advance of the closing date; the applications were examined meticulously by appropriate groups of people from the consultants and the home based project team &mdash; for example, technical aspects were examined by technical people and financial <Col N="1607" /> aspects by accountants, etc.; the tariff aspects were examined in a number of ways and with great care to take into account important aspects such as billing principles, discounts, etc.; the selection criteria were broken down into a series of detailed indicators against which the applications could be compared; all relevant aspects of the applications were graded by different groups and the results were then tabulated in various ways with a view to identifying a winner; the applications were carefully checked for internal consistency; the consultants, and subsequently the full project team, came to a single result which was the one I announced and which fully respected the priority order of the selection criteria and the weighting formula agreed in advance; it is clear that the applicants were treated in an even-handed manner throughout the competition, they all got exactly the same information and equal opportunity to communicate with the evaluators.</P>
    <P>I can categorically state that the consultants' report is meticulous and was carried out in total good faith by the people concerned.  In the course of the evaluation, and in accordance with the evaluation plan, each applicant was given a series of written questions for clarification of their bids on 24 August for reply by 4 September.  Consortia were also each given three hour meetings with the entire project team which were conducted to a pre-set pattern and held consecutively between 11 and 14 September.  Each meeting took the form of one hour presentations, one hour to respond to standard questions posed to all applicants and the final hour for a general discussion to the particular application.</P>
    <P>The question has arisen as to whether the Esat Digifone tariffs were the lowest among the applicants.  The tariffs analysis in the consultants' report is very thorough in this area.  All of the applications had different approaches to segmentation of the market and a variety <Col N="1608" /> of pricing packages and different metering and billing principles.  Their evaluation is quite complex.  Confidentiality is a specific constraint in this area.  I can say at this stage, however, that the application with the lowest tariffs was demonstrably weak in respect of other major selection criteria.</P>
    <P>The evaluation did not take into account features which were extraneous to the competition.  If it did, there would certainly be serious questions about its objectivity and its compliance with the rules.  Jobs were not and could not be an issue.  Regional location or endowments to universities for instance, could not be taken into account.  I have to keep repeating that the evaluation was carried out in accordance with the rules known in advance and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I did not interfere with the evaluation in any way.  Neither did any other member of the Government.  I wish to make it clear that the project team or the consultants were not influenced by any non-telecommunications factors.  The consultants are specialists in advising in competitions of this kind, with a high reputation to protect.</P>
    <P>Following the finalisation of the consultants' report, I discussed the outcome with the leaders of the Government parties and the Minister for Finance.  The selection of Esat Digifone for the award of the licence was agreed on 25 October and I announced the result that evening.</P>
    <P>In a case as sensitive as this there is great advantage in announcing the result as soon as possible to put an end to speculation which grows around such matters, as was the case on this occasion.  There was no undue haste. The plan drawn up by the consultants in July shows clearly that the final report was to be submitted in the week beginning 22 October.  The consultants are to be congratulated for achieving this target. My commitment was to announce the result not later than the end of November. If I had not allowed some interval in case of slippage, I would have been open to criticism for not meeting my deadline.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> No political or other extraneous considerations entered into the selection, which was made totally on the basis of the objective criteria laid down in advance and made known to all.  Esat Digifone won the licence because the project team determined, after meticulous comparative evaluation, that it had submitted the best application.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the question of disclosure of information to unsuccessful applicants.  There are some general points I want to make absolutely clear. Under the terms of the GSM competition and the relevant legislation, I am legally advised that I am constrained by the confidentiality agreement inserted at the request of the applicants from giving certain information to applicants. At no point in the competition process or in the associated documentation did I give any commitment to detailed disclosure of the basis on which the successful applicant won.  Furthermore, it is not generally the practice in other countries to publish evaluation reports or to provide disclosure of this kind.  Arising from accusations made in this House, I raised this specific question with Andersen Management International some months ago.  It responded as follows:</P>
    <P>We have followed the GSM evaluation process in Denmark, Holland, Germany, Norway, Spain, Italy, Sweden and France.  We only know of one country, France, which has published parts of the evaluation documents. In the case of France two aspects should be mentioned.  First, the ministerial evaluation report was modified for the public audience before it was released; second, prior consent was given by the bidders.</P>
    <P>To our knowledge, the evaluation reports used in the above mentioned countries &mdash; except for France &mdash; were kept secret in order to protect the bidders, who have provided the Government with information under the belief that it would be treated confidentially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> I am aware that the Austrian Government has a constitutional obligation to justify its decisions.  I also know that disclosure is less relevant in cases where the size of the cheque determined the result.</P>
    <P>I explained the confidentiality constraints at the beginning of this statement. I would like to be as helpful as possible to understandably disappointed applicants, but the constraints on me are severe.  It is, therefore, proposed that individual briefing sessions will be held with the unsuccessful applicants where each will be given an outline of the evaluation process and the assessment of their own application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be possible to provide any comparative details on the winning or any other application.</P>
      <P>I have already spoken about jobs, but I now want to turn to specific suggestions as regards the loss of jobs in Ireland because of the GSM decision and, in particular, the reported loss of Motorola jobs in Cork.  Procurement by the second GSM operator will be determined fully within the terms of the European Union procurement rules, which require that major contracts of this kind must be put to open tender. Motorola, or any other equipment supplier, will have an equivalent chance of winning any such contract, regardless of the membership of the successful consortium. I reject, therefore, the speculation that jobs might have been lost because the consortium of which Motorola was a member was unsuccessful in its bid for the GSM licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Persona consortium has announced its intention to <Col N="1611" /> lodge a complaint with the European Commission in relation to the GSM process. I have no problem with that.  The bottom line is that I am convinced that the process and the decision will stand up to any scrutiny.  I have no problem with an examination by a third party.  I welcome it if it puts an end, as I am sure it will, to the damaging questioning of a fair competition.  I read in one newspaper that the first line of complaint was to be about my failure to charge a high enough fee.  In the context of what I have already said to date, there are no marks for guessing what the Commission would do with that.</P>
    <P>The GSM licence is a milestone document and it is of critical importance that it is comprehensively and accurately drafted.  Much of its detailed content is based on the winning tender.  The substance of the licence has been agreed between my Department and Esat Digifone and it has been, in recent days, the subject of final legal clearance.  I expect this clearance will be forthcoming shortly.  This is somewhat behind our original schedule but I stress that the only reason for delay is due to the time needed to draft the highly complex document.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts.  It is clear that every aspect of this historic competition has been carried out in an exemplary manner &mdash; whether by me, the officials in my and other Departments or in the international consultants.</P>
    <P>It is important, in view of the recent statements made in this House under privilege, to examine what the Opposition and, in particular Fianna Fáil, have said.</P>

He was a man whom many believe was prepared to see the complete picture shunning the baseless cant of party political posturing when the needs of the nation demanded better. Sadly, his legacy holds no influence in Fianna Fáil because it is in opposition for opposition's sake.  For Fianna Fáil, the national interest has been subsumed by self-interest.  There is no better example of Fianna Fáil's abandonment of the Lemass legacy than its repeated shameful posturing in this House on awarding the second mobile telephone licence.  The Opposition &mdash; and I include the Progressive Democrats &mdash; has threatened an increasingly vital and necessary tool of business and industry by their constant barracking about the award of the mobile telephone licence.</P>

It won fair and square and that should have been the end of it.  What we have witnessed in recent weeks is a groundless campaign wasting our limited resources, sapping the confidence of a small Irish company and deliberately undermining the credibility of Ireland as a place where we can do business. Oppositions have to oppose, but to undermine a company, the Civil Service and a renowned international consultancy is a new low in Irish politics. Apparently, any irresponsible comment is now deemed by the Opposition to be acceptable regardless of the consequences.</P>
      <P>Let there be no doubt in anyone's mind but that the second mobile telephone licence was awarded following a rigorous and independent evaluation of all six applicants.

It was agreed at the consultation and in writing that we should proceed along the lines of £15 million for the incoming operator and £10 million for the incumbent which was Eircell.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that much of the disquiet over the granting of this mobile telephone licence arose from the Minister's refusal to say why the unsuccessful applicants were not successful?  Several months after announcing the successful bidder he announced today &mdash; when this debate was forced on him &mdash; that he is prepared to give individual briefings to the unsuccessful applicants.  If he had done that initially much of the public disquiet, media comment and questioning in this House would not have been necessary. Opposition Members have a duty to ask questions on behalf of the public and this matter involves taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>Having decided not to accept the highest bid principle for this licence, should the Minister not have chosen the bid that would have given the lowest tariff so that the consumer might benefit? The Minister neither accepted the highest bid, which would have benefited the Exchequer, nor the lowest tariff, which would have benefited the consumer. Who will benefit?  Will it be the Norwegian Government, a major part of the consortium?  Does the Minister not see the contradiction in his method of choosing the successful bidder?</P>

      <P>When I set out to provide a licence for a second mobile operator I had one objective in mind, namely, to ensure that by way of competition we would reduce the price of telephone hardware, reduce call charges for mobile operators and ensure real competition in the market.  If I had done what the Deputy proposed when he told me outside the House that I was selling off the family silver to shore up public finances, we would not have lower prices on telephone hardware or lower tariff charges.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a simple Bill with a simple purpose. It has but one substantive provision which is to repeal the scheme &mdash; commonly known as the &ldquo;reinstatement scheme&rdquo;&mdash; whereby certain women were allowed to return to positions in the Civil Service without having to compete formally at Civil Service Commission open competitions.</P>
      <P>The scheme owes its origins to the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, which provided that women, who were then compelled to retire on marriage, could be reinstated upon being widowed.  Indeed, from our present perspective, it seems scarcely credible that a mere generation ago, women were obliged to resign from the Civil Service on marriage.  It is hard to accept today that in 1932 the Brennan Commission reported that:</P>
      <P>If a woman recruited to the post married after eight or ten years' service, the main purpose for which she had been employed entirely fails, and she has, moreover, during that time been blocking the way of a man who could give good value for the service in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1973 Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, the restriction on married women remaining in the Civil Service was abolished and the conditions under which <Col N="1627" /> married women could be reinstated were broadened.  From that time onwards, any woman who retired from the Civil Service for the purpose of getting married and who became a widow, or did not get married, or could establish to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that she was not being supported by her husband, could be reinstated to the Civil Service.  In that context, the 1973 legislation could be said to represent the first major initiative to improve the lot of women in the Irish Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Policy and guidelines on equal opportunities for the Civil Service were drawn up and published in 1986.  They provide the basic principles on which the ongoing development of gender equality policy is based.</P>
    <P>Last year saw only the second woman in the history of the State rise to the rank of departmental Secretary when Ms Margaret Hayes was appointed Secretary of the Department of Tourism and Trade in September.  If we look at the proportions of women in each of the main middle and senior management grades we find that the picture is a good deal more healthy than it was in 1972 just before the marriage bar was lifted. At higher executive officer level, some 38 per cent of the grade is now composed of women &mdash; the corresponding figure in 1972 was 12.4 per cent; women Assistant Principals now represent 24 per cent of the total &mdash; in 1972 they were a mere 4 per cent; 13 per cent of all Principals are now women compared with 0.5 per cent in 1972.  The percentage of women Assistant Secretaries is now 5 per cent, whereas, in 1972, women in the combined grades of Assistant Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Secretary constituted less than 1 per cent.  Women are still under-represented at management levels in the Civil Service but progress is continually being recorded.</P>
    <P>This progress while steady is somewhat slower than I would like it to be. It is assumed that the effects of the marriage bar are still a factor influencing <Col N="1628" /> the representation of women at the highest levels in that it usually takes considerable time to progress to the top of the administrative pyramid; but Margaret Hayes entered after 1973 &mdash; she has reached the top &mdash; so why are there not many more?  It cannot be the marriage bar.</P>
    <P>A further factor influencing the number of women in high ranking positions is the lower participation rate of women in promotion competitions.  This is a disturbing fact and one which is being examined.  Clearly everything is being done to ensure that even the slightest suspicion of bias is removed from Civil Service selection procedures.  It is now policy that every effort be made to try to have at least one women member on each interview board, whether for recruitment or promotion.</P>
    <P>Members of boards are briefed on Civil Service equality policy and are given written guidelines setting out the implications of that policy for the conduct of interviews.</P>
    <P>The general pattern emerging from an anaylsis of statistics gives no indication of gender bias in either recruitment or promotion competitions.</P>
    <P>The current representation of women is, perhaps, nothing to crow about, but the figures do represent substantial change in the right direction.</P>
    <P>To a significant degree, they are also the fruits of the various Civil Service initiatives intended to help staff to combine work and family responsibilities. Career breaks, job-sharing schemes and flexi-time have all been available for a number of years and are widely availed of.  A créche for the children of civil servants opened in 1992 and is operating to full capacity.  Plans are well advanced for a second créche.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the policy statement on the programme of change for the Civil Service, entitled Delivering Better Government, which is to be launched this Thursday, confronts head-on the issues surrounding the under-representation of women in the upper <Col N="1629" /> echelons of the Civil Service and considers the means whereby this imbalance can be overcome.</P>
    <P>The signs are promising but there is no reason to be complacent.  There is still considerable progress to be made. In order to address the topic of equality in a meaningful way, it needs to be looked at in the context of the general climate of change within the Civil Service. This is centred around the Strategic Management Initiative &mdash; or the SMI as it is more commonly known.</P>
    <P>Where is this climate of change leading? We are seeking to develop a process which will place a constant focus on what we should be doing and on likely future developments, thus enabling a more effective and informed response to be made, both to today's needs and to the likely challenges facing us in the future.  I am convinced that meaningful gender equality policies serve to enhance this process.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that the promotion of equality policies yields a number of tangible benefits to the organisation concerned.  It increases productivity by improving the use of staff resources, results in higher levels of job satisfaction and enhanced morale, helps to retain the best people by taking their needs into account, and contributes to a working environment in which higher standards of quality and customer service can take root.  In short, equality for all staff is a key element in achieving a high-performance, flexible Civil Service &mdash; the type of Civil Service which we intend to develop under the strategic management process.</P>
    <P>I would regard the effects of the reinstatement scheme as having been beneficial.  Since 1980 some 400 women, who had left the system on marriage and who met the criteria, were deemed eligible for reinstatement.  For most of the women in this category returning to the workplace was an economic necessity and we should celebrate the fact that the State provided a vehicle by which they could do this for many years.  A major attraction of the reinstatement scheme, compared with re-employment <Col N="1630" /> through open competition, was that people could resume in the same grade and at the same salary point as they had reached at the time they resigned.</P>
    <P>Why are we now seeking to repeal this scheme?  The reinstatement provisions were challenged in autumn 1990, under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, by a former official of the Revenue Commissioners who had been required to resign her position on marriage prior to 1973.  She applied for reinstatement, but accepted that she did not meet the requirements in that she was married and was being supported by her husband.</P>
    <P>She alleged that she was discriminated against on grounds of marital status in that Revenue sought details of her financial circumstances which would not be required of a widow.  The Labour Court found that the entire scheme was discriminatory and contrary to the principle of equal treatment in that access to reinstatement was denied to all men and to certain women.  The court also found that the Minister for Finance should introduce legislation to repeal the provisions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Attorney General's office advised that the reinstatement provisions were in breach of the EU Equal Treatment Directive and that we were obliged, under the terms of the directive, to repeal the scheme.  The then Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern, considered that he had no option but to suspend the scheme pending the enactment of the necessary legislation.  When it was learned that the woman who had taken the case had referred the Labour Court determination to the High Court, it was considered that further action on the Bill should be halted pending resolution of the challenge.  The High Court case has been struck out by consent and it is now possible to proceed with the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I must confess to having some reservations as I stand before the House today to speak in support of this Bill. Those who check the Dáil Official Report for the time when the 1973 Act was going through will find that there <Col N="1631" /> was universal support for its provisions. These provisions were seen at the time, in the words of Richie Ryan, as &ldquo;a further indication of the Government's commitment to end all discrimination against women and of the Government's concern for the less fortunate members of our society&rdquo;.  While the most important provision &mdash; that which ended the ban on married women remaining in the Civil Service &mdash; remains unaffected by the current Bill, I consider it regrettable that the reinstatement provisions for those who were obliged to leave the Civil Service on marriage have now to go &mdash; but go they must.</P>
    <P>The concept of gender equality, which was only in its infancy when the 1973 Act was passed, has developed since then, both here and in Europe, and we are now at the stage where it is seen in a much broader context &mdash; it is no longer simply an issue of equal rights for women but of equal rights for all regardless of gender.  The effects of this more comprehensive approach can sometimes be surprising and even, as in the present case, occasionally somewhat disturbing.  Equality can sometimes be a double edged sword.</P>
    <P>Many will, I know, share my particular sympathy with the women who were obliged to leave the Civil Service before 1973 on marriage and who will no longer have a right to reinstatement should their domestic circumstances so indicate.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months alone three such cases have come to my notice in my constituency. I am sure other Deputies, too, have had representations on this matter. However, I am afraid that we are caught between a rock and a hard place and the only course of action open to us is to repeal the scheme.  If I may quote from the determination of the Labour Court in the case I mentioned earlier:</P>
    <P>The Court is satisfied that the whole scheme for the reinstatement of some women in the civil service is discriminatory and contrary to the <Col N="1632" /> principle of equal treatment, and that the proper solution is to recommend the repeal of Section 11 of the 1956 Act as amended by Section 4 of the 1973 Act.</P>
    <P>The court went on to say that:</P>
    <P>All recruitment to the service should be by open competition through the Civil Service Commission, including the re-recruitment of former civil servants who resigned for whatever reason.  I can assure Members that the Government investigated all available options which might have mitigated the effects of the repeal to some degree at least.</P>
    <P>Consideration was given to such ideas as: instituting a new reinstatement scheme which would apply solely to those women who were compelled to resign before 1973; the possibility of having a scheme which would be open to all former civil servants, regardless of gender, who were deemed to be &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; cases; and the possibility of having special panels in some of the Civil Service recruitment competitions which would be confined to women who left on grounds of marriage.  All such approaches had to be rejected on the same grounds: they each ran a significant risk of being found to be in conflict with the EU Equal Treatment Directive which precludes discrimination based on gender or marital status whether such discrimination is direct or indirect. In effect any targeted scheme had to be ruled out of bounds.</P>
    <P>Although conscious of the necessity not to take any action which would replace one form of discrimination with another, the Government is anxious to take whatever meaningful steps are open to it to facilitate those women who left the Civil Service on marriage and now wish to return.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we have decided that the next two series of clerical assistant and executive officer competitions will include special sub-panels which will be composed solely of former civil servants &mdash; regardless of gender or marital <Col N="1633" /> status.  The House will readily see that while this approach is, of necessity, not focused on women it represents the only measure of relief open to the Government to cater for those who might have wished to be reinstated had the scheme remained on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>It will also be open to all former civil servants to apply for all competitions in the normal way.  Indeed, many women who left the Civil Service on grounds of marriage have re-entered the system through this means.  The extension of the upper age limit to 50 for most Civil Service recruitment competitions has enabled many more women in this category to re-enter the system.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this legislation will, I am sure, be recognised, if not necessarily welcomed, by Members on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>In introducting this Bill the Minister of State referred to being caught between a rock and a hard place.  This Bill has been in gestation for some time resulting from a court decision but was delayed because the defendant concerned sought to have it heard in a higher court.  It reminds me of the unusual effect of the equal treatment alleviating measures introduced by Government to overcome the problem that would be encountered by certain families resulting from equal treatment of married women.  After many court cases here and abroad, the measures were found to be discriminatory, costing the Government another package.  The Act introduced some years ago, specifying that women had to leave the Civil Service on marriage was found to be discriminatory.  As the Minister of State rightly said, equality legislation can turn out to be a double-edged sword.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Confronted by the provisions of this Bill, negative phrases first spring to mind &mdash; bar, barrier, discrimination and <Col N="1634" /> inequality.  A programme of awareness-raising, aimed at promoting women candidates in the June 1994 European Parliament elections, was based on exposing the paradox of a European Union in which in 1993 51 per cent of citizens are women but only 19.3 per cent of the 518 Members of the European Parliament were women.  The campaign slogan was: &ldquo;Can you imagine a world with 81 per cent men and 19 per cent women?&rdquo; Is this startling statistic not the ideal starting point for my contribution today since any data or statistics one cares to use serve only to highlight the inequities that abound?  At the very least, true democracy should entail a system within which both men and women can represent the population and participate in the democratic process.  Any such representation or participation stems from the same democratic base since the very concept of democracy implies that bars, barriers, discrimination, inequities, ceilings and the like should all be exposed and eliminated.</P>
    <P>Lack of representation and participation in any aspect of our society, in the case of either of the sexes, should be exposed and corrected where possible. It can happen at the factory gate, the shop floor, in the corridors of power and, of course, within the Civil Service. None of us can begin to say we live in a democratic society when a group representing about half of that society is excluded from participation in the democratic process or discriminated against.</P>
    <P>Reporting on the marriage bar to the Minister for Finance in December 1972 the Commission on the Status of Women pointed out that the marriage bar resulted from the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956 which provided that women employed in positions in the Civil Service, other than those employed in certain excluded, non-pensionable posts, were required to retire on marriage.  The Civil Service Commissioners Act of 1956 contained a provision enabling the commissioners, in <Col N="1635" /> making regulations in relation to a competition for a position in the Civil Service, to require that a female candidate should be unmarried or a widow.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of Women highlighted the 1996 census which demonstrated that the great majority of married women did not work outside the home, that only 35,000 married women were returned as gainfully occupied, representing approximately 6 per cent of all married women and 9 per cent of a total female labour force.  Outside the agricultural sector, that census reported that there were 23,000 married women gainfully occupied of whom 17,000 were classified as employees.</P>
    <P>The 1972 report of the Commission on the Status of Women went on to state that positions and social attitudes in Ireland tended to discourage women from remaining in employment after marriage but did point out that many women, although anxious to remain in their pre-marriage employment, were obliged to relinquish that employment on marriage, thereby depriving the economy of experienced workers.  This sometimes happened in occupations where the skills they possessed were in short supply and proved difficult to replace.</P>
    <P>A convention of the International Labour Organisation, namely Convention No. 111, provides that ratifying countries shall pursue a national policy designed to promote equality of treatment in employment and occupations with a view to eliminating any discrimination. Within the terms of that convention, discrimination is defined as any distinction, exclusion or preference made, among other things, on the basis of sex.  In 1992 the Commission on the Status of Women reported that Ireland had not ratified Convention No. 111.</P>
    <P>The statutory restrictions on the employment of married women in the public service in Ireland were completely at variance with practice in all member states of the European Union. Restrictions on the recruitment and <Col N="1636" /> retention of married women in the Northern Ireland Civil Service were abolished in 1970, giving women the choice of continuing in employment, in a pensionable or non-pensionable capacity, after marriage.</P>
    <P>The marriage bar in the Republic of Ireland meant that, in general, females employed in clerical jobs in service industries &mdash; in banks, local authorities and semi-State bodies &mdash; were required to resign their employment on marriage. The Commission on the Status of Women reported that the reasons advanced by companies to explain the existence of the marriage bar were varied.  In 1972 one company profiled stated that the need for the bar was that it enabled married women to fulfil their home responsibilities.  God forbid that companies would pursue that policy today.  While some companies may continue to think in that vein, they would not dare raise their heads above the parapet to voice such prejudices.  Some other companies couched the rationale for retaining the bar in economic terms, stating that decisions on the matter often were related to supply and demand for single women workers, yet others reported they were in favour of removing the bar.  Some trade unions were in favour of its retention.  Almost all of the women's organisations who made submissions to the Commission on the Status of Women expressed themselves in favour of the removal of any prohibition on the employment of married women.</P>
    <P>At that time the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recommended that the removal of the bar from the public service should be accepted in principle and that discussions should take place with the unions concerned through the appropriate machinery.</P>
    <P>In its report the Commission on the Status of Women concluded that, in their opinion:</P>
    <P>...compulsory retirement of women from employment because of their marriage is discriminatory and wasteful of their talents, training and <Col N="1637" /> experience and we recommend that a woman should be allowed to continue in her job irrespective of any change in her marital status.</P>
    <P>That report continued as follows:</P>
    <P>...her choice should, of course, be a completely free one and we would not, under any circumstances, wish to see any form of coercion brought to bear on a woman to remain in employment after marriage if she does not wish to do so.</P>
    <P>Fast-forwarding two decades, from the 1970s report of the Commission on the Status of Women to the present day, a European Union conference was held in Dublin on gender balance in decision-making.</P>
    <P>At the opening of that conference last year, the EU Commissioner for Social Affairs, Pádraig Flynn, commenced his contribution with two quotations, the first from Napoleon Bonaparte: &ldquo;because nothing is more difficult and therefore more precious than to be able to decide&rdquo;; and the second: &ldquo;because the complete fulfilment of democracy and citizenship means that all those affected by decisions should help to make and shape those decisions&rdquo;.  These two phases aptly paint the picture of where we should be today.</P>
    <P>Without a doubt, women throughout Europe, and here at home, have achieved a lot since the Commission on the Status of Women reported in 1972. From EU Directive level through to some legislation on the domestic front, women in Ireland have, to a degree, benefited from greater access to the labour market and, in many cases, to better incomes, though &ldquo;better&rdquo; does not necessarily imply equal.  In her article &ldquo;Splitting Images; Women and the Irish Civil Service&rdquo;, Clare Eager writes:</P>
    <P>it is easy to give a cursory glance at public administration in Ireland and assume that, between the eras of Constance Markievicz and Mary Robinson, women's participation in public affairs, particularly in the Civil Service, has been obscured.  In spite of <Col N="1638" /> their appointments to senior posts within the system, women like Deirdre Lane (Clerk of the Seanad)... hide the reality that, historically, the status of women civil servants is one of clerical orientation....</P>
    <P>The achievements of those image makers, like Thekla Beere in the 1970s, can never be underestimated.. ..However influential those women have been, or may be in future decades, the vast majority of women civil servants remain clustered in the lower grades and thus their experience differs from that of...Lane etc.</P>
    <P>Any of the statistics one might care to examine, from, say, the 1960s to the present day, clearly demonstrate that women have been integrated in the Civil Service.  However, this has not been matched by a move towards a fairer balance in the grading structure.  Statistics clearly show that despite female numbers rising within the Civil Service, there has not been a similar rise in their representation in the higher ranks of the administrative structure.  Figures from the Department of Finance indicate that, at the end of December 1995, of a total of approximately 13,800 women in the Civil Service, over 9,000 were employed at a clerical grade.  This figure is in stark contrast to their representation, for example, at inspectorate grade, where they make up only 5.9 per cent compared to just over 94 per cent of males.  Statistics from the Department confirm that the majority of female officers are employed at the lower grades of service, particularly in the traditionally female employment areas of clerical and typing grades.</P>
    <P>Examination of the percentage of females to males in general service grade in the Civil Service, as at end December 1995, demonstrate that, at clerical assistant grade, approximately 81 per cent are female compared to a male representation of about 19 per cent.  This ratio, rather interestingly, mirrors the statistic of the campaign for the elections to the European Parliament, to which I referred earlier, except <Col N="1639" /> on this occasion the female representation is higher, but it is higher when it is not wanted.</P>
    <P>Looking at recent statistics, one shining light, however, breaks through.  At the end of 1995, there was one female secretary of a Government Department, namely Ms Margaret Hayes at the Department of Tourism and Trade. While everyone undoubtedly welcomes this marvellous achievement, it is disappointing that Margaret Hayes remains an isolated case.  She sits alone at this higher level surrounded by 18 male colleagues, at both secretary and deputy secretary level.  Having worked with Ms Hayes in the Department of Tourism and Trade, I take this opportunity to congratulate her publicly on such a fine achievement.  She has been an outstanding civil servant for a long time in a range of Government Departments and she will make an excellent secretary. The only thing that would make her any happier than being secretary of a Government Department would be for Kilkenny to win three all-Irelands in a row.</P>
    <P>Recognising that figures show that women are at last beginning to gain a foothold in the middle and the higher grades of the Civil Service, we cannot ignore the fact that, as Ms Clare Eager points out: &ldquo;for the large majority of female workers, employment in the lower paid clerical grades remains the single most unchanging aspect of their employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I must also refer to the fact that, since the admission of men to the entry grade of clerical assistant within the Civil Service, just like their female counterparts male clerical workers are also victims of the relatively static nature of promotional outlets from the clerical grades.  There have certainly been changes over the last number of decades. Major changes have included the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, being eclipsed to a great extent by the enactment of the Employment of Married Women Act, 1973, which formally <Col N="1640" /> ended the ban on the employment of married women.</P>
    <P>The passing of the 1970s also saw the dismantling of the traditional female only entry grades and this led to a policy, in most cases, of recruitment by merit and ability not by the traditional biased, unequal and discriminatory gender route.  One must not forget also the implementation of equal pay policies. Acknowledging these monumental changes, the figures that have been produced by the Minister for Finance and those which I employed earlier to paint the picture only too vividly demonstrate that, however well equality of opportunity may operate at a senior level within the service, historically, women's employment within the Irish Civil Service remains one of a clerical orientation.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House today has its roots in a case taken by a women from Ennis, County Clare, for reinstatement to the Civil Service.  She was forced to resign from the service because of the marriage bar of the early 1970s and her reinstatement was rejected because she refused to comply with the stipulation that she should prove she was unable to be supported by her husband.</P>
    <P>A case was taken to the Employment Equality Agency challenging the ruling and this woman won her case in November 1991.  However, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners appealed the finding, that each of the three conditions for reinstatement were in contravention of EU equality Directives, subsequently.</P>
    <P>The three conditions of reinstatement apply only to women: they must be widows; be able to prove that they retired from the service for marriage related reasons; or be able to prove that they were not being supported by their husbands.  The woman in the case I have already outlined was not being supported by her husband.  Indeed, the Labour Court found that she should not have had to prove that she was supported by her husband.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> The bringing of this case to the Labour Court witnessed a deluge of calls from former civil servants, to both the Council for the Status of Women and the Employment Equality Agency.  In July 1993, the Labour Court issued its determination.  Two of the findings of the Labour Court were that: the &ldquo;Minister for Finance should, at the earliest opportunity, introduce the appropriate legislation to repeal the statutory provisions governing reinstatements&rdquo;; and &ldquo;under the Equal Treatment Directive ...laws, regulations and administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment be abolished&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following advice from the Attorney General that the statutory provision be repealed, the Department had, at that time, arranged that a Bill would be drafted to give effect to the Labour Court determination.  However, the determination then became the subject of a judicial review by the High Court. This review has now been struck out, thereby allowing the Minister for Finance to proceed with the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>In acknowledging that the Bill must be brought before us, it is ironic that the debate takes place in a period when we have witnessed the first full stoppage of 10,000 civil servants in over ten years. Civil Service industrial relations are in a perilous and fractious state at present. Over recent months, the Minister for Finance had allowed disputes to escalate to serious levels without making any forceful moves to resolve them until near chaos had ensued.  At least ten areas of Government have been affected in recent weeks because of disputes by the civil servants: the examinations section of the Department of Education, the Collector General's Office, the Land Registry, the European Presidency section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Social Welfare are just some of the areas which have suffered disruption. Indeed, Leinster House has not been immune to dispute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> The Minister for Finance as the guardian of the Government's seriously imprudent financial management exercises, must ensure that low-paid civil servants do not bear the brunt and become the easy scapegoats of the administration's lack of fiscal discipline. The Minister, in cahoots with the Government, has not fulfilled the taxation commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Promises have been broken and, quite correctly, stinging criticism has ensued.  It is estimated that the successful programmes &mdash; the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; have created in the order of 130,000 net new jobs.  Economic stability and economic growth have also resulted, thereby allowing Ireland to take a lead role in meeting stringent Maastricht obligations.  Yet, the economic boom is matched &mdash; or probably more correctly mismatched &mdash; by a Civil Service pay revolt; by derisory 1996 tax reductions; the likelihood of a free for all pay bargaining exercise at the end of this year and a phenomenal fall off in popularity of at least one of the parties in Government. The welcoming, at last, of legislation to close a chapter on the iniquitous marriage bar must not, and should not, be balanced by a new chapter of avoidable Civil Service unrest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested by the dilemma in which a woman Minister of State finds herself proposing this measure because at the end of her remarks the Minister of State said this would be hardly welcomed but might be seen as inevitable by many Members.  I was unconvinced by the proposition that it was impossible to keep in place something which would amount to a restitutory remedy for those women who were forced out of the Civil Service due to the unjust marriage bar.  I cannot imagine that anyone could successfully object to a system which has given women who could prove that they were forced to leave the Civil Service a fast <Col N="1643" /> track re-entry merely because those were the facts.  I find it strange that it is proffered as the legal advice to the Government that it is impossible to give people who had been forced out of the Civil Service prior to 1973 some degree of redress by giving them preferential treatment in coming back into the Civil Service after that date.  I find it difficult to see how that could possibly be because one thing is undoubtedly an injustice and the other seems to be a remedy for that injustice.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine that a long-term view of the law or fair view of society would strike down a particular provision where it is established beyond contradiction that its purpose is to give preferential treatment to those who have been unfairly treated in the past.  Whatever adjustment might have had to be made to the law to preserve that compensatory provision for women in those circumstances should have been made rather than the course adopted in this Bill which is simply to abolish the scheme in its entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The passage in the 1932 report of the Brennan Commission to which the Minister referred is a fascinating insight into the thinking of that time.  We should note that it was just in 1932 that such comments were made because they were said by all the people through the medium of the 1937 Constitution. Article 41 of the Constitution enjoins upon the State the duty of ensuring that &ldquo;mothers shall not obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home&rdquo;. Another Article of the Constitution enjoins upon the State the obligation of ensuring that women are not obliged by economic necessity to adopt vocations unsuited to their gender.  The basic fundamental laws of our land are written in the Constitution in tablets of stone.  One might imagine that such a law is now effectively dead wood but there are consequences which could easily follow from it, and, perhaps, the provision that women's duties in the home are constitutionally recognised would probably <Col N="1644" /> have been seized upon in the courts as a constitutional justification for the discrimination of women occupying positions in the Civil Service if women challenged the Civil Service marriage bar.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the proposition unquestioningly that some fast track process for women who had been forced out of the Civil Service prior to 1973 should not be available.  While it is obviously gender discriminatory because it is to women that the marriage bar applied, I cannot imagine the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg or the Supreme Court striking down any amendment to legislation the purpose of which is to undo this injustice done to those women.  As a Parliament we should agree that at least an apology is due to those women who were forced out of the Civil Service in circumstances where they did not wish to give up their job merely because they married somebody.</P>
    <P>It seems that the thinking of the 1930s &mdash; I was interested to hear Deputy McCreevy's point that it seemed to persist in some quarters until a very late stage &mdash; was based on a number of propositions and the Brennan report, quoted by the Minister, reinforces this. The thinking was that women in some sense were not suitable for Civil Service appointment because in the days before generalised access to contraception the function of a woman when getting married was to have a large family and in that thought process it followed that it was unfair of women to clutter up job opportunities for men when they knew that on the balance of probabilities they would have to retire early and would only be completing part of the normal job path for an entrant to the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>A curious feature of all that is the notion that jobs in the Civil Service were for life and they are still regarded as jobs for life especially by the public service unions.  I find in the last analysis that probably justified the Brennan analysis.  It is not that I am suggesting that the fixity of tenure now available to civil servants should be repealed at a <Col N="1645" /> stroke but it occurs to me that if in the rest of the world jobs are not for life, the time will come when jobs in the public service will not be for life either and contract employment and periods of employment will probably come into the public service over the next ten years even though to mention it now is politically incorrect and unwise.  I do not mind saying I think that at some time it will come about.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has presaged the forthcoming Government White Paper on reforming the Civil Service in conjunction with the Strategic Management Initiative and I am interested to learn that it is called Delivering Better Government &mdash; A programme of Change for the Irish Civil Service because my party published a document recently, The Changing State &mdash; Reforming and Rewarding the Public Service.  In that document we underlined the statistical matrix of gender discrimination which still applies to women in the public service.</P>
    <P>Even taking into account the improvement that the Minister of State underlines it is still the case that reform in terms of gender equality in the Civil Service is very much retarded compared to other walks of life.  For instance in my most conservative profession, as others would see it, the barristers profession, the legal profession and the Judiciary, the number of women becoming barristers has expanded dramatically from the day I was called to the Bar.  At that time one could list the number of women barristers by name and probably on two hands out of a profession of 200.  Now, with 900 in the profession, I am sure there are, perhaps, 150 women barristers who are rapidly ascending the heights of the profession, although it is commonly the case that judges are appointed only from those who have been in practice a long time.</P>
    <P>Though there has been a huge influx of women into the profession the position of women on the Bench is not as good as it might be.  However, there is enthusiasm for the appointment of <Col N="1646" /> women to the Bench and there is a complete acceptance that there should be a demonstrated willingness on the part of Government to remedy the gender imbalance which so far characterises the Irish Judiciary.  The figures the Minister outlined for the public service show a disappointingly conservative approach to women.  I note what the Minister said. It is worrying that women are not seeking promotion in proportionate numbers but we have to ask why this is the case.  It may well be that the character and the ethos of the public service is hostile to women seeking promotion.</P>
    <P>It may well be true that many women in the public service are happy with their lot and do not suffer from overdoses of testosterone that compel unsuitable men to enter examinations in which they do not have any prospect of success.  By the same token there must be some hostile elements, hard to finger, which exclude women from competing for promotion in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Regarding overall reform of the public service, we are going through a stage in which the nature of a public service job will be dramatically reformed.  I do not know what conclusions will be reached by the strategic management initiative, but it will be a lost opportunity unless it does for the Irish public service what New Zealand's State services commission and its reform did for New Zealand &mdash; brings into effect the notion of contractual liability for Departments to deliver a specified degree of services for a specified cost and brings to key players in the public service personal responsibility for performance in terms of output and their departmental duties.  That is the cornerstone of this reform.</P>
    <P>If this White Paper turns out to be mishmash, a watering down of other initiatives and a faint-hearted effort to introduce touches and smidgens of principles of responsibility into the process and not one which embraces the concepts which the New Zealanders have wholeheartedly embraced with such success, it will be a failure.  I am concerned that in the last analysis this <Col N="1647" /> Government with its centre left orientation and, the alliance of the Labour Party and Democratic Left Party with the public sector unions, will turn out to be a disappointingly conservative prescription for change in our public service. We are dealing with a situation in which many people consider their specific interests are gridlocked into a zero-sum game in which any concession or change is regarded as a loss and nobody considers they can be in a position where by making changes everyone will be a winner.</P>
    <P>I presage the publication of the Government's document by making the point that if it is not a radical, far-seeing dramatic essay to attempt to change the way the public service is viewed, it will be all the more disappointing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I declare an interest in this Bill because I am one of the people who was fired when I married in 1972.  I suppose I could have a theoretical right of return to the Civil Service which is being extinguished under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will pick up on some of the more general comments made.  The effects of the marriage bar lasted in the Civil Service to this day.  We have a pyramid structure in terms of the involvement of women in the public service.  Two of the major economic Departments which have a significant number of staff, the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment, have only one women principal officer.  That is due in no small measure to successive generations of women leaving the public service on account of the marriage bar and the attraction of taking a marriage gratuity. I hope the strategic management initiative with its emphasis on performance and ability rather than the traditional rigid grade structures will address the central issue of equality in terms of women in the public service.  That service needs the input and perspective of women at every level in the same way <Col N="1648" /> as the perspective of men need to be employed at lower levels.</P>
    <P>Women seek promotion in smaller numbers than men and those who did have been extremely successful in competitions disproportionate to their male counterparts.  Certain Departments have been successful in ensuring that women get a fair crack of the whip and come through the promotional structure. The active promotion of women has taken place in the Department of Social Welfare, in which Deputy McCreevy served, and in the Department of Health, and women of ability in those Departments have come through the promotional structure.  It is no accident that the two women who head Government Departments, Margaret Hayes, in the Department of Tourism and Trade and, Julie O'Neill, in the office of the Tánaiste, have come through the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, respectively, to positions where they have been able to compete successfully before TLAC.</P>
    <P>When I saw the quotation from the Brennan report I was reminded of an old neighbour in Glasnevin.  She joined the Civil Service in 1915 when it was under British rule.  In those days women were let out five minutes early for lunch lest they meet and engage in unacceptable social intercourse with their male counterparts on the stairs. Thankfully, we have come a long way since then.  Unfortunately, the legal advice on this measure is that we cannot move any further, but I hope that through the medium of the strategic management initiative we can ensure that women, who were deterred by the marriage bar, will play their rightful part and advance in numbers in the Civil Service of the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the observations of the Minister and Minister of State about public service reform, the strategic management initiative and the progress of female participation in the public service.  It is of great importance that we have the maximum possible female representation at every level of <Col N="1649" /> the public service.  The Minister said there has been a substantial change in the right direction, but much remains to be done.  Progress will ensure in part what Deputy McDowell is seeking, greater efficiency and a better delivery of services in the public sector.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed about this measure.  It is extraordinary that an equality measure supposed to address an inequality and imbalance between the sexes should result in a specific harsh measure in terms of those seeking readmission to the public service.  The scheme operated to assist women of another generation who worked under different social assumptions and who were obliged to leave the public service. It is disappointing that this measure must be introduced as a result of legal advice.  I accept that a Government is constrained to act on the advice given to it by an Attorney General but was the opinion of the commission obtained on this matter?  It seems extraordinary that legal abstractions can lead to a measure which results in inequality.  The courts have often referred to the famous dictum of Aristotle, who said that equality consisted of treating equals equally and unequals unequally.  In this situation a diversity of arrangements should be permissible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the hard facts?  How many women were obliged to leave the public service as a result of marriage bar? I realise it is difficult to compile an accurate statistic because of the influence of death and emigration, but an estimate must be available of the number affected by this measure.  There is not a lobby to represent that group, but Deputies who attend to the needs of their constituents will be well aware of the substantial number of cases involved.  I was pleased the Minister said a special scheme would be put in place for at least the next two years which will go some way towards redressing the injustice involved.  We will not be lobbied on this matter by many people in a collective sense and we should be careful when dealing with it.  I welcome the <Col N="1650" /> proposal and urge the Minister to extend the scheme in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann recognises the urgent need for fundamental reform of our taxation system and, in particular, demands measures which would relieve the huge burden of taxation on PAYE workers on low to medium incomes; eliminate employees PRSI; reduce the penal levels of employers` PRSI; and that such measures would form an integral part of any successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> and help to create a pro-jobs, pro-enterprise economy properly geared for the competitive challenges which face us in the new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is not intended as another scrap of paper to be deposited on the intellectual rubbish tip of broken promises, false claims and shattered hopes which is the recent experience of the voting public in relation to tax reform. Tonight the Progressive Democtats Party will concentrate on the central issue in the next general election, the central plank of any Administration of which we will form a part between 1997-2002 and the core economic issue which we face, namely whether this country will be led by politicians who have the courage, vision and tenacity to bring about a revolution in the taxation system in the lifetime of one Government. Without using unduly complex or overweening analogies, in political terms the Progressive Democrats Party is tonight lighting the political equivalent of the Olympic flame.  Tonight we will set forth the radical challenge to the old order which the fire on the Hill of Slane constituted 2,000 years ago and defiantly <Col N="1651" /> say to the political administrative establishment, &ldquo;you have failed, you are failing and you will fail and you should prepare to stand aside for those who want to succeed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wish to begin by referring to the Packard plant.  No one but a complete fool would fail to grasp that the workers in Tallaght were employed in a highly competitive, labour-intensive and utterly mobile enterprise.  No one but a complete fool could fail to grasp that Ireland with its huge workforce needs to attract mobile labour-intensive investment to our shores.  No one who looks at the real cause of the Packard debacle can deny that.  In late 1994 and early 1995 the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa, presided over Departments which extracted from the Packard plant £5.5 million in payroll taxes from an annual wage bill of £15.5 million.  The State, which taxes special savings accounts at 15 per cent and many business activities at 12.5 per cent, taxed the workers' payroll at Packard at 35 per cent.  There has been much talk about the grants given to Packard but the annual take in terms of the payroll and PRSI exceeded the grants given to it in any given year.</P>
    <P>When will we grasp the message from the Culliton report that the most important thing any Government can do is to change our anti-work and anti-enterprise tax system?  This afternoon I listened to Peter Cassells, one of the members of the Culliton Review Group and one of the people who identified himself publicly with the report which was given such widespread acceptance at the time.  It struck me forcefully that he had not lost his grasp of the central tenet of that report, which is that the most important thing any Government can do is to deliver reform on our anti-work and anti-employment tax system.</P>
    <P>Why were 800 jobs in Packard so much less valuable than 800 jobs elsewhere in the public sector or the semi-State sector?  Why were the jobs of the Packard workers taxed at 35 per cent of <Col N="1652" /> the payroll while £30 million in subsidies were poured into one company in the semi-State sector, £120 million into another company and £175 million into a third company?  The answer is clear &mdash; political ideology.  High taxes, high subsidies and State control, the intellectual thumb prints of the Labour Party, are all over the Tallaght debacle.  Why do the Ministers, Deputies Quinn and De Rossa, take £5.57 out of every extra £10 earned by a worker earning well below the average industrial wage?  The workers in Tallaght were in low-paid employment.  Why did the State say to a worker in Tallaght who was offered £10 extra for over-time, for working on a Saturday, as payment for productivity or for taking a post of responsibility, &ldquo;we want £5.75&rdquo;?  Why does the State say to such people that if they earn an extra £10 it needs more of that amount than they do?  What socialist justification do these gentlemen have for saying to a single man or woman in Tallaght or elsewhere on below average industrial wages, &ldquo;we need more of your extra earnings than you do&rdquo;?  If one says that to workers earning below the average industrial wage what message is one conveying to them?</P>
    <P>Where is there even the tiniest bit of social justice in confiscating more than half of the marginal earnings of those earning below the average industrial wage?  How do the parties of the left justify what I describe as social theft of that order?  How does the Labour Party, in particular, which has been in office for 12 of the past 23 years, during which time the tax system was largely evolved and shaped, justify the existence of a tax system which has brought super taxes to single workers on below average wages?</P>
    <P>When Labour went into Government in 1973 98 per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the standard rate.  By 1987, after two disastrous periods of the Labour Party in office, 43 per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate, an increase from 1.7 per cent in 1973.  At this time of massive increases in taxation the national debt was doubled during the second period in office from 1982-87.  In <Col N="1653" /> case anyone ever suggests &mdash; I will not tire of saying this &mdash; that this was done by accident or inadvertently or because people took their eye off the ball, when in 1977 I asked a senior member of that Administration if it would not be a good idea to index link tax allowances and bands &mdash; the 1973 figure of less than 2 per cent of taxpayers paying above the standard rate had increased to 14 per cent &mdash; he said clearly that this would mean the end of all social progress. Anyone who thinks that inflation nibbled away unconsciously at the taxpayer's wage packet and was not directed by people who knew what they were about is wrong.  Rather it was done consciously and deliberately and when one pointed out what was happening it was justified on the basis that to counteract inflation in the tax system would be to end social progress.</P>
    <P>Since 1992, when the Labour Party was re-elected to office, tax reform has not merely stopped, but has been thrown into reverse.  Apart from the infamous and short lived income levy which the Minister recently defended as a necessary measure to undo the damage done by the Progressive Democrats when in office and which had the effect of increasing taxes from 27 per cent to 29 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have an opportunity to interrupt the Minister's speech which is what he is doing now. The Labour Party's legacy, as it limps to the end of yet another disastrous period in Government, is, yet again, a missed opportunity, a fumbled chance, some tinkering here and there at the edge of the tax system, but nothing of substance and, certainly, nothing radical.  The people have paid a truly incredible high price for having the Labour Party in office for 12 of the past 23 years &mdash; huge borrowings, taxes, dole queues and political egos.  That is the nightmare experience of the Labour Party at the helm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> Between 1989 and 1992 the top rate of tax of 58 per cent was abolished and the lower rate cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent.  If that Government had survived to introduce a budget in 1993, there would have been a standard rate of 25 per cent and a top rate of 44 per cent.  All this was achieved because the programme of that Government set out clearly identifiable tax targets for tax reform.</P>
    <P>I ask those who constantly chided the Progressive Democrats between 1985 and 1989 with peddling the policies of illusion and championing tax reform which was bogus, whether they would reverse what was done between 1989 and 1992.  Would they slap up the top rate of tax for workers earning below the average industrial wage to 58 per cent on their taxable pound and reapply the 35 per cent rate rather than the existing rate of 27 per cent?</P>
    <P>During that period the yield from income tax grew.  In the period 1997 to 2002, if the Progressive Democrats are in office the lower rate of tax will be reduced to 20 per cent and the top rate no higher than 40 per cent.  In addition, PRSI will be eliminated for employees and transferred into a single digit levy for employers. we have shown how this can be done.</P>

Despite the most favourable economic <Col N="1655" /> circumstances in the last quarter of a century, they have failed to do anything about all the rhetoric on tax reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have shown that this can be done and that, in Government, we deliver on our tax policies. We believe that lowering marginal tax rates yields greater revenue and economic growth.  We point to the experience of other countries to prove that there is an alternative to the crazy economics of our tax system.</P>
      <P>In New Zealand, whose economy is comparable to ours in many respects though different in many others, parties of both right and left abandoned the political orthodoxy which motivates the Labour Party in Ireland.  They took the view that a radical change was needed, out went state control and regulation, subsidies, protectionism and labour market rigidities and in came privatisation, a slimmer and trimmer state sector, a real market economy with a system of Government unreservedly committed to enterprise.</P>
      <P>Unemployment fell from 14 per cent to 6 per cent as these policies were implemented while taxes and welfare were changed to make it worth people's while to work.  They were able, as a result, to reduce the standard rate of tax to 18 per cent and the top rate to 33 per cent.  It has not become a society &mdash; despite all the rhetoric in Ireland &mdash; where people say that it is more unjust now than it was when in the grip of the social democrats, the social engineers, who had brought it to its knees.  It has a healthy economy with good international credit ratings, a healthy economic heart and a great future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the former New Zealand Finance Minister, Ruth Richardson, appeared before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs recently she routed her Irish Labour Party critics <Col N="1656" /> by pointing out in the clearest and most convincing terms that it had chosen the path of high unemployment and welfare as its response to Ireland's economic problems.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about social justice.  I reject with contempt the politics of human set-aside which the Establishment, at the behest of the left, is pursuing. There is no social justice in a system which says to 280,000 workers and their families that they should live on the margins, keep out of the markets and not participate in the economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>We live &mdash; I address this point particularly to those who consider themselves to be on the left in Irish politics &mdash; as part of the European Union economy. We cannot pursue the politics of Bevin and Keir Hardie in modern circumstances. We must accept, as the basic premise of our politics and economics, the market principle.  In a society founded on that principle, like it or not, the first thing that must be delivered for the maximum number of people in terms of social justice is participation in its economic life.  There is no social justice in creating an under-class dependent on distribution to maintain a meagre hand to mouth existence.</P>
    <P>A society which is satisfied by increasing social welfare as an alternative to doing something about the economic plight of people whom society has failed will end up doing what Europe collectively has done and what Germany now sees as the price of that folly.  If one constantly ratchets up social protective legislation and welfare provision at the expense of higher taxation, one will end up with a system, common across the European Union, including Ireland, where it is increasingly less worthwhile to participate in the economic life of the State and increasingly more difficult for those at the bottom of the social ladder to participate.</P>
    <P>Europe is the sick man of the world in terms of job provision.  Ireland is one of &mdash; but not the sickest &mdash; in the European Union in terms of the percentage <Col N="1657" /> unemployed.  As a society and a member of the Union, we have gone nowhere towards a thoroughgoing analysis of what is wrong with Europe and how it can remedy the injustice which third generation unemployment spells out in terms of marginalisation, exclusion, a sense of hopelessness and the destructive corrosive principle at work at the heart of society.</P>
    <P>The people who have created a system in which those at the bottom of the ladder who try to work harder have more than half of their extra earnings taken in taxes and levies have questions to answer.  They have created a system in which many workers on £9,000 have more disposal income than their equivalents on £14,000.  It is the left which is speaking in terms of giving, as a remedy, what I would call cement boots to the unemployed in the form of minimum wage to compound our anti-enterprise system.</P>
    <P>I want to make one point about the job creation statistics.  There has been a disparity between the live register and the labour force survey.  Various explanations have been advanced for this. Those who sign on are people who receive real money.  They are not phantoms; they take the money.  Whether they are phantom unemployed is another question but I do not believe the vast majority of them are in that category. Many people are categorised in surveys as being employed because they are in part-time employment.  Much of the job growth reported in labour report surveys in the last three or four years is really an exchange of full time employment for part-time employment.  That is a more rational explanation for what has happened than the overblown claims of the Government that it is creating more and more jobs in the economy.</P>
    <P>Instead of tackling the central issues of taxation, we have a more complex system with BES schemes where those with more money than judgment gamble their money rather than paying taxation. In this country if one is lucky enough to have money the best thing to <Col N="1658" /> do is invest it in bricks and mortar, especially domestic homes, put it into special accounts where it is taxed at 15 per cent or leave it in a building society account where one can get away with paying the standard rate of tax.  What kind of social justice is there in a society which says to a single worker in Packard that if he or she earns an extra £10 it will take £5.70 in taxes and welfare payments but tells a person wth plenty of money to invest it in a film or a cast iron venture?  What kind of society can say to people who work 40 hours a week and do their best for their families that what they do does not matter?  The State charges them super tax on any extra money they earn.  There are wealthy people in society &mdash; Deputy McCreevy spoke about them earlier &mdash; who boast about using tax breaks and who, by living off their capital or borrowing money, pay nothing to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If such a tax system were imposed by parties of the right, if there were such in Ireland, there would be a revolution led by the parties of the left.  If I said it was justifiable to take £5.70 out of every extra £10 earned by someone earning 80 per cent of the average industrial wage I would be castigated and rightly so.  A party that was in office for 12 out of the last 23 years and which had an opportunity to change that did not do so.  People earning £12,800 per annum, which amounts to £250 gross pay per week, less than £200 in take home pay per week, have more than half of every extra £10 they earn confiscated by the State.  What kind of social justice underlies that state of affairs?  None.  It is about time that the Irish left began to be as radical as the New Zealand left, the Spanish left, the French left and even the British left in the form of the Labour Party which is proposing a 20 per cent standard rate income tax if it is elected at the next election.  Why does the Government tax employment and single workers whose <Col N="1659" /> wages are below the average industrial wage at a rate which would make the reconstructed Communists seeking election in eastern Europe blush with embarrassment if anyone accused them of having plans along those lines?</P>
      <P>In this country a businesman is crippled with tax if he succeeds and rewarded if he avoids risk and effort. Why do we have a system whereby a businessman who makes £50,000 profit in his company and decides to reinvest it in his own business is treated far worse than if he goes to the ICC or other agency peddling BES and avails of a tax break?  Surely we should have a system which encourages a person running a successful business to make it more successful and not one which hammers those who reinvest their surplus money in their own businesses and rewards with tax breaks those who invest in some of the more doubtful BES ventures.  How can that be justified? We have a country in which to invest to provide jobs for others in ordinary business requires idealism and patriotism.</P>
      <P>We have a social partnership which excludes those in ISME who want to increase employment and instead includes organisations whose main concern is to shed jobs.  Those who want to participate at the social partners' table and have an appetite to create jobs are excluded and the big players who want to get rid of jobs and are interested in industrial peace at any cost determine the outcome of the deliberations.  It includes those who want to drive up the public sector pay bill but excludes those in the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed who want a job of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a radical alternative which has been proved to work and that is to face up to the fact that the political establishment, the social partners, the jaded political generation which has brought us nothing but failure and disappointment and the grey faced bureaucratic mandarins who are comfortable with their present system of political <Col N="1660" /> failure are the problem and not the solution.</P>
    <P>The next five years are a window of opportunity for this State.  They will be decisive years.  On the one hand we can muddle along with Labour led mediocrity and indecision and thereby squander the opportunity to effect an economic transformation in this State.  That way we will fail to face the challenges that confront us.  The alternative is to put in place a Government committed to the radical transformation of the economy in its lifetime, one that will face up boldly to the challenge of tax reform, set targets each year and deliver on them; face up courageously to the problems of the semi-State sector; one committed to making it more worth-while to work than not to work; that believes employing is better than sacking; leaves as much as possible of the wage packet in the hands of the employee; rewards risk-taking in employment creation; is committed to business, work and effort and to the inclusion of those whom present policies exclude.</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of success must to twofold: the control of public spending and the transformation of the tax system. That in turn requires that any successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> must be negotiated by those who will implement it.  This rainbow Government has no political mandate as anyone in the street will tell it.  This Government came upon the people from nowhere; they did not chose it.  Without being unfair, it had 16 per cent support for all its candidates in the Dublin west by-election.  It has less than 35 per cent support nationally.  It has no right to impose on its successor an ideological millstone in the form of an agreement between the priesthood of economic failure, the so-called social partners.  The people of Ireland are weary of those who propagate a false consensus about policies that have failed and are failing &mdash; by-election results show that.  We need a new Government with a new programme for radical change and we need to bring the <Col N="1661" /> people with that programme.  The radical change we need will never be thrashed out by the existing social partners sitting around the same table at which they have, in the past ten years, constantly postponed all radical change.</P>
    <P>The ballot box is where the people should make their decisions about the kind of country they want to create.  The people are ready for radical choices and I am sure they know the futility of simply continuing as we are.  I am convinced the next election will be a watershed, the point at which the people will be offered and will grasp a new deal.  I am convinced they will elect to Government people who will deliver on a new deal, whose terms can be as radical and as challenging as they are feasible. When I speak about a new deal I speak about a programme which will do to Ireland what has been done in other countries, not just what was done by Roosevelt for post-depression America but what two Governments of left and right with radical intent did to New Zealand. I speak about a Government that will face up to the issues of the overweening, overbearing and stagnating role of the State in our economy.</P>
    <P>We should put in place a dynamic, lean State which is an agency for change, a Government which will lead a public service apparatus which is performance driven in every sense of the word, in which civil and public servants can deliver of their tremendous potential in bringing about change, in which the ethos in the public service will not be conservatism or time-serving but rather &ldquo;what can I do to change Ireland for the better&rdquo;, in which those who are in charge of the great organs of State, the Departments, semi-State agencies and other agencies of State will be appointed, rewarded and monitored on the basis of achievement and success. They will make contracts with the Government to deliver the service the State requires of them as efficiently and as well as possible.  The officials of those agencies and Departments will be rewarded for doing their tasks well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> I view the Bord na Móna controversy with a good deal of misgiving.  At the heart of it is a person who has made an effort, a person who is upbeat an working for his organisation, who has tried to bring about worth-while change in that organisation and is willing to ask radical questions about the organisation.  Whatever about proper management controls and the proper implementation of remuneration and control of taxpayers' money &mdash; those are serious issues &mdash; I query whether we as a society will ever get to the stage where we will encourage those who hold the levers of power on our behalf to use their own initiative and trust their own judgment and whether we will reward them when they succeed and hold them accountable when they fail.</P>
    <P>If we look at the history of the semi-State sector, has anyone ever suffered for making an appalling mess of matters? Has anybody who ran up a debt of £180 million in Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta ever been sacked?  Has anybody who ran our shipping services into the shore paid the price for that?  By the same token, have those who have done very well ever been properly rewarded? I doubt it.  We as a society must face up to the fact that the Government and the State sector have an essential role in society, but it must be radically different in future.  As a society we must face up to a future in which those who work on behalf of the people in public employment are expected to meet targets in terms of performance, accountability and so on and are given the opportunity to allow their talents to shine through. Above all what is needed is a public service in which, as is the case in the private sector, people are aware that when they succeed and do well they will share in the fruits of their success.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the people get a new deal from the State for which they pay.  For instance, in areas such as public expenditure we are entitled and ought to ask whether we are getting good value for money.  People say that it is dangerous to speak about control of public spending, that it may endanger <Col N="1663" /> the quality of services people expect from the State.  Let us consider a few issues relating to the past five years. Spending on the Garda Síochána has increased by 40 per cent, but have we got 40 per cent more from the criminal justice system?  I am not blaming individual gardaí, I am simply asking the question.  Has the performance of the Garda Síochána been 40 per cent better in the past five years?  Few people, including members of the Garda Síochána, would agree that is the case.  Spending on our prison system has increased by 50 per cent in the past five years, but the present system is in an unreconstructed shambles, in a state of crisis. Spending on the health services has increased by 65 per cent since 1990, but nobody believes that the system is two-thirds better than it was in 1990.  I do not deny that some important improvements have been made in that time, but considering an increase in expenditure of 65 per cent over a five-year period we are entitled to demand a dramatically improved health service.</P>
    <P>At present the economic climate is very favourable.  Other countries are experiencing a downturn while Ireland, as the Minister recently pointed out, is sailing well through this squall and the economic fundamentals are good in terms of growth.  We have survived the downturn in the economies of many other countries reasonably well. However, we receive, and will receive over the next few years, huge transfers from the European Union.  During that period we have the opportunity not only to get things right and make the fundamental changes necessary if we are not merely to stagger into an European Monetary Union as cripples but to survive and prosper.  We have a precious opportunity of five years when things will go well for us and if we do not avail of the opportunity to get things right we will be like the people in &ldquo;The Gladiators&rdquo;&mdash; I used this analogy before &mdash; who run up the travelator, literally fall through a paper screen at the end and are declared the winners.  We will totter <Col N="1664" /> and fall into the European Monetary Union because as a society we will not have made the fundamental changes that are necessary.  We will fail if we do not avail of the opportunities during the next five years.  That period is not merely a window of opportunity but is a period of potential challenge, and if we do not face up to it we will be in very serious trouble.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs this new deal and the electorate will demand it at the next election.  We need a Government which has the courage to propose and deliver on a new deal.  The present politics of the failed consensus are over.  I note Deputy Ahern was quoted in the papers at the weekend as saying there might be ideological differences between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. There may well be but I advise, in the most friendly way, those who think that the present State orthodox ideology is any way in which to transform this country to be very careful.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann welcomes the Government's firm and prudent management of the economy as reflected in the strong economic growth, <Col N="1665" /> increased employment, low interest rates and low inflation achieved over recent years; notes the control of public expdenditure and the sound fiscal stance adopted in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty guidelines; recognises the substantial progress in reform of the income tax and PRSI systems and the other significant measures to promote enterprise and employment in the 1995 and 1996 budgets; acknowledges the Government's continuing support for the less well-off members of our society; and recognises the contribution Government policy is making towards creating a pro-jobs and pro-enterprise economy conducive to achieving real increases in take-home pay, improving the incentive to work and the deepening of the social partnership based upon consensus and consultation which has given Ireland the best economic performance of any country in the OECD in 1995.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to respond to the contribution made by Deputy Michael McDowell which could be accurately described as the sort of speech another Michael, Michael Portillo, or another John, John Redwood, might have offered in another House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not correct because Deputy Michael McDowell was not telling the full story.  The recipe is similar but much closer to home.  In many respects we can see the effects across the water of low personal taxation, particularly of the higher rate, on the delivery of certain essential services such as health and education.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell has made three speeches.  He has made a naked party political broadcast which basically states: &ldquo;Party for hire at the right price, provided we get into Government&rdquo; and, 14 months at least from a general election, that is not an unreasonable pitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> His second speech was an attack on the Labour Party as if we had been a majority party in Government for a number of years.  He was curtailed in the amount of time he could give to that but the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> for which he must be virtually a House correspondent, regularly gives its Irish readership, of which there is a substantial number, a much more extensive diet of a similar critique.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That newspaper performs in the marketplace like any other.  The Deputy, along with his fellow correspondents and colleagues, frequently puts out the same type of material.  In fact, there is a certain similarity, verging on a mantra-like repetition of certain points.  The third part of the Deputy's speech, to which I wish to respond, was the serious economic analysis and sincerely held views in relation to what we should do over the next number of years, particularly with regard to another national agreement if there is to be one.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy McDowell for the opportunity to outline the importance of the consensus approach to pay determination and policy development adopted by all Governments before and since 1988.  I compliment his party's role in those Governments because the personalities in his party who were in Government have between them, on my calculation, more than 20 years' experience of being in office if one takes the ministerial career of Deputies Molloy and O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consensus approach various Governments have adopted has made a major contribution to our economic development over recent years. However, the last three agreements have not been confined solely to pay and taxation changes.  They covered a wide range of policy areas including care for the less well-off sections of our society and the need to increase employment.  The Government's firm <Col N="1667" /> and prudent management of the economy has helped in achieving the goals of the consensus approach in line with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and will facilitate the continuation of this approach in the future.</P>
    <P>The last three centralised agreements have involved the Government, the main trade unions, employers and farmers since 1988.  The current agreement, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; 1994-96 &mdash; was agreed in early 1994 and seeks to build on the achievements of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. All three agreements represents a consensus-based approach to wage determination covering both the public and the private sectors.  They have sought to improve the competitiveness of the economy through moderate pay increases in a framework in which fiscal and monetary policy are geared towards price stability.  A national pay norm is set after negotiations between the social partners.  Payment by firms of the increases is not automatic, however, but depends on their ability to pay.  Accordingly, the national pay agreements have allowed for an element of flexibility which is vital for employment protection and growth.</P>
    <P>The agreements also cover other areas of policy such as Government expenditure and taxation reform.  Under this integrated approach pay increases are influenced by the Government's overall tax and expenditure plans.  The agreements have also embodied the Government's medium-term economic strategy and, in particular, its commitment to respect requirements of the Maastricht Treaty.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the first of the agreements, sought to rectify imbalances in the public finances.  The latest agreement, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> in addition to pay restraint, includes a comprehensive package of measures designed to enhance the economy's productive capacity.  These measures include plans <Col N="1668" /> for taxation reform, structural reform of the economy and investment plans, all of which are geared towards preparing the economy for the final stage of economic and monetary union.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is monitored by a central review committee, comprising representatives of all the social partners.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy in recent years has been characterised by consistency in budgetary, monetary and exchange rate policy which has provided coherence in overall economic strategy and credibility both domestically and internationally. The continued economic stability and moderate pay terms provided by the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> and its predecessor agreements, have enhanced the competitiveness of the economy and contributed to the excellent performance in terms of output and employment growth.  Furthermore, fiscal policy in conjunction with monetary policy has maintained confidence in the exchange rate, contributed to securing low interest rates and underpinned non-inflationary output and employment growth.  The consensus and social partnership achieved under the three national programmes have contributed enormously to this process.</P>
    <P>Over the nine years 1987 to 1995, GDP growth in Ireland averaged approximately 5 per cent per annum. This was more than twice as fast as growth in the European Union as a whole which averaged 2.3 per cent during the same period.  The corresponding figure for the United Kingdom was 2.1 per cent.  It is very important to note our better growth performance did not give rise to undue inflationary pressures. Between 1987 and 1995, our inflation rate averaged 2.1 per cent compared with 2.7 per cent for the European Union as a whole and 4.2 per cent in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Nor was our good growth performance the result of excessive levels of Government borrowing.  In fact it was quite the reverse.  Our general Government deficit has averaged 3.2 per cent <Col N="1669" /> over the past nine years and it has been comfortably below the Maastricht Treaty reference figure of 3 per cent every year since 1988.  By comparison, the average Government deficit for the EU as a whole was 4.3 per cent for the same period.</P>
    <P>There are now clear signals that rapid economic growth is being translated into impressive increases in the number of people at work.  There are more people at work here than in any time since the 1930s.</P>
    <P>While our strong growth rates are by now fairly widely known, it is perhaps not so widely appreciated that Ireland's employment performance in recent years has also been significantly better than both the European Union average and that of the United Kingdom.  Over the same nine year period from 1987 to 1995 to which I referred earlier, employment growth here averaged 1.3 per cent per year.  This was more than three times as fast as annual employment growth in the European Union.  Our unemployment rate has also fallen in recent years at a time when unemployment rates in the European Union generally have been on the increase.</P>
    <P>In 1996, for the third year in succession, the Irish economy will be among the fastest growing if not actually the fastest growing in the OECD area. GDP this year is projected to expand by 5.75 per cent compared to a projected OECD area average of about 2.5 per cent.  Our strong growth performance this year derives mainly from increased domestic demand in the form of increased payment investment and private consumption.  As in 1994 and 1995, this strong growth performance is being translated into jobs.  Employment, after increasing by 40,000 in 1994 and 45,000 last year, is again expected to increase rapidly this year by about 31,000 or 2.5 per cent.  This is the second fastest rate of employment growth in the European Union, only Luxembourg has a faster rate.  It is also about two and half times the projected rate of employment growth of 0.9 per cent in both the European Union and the OECD area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1670" /> Despite our very rapid rate of output and employment growth, inflation is expected to remain fairly moderate this year at around 2.25 per cent.  This compares reasonably favourably with the projected inflation rate for both the European Union and the United Kingdom which, in both cases, is expected to be close to 3 per cent this year.  However, having said this, it is vitally important that we keep cost increases in Ireland down to the absolute minimum and, if possible, well below those of our trading partners. This has indeed been our record over the last decade or so, but we must maintain this progress.</P>
    <P>Irish interbank interest rates are at their lowest levels for decades and this is reflected in the low rates of interest currently available to people borrowing to invest in businesses, to those wishing to purchase their own homes, to those who are already repaying mortgages and to personal borrowers.  The low level of interest rates currently enjoyed by the Irish economy is a symptom of success &mdash; success in maintaining a low level of inflation; success in maintaining a stable and credible currency, success in maintaining a strong balance of payments position and success in maintaining discipline in fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>Economists, bankers, pension funds and insurance companies &mdash; managers of investments around the world &mdash; have looked at the Irish economy and have given it an unequivocal &ldquo;thumbs up&rdquo;.  This is reflected not only in the strong international participation in the Irish bond market but also in the willingness of investors to put their funds into Irish pounds.</P>
    <P>The Government in its programme A Government of Renewal commits itself to continuing the process of tax reform. The programme stresses that reform should favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development and growth.  I reject the false impression being created by some that no progress is being made towards reducing the tax and PRSI burden on <Col N="1671" /> employment income.  That is simply not the case.  Over the past number of years successive Governments have been undertaking a programme of tax reform with a view of increasing competitiveness and growth and thereby contributing to the maintenance and creation of sustainable employment.  In recent years we have made significant progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>In line with A Government of Renewal, a central tenet of the last two budgets has been to reward work by increasing take home pay.  The 1995 and 1996 budgets have confirmed this Government's policy to continue, within responsible budgetary parameters, the process of tax and PRSI changes as an important element in overall strategy. Over the two budgets combined, personal allowances have been increased by close to 13 per cent.  The standard income tax band has been widened by £1,200 in the case of a single person and by £2,400 for a married couple.  This is an increase of close to 15 per cent &mdash; an amount which more than compensates for the reduction in mortgage interest and VHI reliefs.  These increases are significantly above the expected rate of inflation for the two year period of under 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The last two budgets also focused on the lower paid by increasing the general income exemption limits by 8.3 per cent, thereby taking a significant number of workers out of the income tax net altogether. A new PRSI free allowance was introduced in 1995 and increased to £80 per week this year for most employees. This measure, a unique new feature in the Irish social insurance system, means that in the case of most workers, the first £80 of their weekly wage is disregarded when calculating their PRSI contribution.  This allowance is of particular benefit to those on lower pay as it gives valuable relief to those who are already exempted from income tax and who would not benefit from further increases in either the exemption limits or the personal allowances.  Furthermore, the threshold for payment of the <Col N="1672" /> health and employment and training levies has been increased in line with pay increases.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of these measures has been to increase take-home pay, especially in the case of lower paid workers, thereby making employment more attractive.  Equally importantly, these measures will ensure that we continue the progress being made in reducing both the employees' average tax burden and the overall tax wedge.  Let me illustrate this point with a number of examples.</P>
    <P>In 1994-95 the average tax take, including income tax, PRSI and levies, for a married couple, one earner with two children, earning the average industrial wage, was over 23.4 per cent; in 1996-97 this figure is expected to fall to below 22.1 per cent.  For a single person, on the same wage level, the average tax take in 1994-95 was 31.3 per cent; in 1996-97 this figure is expected to fall to 29.7 per cent.  In 1994-95 the average tax wedge, including employers' PRSI, for a married couple, one earner with two children, earning the average industrial wage, was almost 31.8 per cent; in the tax year 1996-97, after allowing for wage increases, the tax wedge is expected to fall to around 30.4 per cent.  For a single person on the same level of income, the average tax wedge is expected to fall from almost 38.8 per cent in 1994-95 to around 37.2 per cent in 1996-97.</P>
    <P>If we look at the period of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the percentage increase in take home pay for a single industrial worker on gross pay of £9,000 in 1993 has increased by 14.6 per cent when the tax changes and the basic pay increases, of slightly over 8 per cent under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> are taken into account.  For a family with one earner and two children the corresponding percentage increase at £9,000 is 16 per cent.  For those further up the earnings scale the corresponding increases are not less than 12 per cent. These increases are significantly ahead of expected inflation over this period of <Col N="1673" /> around 7.3 per cent.  A very large proportion of the increase in real take home pay over the period of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is due to the improvements introduced in the income tax and PRSI areas.</P>
    <P>Also over the period of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> the threshold at which the top rate of income tax applies in the case of a single industrial worker has increased by £1,914 to £12,850, even after allowing for the non-renewal of the PRSI income tax allowance.  In the case of a married couple, one earner, the threshold has increased by over £4,100 to £24,900. This represents increases in the single and married thresholds for the higher tax rate of 17.5 per cent and almost 20 per cent, respectively, which are well above twice the expected rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>These figures give a clear indication of the progress being made in the income tax and PRSI areas and refute statements which have been made repeatedly in this House by those who seek to minimise or understate this Government's achievements.  I hope to achieve greater progress and it is my goal to continue the progress which has been made in the past two years, but it is clearly wrong to complain about the absence of tax reform as some have done.  If tax changes are to be pursued, it is best to do so on a sustained basis. A succession of seemingly moderate tax reductions from year to year can, over a relatively short period, make a substantial difference.  That is what we are in the process of doing.</P>
    <P>A further aim of this Government is to encourage the development of enterprise in order to generate and maintain employment.  To this end the lower rate of employers' PRSI was reduced from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent and the income threshold for the higher rate increased from £173 per week to £250 per week, that is, from £9,000 to £13,000 per annum.  This represents an increase of around 45 per cent.  In addition, the main rate of employer contribution was reduced from 12.2 per <Col N="1674" /> cent to 12 per cent.  For an employer with 30 employees earning £13,000 per annum, this has resulted in a reduction of almost £14,500 per annum in employer PRSI costs.  These reductions are, of course, of significant benefit to the services sector which, as the Deputy is aware, includes many labour-intensive activities.</P>
    <P>For several years now, the policy of successive Governments in relation to corporation tax has been to reduce the standard rate and to facilitate this by broadening the base.  This Government recognises that the corporation tax rate is a critical factor in creating a pro-enterprise environment and in determining the competitiveness of Irish industry in international markets. Therefore, in my first budget in 1995, I reduced the standard rate of corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  This was a further significant step towards our securing a standard rate which is comparable with the rates that exist in competitor countries.  Deputies will recall that I indicated at the time that it is this Government's firm intention to reduce the standard rate further in future years, as resources permit.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget I introduced a new reduced rate of corporation tax which will apply to all businesses liable at the standard rate.  The new rate of 30 per cent applies from 1 April 1996 to the first £50,000 of taxable income in an accounting year.  While all companies will ultimately benefit from gradual reductions in the standard rate, this year's measure provides proportionately greater benefit to the small business sector. This is in recognition of the fact that the small business sector has shown the capacity to create substantial additional employment.</P>
    <P>A reduced corporation tax rate will facilitate the retention of profits for reinvestment to build up business and create employment, particularly in small businesses.  This gives a positive signal to entrepreneurs who are deciding to expand their business.  I hope the companies concerned will respond to this measure and use the facility to expand <Col N="1675" /> their business with a view to creating further sustainable employment.  Of course, all proposals for changes in relation to the taxation of business must be considered in the context of the overall reform of the corporation tax system.</P>
    <P>If our aim is to reduce the tax rate, then we must be prepared to broaden the tax base and endure that the various reliefs, concessions and exemptions make a net contribution to the state of the economy.  For this reason, I introduced measures to curtail abuses of certain tax reliefs and to refocus relief measures on the productive areas for which they were originally intended. Deputies are aware that I took such action in relation to the relief for patent royalty income.  I was not prepared to tolerate a situation where a relief was being misused by certain taxpayers at a significant cost to the Exchequer without a tangible return in terms of increased R &amp; D activity.</P>
    <P>The changes which I am introducing will limit the scope of these costly abuses, while ensuring that the relief is still available for genuine R &amp; D activity.  Similarly, the Finance Bill measures on the BES and section 35 relief for film investment are aimed at curtailing unintended uses of these reliefs and refocusing them on productive employment enhancing ventures.</P>
    <P>Economic growth is the key to achieving a better material society for all.  Ultimately, we want continued improvement in living standards for all members of the community, not only those in employment or in business for themselves, but also those who are the least advantaged, namely, the unemployed, the sick, the elderly and families with dependent children.  There must be an equitable sharing of the fruits of economic growth if we are to achieve progress in a socially cohesive manner.  A sharing society is one that will, in the end, provide the necessary incentive to ensure that we continue to grow and prosper into the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> The Government has, of course, made the achievement of greater social solidarity a key objective in its economic and budgetary strategy in the past two budgets.  In pursuit of this objective, we have adopted a range of measures aimed at improving the real level of social welfare payments, particularly for families with dependent children, and encouraging those who are currently unemployed to actively seek and secure employment.</P>
    <P>In round figures, about 27 per cent of social welfare spending goes to pensioners; 28 per cent goes to the unemployed; a further 28 per cent is spent on family income support; 5 per cent goes on administration and the balance on illness payments.  Each group of beneficiaries has had its social welfare payments increased in the past two budgets. All weekly payments and all adult dependant allowances have been improved in real terms.  Over the past two budgets these increases have been in excess of 5.5 per cent.  This compares with an inflation rate in the period of under 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>These improved rates will ensure that the real purchasing power of social welfare payments will show an increase over the two year period 1995-96.  In terms of the Exchequer, they will cost an estimated £180 million in a full year. Members will agree that this is a very significant commitment.  It is indicative of the Government's and, ultimately, the general taxpayer's willingness and desire to ensure that the more vulnerable people in our society continue to share in the &ldquo;growth dividend&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The policy direction initiated in last year's budget with regard to financial support for children was continued and further developed in this year's budget. Following from the substantial increases of £7 per child given in the 1995 budget, child benefit this year is being increased by £2 per child per month from next September.  This will bring the monthly payment to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.  Taking the last two budgets together, a 45 per cent increase has been <Col N="1677" /> provided in respect of the first two children and a 36 per cent increase for other children.  This represents real support for families with dependent children.</P>
    <P>Research shows that families with a number of dependent children tend to be most at risk of falling into poverty. This applies in particular to those families where the head of the household is unemployed.  Over one million children and almost half a million families benefit from child benefit.  It is of particular value to families on low incomes.  Furthermore it is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment. In this sense, it does not constitute a disincentive to taking up employment. It is estimated that when the full year effects of both this year's and last year's significant improvements have worked their way fully into the Exchequer accounts, child benefit will cost in the order of £390 million per annum.</P>
    <P>It will be generally accepted that the Government has made significant progress in recent years in ensuring that the least advantaged members of our society have shared in the benefits flowing from our excellent economic performance. Social welfare payments have been improved in real terms and the position of families rearing children has been particularly well catered for.  A range of well targeted pro-employment measures have also been adopted and enhanced with a view to getting increasing numbers of the unemployed back into the jobs market.  In the long-term, I believe this approach represents the best way of tackling poverty in our society.</P>
    <P>The calls of those who espouse fundamental tax reform are invariably linked with demands for increasingly stringent control of public expenditure.  I fully acknowledge that firm control of public expenditure, as part of a prudent overall fiscal strategy, is essential if the necessary additional resources are to be released to allow scope for meaningful tax reform.  In this context, I have no difficulty defending this Government's <Col N="1678" /> record on controlling public expenditure. The facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>This Government has succeeded in keeping the growth in public spending to its lowest level since 1989.  In the period 1991-94, the average real increase in day-to-day Government spending was 6 per cent.  Since taking office, this Government has succeeded in not only containing but actually reversing this excessive growth trend.  In 1995 the real increase in public expenditure was just over 3 per cent and in the 1996 budget I have provided for an increase of 2.5 per cent.  Gross non-capital supply services spending as a share of national income is planned to be lower this year than in any year since 1990.  These facts prove that this Government has succeeded in keeping public expenditure under firm control &mdash; something which previous Governments since 1990 did not manage to achieve.  This Government is fully committed to maintaining its prudent stance on public spending. This is being done as a wider budget strategy designed principally to ensure that Ireland continues to be in a position to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Renewal limits the growth in gross current spending to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms in 1996 and 1997 &mdash; the first time that a Government policy programme has given such specific targets for controlling public expenditure.  In setting our public expenditure targets. the Government has taken a considered view about the appropriate level of spending growth given Ireland's social and economic development.  The modest increase in current spending provided for under our targets allows sufficient scope to ensure that the benefits of economic growth can be used to improve essential public services, particularly for those in greatest need, while at the same time providing resources for significant tax reform, especially reform directed at removing the disincentives to job creation.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of this Government's committed and innovative <Col N="1679" /> approach to overall public expenditure and budgetary management &mdash; if indeed such evidence is required &mdash; can be found in the planned move to a new system of multi-annual budgeting which I announced in my Budget Statement on 23 January 1996.  The phased introduction of a multi-annual budgetary framework, with effect from the 1997 budget, will make an important contribution to the overall effort to maintain firm control on the growth in public expenditure. The multi-annual approach, involving three year benchmark projections for the budgetary aggregates, will facilitate a planned approach to the management of the public finances.  The process will involve the establishment of baseline projections of expenditure for three years ahead which will be agreed by the Government.  These projections will be costed on the technical assumption of a continuation of the existing level of programmes and services.  While it will still be open to Departments to seek additional resources over and above the baseline projections, the existence of such Government approved projections will provide a valuable benchmark against which such demands may be more rationally assessed, and should serve as a restraining influence on expenditure generally.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I set out the role of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement are helping to control the level of increase in pay rates and deal with restructuring issues.  Moderate increases, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, combined with the fact that no further cost increasing claims may be made or processed under the terms of the agreement, are helping to control public expenditure.  This control is essential if we wish to make further progress on tax reform.  Continued moderation and certainty in pay costs is also essential if we are to improve competitiveness and bring further growth to reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> As already stated, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is due to conclude at the end of 1996 &mdash; though the public service pay agreement continues until the end of June 1997.  I would see merit in a new programme to succeed the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> in order to address the major challenges which our economy and society as a whole will face in the next number of years, including involvement in Economic and Monetary Union and continuing to tackle employment through flexibility and improvements in competitiveness.  A new programme would allow the social partners to play their part in addressing the challenges ahead and would continue the consensus approach to the management of the economy which has served the country well in recent years.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat the essential and incontrovertible facts.  This Government's firm and prudent management of the economy, combined with the moderate <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> wage increases and the significant tax and PRSI changes introduced over recent years has contributed to real increases in take home pay for workers. They have also led to low inflation, low interest rates and strong economic growth which is now being converted into a rapid expansion in numbers at work.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue the process of tax and PRSI reform as resources allow.  The principles and priorities which will guide the Government in this regard will include targeting lower paid workers, widening the standard rate tax band, increasing personal allowances and exemption limits, reviewing the efficiency of tax expenditures, continuing the improvements in the tax collection system and strengthening the Revenue's audit capacity in the fight against tax evasion.</P>
    <P>While we have much work to do, the process that we have adopted over successive Governments, in some of which the Progressive Democrats, but not Deputy McDowell, were members, have brought us to the point where our <Col N="1681" /> record in European terms and OECD terms is the envy of other countries including New Zealand.  I do not doubt that there is much more work to be done but we will continue to do it with the same level of success which we achieved to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a fairly wide ranging address by both the proposer of the motion, Deputy McDowell, and by the Minister on this motion and on the economy.  I will try to confine my remarks to a number of those areas.</P>
      <P>This debate will go nowhere unless we explicitly state our assumptions.  We could make speeches about tax reform, PRSI and a pro-jobs economy for the new millennium, but they will not achieve anything unless they are focused on the agenda now facing the Government.  I assume the Government will start discussions about the successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> notwithstanding the ritualistic dancing which has to go on before every national agreement.  It follows from that assumption that nothing said in the House should damage or dictate the Government's negotiating stance for those discussions.  The discussions are a part of the Government's housekeeping tasks, the management of Government services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Government will seek industrial peace and consensus on pay for its own servants.  The Government is like any other employer.  It must negotiate with its employees on the basis of its strengths and weaknesses.  In the past, the Government has broadened the base of the discussions to include all employers so that marketplace realities might enter the equation and produce a better outcome for the Government that would have occurred in an in-house public service pay round, in other words, the commercial realities facing the exposed, competing private sector would act as a surrogate constraint on the Government's freedom of manoeuvre in public sector wages.  As a <i>quid pro quo,</i> the Government always has the capacity to move the parties <Col N="1682" /> towards consensus by commitments on job creation or by tax or PRSI measures.</P>
    <P>The Government has to realise that the private sector may be reluctant to be used again in this way.  Many employers feel that a new wage round negotiated in a three party programme will produce an unacceptably high price for them because the Government appears to be suffering from an embarrassing surplus of revenue and, if the longer term consequences are ignored, can afford more generous wage increases to buy industrial peace.</P>
    <P>The private sector cannot afford a wage round at this point.  If competitiveness is to be maintained, particularly when the exchange rate is IR£103 or higher to £1 sterling and if more jobs are to come on stream, the scope for wage increases in the private sector is nil. That is what Deputy McDowell is saying, although not in so many words.  He speaks on behalf of the private sector which wants the Government to fund the next round entirely through PRSI and PAYE tax cuts.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil agrees that tax rates must be lowered, but the irresponsible spending levels achieved by this Government must be pruned back first.  In some ways, it would make better sense for us to state our firm concerns about limiting Government expenditure than to call for tax handouts.  The Government should be in a position to go to the negotiating table and tell all parties that their hands have been democratically tied by this House.  The public sector wage bill is too high and cannot be allowed to get higher.  At the same time, revenue growth or no revenue growth, we must continue to make inroads on the structural defect in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It would make sense for the Government to stand back from the negotiations and let the private sector negotiations set the levels of a new round based entirely on the commercial realities of the marketplace.  I would go so far as to suggest that, instead of <Col N="1683" /> embarking on a new round of discussions, the Government could do worse than announce that public service employees would be guaranteed the same increases that are negotiated in private sector bargaining &mdash; no more and no less.  The Government could even promise to backdate it.  Who could possibly criticise that stance?  It is the stance the public wants.  It is what the taxpayer is crying out for because he or she knows that real tax reductions will only come about when Government spending is responsibly controlled.  The wage levels in the economy must in future be those which the private sector can afford and not those which the public sector negotiates with itself.</P>
    <P>Are we rapidly approaching the position of having two distinct labour markets? In the private sector we have seen a huge increase in the number of part-time workers, specific contract workers and even the self-employed on schedule D.  I was amused to learn that the recent leading High Court decision on who is or is not an employee for tax purposes concerned a person appointed by the Minister for Social Welfare as branch manager of an employment office in Tullamore.  He was held to be self-employed for tax purposes; even the public sector is changing.  The point is nevertheless valid.  The kind of lifelong secure and pensionable employment still available in the public sector is a thing of the past in the private sector because private sector employment is no longer immune from competition and cyclical shocks; even banks have to compete now.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether reforms in the public sector manpower policy, about which we have read recently, will mean an abandonment of the traditional Civil Service job package in favour of some imitation of our private sector fixed term contract of service; perhaps so. It is what Devlin wanted; it is what MacSharry wanted.  Clearly, there are areas of the public sector where the phasing out of the traditionally appointed Civil Service may be in order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> Other areas, however, must be specially considered.  I speak of the labour intensive public services in nursing and health care, in education, in the Defence Forces, the Garda and the prison service.  The public servants employed in these fields must be specially catered for because they are employed and skilled in particular tasks in which the Government has the monopoly. Accordingly, their opportunities for job switching are clearly limited and the rewards of a secure and pensionable employment should be theirs.  Comparisons with the private sector are not altogether applicable.</P>
    <P>I want to state Fianna Fáil's position on privatisation.  You will not see Fianna Fáil privatising the prison service or the health service.  You will not see privatisation of the Garda or schools.  These services are for the public and the Government must guarantee their quality.  You may, however, see privatisation of services that can be brought in by Government at a saving &mdash; for example, transport or revenue collection &mdash; provided the changeover does not mean that the private contractors are not achieving the cost saving by exploiting the workforce or skimping on the quality of the service delivered.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the views of some commentators, Fianna Fáil believes that, by and large, the taxpayers get very good value for the public service; Fianna Fáil believes that the labourer is also worthy of his hire.  However, the days of strict comparability between public sector and private sector pay rates are long gone and any new wage round should recognise that reality.  Otherwise, one will be artificially high and the other artificially low, and that is a recipe for disaster all round.</P>
    <P>We should compare the social partnership we have had since 1987 with the New Zealand experience with which Deputy McDowell, I and other members of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs are familiar, having had the pleasure of listening to and deliberating with former New Zealand Finance Minister, Ms Ruth <Col N="1685" /> Richardson.  They started a process of reform in the mid-1980s.  She inherited the process which was started by a Labour Government some years previously. I asked her what kind of reaction she got from the public sector unions and the answer was that they did not have any difficulty.  However, at this stage of our economic development if one attempted to implement some of the New Zealand changes, one would have considerable difficulty with the public service unions for the following reason.</P>
    <P>In 1987 social partnership became the norm under the then Fianna Fáil Government.  It is a great credit to the Irish trade union movement that they saw, more than anybody else, and were prepared to accept that unless we changed our economic ways we were not just on the verge of fiscal and financial bankruptcy, we were bankrupt. There was no other explanation for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell has given an interesting and fairly accurate account of how we arrived at that situation and I have also spoken about it in the past. The trade union movement, more than any other sector, was prepared to lead its members.  The realisation was there and credit is due to them but if in 1996 one was to attempt the level of reforms implemented in New Zealand, they would not be quite as receptive because we have turned the corner.</P>
    <P>My objection to Government expenditure policies is that we are passing up an opportunity that we will not see again.  One need not be a great economist or mathematician to realise that we are probably at the height of the economic cycle in Ireland.  The growth rates we experienced in the past number of years are unprecedented.  However, one must be aware of future events.</P>
    <P>By the end of the decade we will probably be participants in Economic and Monetary Union, which will constrain our movement in the future.  We will not be allowed to have large current budget deficits or large Exchequer borrowing requirements.  As the Minister pointed out in reply to a question from me today, if we do, our partners have <Col N="1686" /> made various proposals about tax, punishment fines and so on.  With one European central bank, we will not have the same flexible control over financial policy.</P>
    <P>One does not need to be Einstein to work out that, with more members joining the European Community from the east and the Community getting bigger, we will not enjoy the same proportionate level of funds which has been transferred to us from the rest of the Community for the past ten years or so.  That is not to say we will not get some EU funding in the future; we will, but it cannot be of the same proportion.  The purpose of European funding was to increase Irish economic income <i>per capita.</i></P>
    <P>We cannot just cut the major programmes now in place.  The Exchequer will be expected to take up some of the slack and that will put a strain on our financial resources.  All those things coming together at one time will result in an enormous strain and a prudent Government or Administration would be taking steps to take account of that now.</P>
    <P>I, as much as anybody, recognise the exigencies of electoral politics. However, the Irish electorate has changed over the past 20 years.  When the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and I first came into the House the Minister came in against the run of play while I came in on the tide of great disenchantment with the outgoing Government.  The manifesto which my party put before the people has been rightly critcised, and by none more so than the present speaker.  However, politics has changed dramatically.</P>
    <P>People may think that trying to store up a load of goodies to hand out in tax reductions will result in electoral success in 1997.  That is how Irish politicians thought traditionally.  Most of those involved in grassroots politics will say that is the way to do things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister agrees but I do not know whether he can bring everyone in his political party, and his partners in Government, to the same thinking.</P>
      <P>There are great myths about public spending.  The Minister talks about real rates of increase, and we debated that before Christmas.  I served in this House with the late Deputy John Callanan of Galway.  He used to speak from the backbenches, he was a man of the most eminent and sound common sense.  He came from a tradition in my party &mdash; and the Labour Party &mdash; of sound common sense.  He called a spade a spade. The fact that he did not have formal university degrees did not mean he was not the most educated person, in the widest sense, I ever met in this House.</P>
      <P>In our parliamentary party he argued against the idea of percentage wage increases which he said would prove to be a disaster.  He said that someone on £100 a week getting a 10 per cent increase will have £110 but a person who is on £20 will only be £2 better off, in other words, the percentage wage increase widened the gap between these two workers.  This seems to have been lost sight of in national wage agreements in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument can be applied to public spending.  We have slowed down the rate of public spending in percentage terms but that is not to say it was not totally out of control.  Any Government must recognise a few simple realities. Much of the time we spend fighting over the Estimates is a total nonsense.  Let us say that gross Government spending this year is £14 billion.  Nearly £4.5 billion of that goes to social welfare payments. They are man made schemes.  If people get sick, we will pay them just as we pay the unemployed.  We have no control over that element of expenditure. About £200 million more goes to repayments on the national debt. <Col N="1688" /> Nobody would be so foolish as to suggest that we renege on our national commitments.  Nearly £5 billion goes on public pay and pensions.  If one adds up those three figures alone, they come to £11 billion.</P>
    <P>One must accept there are things that Government must do.  We spend much of our time fiddling around looking for £2 million here, £3 million there and £5 million in the other place, but unless the Government is prepared to take some control over those three elements of spending, the rest is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>I made a point to the Minister about social welfare, privately and publicly, during the debate on the Finance Bill and at other times for the benefit of his civil servants in the Department of Finance. Statements about the difference between the live register and Labour Force Survey are rubbish.  There should be no difference.  The people who sign on every week are real people with real names and addresses.  The Department of Social Welfare spent millions of pounds computerising the system over the last 15 years.  If the political will was there, at the press of a few buttons one could tell the number of people involved, what school they had attended, previous jobs, how many children they have and what masses they attended, if they went to mass.</P>
    <P>To say a survey is more accurate than actually counting the people would be like standing at the top of Grafton Street and surveying people on how they will vote in the next election and deciding to publish that and not bothering to conduct an election at all.  The electorate of somebody who suggested that would decide the person was not fit to be in the House.</P>

      <P>In the years ahead we will look back and say chances were wasted in the period 1993-97.  I am aware the Members with whom I served in Government wish to do the right thing, but the exigencies of politics will dictate that, when we look back, we will say a great chance was wasted.  Since entering Opposition, I have become increasingly convinced of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The town of Cobh has grown enormously over the last number of years and is continuing to develop.  The Minister is familiar with the geography of Cobh and that it is effectively built on a hill.  There are three levels, one at the waterside, another slightly up the hill and the third at the top of the hill.</P>
      <P>The largest amount of development over the last two years has been at the top of the hill and there has been a major problem regarding the water supply to the new housing estates.  The supply to the new houses and the existing housing stock in the middle layer is cut off at different times during the day. This was particularly the case last summer, and the water is often cut off in the morning.  Given the massive amount of development taking place, a new water tower to supply water to the new houses is required.  If a catastrophe occurred, such as a fire, one of the main dangers is that the water supply may not be sufficient to enable the fire brigade to extinguish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of weeks ago the Minister's programme manager met the urban district council in Cobh and the members <Col N="1690" /> were promised that the council would receive a reply by 22 April.  A response has not yet reached Cobh &mdash; I am not aware if it arrived this evening &mdash; and the members of the urban district council are most disappointed.  I ask the Minister of State to urgently address this matter because it has been ongoing for a number of years.  It has not arisen only in recent months; it dates back to the time my party was in Government. However, this problem must be addressed immediately to ensure a catastrophe is avoided.  I do not want members of the Government blamed for something they had the power to rectify.  I hope the Minister of State has good news for Cobh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to respond to this matter.  I have high regard to the people of Cobh; the Deputy and I have had many good times there in recent times.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the deficiencies in the water suply serving the town of Cobh and its immediate surroundings and that the people of Cobh are most concerned. Proposals to rectify the water supply problems in Cobh have been prepared by Cork County Council.  These entail improvements, not only for the town of Cobh but also for the Midleton and Carrigtwohill areas, which are estimated to cost £3.4 million.  Contract documents for the overall scheme have been submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>In common with a large number of other desirable projects it has not yet been possible for my Department to allocate funds which would permit this scheme to progress towards construction. This is due to the demand for finance for other high priority water and sewerage schemes around the country. In allocating scarce resources to the most urgent projects, we are forced to make difficult decisions that must inevitably cause disappointment to some local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> In determining spending priorities for water schemes, we must have regard, first and foremost, to health and safety issues and the need to comply with national and European standards relating to water quality.  Other factors that must be taken into account include the social, economic and employment benefits that will accrue to a town or region as a consequence of the provision of additional water.  Some areas and their local authorities will always be disappointed when it is not possible to advance projects they consider vital to their areas.  However, we do not have access to unlimited resources to fund water supply schemes everywhere in the country.</P>
    <P>Over the last five or six years approximately £9 million in capital grants have been paid to Cork County Council for water and sewerage schemes around the county and in the years immediately ahead I anticipate further substantial moneys will be allocated to carry out important schemes.  Regretfully, however, it is not yet possible to set a definite date for the start of the Cobh scheme but I assure the Deputy every effort will be made to advance the project at the earliest opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important topic.</P>
      <P>One of the most sinister developments in Ireland's rising tide of crime is what is known as contract killing.  On Saturday, 27 April 1996, <i>The Irish Times</i> listed 11 cases of murder, most of which, if not all, were contract killings; some of them date back to 1994, but none have been solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rise in the number of contract killings in this country is inextricably linked to the greater availability of illegal firearms.  The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, sets out <Col N="1692" /> to control the supply and distribution of illegal guns.  However, it has failed; illegal firearms have proliferated.  In many cases they are imported with large consignments of drugs as the traffickers' sweetener in the drug deal.  In the city of Limerick, which I represent, the experience is that anybody who wishes to gain access to an illegal firearm can readily and quickly do so.  The firearm may be purchased for the going rate or, alternatively, rented.</P>
    <P>The current price to rent an illegal firearm in Limerick is approximately £40 an hour.  The standard charge for a contract hit is approximately £2,000. However, as guns proliferate, life inevitably becomes cheaper.  In Limerick recently, a price of £400 was quoted. This is the price of a life now.  In some of the larger urban areas in the United States, the police have managed to reduce levels of violent crime by targeting illegal firearms.  It is long past time for the Garda to mount a similar operation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Contract killings are difficult to solve. In many cases they are carried out by professionals who are well acquainted with the law and are careful to leave no forensic evidence.  There is no link between the killer and the victim and accordingly there is no motive in the popular understanding of the word. Nevertheless, it must be stated that the Garda's success in solving these crimes has been conspicuous by its absence.  A number of factors contribute to this problem.</P>
    <P>Garda management style is notable for its lack of consultation.  The vast majority of the Force now regard the five year corporate plan as an unmitigated disaster.  The abolition of specialist units whithin the Garda without consultation has proved to be a catastrophic blunder.  Detection of contract killing requires a particular type of expertise which, in my opinion, can only come with the re-establishment of something <Col N="1693" /> along the lines of the now abolished murder squad.</P>
    <P>All promotional decisions within the Garda up to the rank of assistant commissioner are made by senior officers. No outside agency is involved.  This has led in many instances to a situation where promotional opportunities are denied to those skilled in the art of detection and the Garda's overall competance in crime detection has been badly compromised as a result.</P>
    <P>The victims of contract killings are often people who have been involved in crime themselves.  This has resulted in a tendency to send out a subliminal message to the public that it should not be as concerned about those killings as it might be about others.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There is no room for complacency about murder.  The greater tendency to resort to murder inevitably endangers us all.</P>
    <P>I am waiting with bated breath to hear the Government's response.  Can the Minister of State tell us when will it be likely that some people will be apprehended, brought before the courts and charged with some of those contract killings which remain undetected, in some cases for a number of years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure the House that all murders are fully investigated by the Garda and that every effort is made to bring the perpetrators to justice.  In this regard, the Garda allocate optimum resources to the investigation of all murders. The primary task, of course, is to identify those responsible and to assemble evidence to support the institution of legal proceedings.  In addition, special attention is also directed to the motivation involved, either directly or indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Crimes of this nature are investigated by divisional investigation teams, the membership of which includes detective gardaí who have been trained in the investigation of serious crime.  The gardaí involved in these investigations <Col N="1694" /> know the local community and they work in close proximity to sources of intelligence.  The divisional investigation teams are assisted by gardaí from the Garda Technical Bureau which provides specialised services, such as ballistics, photography and fingerprints.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing assistance to the divisional units, the serious crime squad at the central detective unit has the task of gathering intelligence and information on all serious crime.  Every effort is made in the examination and collation of this material to establish if the crimes are linked in any way.  This includes, in the case of murder, trying to establish if there is a common perpetrator for two or more offences.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that maximum resources are deployed to solve all murder cases including the identification of possible so-called contract killers.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this issue.</P>
      <P>Recent disclosures have caused us all to revisit and question, with extreme regret, remorse and anger, the conditions under which children in care were placed during the 1950s.  These were all vulnerable children who, for various reasons, found themselves out of home and reliant on whatever care the State could provide, with the assistance of religious orders.  As well as accountability for the past, it is vital that we critically evaluate on an ongoing basis the welfare of vulnerable children today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the week in which the Goldenbridge disclosures were made, Focus Point, the charity dealing with homeless people generally, came in contact with children as young as 12 years of age living rough on the streets and presenting as homeless to the authorities.  The most <Col N="1695" /> recent official figures from the Eastern Health Board for 1993 indicate that there were 427 homeless children in its area.  Of those, two-thirds were between 13 and 16 years of age.  It is important that we got more up to date figures so we can respond in policy terms to this need.</P>
    <P>Of those 427 homeless children identified in 1993 by the Eastern Health Board area alone, 42 per cent had formerly been in care.  There is something radically wrong with a care system which produces homeless children. Focus Point outreach workers, as recently as February of this year, met 33 different children out of home and sleeping rough in cars, derelict buildings or anywhere they could find.  In 1994, Focus Point street workers met 531 individuals, three-quarters of whom were male; 38 per cent were children under 18 years of age &mdash; from 12 to 17 years of age &mdash; and 20 per cent were sleeping rough.</P>
    <P>The possibility that some of these children are involved in prostitution is too terrible to contemplate.  That adults could target, seek out and prey on such vulnerable young people, taking advantage of their desperation with a view to gratifying their own sexual needs, is truly abhorrent.  What is the extent of the Department of Justice and Garda knowledge of the involvement of minors in prostitution?  How many reports have been received by the Garda or the health boards of such activities?  Are reports in a Sunday newspaper true, for example, that the names and car registration of persons alleged to be involved in such activities have been given to the Garda in the north inner city?  Is there an investigation into this matter?  What is the health board's involvement to date given that reports have been made to it by child care workers?</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, introduced tough penalties <Col N="1696" /> for controlling or organising prostitution or forcing or coercing a person into prostitution.  In April 1994, I took the opportunity to raise my concerns about gross acts of indecency involving minors.  I was assured an investigation was ongoing on foot of my inquiries. Under the 1993 Act, the act of buggery of a person under 15 years of age carries a life sentence and there are penalties in section 9 of that Act for the organisation of prostitution.  A conviction on indictment under section 9 carries a heavy fine, a term of imprisonment or both.  The law is in place to take action against these people organising prostitution, particularly as it relates to children. Is the Act being implemented and, if not, why not?</P>
    <P>When children are involved in prostitution there is obviously a double imperative to implement the law to protect the vulnerable child.  In 1993, in line with the Law Reform Commission report on vagrancy and related offences, the Dáil decided to include section 7 of the Act which makes it an offence for soliciting in public for the purposes of prostitution; this applies to clients, pimps and prostitutes.  Between the time of the introduction of the Act and December 1994, only 12 men were prosecuted compared to 116 women.  The women involved and not their clients are being prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Is it true, as reported in one of the Sunday newspapers, that the Garda has been given details of a person suspected to be involved in organising prostitution involving minors in the north inner city? If so, what is the status of the investigation arising out of these reports and has a file been sent to the DPP?  Will the Minister confirm that this is being investigated?</P>
    <P>Child care workers say that in a very short period, a newly homeless child will become immersed in a street culture which will expose him or her to drugs, sexual exploitation, crime and, in some cases, prostitution.  This requires an <Col N="1697" /> urgent response.  More Outreach workers are needed; I understand the Eastern Health Board has five Outreach workers in its area.  Three people from Focus Point do similar work.  These is a need for safe places which are childcentred to meet the needs of these homeless children.</P>
    <P>The Garda must investigate this matter urgently.  There is much hand wringing and procrastination about mandatory reporting but this is not about a failure to report.  In this instance, it is said that reports have been made to the authorities.  What is needed is mandatory action as a result of those reports. Action in this matter cannot morally be postponed.  The thought that advantage is being taken of young people in an alleged drugged state by sexually perverted adults is a nightmare.  The possibility that it could be happening tonight as we speak is intolerable.  I ask the Minister to seek a full report from the Eastern Health Board and the Garda Síochána as to the allegations which were made surrounding a person in the north inner city who is alleged to be involved in child prostitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, contains a comprehensive statutory framework for the development of services and supports for the care and protection of children.  To date, 61 of the 79 provisions of the Act are in operation and the Government has committed itself to the implementation of the Act in its entirety by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In particular, section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991, places a statutory duty on health boards to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and requires that they provide a range of child care and family support services.  This section applies also to promoting the safety and welfare of children who are exploited in the area of child prostitution, pornography and sex tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> Since 1993, in the region of £35 million on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of new child care and family support services, and a range of new services and facilities have been put in place throughout the country.  Over 850 new permanent posts have been created for the child care services.  These measures represent the largest ever investment of resources in the child care area.  The important new child care and family support services that have been developed are designed to ensure the child protection services are strengthened and equipped to respond to the needs of children who are not receiving adequate care and prevention; counselling and treatment is provided for those who have been damaged by abuse and neglect, special therapeutic care is provided for those who have been damaged by abuse and neglect and locally based services are in place to assist children and families in difficulty.</P>
    <P>While the Garda has no evidence which would suggest vulnerable children are falling victim to prostitution or organised sexual abuse, I can assure the House that any information in this regard which comes to their attention is acted upon and investigated fully.  The Deputy stated that it is said that these things are happening.  The Deputy, or anybody else, has a responsibility to make any hard evidence available to gardaí who will act on definite information. What we have heard tonight is a report of other reports.  If there is evidence, the Garda will act firmly on what could be an appalling crime.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cecilia Keaveney gave notice of her intention to raise the following matter: the need to categorise fishing co-operatives as small and medium enterprises for the purpose of soft loan finance.  I take this <Col N="1699" /> opportunity to congratulate her on the occasion of her maiden speech in Dáil Éireann.  I have no doubt that it will be the first of many contributions she will make in this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to raise this matter which relates to allowing the fishing co-operatives access to the Government's affordable loan finance programme.</P>
      <P>There is an anomaly in the regulations for the programmes and as a result fishing co-operatives appear to be excluded.  The fishing industry also appears to be excluded from participation in the subsidised loans schemes for Border counties from the European Union.  There can be no doubt that the two soft loan schemes introduced in response to the Task Force on Small Business have had a major impact on the overall ability of asset backed small companies to secure affordable longer-term finance.  However, for some bizarre reason fishing co-operatives and those running fishing enterprises have not had access to these funds.</P>
      <P>This represents a discrimination against a sector that has much to contribute in terms of enterprise and jobs. Fishing is a major business and its role should be recognised; for example, it is the biggest enterprise in County Donegal. Fishing is also a sector that is under intense competition and, therefore, needs a modern fleet.  The failure to allow fishermen to have access to the funds appears to go against the spirit of the Government programme which gives a commitment to improve fishermen's working conditions and safety by reducing the age of the offshore and inshore fleets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dangers of fishing are well known as we have found to our cost in Donegal. Fishing is considered to be ten times more dangerous than mining.  This underlines the importance of the renewal of the fleet.  At present much of <Col N="1700" /> the fleet is very old.  According to the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, the average age of a vessel in the Irish dimersal fleet in 1990 was estimated to be about 30 years old but many boats are up to 50 years old.  No new vessels have been built since then; in fact, vessels of this kind stopped being built in the early 1980s.  What is now approaching is a situation where the older boats are being decommissioned, they are being left in port and we are losing out.</P>
    <P>A 1992 socio-economic study on the fisheries sector said that, given the average age of the Irish fleet, most vessels are able to pay their way but few are returning sufficient profits to facilitate vessel replacement.  This emphasises the importance for fishing co-operatives and fishermen to have access to affordable loan finance.  If they do not, the fleet will continue to disintegrate.  It will also be unable to meet the challenge of other EU countries, with Spain for example, currently rebuilding its total fleet.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry must compete or die.  As somebody who comes from County Donegal, where the ports of Greencastle and Killybegs play such an important role, I am not willing to allow the fishing industry to go into decline.  If the fleet goes, with it goes schools, shops, services and, indeed, life itself in depopulated rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister of State to extend the affordable loan finance programme to fishing co-ops.  I also ask him, in conjunction with his Government colleague, the Minister for the Marine, to consider a special, separate fund for fishermen and fishing co-ops the next time a fund is announced.  This would reap dividends for the economy and would be a wise and welcome development.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are not looking for charity. They are looking for recognition as small and medium enterprises, and to <Col N="1701" /> have the same access as other firms in the sector to affordable loan finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear Deputy Keaveney make such an eloquent maiden speech on behalf of her constituents and of an important industry for her area.</P>
      <P>To take up her point about fishing safety, the Health and Safety Authority is within my brief and we have paid particular attention to safety in the fishing industry.  We are concerned about the appalling loss of life experienced in the industry, especially within the last year. I have visited fishermen's wives in Donegal and launched an exhibition on fishing safety.  A task force within the Authorty has been appointed to concentrate on this area and, in conjunction with fishing representatives, it is examining what constructive steps we can take together to reduce the toll of death and injury.</P>
      <P>The subject of the Adjournment debate is access to the finance scheme, the primary measure of the small business operational programme launched in September 1996.  The scheme provides a total fund of £208 million with a subsidised interest rate of 6.5 per cent fixed for a period of seven years.  It is being administered by four commercial banks &mdash; AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and National Irish Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is a unique partnership between the European Community, the participating banks and the Exchequer. The subsidy on the loans is carried by the European Commission as part of its contribution to the operational programme under the European Regional Development Fund, by the Exchequer and by the four participating banks.  The banks carry all the risk associated with the loans, which are appraised by the banks in accordance with normal commercial banking criteria.  The banks also <Col N="1702" /> carry almost 50 per cent of the cost of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme is to improve the access of small business to finance and credit and to address the key borrowing needs of small business by providing low cost funds with certainty in relation to repayments and simplicity in administration.  The scheme is intended to be as broadly based as possible; accordingly, with the exception of sectors specifically regulated by the EU to which special conditions apply, the scheme is available to all types of non-agricultural small business in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards categorising fishing co-operatives as small or medium enterprises, the scheme is aimed at small businesses which are defined as enterprises which employ 50 or fewer employees or have a turnover less than £3 million or, where the businesses are part of a group structure, the total employment of the group does not exceed 150.  Consequently, fishing co-operatives which come within the scope of that definition would be eligible under the scheme provided certain additional criteria are met.</P>
    <P>In regard to these additional criteria it is relevant to mention that the access to the finance scheme constitutes a State aid and consequently it had to be notified to the Commission of the European Communities for approval as part of the operational programme for small business. The scheme was duly approved by the Commission with the inclusion of a number of conditions relating to Community policy and sensitive sectors.  For example, the Community contribution for the scheme under the European Regional Development Fund cannot be used to fund investments falling within the exclusive remit of the FEOGA fund under Regulation 866/90 and the granting of loans to the agricultural food sector is subject to the prior certification of the Department of Agriculture, Food <Col N="1703" /> and Forestry, so that the selection criteria specified in Regulation 866/90 are met.</P>
    <P>In the case of the marine food sector, discussions took place between officials of my Department, the Department of the Marine and the Commission to establish working arrangements to ensure appropriate access of the sector to the scheme while fully respecting Community policies.  These discussions led to an agreement that each application for a loan relating to the marine food sector must be certified by the Department of the Marine as complying with the general provisions for fisheries set out in the Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994 to 1999. <Col N="1704" /> That Department must also improve the investment and inform the monitoring committee for fisheries of the investment to ensure a comprehensive and integrated approach to fisheries investments and their subsequent evaluation. This certification is carried out by the aquaculture division and sea fisheries division of the Department of the Marine as appropriate.  It does not in any way guarantee that a project will qualify for a loan under the scheme as the banks are required to apply normal commercial criteria to each project before approval can be given.  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 May 1996.</P>

      <P>The Customs Service has primary responsibility for preventing the illegal importation of controlled drugs at air and sea ports and other entry points to the State.  In the Single Market era, the Customs Service is required to play an increased role in protecting not only our own frontier, but also the Irish section <Col N="1441" /> of the external EU frontier against the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on a number of occasions, the Revenue Commissioners responded to that situation by allocating substantial resources to this area, in particular by setting up the Customs National Drugs Team (the CNDT), comprising over 70 staff, with specific responsibility for detecting and preventing drug smuggling.  This specialist team operates on a countrywide basis, including at air and sea ports, and it also supplements the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for combating drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
      <P>The Customs Service has succeeded in making many substantial seizures of illegal drugs over the past number of years.  The street value of seizures made since 1993 comes to some £60 million. The majority of these seizures involved cannabis resin, but quantities of other illegal drugs, including cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, etc. have also been seized.</P>
      <P>Drug smugglers detained by Customs are turned over by them to the Garda. Since 1993, a total of 22 persons detained by Customs and transferred to Garda custody have been successfully prosecuted and sentenced to jail terms ranging from two to ten years.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question concerns whether plans may be put in place to cater for the possibility that a majority of member states fail to meet <Col N="1442" /> the criteria for moving to Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the Treaty on European Union provides that not later than 31 December 1996, the European Council will decide whether a majority of member states meet the conditions for moving to Economic and Monetary Union, whether it is appropriate for the Community to move to Economic and Monetary Union and if so, to set the date for Economic and Monetary Union to begin.  The Treaty further provides that if by the end of 1997 no date has been set for Economic and Monetary Union to begin, it will begin on 1 January 1999. The Treaty does not require that a majority, or indeed any specific number of member states meet the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union to begin on 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>It was already clear at the time of the Madrid European Council last December that a majority of member states would not meet the criteria when the position fell to be examined later this year, thus precluding an early start to Economic and Monetary Union. Accordingly, the European Council confirmed then that Economic and Monetary Union would begin on 1 January 1999.</P>

      <P>The number of direct jobs created in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in 1995 is estimated at about 600.  In addition, there are a substantial number of indirect jobs in associated legal, accounting and other services such as software development which provide essential support to companies <Col N="1443" /> located in the centre.  It is not possible to accurately quantify this employment. At the end of 1995, there were over 100 people employed at the IFSC in retail and catering activities, as well as in the areas of security and cleaning.  There is of course also substantial construction employment on the site at present.</P>
      <P>In regard to the further development of secondary employment relating to the centre, the Deputy may be aware that the Taoiseach recently launched a new IDA Ireland marketing initiative which aims to get IFSC companies to extend their operations in Ireland through the creation of a shared services centre or back office.

      <P>The question of introducing a tax credit system has been considered over the years.  In looking at possible options in the area of taxation it is important that there should be no confusion between the underlying policy considerations, such as equity, progressivity or efficiency, and the essentially administrative issue of how best to realise these in practical terms.  Tax credits are simply an alternative means of pursuing goals which could equally be advanced within the framework of the present allowance system.  Thus, the same effect could be achieved by reducing the standard rate tax band by an amount equivalent to the relevant allowance.  The choice between a credits system and an allowance system should, therefore, rest on considerations of simplicity from the standpoint <Col N="1444" /> of taxpayers and the administation of the system by both employers and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of substituting tax credits for allowances, this would considerably increase the progressivity of the tax system in the absence of other changes.  The tax system is already quite progressive.  Moreover, without other changes in the tax system, it would bring about a situation where a greater proportion of income tax payers would be liable at higher rates.  I do not believe that this would be generally seen as an improvement in the income tax system. It would certainly run counter to the view that economic and employment objectives are likely to be best served by keeping marginal tax rates as low as possible.</P>

      <P>I regard the Act as a key statutory mechanism for delivering the highest standards of integrity and accountability in public office.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should also be aware of the range of related legislative measures being pursued by the Government. These measures include the Electoral Bill (1994), the Compellability, Privilege and Immunities of Witnesses Bill (which are currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas), the Freedom of Information Bill, which will be published in a few months' time, and the reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, which will clarify the respective roles and areas of responsibility of Minister and Departmental Secretaries, and which is being directed by the Advisory Group on Public Service Reform Legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When enacted, these measures will constitute a comprehensive legislative <Col N="1445" /> framework within which matters such as: the funding of political parties; greatly enhanced powers for Oireachtas committees and improved accountability in decision making, will be dealt with.  This Government has gone further than any of its predecessors in seeking to ensure that appropriate measures are in place so as to deliver the highest standards in public office.  The Ethics in Public Office Act, in conjunction with the comprehensive range of legislative initiatives outlined above will develop and enhance public confidence in our political and administrative systems, which is a prerequisite for a healthy and vibrant democracy.  If the Deputy has reasonable proposals which would further enhance these legislative measures I would be happy to consider them on their merits.</P>

      <P>The percentage of the combined income tax receipt in 1995 from the PAYE, farming and other self-employed sectors as contributed by each sector was 86.7 per cent from PAYE, 1.7 per cent from farmers and 11.6 per cent from other self-employed.  These figures do not take account of receipts of deposit interest retention tax for which a breakdown between particular classes of taxpayers cannot be ascertained.</P>
      <P>The figure for PAYE covers more than tax on wages and salaries.  For example, tax paid by directors of close companies is included, as is the tax on other income of employees such as rent and other investment income.  After adjusting for these factors, tax on wages and salaries normally represents about 68 per cent of the take from income tax, excluding deposit interest retention tax. The figure for PAYE also includes the tax paid on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
      <P>The figure for other self-employed includes tax paid on income from trades and professions other than farming, together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes withholding tax on professional fees.  The yield in 1995 from this sector was reduced by approximately £52 million as a result of implementing a High Court ruling to the effect that withholding tax on professional fees should be allowable as a credit against income tax liability on a current year basis.</P>
      <P>The percentage figures given must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in each of the sectors mentioned, which are estimated for the income tax year 1995-96 to be 864,000 in PAYE, 31,000 farmers and 94,000 other self-employed.</P>

      <P>I would like to point to a number of initiatives in this area.  Last year, I introduced the £1,000 scrap car scheme which has been very successful in removing older, more polluting cars, from roads and replacing them with new less polluting ones.  I am also providing in this year's Finance Bill for the ending of the application of the favourable unleaded petrol excise rate to superplus unleaded petrol and making it subject to the same excise rate as leaded petrol. Furthermore, in my Budget Statement I indicated that the tax system can clearly play a key role in environmental policy and in eliminating activities which destroy our environment and deplete natural resources.  I have therefore directed my Department, in conjunction with other relevant Departments and Agencies, to examine the strategic impact of taxation on environmental policy and to bring forward specific tax measures for the 1997 budget which will have due regard to competitiveness considerations and work in this regard is continuing.</P>
      <P>EU and other Treaty obligations have a bearing on the scope for future action here.  Imports cannot be singled out for taxation as against domestically produced products.  Obligations arising from EU membership prohibiting discriminatory tax treatment against imports must be respected, as must obligations arising from Ireland's membership of the World Trade Organisation. EU Directive obligations relating to Excise and VAT may also impose constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the creation of the Single Market, the use of frontier controls to policy tax measures has been eliminated.  If tax rates for products are substantially <Col N="1448" /> higher in Ireland than those in neighbouring states, recourse to personal importation on a wide scale may arise and this also acts as a constraint on the freedom of action.  The working group will undoubtedly have to have regard to this in its deliberations as well as having to examine carefully the impact on competitiveness of any measures being considered for introduction.</P>
    <P>At the EU level, the ECOFIN Council recently requested the EU Commission to bring forward revised proposals dealing with carbon/energy taxation; it is expected that these will be presented by the Commission later in the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of this review a number of meetings were held between the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of the sheriffs.

In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have submitted to my Department their proposals on revision of the remuneration of the sheriffs for Revenue work.

      <P>I have read the document to which the Deputy refers, and find that the overall tenor of the report does not support this interpretation.  On the contrary, the analysis acknowledges that &ldquo;...the 1995 budget targets have been comfortably met&rdquo;, that the &ldquo;cautious&rdquo; 1996 budget &ldquo;reflects a determination to contain public spending and maintain fiscal discipline in the run-up to European Monetary Union&rdquo;, and that strong economic growth indicates that &ldquo;job creation will remain high&rdquo;.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that this Government will continue to pursue fiscal policies which will <Col N="1450" /> ensure that Ireland maintains its adherence to the Maastricht fiscal criteria. Our general government deficit has been kept well below the 3 per cent limit since 1988.  Our debt to GDP ratio has been reduced from 116 per cent at end-1987 to 85.4 per cent at end-1995 and will fall further to a projected 81.2 per cent at end-1996.</P>

      <P>However, as I have already stated in reply to previous questions on the matter, these costings were, of necessity, very tentative.  The decision taken by the Government in regard to funding is clearly set out by the Minister for Education in her foreward to the White Paper which states that the amount of funding which can be made available in any year will be a matter for the Government to determine in the context of its budgetary position, having regard to the Maastricht Treaty convergence criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In autumn last year.  Germany tabled proposals for a &ldquo;Stability Pact&rdquo; between member states participating in European Monetary Union.  The proposals were aimed at ensuring that strict budgetary discipline is maintained after the formation of European Monetary Union.  The rationale behind the key proposals was that in favourable economic periods, member states should aim for budget deficits considerably lower than the 3 per cent of GDP reference value in the Treaty on European Union, <Col N="1453" /> in order to ensure that deficits do not exceed 3 per cent even in unfavourable economic circumstances.  The Stability Pact, as proposed, by Germany, included proposals for financial penalties to be applied to a member state which breached the 3 per cent figure in the planning or implementation of its budget.</P>
      <P>The German proposals for the most part give substance to existing general provisions in the Treaty aimed at ensuring fiscal discipline and close co-ordination of economic policies by member states.  Work is ongoing to determine the extent to which the substance of the German proposals can be accommodated within the Treaty.  Article 104c of the Treaty provides for an annual examination of each member state to see if it meets the deficit rules laid down in the Treaty and for penalties where a member state in breach of them persists in failing to take corrective measures. These penalties include inviting the European Investment Bank to consider its lending policy to the member state concerned, requiring the member state to make a non-interest-bearing deposit with the Community until the excessive deficit situation is remedied and imposing fines of an appropriate size. Article 103 requires member states to pursue economic policies as a matter of common concern, requires the Council to set out broad economic guidelines for the economic policies of the member states and the Community, and provides for multilateral surveillance by the Council of economic developments in member states in order to ensure sustained convergence of economic performances.</P>
      <P>The Madrid European Council in December examined the Stability Pact proposals and noted the European Commission's intention to present, in 1996, its conclusions on ways to secure budgetary discipline and co-ordination in European Monetary Union in accordance with the procedures and principles of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Verona there was broad agreement that member states will have to <Col N="1454" /> operate below the 3 per cent reference value in normal economic conditions in order to allow a sufficient margin against the possibility of an economic downturn, and that member states should, therefore, aim for a medium-term orientation of fiscal positions well below 3 per cent.  Ministers also agreed that a deficit orientation would be sufficient and there was no need to specify a debt value stricter than that already provided in the Treaty.  Finally, most member states, including Ireland, were agreed that the proposed Stability Pact, including possible sanctions for breach of the Treaty excessive deficit procedure should be concluded within the provisions of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Further work is now being carried out at official level.  Essentially this work will concentrate on to what extent the existing multilateral surveillance mechanisms should be strengthened in order to ensure that member states remain below the 3 per cent reference value in the Treaty during all stages of a normal economic cycle and to identify risks to this target at an early stage so that preventative action can be taken; and on making clear how and in what circumstances the sanctions provided for in the Treaty should be applied, so that these matters are as far as possible settled in advance of particular cases arising.  It is envisaged that progress will be reviewed again by EU Finance Ministers prior to the Florence European Council in June.</P>

      <P>A total of £16.246 million provided in the 1996 Votes of Government Departments and Offices in respect of the costs of holding the EU Presidency this year. This represents the estimated costs of ensuring an efficient discharge of the additional functions and responsibilities arising from EU Presidency.</P>
      <P>As with all public expenditure my Department has an ongoing role in monitoring this expenditure.  To facilitate monitoring, where the Department or Office has such an EU Presidency allocation, it is &ldquo;ring fenced&rdquo; and identified separately in the published 1996 Revised Estimates for Public Services. Expenditure is monitored on the basis of monthly returns from Departments and Offices to the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The current system of lobbying is unsatisfactory as most submissions simply state a list of measures which are devised by their organisation without any view on the overall budgetary impact of proposals.  It was for this reason that I announced in my budget speech that all submissions should in future be made to the Finance and General Affairs Committee.  That committee will evaluate the contents of such submissions, will meet with representative groups and will submit a report to me with their recommendations.</P>
      <P>The revised procedure will allow for much more in-depth, open and public consideration of proposals from interest groups.  The recommendations arising from this consultation process would constitute a valuable contribution to the way in which budgetary proposals are formulated.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the number of audits carried out by the Revenue Commissioners under the various audit programmes.</P>
      <P>In 1995, about 23,000 audits were completed under the various tax audit programmes.  This represents a coverage of approximately 8 per cent of the taxpayer base.  This level of audit coverage compares favourably with the level of audits carried out in other tax administrations which have self-assessment systems.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of Revenue audits are targeted audits.  This means that most cases are chosen for audit following a risk analysis which may suggest the possibility of incorrect returns for any of the taxes.  Selection of cases on this basis has proved to be successful.  It is also less intrusive on the complying taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The direct yield from audits has risen from £106 million in 1992 to £138 million in 1995.  However, it should be borne in mind that the overall yield from audit programmes does not consist only of the amounts recovered directly from audits. There is also a much greater indirect yield from taxpayers who file more accurate returns due to their perception of the risk of detection of tax evasion and the consequential cost in terms of additional tax, interest and penalties. The indications are that this strategy is successful.  The Revenue is also satisfied from its records and from its interaction with taxpayers, business groups and tax advisors that there is a strong awareness of the risk which Revenue audit poses to the non-complying taxpayer.  The growing knowledge of Revenue auditors of specific businesses and the practices within particular sectors, which comes partly from the specialisation in different economic sectors, is underpinning the improving detection rate and supporting the general perception of Revenue's ability to identify tax evasion.</P>

      <P>The general position which applies, under statute, in relation to the remuneration of chief executives of State bodies is that it is determined by the relevant board with the approval of the Minister directly concerned and the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>With a few approved exceptions, the authorised rates of remuneration are those recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  These rates are recommended by the review body on the general basis that they cover salary and all other benefits, apart from superannuation and expenses arrangements approximating to those applying in the Civil Service, and that if additional benefits are provided the recommended rate should be reduced by the value of those benefits.  That is the basis on which the recommended rates have been accepted by the Government and approved for implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of the approved arrangements is a matter for each chairperson and each board.  In guidelines for State bodies issued by my Department in March 1992, chairpersons were reminded that they are required to implement Government policy in relation to the remuneration of chief executives and that the arrangements made cover total remuneration. The guidelines also require each chairperson, when submitting the annual report and accounts to the relevant Minister, to submit a report which, among other things, affirms that the Government guidelines on the pay of <Col N="1460" /> chief executives are being complied with.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these procedures, if properly applied, would be adequate. I have, however, written to Ministers asking them to carry out an examination to ensure that the arrangements which actually apply at present in relation to the chief executives of State bodies for which they are responsible, are in line with these procedures.</P>

      <P>The function of the Board of Governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is to take the major decisions affecting the structure and operations of the bank.  For instance, the Board of Governors has recently decided on a capital increase, and in general it sets the overall direction of bank policy at the highest level.</P>
      <P>The day to day running of the bank, approval of projects and formulation of the bank's policies in particular areas is a function of the Board of Directors.</P>
      <P>The one task which will definitely fall to the Chairman of the Governors is the chairing of the bank's next Annual Meeting in London in April of next year and I look forward to this.</P>
      <P>As I have just taken up the appointment it would be premature to identify any specific proposal which I would initiate in the course of the year.  I intend, in my capacity as chairman, to emphasise the compelling need to advance the economic development of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are the EBRD's area of operation.  I will make it my business to support the Bank's current policy of assessing programmes and projects by reference to the contribution they can make to the process of transition from command economy to market economy, while observing scrupulously the requirements of sound banking practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> I will be reinforced in my capacity to promote the economic development and integration of our Eastern neighbours in the second half of this year when Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union and I will be President of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers.  The progressive integration of the Central and Eastern European countries into the global economy is in the interests not only of those countries themselves, but also of the European Union and the international community.</P>
    <P>In response to the last element of the Deputy's question, I envisage that the implications for Ireland of the work of the EBRD will be indirect &mdash; through the gradual rise in prosperity and trade which the transition process should generate. I feel that my election as chairman of the Governors for the coming year is a reflection of the esteem in which Ireland is held in the international community and I would expect that it would lead to a higher profile for the Bank in Ireland.  This in turn may make Irish business more aware of the many opportunities the bank offers to make a worth-while contribution to the transition process.</P>

      <P>In last year's budget I announced a new scheme of relief for traditional seaside resorts.  This pilot scheme came into effect last July for a three year period. The scheme is in operation in 15 seaside towns around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this scheme is of a pilot nature, it will be important that we learn from experiences of the 15 designated pilot resort areas.  At preent both officials <Col N="1464" /> from my Department and the Department of Tourism and Trade are monitoring the progress of the scheme and I understand that the Department of Tourism and Trade has written to the regional tourism organisations and Shannon Development requesting a report on developments under the scheme and its impact on the designated areas.  However, given the tax based nature of the scheme and the normal lead in time for capital projects it is difficult to assess the level of activity which is currently under way.</P>
    <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to what the Minister for Tourism and Trade said when questioned recently on this subject in the Dáil.  Minister Kenny indicated that he would be positively disposed towards giving the Government a progress report on the scheme at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's second point, since the passing of the 1995 Finance Act, there have been numerous requests to extend the scheme to additional towns and, in certain cases, to enlarge areas where the incentives already apply.  However, as I said on many occasions in the past until the expereince from this pilot scheme can be thoroughly assessed, I have no plans to broaden in any way the current scheme.  Requests for inclusion in the scheme on behalf of other towns will be considered, if and when the scheme is being extended beyond the present three year period.</P>

      <P>It would not be possible under EU law to accede to the Deputy's requsst to remove excise duty on the negligible amount of wine produced in the country without also reducing the excise duty on all wine imported into the State.  While it would be theoretically possible to introduce a zero rate of duty for all wine sold in Ireland, such an excise reduction would favour in the main, a non-domestically produced product.  It would result in turn in significant pressure to reduce the excise duty on beer and spirits, which are domestically produced alcoholic drinks.  I am not prepared to do this, not least because it would have significant negative effects on Exchequer revenue from alcohol amounting to several hundred million pounds.  The Exchequer receipts from wine alone in 1995 were £49 million, or 10 per cent of total excise revenue from beer, wine and spirits together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main obligation on any Presidency is to ensure an efficient, effective and impartial approach to the discharge of the business of the European Union and this is a primary objective for our Presidency planning.  Those issues which will be priorities for the European Union and for Ireland during our Presidency are set out in the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  They are likely to include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Intergovernmental Conference to review aspects of the EU Treaties,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" />&mdash;preparations for the Third Stage of European Monetary Union,</P>
    <P>&mdash;growth, competitiveness, employment and social inclusion,</P>
    <P>&mdash;agreement on the draft Union budget for 1997,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Third Pillar issues such as drugs, immigration, extradition and organised crime,</P>
    <P>&mdash;implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy,</P>
    <P>&mdash;furthering developing relations between the EU and the applicant countries in preparation for future enlargement of the Union, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the continuing development of relations with other countries and regions outside the Union.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference will be a major priority for the Irish Presidency and we will seek to advance its work as expeditiously and constructively as possible.</P>
    <P>Ensuring that preparations for the move to the Third Stage of Economic and Monetary Union proceed as efficiently as possible will be another priority for our Presidency.  Attention to the technical work required for the introduction of the Euro will be necessary. The Irish Presidency will focus also on issues such as the relationship between participants and non-participants in the Third Stage.</P>
    <P>The principal economic challenge for the Union and its member states is to address the unacceptable level of unemployment in the EU.  We will work during our Presidency to ensure that employment remains high on the Union's agenda.  The Dublin European Council in December 1996 will review the effectiveness of the programmes of action, co-ordinated at Union level and designed to make significant inroads into structural unemployment, as well as looking at the effectiveness of member states policies in this area.  A feature of our European Council will be the presentation of the Second Annual Report <Col N="1469" /> on Employment.  The question of competitiveness will be actively pursued in the Council with a view to the presentation of a report to the Dublin European Council.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the work of the Irish Presidency will be the finalisation, on the basis of the Commission's draft budget and with the full collaboration of the other arm of the Budgetary authority, the European Parliament, of the Union budget for 1997.</P>
    <P>The Union's policies must be designed to respond &mdash; and be perceived to respond &mdash; to real public concerns. Among the issues which most concern the citizens of the Union are those within the Justice and Home Affairs area, for example the prevention of terrorism, of drug smuggling and of international organised crime.  Ireland looks forward during its Presidency to assisting in the development of a Union programme for action on drugs, as mandated by the Madrid European Council. We will seek to advance also the work of the Union in the areas of judicial co-operation, immigration and asylum, external borders, racism and xenophobia, and organised crime.  Ireland will be looking also to streamline the decision making process in the Justice and Home Affairs area.  It is hoped that the Intergovernmental Conference will assist in this process.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency, in common with every other Presidency, will seek to manage the Union's extensive external relations agenda efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>Issues arising from developments in former Yugoslavia and in the Middle East are likely to remain priorities during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>The Union's relations with its eastern neighbours will continue to influence the development of the Union over the next few years.  The enlargement of the Union to include Cyprus, Malta and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will bring new challenges to bear on the Union, its member states and the applicant countries.  Ireland's <Col N="1470" /> Presidency will seek to advance preparations for the enlargement of the Union.</P>
    <P>Other matters which will be important items on Ireland's Presidency agenda include continuing the implementation of the EU-US Action Plan, developing the Union's relations with Canada, strengthening its relations with Russia and with the independent states of the former Soviet Union and followup to the Barcelona Conference on enhanced EU-Mediterranean relations.</P>
    <P>The production of a programme for the Presidency is well in hand and will be finalised in the light of the work done under the current Italian Presidency. This programme will include a detailed itemisation of the work which Ireland will seek to advance during its Presidency term involving the full range of Council formations.  The Presidency is obliged to place its Programme before the institutions of the Union early in July and it will be circulated to Deputies at that time.  In addition, and in advance of the finalisation of the Presidency Programme, the Taoiseach has indicated that the Dáil will have the opportunity to debate the Presidency in June.</P>

      <P>Severe snowstorms and record low temperatures during the month of February have resulted in loss of life in the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Quanghai and in Tibet.

In some areas over 40 per <Col N="1471" /> cent of livestock, the main source of income and food has been lost.</P>
      <P>According to the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs, disaster relief efforts by Government Departments and local authorities proceeded rapidly and they have delivered clothing, medicine, food and fuel to the population in the worst affected Provinces.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Government has indicated it would welcome international assistance for the snow-stricken areas. My Department is currently engaged in discussions with the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs with a view to making a contribution to the relief efforts in the region.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to the Chinese authorities concerning Gedun Choekyi Nyima, the six year old boy who is the Dalai Lama's choice as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, and the Abbot of Tashilhunpo Monastery, Chadrel Rinpoche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During their visit to China from 22 to 24 January 1996, the EU Troika Delegation on Human Rights, on which Ireland was represented, raised the question of the dispute over the selection of the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama between the Dalai Lama and the Central Government, with a view to seeing whether the wishes of the Tibetan people might be respected.  The <Col N="1472" /> EU Troika also inquired about the well-being of Gedun Choekyi Nyima and the Abbot of Tashilhunpo.</P>
    <P>In their response, the Chinese authorities blamed the Dalai Lama for allegedly sabotaging the proper procedure for the selection, which involved the approval of the Central Government. They said that the boy was in very good shape physically and was leading a healthy, normal life.  However, they were unfortunately not able to disclose his whereabouts or that of the Abbot of Tashilhunpo Monastery, who it was said had been taken ill in May 1995 en route from Beijing to Tibet and was still hospitalised.</P>
    <P>The EU Troika also raised the issue with the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Li Zhaoxing.</P>
    <P>The responses from the Chinese authorities can hardly be considered satisfactory. Ireland, with her EU partners, will continue to follow this matter closely and will seek to ensure that the Chinese authorities are kept fully aware of our concerns.</P>

      <P>The new renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts commenced on 1 July last for a three year period.  The purpose of the scheme is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in a certain limited number of seaside resorts.</P>
      <P>I stress that this new initiative is a pilot scheme and is thus of an experimental nature.  It must, therefore, be applied on a limited basis in order to evaluate its efficacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection of the 15 towns was made in order to give an even spread around the coast of designated resort areas.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it <Col N="1473" /> is not possible to designate every area of the coast for the purposes of this pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>Until this pilot scheme is firmly established it would be inappropriate to consider the designation of any further towns.  Consequently, I have no plans to extend the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the introduction of divided relief for small companies would be justified in the circumstances. Previous experience with this type of relief has shown that it is of limited value in generating additional equity investment, that it is prone to widespread abuse and that, at best, anti-avoidance safeguards may only be partially effective.  Also, the provision of dividend relief, even on a restricted basis, could be very costly.  Revenue estimate that the introduction of relief for the small business sector would cost a minimum £10 million in a full year, but the cost could be substantially higher owing to the scope it would provide for tax avoidance on a wide scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards relief in respect of dividends paid out of patent royalty income, Deputies will be aware that the Finance Bill currently before the House amends the rules governing this relief.  The amendments are being introduced to curtail abuses of the relief within the manufacturing sector.  The aim is to <Col N="1474" /> refocus the relief on the area for which it was originally intended viz. genuine innovation and inventiveness.  The Finance Bill provisions will apply only in respect of royalty payments between connected parties.  In such circumstances, taxpayers will be entitled to claim dividend relief by reference to the level of group R &amp; D expenditure in a three year period.  Alternatively, they will be entitled to unlimited dividend relief where they satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant invention involved a radical innovation and was patented for bona fide commercial reasons rather than primarily for the purpose of avoiding tax.  The provisions are reasonable and I see no need for a special exemption for particular types of firms.</P>
    <P>A wide range of tax incentives have been introduced in recent years for equity investment and enterprise development in the small business sector. Among the measures included in this year's Finance Bill are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the renewal of the business expansion scheme with a rebalancing of the scheme in favour of small business and employment creation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a broadening of the 27 per cent rate of capital gains tax on equity investment in SMEs,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a further increase (to 75 per cent) in the capital acquisitions tax relief on the transfer of a business, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;a reduced 30 per cent rate of corporation tax for the first £50,000 of annual company income.</P>

      <P>The joint Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme 1994-99 is the <Col N="1475" /> successor to the earlier programme which ran from 1991 to the end of 1993. The INTERREG programme is a multi-sectoral one with two major objectives; cross-Border co-operation and the economic regeneration of Border regions of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission approved an EU aid allocation to Ireland under the Programme of 89.5 MECU (approximately IR£72 million).  When Exchequer co-funding and funding from State agencies <Col N="1476" /> and the private sector is added, the total package for the Border counties amounts to nearly IR£115 million.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the programme grants are approved on the basis of projects submitted and funding is not determined on a county basis. However, the following tabular statement sets out the details of the projects funded, total cost and EC grant.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to an anomaly in section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, regarding rented residential accommodation which is discriminatory against widows in view of the fact that a section 23 property in the late husband's name passes exclusively to the widow for her maintenance within the ten years of life of the tax relief, with the relief being clawed back in the year of death; his views on whether this is an unintentional anomaly in view of the fact that, if the section 23 property is in the name of a wife and either spouse dies, no additional tax arises, as is the case if the section 23 property is in the name of the husband and the wife dies; his further views on whether the continuation of this anomaly could lead to the section 23 property being sold to pay the taxes at a time when, in many cases, a widow is most in need of relief; whether concessional relief is available; if so, the circumstances under which concessional relief is given; the plans, if any, he has to retrospectively amend this legislation or to arrange that a husband's death will be ignored for section 23 tax relief purposes when the death occurs before the expiry of the tax relief period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the difficulty to which the Deputy is referring can arise in certain circumstances upon the passing, on the death of the owner, of a section 23 property to the surviving spouse.  It arises only when the deceased person is the &ldquo;assessable person&rdquo; of a jointly assessed couple or where single treatment applies and does not reflect a different tax treatment for surviving husbands as against wives.  In saying that, I accept that since most married couples, who are jointly assessed, continue to opt for the husband as the &ldquo;assessable person&rdquo;, the tax charge is more likely, in practice, to affect the woman.</P>
      <P>Approaches have been made directly to the Revenue Commissioners on this issue and they are currently reviewing the position with a view to bringing forward proposals at an early date to eliminate the anomaly.</P>
      <P>In the interim, if the Deputy has concerns in relation to any particular case, the details should be made available to the Revenue Commissioners at Dublin Castle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of stamp duty on property transfers depend on the amount or value of the consideration paid for the property and range from 1 per cent to 6 per cent, and the 6 per cent rate applies to property over £60,000.</P>
      <P>As regards the effect of stamp duty on the purchase of second-hand houses, it is the case that house prices have been rising in some areas at a rate greater than inflation in recent years.  It is by no means certain, however, that a reduction in the rates of stamp duty would be passed on to the purchaser of a property, particularly in a buoyant property market.  The likelihood is that, in such circumstances, any reductions in stamp duty would accrue to those selling second-hand properties and would not benefit home buyers.</P>
      <P>I believe that the levels of stamp duty on the transfer of second-hand houses serve, to a very real extent, to protect the housing market against property speculation.  This is supported by commentators within the property market itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, there are a number of important reliefs and exemptions which are primarily aimed at assisting house buyers to purchase new homes.  There is a full exemption from stamp duty for transfers of new houses with a floor area below 125 square metres.  Transfer of new houses with a larger floor area attract stamp duty based only on the site value, subject to a minimum site value of one-quarter of the full house (plus site) value.  The targeting of these stamp duty reliefs in favour of new houses takes account, <i>inter alia,</i> of the fact that most new house sales are subject to VAT at 12.5 per cent, whereas sales of second-hand houses generally are not. There is also 100 per cent mortgage-interest tax relief for first-time buyers of both new and second-hand houses and a reduced rate of relief for other mortgage holders.  A generous £3,000 new <Col N="1486" /> house grant is also available for first-time buyers.  All these reliefs and exemptions help to moderate the cost of housing generally and also play an important role in promoting employment within the construction sector.</P>
    <P>In framing taxation policy, the Government must have regard to both the budgetary implications of changes to the tax code, and the possible effects of such changes on other aspects of Government policy.  As regards the present stamp duty code, I am very much aware of the substantial Exchequer yield from stamp duty on the transfer of property, including second-hand houses, which is estimated at £160 million this year.</P>
    <P>This is a large component of the overall capital taxes yield and makes a very significant contribution towards the cost of implementing the Government's important social and economic programme. Were the Exchequer yield from this stamp duty is to be reduced it would be necessary to bring in compensating measures elsewhere in the taxation code which could have a detrimental effect on the economic well-being of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some Irish firms are experiencing difficulties in their competitiveness as a result of movements in the exchange rate with the UK.  It is, however, a matter for each individual firm in the first instance to make the arrangements required to cope with the economic environment in which it finds <Col N="1487" /> itself.  Nevertheless, the Government has a key role in trying to ensure that this environment is as conducive as possible to economic activity.  The present environment is characterised by low inflation, moderate wage developments under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, interest rates which are well below UK levels, sound public finances and a strong balance of payments surplus.</P>
      <P>I would also point out to the Deputy that GNP growth is forecast at 5 per cent in 1996 following 7¼ per cent in 1995 and 7.4 per cent in 1994.  Employment is projected to expand by over 30,000 this year following an increase of 45,000 in 1995.  Thus, the environment the Government has created is demonstrably one conducive to output and employment growth.</P>
      <P>Central to the policy framework which has achieved this success is the Government's commitment to price stability &mdash; which is facilitated by exchange rate stability.  I would also point out to the Deputy that the fall in the value of sterling should be providing benefits to many businesses, in terms of lower input costs.</P>
      <P>The process of enchancing Irish competitiveness is ongoing and one on which the Government has always been working.  In the budget this year I reduced both the lower and standard rate of employers' PRSI.  Following the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax in the 1995 budget, I introduced a reduced rate of 30 per cent for the first £50,000 of income otherwise liable to the standard rate.  I would also like to point out that industry in this country benefits from a corporation tax rate of 10 per cent which compares very favourably to the equivalent rate of 33 per cent in the UK.</P>

      <P>I am not sure what exactly the Deputy is referring to in his question relating to the threat of greed and fraud in the Irish film industry.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy is aware, on budget day I announced a continuation of the tax relief scheme for investment in films in a modified form.  Section 26 of this year's Finance Bill substitutes a new section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987. As the old section 35 was due to come to an end, a review of its operation was commissioned in October last year.  As a result of this review it was decided to renew this relief for the film industry.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the steps which I took on budget day along with the new provisions which I introduced in the Finance Bill will significantly improve the targeting of this relief and thereby strengthen the Irish film industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, I should also point out that my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is the certifying authority and before issuing a certificate, carries out a detailed scrutiny of proposed film projects.  However, investors make their investments at their own risk and the issue of a certificate does not represent a guarantee that the film certified will be made or that the investor will recoup the investment made under the section 35 provision.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to his question on 12 March 1996 (Question No. 82).  The position as given in that reply, a copy of which follows, has not changed in the interim.</P>
      <P>The following is the reply of Tuesday, 12 March 1996:</P>
      <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn): The relevant available information relates to companies classified in the Revenue Commissioners' records as being involved in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.</P>
      <P>The corporation tax liability of such companies who had accounting periods ending between 1 April 1993 and 31 March 1994 (the latest period for which the relevant data are available) was some £114 million.  The PAYE liability of such companies in respect of the year ending 5 April 1993 (the latest period for which the relevant data are available) was in the order of £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To determine the information requested by the Deputy in respect of the liability of such companies to <Col N="1490" /> taxes other than corporation tax and PAYE would involve an extended investigation of the Revenue Commissioners' records which could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the operation of the benefits system does not act as a disincentive to people with a disability to participate in the labour market.  In the light of the retention of secondary benefits by participants under Department of Social Welfare employment opportunity schemes, my Department is raising this issue with the Department of Social Welfare in relation to the two employment schemes for which it has responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Pilot Programme for the Employment of People with Disabilities in viable business enterprises was launched in 1994 and is being administered by the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
      <P>Payment of allowances is discontinued for people employed under this scheme as they are in receipt of a wage but have retained their secondary benefits for the duration of the programme. This scheme will terminate at the end of 1996 and the interdepartmental monitoring committee for this programme is now making arrangements to carry out a full evaluation of the programme and its future.  Entitlement to secondary benefits will be assessed in the context of this evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment support scheme (ESS) which provides employment opportunities for people with more severe disabilities is also administered by <Col N="1493" /> the NRB.  People employed under the ESS may retain their secondary benefits for up to one year.  My Department is in regular contact with the NRB and overall the ESS has been very successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East)</i>: The current position under the dental treatment services scheme, which was introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994, is that dental treatment services will be extended to all adults with medical card eligibility on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>In the initial phasing of the scheme persons aged 65 years and over were identified as a priority group and additional resources have been made available to health boards to enable them to provide dental treatment services including dentures for this group. In addition emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is available under the dental treatment services scheme to all medical card holders irrespective of age since the beginning of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second phase of the scheme will involve the extension of the scheme to provide routine dental treatment services to medical card holders in the 16 <Col N="1494" /> to 34 year old age group and the provision of full dentures to all medical card holders without any natural teeth.</P>
    <P>It was my intention to introduce the second phase from 1 April 1996. However the Irish Dental Association indicated their unwillingness to co-operate with the introduction of the second phase of the scheme pending resolution of certain issues.  The provision of appropriate funding was not an issue. The scheme could not be extended without the co-operation of the association as private dental practitioners carry out the treatment on behalf of the health boards under the scheme.  These issues have now been settled and the second phase will be introduced on 1 June 1996.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> Diabetic services for the Southern Health Board are currently provided at Cork University Hospital, where the board's endrocrinology service is based, at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital and also by a number of general physicians in Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a consultant-led service in Kerry has been raised in the recent past and the health board has examined the options in relation to the <Col N="1498" /> delivery of this service in consultation with senior medical, nursing and other staff.  It was particularly anxious to obtain the views of the new consultant endocrinologist on his appointment to Cork University Hospital in terms of how best the diabetic services should be developed at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>Following its consultation process, the board is now of the opinion that the establishment of a diabetic clinic at Tralee would require the appointment of an additional consultant.  In view of the competing demands in 1996 for consultant posts, the board is actively pursuing a number of interim proposals for the immediate delivery of a diabietic clinic at Tralee.  I have asked the board to keep me informed of any developments in this regard.</P>

This increased level of graduate output should make a significant improvement in the provision of speech therapy services.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware that people with physical and sensory disabilities such as deaf people may incur additional costs as a result of their disability. I understand that this issue is being addressed by the Commission on <Col N="1501" /> the Status of People with Disabilities which is to report shortly.  Any amendment of the domiciliary care allowance which is currently £97.70 per month or the mobility allowance currently £38.00 per month will be taken in light of the commission's report.</P>
      <P>Voluntary organisations for the deaf which are grant aided by the health boards, provide a range of services to deaf people including counselling, interpreting services and specialised equipment. The National Rehabilitation Board (NRB) provides the State audiology service.  This service provides hearing tests, hearing aid supply and fittings and hearing aid repairs for all children up to school leaving age regardless of parental income and for all adult medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The NRB administers two employment schemes which act as incentives for employers to employ people with disabilities, including deaf people.  The employment support scheme caters for people whose disability results in a significantly reduced capacity to operate to full productivity standards by providing a subsidy to employers based on reduced productivity.  The Pilot Programme for the Employment of People with Disabilities, introduced in 1994 for an initial three-year period, contains an employment support fund which is a subsidy payable for each employee with a disability related to their productive capacity.  It is a condition of participation in the programme that at least 50 per cent of the employees are people with a disability.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that mortality rates from diabetes in this country are lower than the European average.</P>
      <P>There are two forms of diabetes, insulin-dependent diabetes which usually occurs before 25 years of age, possibl in early childhood.  At this time it is not known why children develop diabetes. The second form of diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes, occurs in adulthood.  Children with diabetes are often symptomatic and come to medical attention quickly.  However, people with poorly controlled diabetes or who do not know that they have diabetes may develop the complications associated with diabetes.  These include heart attack, stroke, poor circulation to the legs and damage to the eyesight and kidneys. The health promotion unit of my Department has therefore provided financial support over the past number of years for information programmes to raise awareness of diabetes and the ways in which the complications associated with it can be prevented.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a signatory to the St. Vincent's Declaration, an initiative of the World Health Organisation.  The Declaration set out clear outcome targets aimed at reducing major health problems associated with diabetes and identified the indicators that can be used to monitor progress towards these targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A diabetic action group has been established in response to the declaration, with representation from professional groups and voluntary organisations which deal with the condition. The Department of Health has observer status on the group.  In December 1995 a preliminary workshop was held by the groups to look at the current services available to people with diabetes. Another workshop is scheduled to take place next month.  I am sure that the reports of these workshops will be of valuable assistance to my Department in the effective planning of services.  In <Col N="1508" /> addition, my Department will continue to liaise with the World Health Organisation in working towards achieving the targets set by the declaration.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 100, 101, 102, and 103 together.  I assume the Deputy is referring to the report of the Working Party on Tuberculosis.  I am pleased to state that arrangements are currently being made for the printing and publication of the report.  The report will then be circulated to the health boards with advice on the implementation of its recommendations.</P>
      <P>The concerns expressed recently by the WHO relate to the global situation which is not reflected in the figures relating to Ireland.  The incidence of tuberculosis in Ireland has declined from 230 cases/100,000 population in 1952 to 15 cases/100,000 population in 1994.  Likewise there has been a marked reduction in deaths from tuberculosis from 266/100,000 population in 1901 to 1.4/100,000 in 1994.</P>
      <P>The report of the working party recommends best practice on the collection of statistical data, surveillance, screening, prevention, detection and treatment of the disease and will form the basis for the control of tuberculosis for the coming years.  The implementation of the reports recommendations will help to ensure accurate information, improved compliance with treatment, minimise missed opportunities for prevention and detection and ultimately reduce the incidence of tuberculosis to the lowest possible level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> Tuberculosis is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981 and health boards are required to furnish returns of cases to the Department.  Health boards are also statutorily responsible for its diagnosis, treatment and prevention.</P>

      <P>The Council Directive on the conservation of wildbirds (79/409/EEC) lists the peregrine falcon as an annex 1 species. Annex 1 species under the Directive shall be the subject of special conservation measures concerning their habitat in order to ensure their survival and reproduction in their area of distribution. The peregrine falcon is a protected species in Ireland under the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>The population of peregrines in Ireland declined to circa 30 pairs in the early 1970s due largely to the use of pesticides. The Irish population has now recovered to circa 450 pairs (350 in the Republic and 100 in Northern Ireland). However, it is still a species of global conservation concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peregrines prey on a wide variety of medium sized birds ranging in size from thrushes to woodpidgeons-mallard including feral and racing pigeons. Aside from anecdotal evidence, there is no information available which can quantify the impact of peregrines on <Col N="1512" /> racing pigeons.  However, in view of the relatively low population of peregrines and the wide variety of prey available to them, predation on racing pigeons must be extremely low particularly in comparison to losses arising from weather, exhaustion or other natural threats.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence anywhere in Europe that peregrines (or any other bird of prey) are responsible for declines in song bird populations. Again, the low Irish population of peregrines could have little, if any, impact on song bird populations. Declines in some song bird species have been attributed to factors such as agricultural intensification, afforestation, climatic changes and domestic or feral cats.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service is currently planning baseline population surveys to establish future trends in populations.  Song bird species of particular concern are ring ouzel, wood warbler, bearded tit, tree sparrow, twite and corn bunting.</P>

    <P>Generally, the most common faults resulting in test failure are inadequate observation; incorrect position on roads; inadequate use, or lack of use, of mirrors and signals; inadequate reaction to hazards; inadequate progress; and incorrect use of vehicle controls.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Tipperary centre is being closely monitored, and some testing has been carried out there in recent months by experienced supervisory staff to establish the underlying causes of the high failure rates.  Some recurring faults, notably a failure to take adequate observation at junctions and roundabouts, have already been brought to the notice of professional instructors locally and some improvement in test performance has since become evident.  The position will continue to be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The present urban renewal scheme commenced in August 1994 and will operate for a three year period in 35 centres throughout the country.  A comprehensive review of the impact, effectiveness and cost of the urban renewal <Col N="1524" /> schemes which have operated to date is currently under way to assist in the formulation of future policy in this area. It would be inappropriate to consider what new areas, if any, might be suitable for designation until general policy in relation to the next phase of urban renewal is determined in the light of the review.  Arklow is, however, included in the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas which commenced in July 1995.</P>

      <P>Annual reports for the regional technical colleges have not been submitted because audited accounts, which are a specified requirement, are not yet available.  The finalisation of the accounts has been delayed by the need to resolve a number of technical accounting difficulties which affected all the institutions in the sector. These difficulties, which have now been resolved, arose principally from the divergence between the accounting year-end of the institutions, 31 August, and the accounting year-end of the Department, 31 December.</P>

      <P>Details of the number of second level schools which do not have permanent guidance counsellors are not readily available in my Department.  It is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of individual schools to decide whether to appoint a guidance counsellor in a permanent capacity within the approved teacher allocation or to provide for guidance through temporary appointment or part-time hours.</P>
      <P>Up to 1995, all second level schools with enrolments of 500 or more pupils qualified for the allocation of an ex-quota post in respect of guidance while schools in the 350-499 enrolment category qualified for the allocation of 0.5 of a post.  This provision is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approved the allocation of an additional 100 posts to schools in the free education scheme on an ex-quota <Col N="1528" /> basis in respect of guidance for the current school year.  In addition, revised arrangements were introduced to determine the allocation to individual schools.  Schools with enrolments of 1,000 or more pupils now qualify for a second post while schools in the 800-999 enrolment category qualify for an additional 0.5 of a post.  Schools in the 250-349 enrolment range qualify for 0.5 of a post while schools with enrolments below 250 qualify for an allocation of between 0.4 and 0.1 of a post depending on the enrolment in the individual school.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 181 of 2 April 1996, I was aware that the school in question had sought special consideration in view of the presence of a number of special needs children.</P>
      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department received a letter from the school concerned on 20 March 1996, giving some details on eight children with special needs who are enrolled there.  In suggesting that the school provide details of the individual children, I had in mind more specific information. In particular, the fact that my Department would require psychological and physiotherapy reports for the relevant children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have now made arrangements for a member of my Department's primary inspectorate to visit the school in order to discuss the needs of these children <Col N="1534" /> and to examine any available assessment reports.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy applied to my Department in February 1996, for grant-aid towards the cost of a range of improvement works at the school.</P>
      <P>The nature of the works proposed suggested that they were not of an emergency nature.  Accordingly, due to financial constraints, my Department was not in a position to provide grant-aid for the improvements and the chairperson and board of management were notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>The school subsequently advised my Department that their safety officer is of the view that the works in question are of an urgent nature and my Department immediately requested a report on the matter from the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>My Department has for many years made special arrangements in the certificate examinations for candidates who would have difficulty in communicating what they know to an examiner because of physical and sensory disabilities, including visual and hearing impairments, or because of a specific learning difficulty.</P>
      <P>The special arrangements are intended to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment.  They are also intended to ensure that, whilst giving candidates every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment, the special arrangements will not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements are not in general approved in the case of pupils who are assessed as being slow learners or as being mentally handicapped where the learning difficulties of such pupils arise solely from their level of general intellectual ability and are not due to specific difficulties in reading or in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for special examination arrangements in respect of students with Down's Syndrome are considered on <Col N="1536" /> their merits and within the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>A school which is not satisfied with my Department's decision regarding special arrangements may appeal to the special arrangements appeals committee. This is an independent body of five persons, consisting of two officers of my Department and three members from outside my Department, including the Chairperson.</P>
    <P>My Department does not maintain statistics on the number of students with Down's Syndrome who sat, or are expected to sit, for the certificate examinations in 1995 to 1998.  I am advised that where applications are made for special examination arrangements in respect of candidates with Down's Syndrome, such applications are generally put forward on the grounds of their particular presenting disabilities (e.g. impaired hearing, specific learning difficulty etc.) rather than on the grounds of the underlying syndrome.</P>

      <P>In 1995, an application for the establishment of Gaelscoil na Cruaiche, Westport, County Mayo, was submitted for consideration to my Department.  It was one of two applications received to establish gaelscoileanna in the Westport centre.  As the promoters of both gaelscoileanna were unable to satisfy some of the main conditions necessary for the granting of recognition, especially those relating to enrolment numbers and accommodation, neither application was successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A revised application for recognition in respect of Gaelscoil na Cruaiche has <Col N="1537" /> recently been received.  The application is currently under consideration in the planning section of my Department and an inspector's report has been requested.</P>
    <P>My Department requested Gaelscoileanna, the umbrella body for the establishment of all Irish schools, to ensure that applications for new gaelscoileanna be received in the planning section of my Department as early as possible but no later than the Easter preceding the school-year in which proposed new schools wish to commence operation.  This is in order to facilitate a full examination and a sufficiently early decision by my Department to enable approved schools to open as intended.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that dealing No. P2094/93 is an application for first registration, which was lodged on 6 April 1993.  I understand that, due to their complicated nature, these dealings can take some time to process.</P>
      <P>The Registrar of Titles has informed me that the present position in relation to this dealing is that queries were issued by the Land Registry to the applicant's solicitor on 10 January 1996 and a reply is awaited to these queries. The application cannot proceed until these queries are fully dealt with.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy Registrar contacted the applicant's solicitors on 26 April 1996 in this regard and I can inform the Deputy that, on receipt of a reply to the queries issued, the matter will be expedited by the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over as well as certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Currently, about 470,000 people qualify under the free travel scheme at an estimated annual cost this year of some £32.7 million.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties faced by wheelchair users when accessing public transport.  In recent months, my Department has contacted all of the transport operators currently participating in the free travel scheme requesting details of arrangements which they have in place to cater for the specific needs of disabled or infirm people wishing to use their transport services.  In general terms, most of the operators are able to provide some limited form of facility for disabled passengers such as special boarding ramps or steps, reserved spaces, etc.  Some respondents said that they would be prepared to adapt their vehicles or invest in new vehicles if they received financial assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will continue to keep the question of accessible transport for infirm people or people with disabilities under review to see if improvements can be achieved, <Col N="1548" /> within the scope of my Department's free travel scheme, having regard to the resources available to the scheme.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 169, 172, 173, 176, 177, 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply, on 18 April 1996, to Deputy Walsh's adjournment motion on the future of social welfare branch offices.  Since the end of the 1980s the Department has been engaged in a programme of fundamental change in the way it delivers its services to the public.  This provides for the local delivery, by departmentally staffed local offices, of a much broader range of services and the implementation of more modern systems of payments. The switch from payments in cash to alternative payment methods, mainly through post offices, is a central feature of the new service.  The frequency of signing for unemployed people is also being reduced from weekly to monthly.  These changes in service delivery have implications for the traditional role and type of activity carried out by branch offices which are operated by branch managers on a contract basis for the Department.</P>
      <P>For this reason, as I stated on 18 April, a review of branch office operations has been under way in the Department for several years and predates my appointment as Minister.  The purpose of this review is to see how best the benefits flowing from the changes in service delivery can be extended to existing social welfare customers and the public generally in the catchment areas currently catered for by the branch offices.</P>
      <P>No decision has yet been taken with regard to the future of the branch offices and any such decision will be fully discussed with the branch managers under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme which covers them.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 171, 183, 185, 186 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was a major success last year and proved to be of significant benefit to local communities and voluntary groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> Many valuable projects were undertaken by students which would otherwise not have been carried out.  The students also gained valuable work experience and are generally pleased with the scheme.</P>
    <P>The underlying purpose of the scheme is to provide income support for the less well-off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and are unable to obtain summer work.</P>
    <P>The hourly rate of pay was increased by me last year to £3 and this increased rate will be paid again this year.  This will enable those eligible to earn up to £600.  A survey of 400 student participants, carried out by my Department last year, showed that: most students were satisfied with the basic rate of pay; some students felt that it was unfair to have two rates of pay applying to the same work; many took up the option of engaging in other part-time work, which is allowed under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the upward trend in student participation each year in the scheme since its inception in 1993, priority this year is being given to enabling the maximum number of eligible students to take part within the £10.1 million allocation.  The allocation for 1995 was £6.3 million while the allocation for 1994 was £3 million.</P>

      <P>A special once-off grant of £200 payable on the birth of twins was introduced in 1993.  Previously, grants were only payable in respect of multiple births of triplets or more children.  In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents in multiple births, I made provision in the 1996 budget for an increase, from £200 to £500, in the grant payable on the birth <Col N="1552" /> of twins and for the introduction of a new grant of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the ages of 4 and 12 effective from 1 January 1996.</P>
      <P>The grants are intended to assist with the particular financial pressures at birth and as the twins enter primary and secondary school.  These improvements, which were provided for by way of section 5 of the Social Welfare Act, 1996, are in addition to the £2 increase being provided in the monthly rates of child benefit from September next and the £7 increase provided for September 1995 payable for each child.</P>

      <P>Under existing provisions, an adult dependant allowance is payable to a social welfare recipient in respect of a spouse or partner where they are not in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right and do not have income in excess of £60 per week.</P>
      <P>The problems associated with the current situation, whereby a beneficiary loses entitlement to the adult dependant allowance and half of any increase payable in respect of dependent children when the earnings of the spouse or partner exceed this income limit, would not be resolved by increasing the present limit in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>I included legislative changes in the Social Welfare Act, 1995, which are designed to enable me to make provision for such tapering in appropriate regulations.  A number of options for tapering of the withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance are currently being examined.  I hope to be in a position to make progress in the matter by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism aims to attract investment of £652 million for Irish tourism over the period 1994 to 1999, of <Col N="1556" /> which £369 million will be provided by the European Union.</P>
      <P>Expenditure is taking place under five separate sub-programmes and annual allocations from the European Regional Development Fund/ESF for each as published in the operational programme are given in table 1 of the following tabular statement.  These allocations are subject to regular review, in consultation with the European Commission to take account of overall programme performance and actual progress in relation to approved projects.  The current position in relation to expenditure, and commitments already entered into in relation to approved projects, under each sub-programme is set out in table 2 of the same tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, copies of which are available in the Dáil library, was launched in October 1994 outlining in great detail eligible amenities and facilities.</P>
      <P>The natural cultural tourism sub-programme is administered by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and it is designed to make Ireland's heritage and culture more accessible and attractive to overseas visitors through offering assistance towards the development of: national-regional cultural activities; national monuments and historic properties; and natural environment.</P>
      <P>The product development sub-programme, with the exception of the tourism angling measure, is administered by Shannon Development in its area and Bord Fáilte for the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>The sub-programme is designed to meet the continued growth in international demand for high quality special interest amenities and facilities.  Under this sub-programme assistance is available for the development of: large tourism projects; medium size regional projects; tourist information and heritage projects; tourism angling, administered by the Department of the Marine/Central Fisheries Board; special interest holiday facilities; and specialist accommodation-related developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> The marketing sub-programme, designed to encourage the industry to take an increasing role in securing the future success of Irish tourism, to increase market share in established markets and to achieving successful entry into new markets, is administered by Bord Fáilte.  Marketing grants are made available towards initiatives which: extend the tourism season; expand sea and air access; develop new markets; develop product and niche markets; and attract more high yield business.</P>
    <P>Applications for assistance under both the product development and marketing sub-programmes are considered <Col N="1558" /> by independent management boards. The decisions of the product management boards for the Bord Fáilte and SFADCo areas respectively, as to grant aid for facilities and amenities are announced regularly and annual reports of each board's activities will be lodged in the Dáil Library when available.</P>
    <P>The training sub-programme, which is administered by the Department of Education and CERT, is designed to enhance education and skills levels in the tourism and hospitality industries. Measures assisted include: programmes for the unemployed; programme of initial training, normally school leavers; and continuing training.</P>

      <P>The present study on insurance costs is intended to focus primarily on an economic evaluation of liability insurance costs in Ireland as they impact on the Irish economy and on the competitiveness of Irish industry.  The consultants have also been requested to compare the liability cost position in Ireland with a number of EU countries, in addition to the UK.  This comparison with the UK and certain EU member states is particularly relevant both in the context of the competitiveness of the Irish traded business sector and in the similarity of insurance systems in operation throughout the EU.</P>
      <P>The insurance position in New Zealand and other countries which are not significant trading partners is not directly relevant for the purposes of the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland which is the key focus of the present study.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to commission a study of the insurance position in New Zealand.</P>

    <P>While the terms of reference of the study do not make explicit reference to other non-EU countries, the draft report refers to other non-EU jurisdictions, where appropriate, in terms of <Col N="1564" /> systems of compensation and young driver schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Casual Trading Act, 1995, is to achieve greater decentralisation, efficiency and flexibility in the regulation of casual trading by the local authorities than was possible under the less flexible regime provided by the Casual Trading Act, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Causal Trading Act, 1980, <Col N="1566" /> required that an application for a casual trading licence be made at least 30 days before the first day on which the applicant intends to start trading.  This is not, therefore, a new requirement and there is no evidence that it proved expensive or impossible to comply with in the past. The only change in this regard is that in future applicants will have to apply to the relevant local authorities rather than the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for a licence.</P>
    <P>As the Casual Trading Act, 1995, will only come into force on 1 May, I do not intend to exercise my powers under section 2 (3) of the Act at this stage. However I should point out that under section 2 (4) of the Act local authorities are empowered to exempt categories of trading previously exempted under the Casual Trading Act, 1980, or to exempt any new categories of trading they may decide are appropriate for their own areas.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology, together with officials from my Department met with representatives of the mobile catering business, on 14 March, to discuss their concerns.  The representatives were advised of the provisions and requirements of the Casual Trading Act, 1995, and the options open to them.  It was suggested to them that as the local authorities are at present in the process of preparing by-laws under section 6 of the Act, they could make representations to the relevant local authorities in relation to special events at which they are interested in trading.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware the corncrake grant scheme has been operated by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy for some years now with funding provided by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.  Indeed the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has recently announced the allocation of £64,000 for this scheme in 1996.  The rural environment protection scheme administered by my Department provides payments to farmers who practice farming in an environmentally friendly manner.  Additional payments are available to scheme participants who have some or all of their lands in a proposed natural heritage area and agree to farm this area as prescribed by the NPWS.  The existing corncrake areas are proposed NHA sites and as such the additional as well as the basic REPS <Col N="1569" /> payment is available to REPS participants in such areas.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that when REPS was being devised, it was made clear to the Commission that it would provide for corncrake conservation under the supplementary measure dealing with proposed NHAs. My Department does not operate any other schemes through which corncrake conservation could be provided for.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any recent case made by the IWC in relation to a separate corncrake conservation scheme to be established from 1997 and I have no plans for the establishment of any such scheme.</P>

      <P>In the helpsheet which accompanied the 1996 area aid application form, intending applicants are advised, in the case of each parcel of forage area which they intend to declare, to deduct from the gross area of that parcel any non-utilisable areas including expanses of bare rock.</P>
      <P>If an applicant fails to make any necessary deduction from the gross areas of his land parcels, then in the course on an inspection he may be penalised for overdeclaring the actual utilisable area available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/93, as amended, lays down the penalties to <Col N="1573" /> be applied is discrepancies are discovered in the course of carrying out controls.</P>
    <P>Where the declared area is more than 20 per cent greater than the area found on inspection, no area linked aid will be payable.  Where a false declaration is made as a result of serious negligence, the applicant shall be excluded from the aid scheme concerned for the current calendar year.  Where a false declaration is made intentionally, he or she shall be excluded from all area aid linked schemes for the following year also in respect of the area equal to that for which the current year's area aid application is rejected.</P>
    <P>In the case to which the Deputy refers, therefore, the applicant would appear to have overdeclared his net forage area by 10 hectares or 28.57 per cent, in which case he would lose entitlement to all 1996 aid in respect of the livestock schemes for which an area aid declaration is required and, if his application is deemed to constitute an intentional false declaration, all area-linked aid in respect of 35 hectares in 1997.</P>

      <P>Under the support system for producers of arable crops which was introduced as part of CAP reform, area payments are limited to regional or national base areas reflecting the average of the areas which were used to produce arable crops &mdash; cereals, oilseeds, protein crops and linseed &mdash; or in set-aside during the years 1989 to 1991 inclusive.  The national base area for Ireland is approximately 345,000 hectares.  Since the new system was introduced under CAP reform the area cultivated in Ireland has been well below the permitted national level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>The European Union has adopted the objective of stabilising CO2 emissions in the Union as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2000.  Ireland's national CO2 abatement strategy was formulated in 1993 with the objective of limiting the increase in CO2 emissions to 20 per cent over 1990 levels by 2000.  This strategy was designed around targets and measures which will accommodate necessary economic growth in addition to contributing to the stabilisation of community CO2 emissions.  Measures in the areas of transport and energy policy will contribute to the realisation of these objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 includes provision for substantial EU assisted investments in the main line railway network and <Col N="1576" /> public transport services in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Total investment in the mainline rail-work will amount to £275 million in the period.  This investment, which will be focused on track renewal, modern signalling systems and rolling stock, will encourage greater use of the railways for passenger and freight traffic, particularly longer-distance passenger journeys and the transport of freight which is unsuitable for transport by road.</P>
    <P>An investment of £295 million will enable substantial progress to be made on implementation of the public transport elements of the Dublin Transportation Initiative (DTI) including the introduction of a light rail network and quality bus corridors.  Implementation of the DTI strategy will result in a significant shift from private to public transport and produce positive environmental effects.</P>
    <P>I launched a major strategy for the further development of the renewable energy sector last week, and a copy of that strategy is available in the Oireachtas Library.  In broad outline, the elements of my strategy are: (a) the commissioning, completion and publication of a study into the total renewable energy resource in Ireland; (b) the establishment of a working group on grid connection issues; (c) the establishment of a renewable energy information office; (d) the securing, by the end of 1999, of electricity supply from an additional 100MW of installed capacity using renewable energy sources, through competitions &mdash; European Regional Development Fund support of up to £6.5 million from the economic infrastructure operational programme to be provided: (e) the drawing up, in consultation with the Power Procurer and the ESB, of a scheme to cater for the development of small scale renewable energy based electricity generating projects; (f) the provision of European Regional Development Fund grant support from the economic infrastructure operational programme of up of £1 million for the building, by the end of 1999, <Col N="1577" /> of a pilot wave energy electricity generating plant; (g) allowing third party access to the electricity network for renewable generators who wish to sell green electricity directly to electricity consumers; (h) guaranteeing electricity market access for EU Thermie funded renewable energy projects; (i) setting targets for the future generation of electricity from renewable energy for the 2000-2010 period; (j) the pursuit of further fiscal measures to support renewable energy development in the context of the greening of the 1997 budget.</P>
    <P>Under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme 1994-1999, I have established the Irish Energy Centre to co-ordinate and implement a series of energy efficiency and conservation initiatives (Question No. 5, Vol. 462 of 5 March 1996 Dáil Official Report).  The sum of £21 million is available to the Irish Energy Centre for these initiatives over the period of the operational programme.  These initiatives, together with the renewable energy strategy, will contribute to the realisation of Ireland's CO2 emissions targets.</P>

      <P>The sum of £229,265 was received by way of fees, royalties and rents in the year ended 31 December 1995 in respect of one State mining licence and 17 State mining leases.  The answers to the Deputy's other questions are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statutory six-monthly reports which I am obliged to present to both Houses of the Oireachtas, under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, which give details of all State mining facilities &mdash; leases and licences &mdash; and prospecting licences in force under those Acts. The report for the six months to 31 December 1995 (PN 2265) was presented on 2 February 1996.</P>
      <P>I am currently examining an application for a State mining facility in respect of a proposed major zinc and lead mine at Lisheen, County Tipperary, and a proposed calcite mine at Kilbreckan, County Clare, for which planning permission and an integrated pollution control licence have also been applied for and are required before mining could take place.  Other mine development possibilities are also being actively pursued with the interests concerned.</P>

      <P>In my reply to Question No. 237 of 5 March 1996 I pointed out that the Dublin Transportation Initiative strategy, which has been accepted by the Government <Col N="1581" /> as the policy framework for transportation planning in Dublin, incorporated an on-street light rail system.  I also pointed out that DTI had specifically recommended against an underground (DART) system on economic, financial and accessibility grounds.</P>
      <P>I am advised that on the basis of a very preliminary estimate, CIE calculate the additional cost associated with constructing a two kilometre underground section of light rail in the city centre would be in the region of £65 million. This would include the cost of stations and of upgrading the rolling stock.</P>

      <P>Final decisions on the precise routes of planned light rail links will not be taken until the public consultation programme now under way is completed, a public inquiry has been held and EU approval procedures have been completed.  The impact on employment is one of a range of issues being considered as part of this process.  One of the underlying aims of the proposed light rail network is to support development policies which create and sustain employment and I would be most concerned about any potential loss of employment as a result of the development of light rail.  However, pending completion of the process already outlined it would be premature to speculate what impact the development of light rail will have on employment along the eventual routes and in the city as a whole.</P>

Cork County Council included the Knockadoon to Ballycotton area among their proposals.

The council has advised that whilst the overall long-term cost of protecting the coastline at Ballycotton is in the range of £450,000 to £600,000, the most critical works could be undertaken at a cost of £60,000 approximately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 238, 239 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>The closing date for receiving tenders is Tuesday, 30 April 1996 at 12 noon. The proposal is to build a rock breakwater southwards from the harbour wall, a rock groyne eastward from a point on the esplanade near the aquarium and to build a shingle beach in their lee.  The design calls for the use of shingle similar to that found naturally on the south beach and one possible source that has been identified is the Codling Bank.</P>
      <P>The present proposal was not chosen lightly.  It is the most economical and effective way of protecting the northern esplanade which has been attacked by natural processes since it was first built. The vertical wall and pier have combined with natural elements to undermine the foundations and scour out the beach which could otherwise protect them.  To protect the wall and pier a beach is needed extending sufficiently far out to minimise the wave impact on them.  The beach must be stabilised and that requires breakwaters and groynes to keep it in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was designed, costed and negotiated between officials of my Department and the councils, Bray Urban District Council and Wicklow County Council.  The proposal was put to the UDC.  They called a special meeting to consider the matter and had an <Col N="1587" /> oral presentation from my Department and questioned officials in detail on all aspects of the problem and the proposed solution.  The UDC subsequently considered the proposal under the planning Acts and granted itself permission to carry out the development.  The planning regulations under which this process was undertaken provide for public notice, public display of the proposals, receipt of submissions and observations to the proposal and an evaluation of implications of the proposal for planning and development in the area before a decision is made by the council. The planning decision was reached last autumn.</P>
    <P>A public meeting was held in Bray on 8 February 1996 to give further information to the local residents on the details of the scheme and the analysis of other options.  The general tenor of that meeting was that most of those present wanted the scheme to go ahead but some people were worried by the visual appearance of the end product.  Further analysis has been carried out by my Department and I understand the UDC has commissioned landscape planners to come up with an analysis of the visual impact and costed methods of improving the amenity value.  The most recent technical reports have been passed to the UDC.</P>
    <P>My Department's engineers have looked at:&mdash;</P>
    <P>strengthening the sea wall;</P>
    <P>protecting the wall with rock revetment; and,</P>
    <P>protecting the wall with a new raised beach</P>
    <P>Strengthening the sea wall would cost more &mdash; at least £2.8 million &mdash; and would only last until the increasing wave height scoured out the remnants of the beach to a new lower level and undermined the wall.  It would not prevent the current overtopping problem or flooding and it would not reduce the erosion of the beach which is now only available at low tide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> Rock revetment would protect the wall by placing a sloping face of large rocks to absorb the wave energy.  Prevention of overtopping and flooding would entail extending quite a distance seaward and this would combine higher cost &mdash; £3.2 million &mdash; with an extensive rock pile along the promenade and pier. There would be no beach.</P>
    <P>New raised beach requires rock structures to keep it in place.  Using shingle with the rock structures as proposed is budgeted at £2.4 million.  This provides an embankment at promenade level with a sloping beach beyond that.  To use fine sand would require much more elaborate rock structures than are proposed, more closely spaced and double the quantity of nourishment materials. It would have to be replenished from time to time because it would be more difficult to keep it there against storm pressures.  The initial cost would be two to three times the shingle option because of the extra rock structures and greater fill quantities.  Ongoing maintenance costs would also be considerably lighter.</P>
    <P>In addition the further options of a recurve wall, an offshore breakwater or a basin to accommodate a future marina were examined.  A recurve wall is a substantial reinforced concrete wall 1.1 metres high with a curve on the outer face to turn waves back and prevent overtopping.  It would require strengthening of the seawall as well and this, like the proposal to strengthen the sea wall mentioned earlier, will not eliminate the scoring at the base of the wall.  An offshore breakwater would have to be more substantial than the rock revetment and, that, combined with the complexity of working offshore would be likely to be a significantly most costly option than that currently proposed.  On its own it would not result in the rebuilding of the beach but it would prevent further erosion.  The outline cost of the rock structures to form a basin would be £3.5 to £5 million depending on results of detailed site surveys and model studies.  The design and <Col N="1589" /> modelling exercise for what is effectively a new habour would cost in excess of £90,000 and take up to 12 months.  It may require revetment of the esplanade as well and the required dredging would almost certainly lower the existing beach.  The proposal would cease to be coast protection works and would not attract the present available funding.  As well as putting the funding at risk the delay would put the esplanade at hazard of collapse and inundation for at least a further year.</P>
    <P>My Department is open to any reasonable proposals and will incorporate any additional work that Bray UDC is prepared to fund.  The technical resources of my Department will also be made available to help assess any new options.  But the bottom line is that a decision must be made whether or not to proceed to contract on the present proposal with or without modifications. If the decision locally is not to proceed and a viable alternative, which is eligible for the present funding, is not in place to start this year there must be a risk of the project not proceeding as other demands emerge.</P>
    <P>My Department has given extensive consideration to this proposed coastal protection scheme.  The moneys that have been earmarked for the scheme. some £2.4 million, of which Bray and Wicklow local authorities are to contribute between them 25 per cent, are almost half of all the moneys assigned to coast protection works in the Community Support Framework agreed between the Irish Government and the European Union for the period 1994 to 1999.  It is not practical to devote further funds from this measure to the Bray scheme and there are no supplementary funds from any other source available to me.  Should Bray and Wicklow local authorities be in a position to guarantee additional funding I would have no difficulty if it were used for visual enhancement of the scheme as proposed or any other additional work required.  I am also willing to respond to the wishes of the local authority with regard to the future of this scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> The timescale for final decision is short.  I understand that Bray UDC will be meeting with those opposed to the present scheme and those in support on 14 May 1996.  Officials from my Department will attend.  Following that meeting Bray UDC will have to make a decision to proceed with the scheme as designed, or with additional works which are funded locally.  A prolonged delay in proceeding with the Bray project would of course oblige me to redirect the finance which is being made available this year to other coastal protection schemes, for which there is considerable pressure.</P>
