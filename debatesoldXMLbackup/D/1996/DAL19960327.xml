      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will hear expressions of sympathy on the passing of the former Member and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Mr. Seán Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with considerable shock that Members learned of the death of Seán Browne this morning. Seán presided over this assembly as Leas-Cheann Comhairle from 1977 to 1981.  He showed good humour and humanity in the exercise of that and all other offices he occupied.  Most of us will remember him for his gentleness. He was not easily angered although he had deep convictions and occasionally showed a form of annoyance.  He lived his life as he would have liked politics to be practised, as a profession involving conciliation and consideration for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from being a very effective representative of the constituency of Wexford, in particular, Enniscorthy, and an advocate of its cause in all debates in which he took part, he was also a prominent member of the GAA.  He served as chairman of the Wexford County Board for, I believe, a longer period than any other individual.  While it is difficult to <Col N="994" /> retain the confidence of the electorate in one's constituency for a long time, it is probably even more difficult to maintain the confidence of the GAA in a county chairman for as long a period as Seán Browne succeeded in doing.  His success in combining an effective and active political career with such service to sport, and to young people through sport, is a tribute to the breadth and depth of his character.</P>
    <P>He was proud of his native county. Some of us will recall that whenever the Wexford Strawberry Festival was in prospect, Seán would distribute punnets of strawberries in the House on a nonpartisan basis to induce us to consume adequate quantities of the best strawberries in the world.  He was generous, proud of his county and what it was capable of producing and, because of his willingness to do something that was open to comment, humble.  Members who served with Seán will remember that sense of humility and gentleness.</P>
    <P>I extend my deep sympathy to his family and to his nephew who is a distinguished representative of the same constituency.  On behalf of all Members I express deep sympathy to the Browne family and, in particular, to the Fianna Fáil Party who have lost a champion and one who represented all that is best in political life and in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in expressing sympathy on the death of Seán Browne.  I recently visited him in hospital as his health failed.  He maintained a close interest in what was happening here, mainly by listening to the radio.</P>
      <P>He served in the Houses of the Oireachtas for 24 years as a Deputy from 1957 to 1961 and a Senator until 1969 when he returned to this House until his retirement in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach correctly stated, Seán was fair but firm and well able to handle himself.  When he chaired Fianna Fáil Party meetings he was also very firm.  He was very good with money and new party members had to immediately sign a standing order and pay up the <Col N="995" /> funds.  I am afraid this practice is not as well observed now.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not possible to avoid paying as Seán would follow people around the House until he had obtained their signature.</P>
      <P>He was the Fianna Fáil assistant director of by-elections for 15 years.  I was involved in only a few of those by-elections but I know from colleagues who were involved in all of them that he applied the same ground rules, he was a tremendous architect of by-elections and derived great satisfaction from them.  Very much a committee person, he worked hard on committees and as chairman of the Fianna Fáil Party and Government assistant whip.  Last summer he recalled some of the old practices in the House.  He had a great regard for John Kelly who brought an end to the late sittings.  The then Government assistant whip would have been grateful for this improvement as otherwise he would have had to keep the House in order until midnight and cope with other difficulties.  Seán did not welcome difficulties and I think he preferred strawberries to some of the difficulties in the House.</P>
      <P>He also had a love for GAA and served as chairman of the county board for 21 years.  When I asked him about his best memories of that period he referred to the great Cork versus Wexford matches of the 1950s.  Fianna Fáil is very proud of Seán whose nephew, Deputy John Browne, continues the tradition. On behalf of my party I extend sympathy to his family, the people he represented in Wexford and his friends in Dublin where he lived for many years.  On behalf of his family, I thank the staff of Beaumont Hospital who looked after him so well in recent times.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Parliamentary Party I extend sympathy to the family of the late Seán <Col N="996" /> Browne who served this House and the Seanad with distinction.  He was chairman of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party for many years and also served as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I knew him quite well and he was an effective and hard working representative of the people of Enniscorthy and Wexford. This tradition is carried on by his able nephew, Deputy John Browne.  We extend sympathy to his family, nephew and Fianna Fáil Parliamentary colleagues with whom he served with distinction for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progress Democrats I extend sympathy to the Browne family on the death of Seán. He was first elected to Leinster House in 1957 and gave 24 years of distinguished service to the people of Wexford and the Fianna Fáil Party as a Member of the Dáil and Seanad. Although I was Deputy in 1977 I did not know him well but like the Taoiseach I remember him bringing strawberries from Wexford at the beginning of the season.  He was a very gentle person and I extend my sympathy to the Fianna Fáil Party and, in particular, his nephew, John.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I extend sympathy to the family of the late Seán Browne.  I did not know Seán as he left the House shortly after I became a Member.  However, it is clear from what has been said that he dedicated his life to his community, local and national politics and the GAA.  I extend my sympathy to his family and colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach contacted the President of Egypt, Mr. Mubarak, and King Hussein of Jordan regarding clearance for the shipments of Irish beef to Arab countries?  Will he clarify if it is the Government's intention to reinstate the ministry of food as the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  I understand it is at present incorporated in the Department of Health and administered by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea.  However, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, this morning indicated that it was to be moved to the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Will the <Col N="998" /> Taoiseach clarify those important issues?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair allowed the leader of Fianna Fáil to make the point so I think it is appropriate for me to reply.  Any international <i>démarche</i> of this kind needs to be properly prepared. That has been done by laying the diplomatic and technical groundwork so that the call will have the best possible prospects of success.  The situation is obviously extremely difficult.  This decision, taken by President Mubarak early on Monday, has serious consequences and I take it seriously.  Therefore, I want to prepare, and have prepared, any <i>démarche</i> I make in the best possible way.  That is precisely why the call is taking place this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important in a matter of this kind that the Deputy should table questions in an orderly way.  I am obliged on the Order of Business to answer questions about the presentation of legislation, not about other matters that the Deputy may think of on the spur of the moment.  I have answered questions he posed, that are in order, accurately and fully.  If he wishes to ask any other questions about the strategic alliance he can, to get the most up-to-date information, properly and with due notice put them to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. I would advise him to do that himself if he does not have confidence in his spokesperson to do it on his behalf.</P>

The final date has now been passed and Tele Denmark is the only bidder.  The Taoiseach should tell us whether the Government will negotiate with that consortium on the basis of the legislation.  International financial papers seem to indicate that the Government will negotiate.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a matter on the Order Paper, No. 26, a motion in my name to allow for the laying before the House of the report of the investigation into the death of Kelly Fitzgerald and a debate on the matter. What are the Government's intentions in this matter?  Will it be providing for the laying before the Oireachtas of this report, and will we have a full debate on it under privilege?  The Tánaiste has indicated that he is considering the legality of that proposition to allow for a debate on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is maintaining that the death of Kelly Fitzgerald and its handling by the health board is a matter for Private Members' Business.  The reason I put it on the <Col N="1002" /> Order Paper was to allow me to raise it every day on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is asking about a Private Members' motion in her own party's name.  If her party wishes to give it priority it can do that.  The report on the Kelly Fitzgerald case is a separate matter, and the Government has been considering it quite separately from any motion the Deputy is making inquiries about.  It is our intention to present a report on that matter to the Joint Committee on the Family, and we hope that committee will be able to consider the matter fully in a mature and balanced way.  I am sure there will be constructive value for the future in ensuring that horrible tragedies of the kind that occurred in this case do not recur.</P>

      <P>I know the dispute is outside the Chair's control but it has caused some difficulties. The idea behind this amendment is to remove derogatory dependency terms from this Bill.

      <P>Did the Minister have an opportunity to examine this and, if so, when will it be possible to amend the legislation and the literature emanating from his Department and all other Government Departments to delete all these derogatory terms?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that I was supportive of the principle the Deputy was proposing. I believe that the terminology which defines people as &ldquo;adult dependants&rdquo; is unacceptable.  The vast majority of so-called adult dependants are women and tend to be women who work in the home.  It is a long-standing recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare to replace that term.  My understanding is that the alternative term proposed by the Commission on Social Welfare was &ldquo;qualified partner&rdquo;<Col N="1007" /> but when I considered whether we should use that term I found that in many respects the term partner would not be appropriate.  In some cases the adult in receipt of a dependant's allowance may, in fact, be a former partner or a former spouse.</P>
      <P>My preference is for the term &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo;.  It appears to be a better term.  On Committee Stage I undertook to consider the possibility of introducing an amendment on Report Stage which would have a general effect and suggested the term &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; could be construed to mean &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo;.  However, the parliamentary draftsman advised that all references to &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; should be replaced with the proposed new term and pointed out that to do otherwise could have unintended effects as it may be necessary to make certain consequential textual amendments to sections of the Acts which refer to &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo;. As it is necessary that the Bill be enacted by 6 April next, Deputies will appreciate that it would not be possible to complete the detailed necessary work involved in trawling existing legislation and regulations in this regard.  I regret, therefore, that it is not possible to bring forward the amendment I intended to introduce at this Stage, but I solemnly undertake to table a suitable amendment under the 1997 Social Welfare Bill to effect the measure all sides of the House wish to have implemented.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the spirit of this amendment. I understand the position of the Bills office and the parliamentary draftsman's office that this amendment would involve changes to a tremendous body of legislation and regulations.  In developing and maturing as a society it is important that we give effect to appropriate terms.  Given that some of the terms in the legislation are derogatory and humiliating, it is incumbent on us, as legislators, to ensure that not only do we give effect to sentiments of equality and parity of esteem but that at every possible opportunity we ensure they are included in legislation and regulations.  Derogatory terms have crept into various Department of Social Welfare documents, including explanatory leaflets and others, and the sooner they are eliminated the better.  I commend the Minister for his acceptance of that position.  I hope derogatory terms will be removed at the earliest opportunity and we can look forward to enlightened and mature legislation, regulations and terminology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2b:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;(1)  The recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare in <Col N="1009" /> relation to a common basic payment or minimally adequate payment shall be recognised as the official poverty line.</P>
    <P>(2)  The official poverty line rate shall be established at:</P>
    <P>(a)  for a single adult, £50.00 per week at 1985 prices,</P>
    <P>(b)  for a married couple, 1.6 times the weekly rate for a single person at 1985 prices,</P>
    <P>(c)  for each child under the age of 18 years, £10.00 per week at 1985 prices.</P>
    <P>(3)  The official poverty line rate shall be indexed annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to improve the basis for planning and development of our social welfare services. This amendment does not impose a cost on the Exchequer and has been tabled to assist planners in developing a comprehensive social welfare system. The Minister when in Opposition supported the objective of this amendment and now that he is Minister for Social Welfare he is in an ideal position to implement measures to give effect to his sentiments in this regard.  We must wait and see how he, as Minister, measures up in terms of implementing measures to give effect to some of his well worn sentiments regarding this area.  The advantage to the Department of accepting this amendment is that it would provide a base line on which to develop policy.  It is a recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare which spent a great deal of time debating this issue and did not put forward this measure lightly.</P>
    <P>An official poverty line rate for single adults of £50 per week at 1985 prices would compare to £68.50 at today's prices.  That is not an exorbitant amount of money.  It is a base line from which to operate.  Given that many social welfare studies which use different base lines to measure proverty give rise to confusion, <Col N="1010" /> this poverty line rate is as good a benchmark as any.  Having implemented the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare for the past ten years it is appropriate, now that we are making changes which will take effect in the latter part of this century and the beginning of the next one, that we should have something solid on which to base and build our policy.  I strongly recommend that the Minister accepts this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the fact that I proposed an initiative when in Opposition, and that is true.  He referred to it on Committee and Report Stages.  It is a useful vehicle to debate the question of poverty in the House.  I am doing something much more important than simply seeking to provide for a poverty line which would be significantly out of date.  The Commission on Social Welfare, in a report ten years ago, made a recommendation on what is estimated as a poverty line in terms of adequate income.  In negotiating the Programme for Government Democratic Left sought an updating of the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare.  There is a commitment in the Programme for Government that the commission recommendation on the main rate will be examined by the ESRI and a report produced on what the rates ought to be.  When I came to office one of the first things I did was ask the ESRI to consider this question, and I expect a report from it on income adequacy by the middle of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That body will also consider how such a recommendation could be indexed. Various devices have been used for indexing.  At times, depending on the economic position, various levels of social welfare payments fall behind the requirement.  When the Commission on Social Welfare addressed income adequacy it found that a significant proportion of social welfare payments were way below what it considered to be even a minimally adequate income.  It recommended an emergency approach to bring the rates up to a certain level and <Col N="1011" /> that efforts be made to reach the main rate over a period.</P>
    <P>Another action I took with the agreement of Government, to deal with poverty was to establish the national anti-poverty strategy, involving a high level interdepartmental committee which is currently consulting widely with the voluntary and community sector whose members are actively engaged on a day to day basis in working with people affected by poverty.  That strategy produced a summary of the submissions made by the voluntary and community sector and published a document on the broad themes identified.  It also produced a document outlining the institutional reform that could be made to support such a strategy.  The intention is that all Government Departments and agencies, in the formulation and implementation of policies, would be obliged to have regard to the question of poverty and consult those affected by it.</P>
    <P>I also established a Commission on the Family which, in the next 15 months &mdash; it will report by June of next year &mdash; will consider how we can support families regardless of their status, whether single parent or two parent families, whether married or cohabiting.  Families with large numbers of children are those most at risk of poverty.  I am very proud as Minister for Social Welfare to have established this commission.  The Government is determined to implement the recommendations of the national anti-poverty strategy and the Commission on the Family.</P>
    <P>I also substantially increased child benefit by £9 per child, the largest increase ever in that benefit.  That is a concrete step to deal with poverty. Research indicates &mdash; the Commission on Social Welfare made it clear this is its view &mdash; that poverty affects families with children to a greater extent, and the larger the family the more likely it is to be affected by poverty.  Not only have I pursued the policies I advocated when in Opposition as Leader of Democratic Left but I am actively implementing those policies.  I am not at <Col N="1012" /> all embarrassed by Deputy Walsh's proposal or my refusal to accept it because it is too late to do so.  His party had the opportunity since 1986 to implement such a proposal, which might have been useful in the years since then, but failed to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>How can a Minister who, every year in Opposition, called for a measure such as that proposed in this amendment say it is no longer useful? Those who have followed this debate will be aware that it is not true that the Minister is actively implementing policies he pursued when in Opposition.  All one has to do is look at the various sections dealt with on Committee Stage to see that is the case. For example, when the Minister was in Opposition he had very definite views on multiple births and believed people advocating that twins should constitute a multiple birth had a justifiable case. When he came to office those people wrote to congratulate him, believing that he would meet his commitment in <Col N="1013" /> that regard, but he failed to do so.  Likewise in regard to poverty, those who heard the Minister speak about this matter when in Opposition are disappointed at his failure to implement the policies for which he made such a strong case at the time.</P>
      <P>The third item is the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The Minister does not like to be reminded of it but, in Opposition, he said that disabled person's maintenance allowance should be £150 per week.  Although this is the Minister's second Social Welfare Bill, the allowance is only 48 per cent of that amount.  He has done nothing about this important issue in his time as Minister. It is wrong to make such strong calls in Opposition and then let people down when one is in a position of being able to do something for them.</P>
      <P>The wording of amendment No. 2b is the same as that of an amendment tabled by the Minister two years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister felt the provision appropriate when he was in Opposition and I cannot understand why he feels it is not useful when he has the power to accept it.  It was useful from 1987 to 1994.  If the Minister forgot the issue when drafting the Bill he should now be ready to admit it was what he called for over the past eight years, apologise for forgetting to include it and accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to identify a standard for the official poverty line which can be indexed annually.  It will not cost the State anything to accept the amendment.  The public will not be convinced if the Minister decides that what was useful in the past is not useful now. It will not wash in the context of the Bill given the lack of action in relation to twins as multiple births and the disabled person's maintenance allowance provisions. The Minister has been in office for two years now and people expect to <Col N="1014" /> get more than 48 per cent of the amount the Minister called for in Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister is not willing to accept this amendment.  When one becomes Minister one's perspective changes, particularly the Minister for Social Welfare who gives the lowest percentage increase and realises one has hung oneself on a hook and cannot get off it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a point in saying that the commission's figures are out of date but if the Minister agreed with the principle of the amendment and inserted an updated poverty line figure, this side of the House would not object. The Minister's problem with the proposal is that if we agreed on a standard for the poverty line, every rise in payments he announces as Minister could be measured against an independent yardstick.  In other words, the Minister knows because he proposed this that he has failed his own test.  The 2.5 per cent increase only translates into a rise of £1.50 or £2 a week.  If one were to factor in the inflation rate and the growth in the economy and the increase was measured against an independent measurement, it would be clear to people that they were not getting a rise.</P>
      <P>To protect his own integrity the Minister should agree to establish a poverty line in the social welfare code &mdash; an independent measure which would be adjusted each year and indexed in line with the consumer price index.  The Minister should also agree that the basic line would be reviewed every five years by an independent body based on the general growth in the economy.  It is important that the rising tide lifts all boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was long on rhetoric.  He talked about commissions and bodies but they do not impress the people. They want action.  The people I represent will always ask what an increase means in monetary terms.  They know that commissions are established and publish reports but it is action that counts.  The Minister made great play of the rises in child benefit but such rises <Col N="1015" /> benefit everybody, including very high earners.  When the Minister refers to child benefit he neglects to mention that 70,000 people come out of the system each year and only 48,000 go into it because the birth rate has dropped.  The cost of giving generous increases in child benefit is nothing like the Minister makes out because the birth rate has dropped so dramatically.  That is a simple demographic fact.  The Minister knows that in time one can give more generous increases in child benefit at much less cost because of the drop in the birth rate.</P>
    <P>This amendment is based on what the Minister previously proposed.  The Minister might even propose to amend the amendment's subsection (2) (c) to cover each child under 21 years of age in full-time education, so that all dependent children, particularly those of people in receipt of social welfare allowances or benefits, are covered.  We would thereby do something to ensure that the children of those dependent on social welfare can avail of grants to go to third level education.</P>
    <P>The acid test by which the Minister's performance will be measured is how he has fulfilled the promises and proposals he made in Opposition.  The public seems to have made up its mind already given that Democratic Left is at 1 per cent in the opinion polls.  The consensus among the public is that there has been less improvement and reform in social welfare during the Minister's tenure than under any Fianna Fáil Minister. Fianna Fáil is proud that it created the system and developed it.  The Minister is not willing to have an independent measure of his performance because he knows he would fail his own test.</P>

I have been informed by his Department that it does not have that information, that the Central Statistics Office might be in a position to provide such.

      <P>(a)  the said employment commences on or after the 6th day of April, 1996, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> (b)  in any other case, where, subject to such conditions and in such circumstances as may be prescribed, the person employed in either of the said employments, elects to be an employed contributor within the meaning of section 9 (1)  (a).&rsquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the extension of Class A social insurance to people who take up community employment or who participate in the part-time job opportunities pilot programme sponsored by the Conference of Religious of Ireland &mdash; CORI &mdash; on or after 6 April 1996. Having considered the question of extending full social insurance to community employment and CORI workers and in the light of views recently expressed by interested groups, I have decided to provide such workers who commence employment prior to 6 April 1996 with the option of paying full social insurance, that is Class A, contributions.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated to Deputy Joe Walsh on Committee Stage that this issue was being examined with a view to tablng an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which such workers may elect to pay Class A contributions will be set out in regulations. What I have in mind is that such workers who wish to pay full social insurance will notify their employers and, once a person has elected to pay Class A contributions, he or she will be required to continue to pay the full rate contribution for the duration of their employment in community employment schemes or participation in the CORI part-time job opportunities pilot programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this worthy scheme administered by FÁS under the aegis of CORI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment, which will allow people the option of paying the considerably higher Class A social insurance contributions, is also welcomed since such contributions will reap benefits well worth the additional cost <Col N="1018" /> involved and, ultimately, entitle people to a contributory pension.  Where feasible, this option should be allowed in all cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the provisions of this amendment relate to people who participate in other progrmmes or schemes not run by CORI?  Does the Minister consider it essential to confine that option to those schemes or can it be broadened to cater for, say, women in the home who would be anxious to participate if they could benefit?</P>

      <P>I welcome the support for my amendment.  The position with regard to community employment and the programme sponsored by CORI is those participants, who pay Class J social insurance contributions at present, are the only people to whom that class applies.  That class is now being replaced by Class A contributions. From 6 April next all new entrants to community employment and the CORI part-time job opportunities pilot programme will be obliged to pay Class A contributions.</P>
      <P>This amendment will afford those at present participating in community employment, the CORI pilot programme, or who take up such employment before 6 April next, to opt for the full Class A contribution but does not extend beyond those categories.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Mary Wallace about women in the home simply does not apply unless they are participants in a community employment scheme or the CORI part-time job opportunities pilot programme.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3b:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  In all cases where a person's application for a disability allowance has been rejected, they shall be entitled to receive within ten days a written statement, in such form as shall be specified by regulation, of the reasons for this rejection.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the improvement of the quality of service provided to recipients of allowances &mdash; in this case we are talking about disability allowance &mdash; responsibility for which has now been transferred to the Department of Social Welfare, we expect such services to be delivered by Departments and their agencies in a friendly and helpful manner and that the greatest degree of information will be provided.  As public representatives we see people ever week in our clinics who want us to obtain information for them on a particular problem or difficulty they have and in my experience the majority of those problems relate to social welfare issues.  These problems result in additional stress and anxiety for claimants who make their applications in <Col N="1020" /> good faith.  They are entitled to a written explanation or statement, within a reasonable length of time, if the application is rejected and ten days, as suggested in this amendment, is adequate. A great deal of pressure would be removed from the Department if it were to issue such explanations because every day on the Order Paper there are questions seeking information for constituents which should be given in the first instance by the Department.  We all know the cost of putting down a Dáil question and the reply thereto is exorbitant. It is a cost to the taxpayer and results in additional work for officials in the Department.  It is another layer of bureaucracy involving the claimant, the local Deputy, Department officials, the Secretary of the Department and, finally, the Minister.  The paper generated in that process and the unnecessary time and administrative work involved is totally out of proportion to the problem which should be resolved at source. If a person's claim is rejected he or she should be given an adequate and comprehensive explanation in writing which would result in a considerable saving for the taxpayer.  I ask the Minister to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have some difficulty with that because I do not know at what point I can ask questions.  On the issue of disability allowances referred to in amendment No. 3b, we were advised <Col N="1023" /> that when the administration aspect is sorted out, improvements will be made.</P>
      <P>We were also advised that when the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities reports there will be further improvements.  I am concerned about that.  Earlier this morning Deputy Ó Cuív was informed that when the report from the Commission on the Family is concluded there will be progress in that area but it will not be available until June 1997.  By then the Minister and the Government will be out of office.  The report from the Commission on the family is being used as an excuse to do nothing.  The reports are good and I am interested in many of them, especially the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the report of the Commission on the Family but we should not delay a decision by a year and a half saying we cannot decide on anything until a report is available.  It is somewhat like the stalling procedures on Committee Stage where we were told we would get answers on Report Stage.  Now we are on Report Stage and there is no answer. I am concerned that while we are raising issues that are important to people whom we represent, we cannot get real answers.  We are told it is not appropriate to ask such questions today but to ask them when the report is available, although the report will not be available for a year and a half.  It is wrong to delay answering in this manner.  I do not wish to take from the importance of the reports of these commissions which will be milestones in the history of the State. While we await these reports anxiously, they should not be an excuse for doing nothing in the meantime.  I am concerned that there are repetitions of this throughout the Bill.</P>

      <P>As I was explaining to the Deputy, this is one of the most innovative social welfare Bills for many years.  We are debating sections all of which are positive, give new rights to people in receipt of social welfare, increase the amounts of money they will receive, and the protection of people on social welfare and those who are paying PRSI contributions.  The amendment the Deputy tabled seeks to provide for a written reply or a written explanation of the refusal of an appeal. Section 31 provides regulatory powers to specify procedures to be followed on decisions by deciding officers and appeals officers on social welfare payments and on determinations by officers of health boards in relation to claims for supplementary welfare allowance. These powers will be used to provide that all such decisions and determinations will be given in writing and will <Col N="1025" /> set out the reason for an adverse decision.</P>
      <P>By saying she is not getting answers and is not getting action, the Deputy only indicates that she has failed to read the Bill.  She is wasting the time of the House by tabling an unnecessary amendment.  She is requesting that replies be provided within ten days when the practice is that replies and written explanations are provided within three to four days.  The attempt by the Deputy to imply that nothing is being done is wrong.  She is confused, primarily because she has failed to read the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is convinced I will be out of office by June 1997.  She is wrong on two counts.  First, the general election is not due until November 1997.  I advise her not to go to the starting line just yet. Second, it is for the electorate to decide whether I will be in office or out of office whenever the general election takes place.  She may have an opinion as to what will happen just as I have.  I would be happy to go before the electorate on the basis of this social welfare Bill alone because of the range of improvements in it.  I have no fear of the judgment of the electorate in this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wallace refers to reports and commissions.  Reports and commissions are important.  They help us to draw on the expertise of various people whom we might not otherwise have available to us to examine complex issues and questions to which there are more than one answer.  It is important that we use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My record in this Department indicates that I do not sit on reports.  When the report on child benefit was presented to me in January 1995 I acted on it within three weeks by implementing some of its recommendations and I continue to act on it.  When I established the task force on security for the elderly at the beginning of February, I gave it a target date for presenting its report to me by the end of February.  It did so and within a matter of two months we now have a <Col N="1026" /> Government decision on the recommendations of that task force already in place and already being acted upon.</P>
    <P>This must be interesting to the Opposition benches.  If Members listened to what I have been saying they might not repeat the mistakes they have repeated this morning.  They are not interested in what the Minister has to say in response to the questions they have asked.  There is no point in asking questions if they will not listen to the answers.</P>

The evidence is that when I receive a report I act on it.  I have no doubt when the national anti-poverty strategy report is presented to Government it will be acted upon and when the report of the Commission on the Family, which is to be out by June 1997, is presented to Government it will be acted upon.  I have no doubt either that it will be this Government which acts on it.</P>

He spoke arrogantly about not being afraid to face the electorate and so on but is this what he is doing?  When I was in Dublin West I wondered where the Democratic Left members were. Why are they not out talking about the gaisce they are doing in Government and the difference they are making? They are afraid to face the electorate, to accept this golden opportunity, in a constituency which has all sections of society, from the deprived to the well-off. That party, huddled together in a smoke-filled room, decided it would be humiliated in this by-electon and funked the election to save its bacon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> In page 34, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) Section 4 (4) (a) (as amended by section 11 of the No. 2 Act of 1995) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution for &lsquo;rule 1 (2) (m) and 1 (6) of Part I of the Third Schedule, Rule 3 (3) of Part II of the Third Schedule and Rule 2 of Part III of the Third Schedule,&rsquo; of &lsquo;Rule 1 (2) (m), 1 (2) (u) and 1 (6) of Part I of the Third Schedule, Rule 1 (4) (u) and 3 (3) of Part II of the Third Schedule and Rule 1 (1) (o) and 2 of Part III of the Third Schedule,&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, section 15 provides for regulatory powers to exempt awards made by the hepatitis C tribunal for the assessment of means for the new disability allowance. Amendment No. 7 provides for similar powers to exempt such awards for the assessment of means for all other social assistance payments.  This exemption will apply not only to women to whom the awards are made but also to their spouse or partner in the event of their claiming or being in receipt of a social assistance payment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 provides for a consequential amendment to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, under which the regulations in question will require the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  This is another example of the approach of the Government and myself to problems that arise &mdash; we look at how it can be solved and take action. I am sure this amendment will have the support of the Opposition Deputies in the interests of the women, and some men, who will go before the tribunal and may receive compensation for their claims.</P>

No Member should pat himself or herself on the back for doing what we can in this case.  We must bear in mind that these people were contaminated by blood which they had a right to assume would be perfect at the time they received it.  As a result, it behoves us to bend over backwards to ensure there are no difficulties with regard to the compensation due to the infected women, which will be badly needed in the years ahead.  These people did not ask to be infected in this way and if they could turn back the clock they would be delighted to do so.  We agree with any statutory measure in this regard and we also called for the setting up of the tribunal on a specific basis but it has not been possible for the Government to agree.  We agree with those amendments because we are glad to support anything which will help the infected women.</P>

      <P>I also support these amendments, which are humane and take into account the plight of these women.  It is only proper that they should have been introduced to ensure those infected by hepatitis C are not disadvantaged in any way in terms of payments made.  Those people have suffered sufficient trauma already and are entitled to any payments they receive subject to these amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 proposes to delete from the Principal Act the phrase, under a lease which was certified by the Irish Land Commission to be bona fide and in accordance with sound land use practice.  The REPS scheme, which benefits people who use land in an environmentally friendly way, has not be covered in the Bill.  When will a similar measure for REPS come into effect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4a:</P>
      <P>In page 36, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PART X</P>
      <P>44.  &mdash;(1)  The Minister shall, following consultation with representative bodies, including representatives of claimants, establish a &lsquo;Charter of Rights&rsquo; for claimants.</P>
      <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Charter of Rights shall contain provisions in relation to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the right to have all personal dealings conducted in a manner and place which is conducive to privacy and is easily accessible;</P>
      <P>(b)  the right to be treated with courtesy and respect;</P>
      <P>(c)  the right to be presumed honest;</P>
      <P>(d)  the right to full access to services and fair treatment irrespective of political, religious, cultural or sexual orientation;</P>
      <P>(e)  the right to confidentiality and to have access to all relevant information contained on his or her computer file;</P>
      <P>(f)  the right to an explicit and transparent system for making complaints and the right to a speedy response to such complaints;</P>
      <P>(g)  the right to an oral hearing in the event of an appeal;</P>
      <P>(h)  the right to full and total information including eligibility criteria at the time of application;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  the right to be advised within a period of not more than four working days of the lodgement of an application within the meaning of this section, to be advised of the identity of the person empowered <Col N="1032" /> with the task of determining the application.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This issue involves the provision of services by the Department of Social Welfare which should grant courtesy and the greatest degree of civility to claimants as their claims are processed through to decision stage.  In my opinion a charter of rights represents a very desirable innovation.  Other Departments have shown a far more enlightened attitude to this matter than the current Minister for Social Welfare.  I was disappointed that the Minister rejected this amendment on Committee Stage and voted against it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's action is in direct contrast to the policy of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry which introduced a charter of rights for farmers some months ago.  It was correct to do so because farmers making claims for payments at local Department offices complained that such offices were inadequate in terms of providing them with the privacy and courtesy necessary to attend to their business.  They also complained that the regulations and guidelines issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry were inadequate and must be made more straightforward and that the application forms were complex and difficult to understand.  A similar situation obtains in the Department of Social Welfare.  In terms of agricultural and farming activities, applicants can obtain the information and services they require from a range of State agencies, consultancies and advisory services such as Teagasc. This is not the case with social welfare claimants.</P>
    <P>Members of the most deprived sectors of Irish society are at a disadvantage when completing complex application forms, receiving information and applying for aid under the various services. On Committee Stage Members inquired about particular regulations and statutory instruments.  The officials of the Department made available a particular statutory instrument which had not been available to Members, not <Col N="1033" /> to mention the general public.  I appreciate the fact that we received the statutory instrument in question, but all guidelines should be published and made generally available.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I also referred to a study carried out by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed. The INOU has made some progress in regard to having itself accepted as a representative body, but not as much as it should because a substantial number of Irish people are unemployed. This organisation should be entitled to a full consultancy role in all relevant fora.</P>
    <P>The report of the INOU inquired if reception areas are available at employment exchanges and offices throughout the country.  It was discovered that, while such areas are available in 45 per cent of the offices in urban districts, they are available in only 18 per cent of rural districts.  The entire study suggests that, in general, rural areas are more disadvantaged than urban areas.  Surely claimants and poor people in rural areas are entitled to avail of the courtesy and facilities available to people in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight the disadvantage experienced in an area I represent, namely Castletownbere.  The Department of Social Welfare, and I assume the Minister, decided to close the social welfare office in Castletownbere, even though it is 60 miles to Bantry, the nearest town.  The road along the peninsula on which Castletownbere is situated is in a state of disrepair and cannot even be described as a secondary road.  A telephone answering machine was installed in the social welfare office and an official travels there once a week to monitor incoming calls.  If a person cannot visit the office on the day in question, he or she is obliged to travel to Bantry or Caherciveen in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>This represents a withdrawal of services to an isolated farming area which is quite poor and the lives of social welfare claimants in Castletownbere have disimproved as a result.  Offices in certain areas of the country have been improved and upgraded to information <Col N="1034" /> offices.  This is proper because people are entitled to the best information on which to base their claims.  The INOU's report states that up to date, relevant information is only available in 29 per cent of cases in rural areas.  The report also states that information can be obtained for &ldquo;take away&rdquo; purposes at 29 per cent of rural employment exchanges, while the figure for urban areas is 50 per cent.  On average, 46 per cent of respondents stated that they obtained no information at their employment exchanges and 24 per cent made a similar claim in the case of health clinics.  We must try to remedy that and improve the physical environment in which people make their claims.  People should not have to queue on the street outside employment exchanges, particularly in inclement weather.  There are inadequate facilities for the disabled and that is scandalous. There is access for those with disability in 70 per cent of urban exchanges but only in 43 per cent of rural ones, which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Women are treated shabbily.  In many cases they are homemakers and must mind their children.  The report states there is a safe place for children to wait in 14 per cent of rural exchanges but there are no toilet or nappy changing facilities.  We must improve the quality of the delivery of the services.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to privacy.  The humilitation of making a case, which involves giving personal details, within earshot of those in the queue is profound. I stated on Committee Stage I was pleased at the finding that staff are courteous, helpful and seek to facilitate claimants in every way.  However, the report states that there is great need for extra staff, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum, the Commission on Social Welfare, INOU and other concerned representative groups support this amendment which seeks to have guidelines, Statutory Instruments, regulations and supporting leaflets and documentation from the Department not only published but made generally available. <Col N="1035" /> Internal documents should also be made generally available.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we debated the issue of the Department seeking to recover overpayments.  We believe six years is too long.  The executor of a will may not be financially well off.  In some cases solicitors may not give the best possible advice and put an adequate amount of money aside to cover overpayment by the Department.  They may advise their client to disburse the moneys and leave it to the executor to meet the liability.  Solicitors and accountants whose clients are social welfare recipients should have all the relevant material made available to them.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Department of Social Welfare, the only Department to use the electronic media in a useful way. It gives up-to-date information on Aertel and on popular programmes such as &ldquo;Live at Three&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As regards appeals, people are often confused and are not aware of their entitlements or their right to an oral hearing.  It is more effective if people make their own cases and have someone to support them.  There should be a charter of rights for social welfare recipients.  This group, who have drawn the short straw in society, are entitled to have the services delivered to them in a friendly, courteous and confidential way.</P>
    <P>We do not intend to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare should draw up a charter of rights for social welfare recipients. The Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Health have such charters.  On admission to hospital patients can receive a copy of the charter. This gives them a sense of security and raises the level of staff consciousness. While 99 per cent of staff are friendly and informative the other 1 per cent who may deal with telephone queries in a sharp manner often cause problems for the elderly.  When I telephoned <Col N="1036" /> a particular office recently I was greeted with the response &ldquo;Smith&rdquo; and not by the name of the section.  I could not believe I was answered in this manner. I accept it may have been an isolated incident and that the majority of staff are informative and courteous.  I could tell &ldquo;Smith&rdquo; that is not the way to answer the telephone, that an elderly or sick person might be put off by such a response.  The Minister for Health believed it was necessary to introduce a charter of rights for patients and I fail to understand why the Minister for Social Welfare does not do so.</P>
      <P>The 1996 report on standard of service for welfare recipients shows a marked difference between services in urban and rural areas and between employment exchanges and health clinics. The Minister should examine this matter.  It is interesting to note that only 1 per cent of people in urban areas compared with 71 per cent in rural areas said they have to queue outside employment exchanges.  A 12 year old child who started post-primary school in Navan once told me about the great place in Navan where people get money for queuing on the footpath outside the building.  She said that every day when the children are on their lunch break people queue on the street outside the building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It was three or four years ago.  Fortunately, the position changed when the new offices were provided two years ago.  This report, dated January 1996, states that 71 per cent of people in rural areas have to queue outside employment exchanges.  I can understand the Minister asking if that child made those comments in the last century because only 1 per cent of people in Dublin said they had to queue outside employment exchanges.  Therefore, the Minister may not be familiar with the problem.  I am not criticising him, I am merely highlighting the report's findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> A total of 50 per cent of people in urban areas compared with 7 per cent in rural areas said they had privacy when making their cases.  There is also a marked difference between the operations of employment exchanges and health clinics.  While only 7 per cent believed they had enough privacy when making their case in employment exchanges, a total of 80 per cent of those attending health clinics believed that to be the case.  Perhaps this stems from the fact that there is a charter of rights in the Department of Health and not in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The charter of rights gives a sense of security to patients, particularly public patients.  They are aware that they have rights even though they are not paying large sums of money for their medical care.  Social welfare recipients are entitled to a similar charter.  The fact that they are getting benefits from the Department should not mean that they do not have rights.</P>
    <P>Some old age pension applicants left school in the 1930s and the 1940s at 11 or 12 years of age and may not have excellent literacy skills.  It may be difficult for them to complete the relevant application form.  Amendment No. 4a states that the charter of rights should contain provisions on the right to have all personal dealings conducted in a manner and place which is conducive to privacy and easily accessible, the right to be treated with courtesy and respect and the right to be presumed honest.  Is there a difficulty with enshrining that in a charter of rights?  All employment exchanges should be accessible.  I do not know if that is the case at present.  Many people are unaware of their entitlements and do not understand how to apply for certain benefits.  A charter of rights could be beneficial in that regard. I am not saying that staff are unhelpful but in the 1990s people may presume that everyone can read and write: that is an unsafe presumption.  I am also concerned that people who work in nine to five jobs and deal with many files may simply regard an application as another <Col N="1038" /> case.  People apply for an old age pension, disability benefit or invalidity pension once in their lives and it is a big issue for them.  It is, therefore, essential that they are dealt with in a private, courteous and respectful manner.  The vast majority of people treat applicants in this way and there is nothing wrong with the Department of Social Welfare setting out in a charter of rights for social welfare recipients.  If it has nothing to hide or to be afraid of then the Department should introduce a charter of rights similar to the one introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The Minister's refusal to accept this amendment gives rise to questions about his commitment to transparency and the protection of people's rights.  A charter of rights is a basic right.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (h) provides for the right to full and total information, including eligibility criteria, at the time of application. On Committee Stage we referred to elderly people in rural areas who keep their savings in their homes and are afraid of being robbed.  It was pointed out that an applicant for a pension is entitled to have £2,000 in savings which is disregarded.  How many elderly people know the first £2,000 in savings is disregarded?  If this information was given in the application form elderly people would know that the Department would not take it into account in the assessment of eligibility.  As Deputy Walsh correctly stated, one of the main concerns of elderly people is that they will have enough money for their burial which may cost £1,000-£2,000.  The Department has told me that they are entitled to have this amount of money in savings and it will not be taken into account in the assessment of eligibility.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we referred <i>ad infinitum</i> to the application of a notional rather than an actual rate of interest to sums over £2,000 and I hope we got our message across.  The Department might not be too anxious to tell people who receive a 0.25 per cent rate in the bank that they use a notional rate of 10 per <Col N="1039" /> cent and I hope it will change this practice following the debate on Committee Stage.  If people knew that the first £2,000 was disregarded and every £1,000 after that treated in a certain way they would be able to calculate their entitlement. The Department should not be afraid to set out the criteria in the application form.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (i) proposes that the charter of rights should contain provisions in relation to &ldquo;the right to be advised within a period of not more than four working days of the lodgement of an application within the meaning of this section, to be advised of the identify of the person empowered with the task of determining the application&rdquo;.  It is not too much to expect the Department of Social Welfare to acknowledge the receipt of application forms.  For example, it should be possible for the Department to write to people informing them that their application for an old age pension has been received and is being dealt with by Margaret Smith who can be contacted at a certain number.  This would mean people could telephone Margaret Smith and ask her when a decision would be made on their application.</P>
    <P>I presume everyone, including the Minister, would agree to the inclusion of all these provisions in a charter of rights. It is extraordinary in the era of transparency that the Department is afraid to adopt a charter of rights similar to those adopted in other Departments.  It is not too late for the Minister to say there is nothing to hide in the Department of Social Welfare that all applicants for funding, benefits and allowances are treated as valuable customers, presumed to be honest and always treated with courtesy and respect; their matters are dealt with in a private way and there is no problem providing information on the eligibility criteria.  If this is the type of system the Minister would like to see operated in the Department then he should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to <Col N="1040" /> know where to begin.  On the many allegations made by Deputies Wallace and Walsh about long queues in the rain, there are no reports in my Department of such cases.  To give the impression that everyone who goes to a social welfare office faces a long queue in the rain is wrong and inaccurate.  It is also unfair in terms of the progress made by the Department of Social Welfare in recent years in improving its office accommodation and facilities so that people can be dealt with in a private manner.  I have visited a number of social welfare offices and much of the work done predated my appointment as Minister.  The criticisms the Deputies opposite are laying at the door of the Department of Social Welfare are in effect criticisms of their party colleagues when they were in the Department.</P>

      <P>It is inaccurate criticism and I must defend Deputy Woods against the allegations being made against him by his party colleagues in relation to the services provided by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rights a person has as a citizen can neither be limited nor enhanced by a charter which is simply a statement of rights.  The absence of availability of a charter of rights should neither enhance nor restrict those rights.  People have rights under the law.  They have rights as citizens under the Constitution and they have a right to information.  One of the innovations I introduced was the arrangement with the Department of Health whereby my Department would take responsibility for the National Social Service Board which runs 80 citizens' information centres around the country.  Last year and this year I gave them significant additional resources to develop their information services, to put the voluntary information services they provide on a full-time and more professional basis to ensure that the <Col N="1041" /> information being provided is accurate and reliable.</P>
    <P>The Department, through the National Social Service Board, also funds a range of independent information providers.  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed is a case in point with centres for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>There is a whole range of independent information providers which the Department currently funds in order to ensure that people who may be reluctant, for whatever reason, to come to a Department of Social Welfare office to seek information or clarification on some point will have an independent source from which they get information on which they can rely.  They can then come to the Department with that information under their belt and discuss their problem or claim with a Department of Social Welfare official in an informed way.</P>
    <P>We are encouraging access to independent information and are developing a comprehensive information service within the Department itself.  It is my understanding that virtually every public office of the Department of Social Welfare has information leaflets available to the public.  When an application form is posted to a person it is accompanied by an information leaflet on the payment they may be seeking.  It is not always possible to ensure that a person who picks up an application form in an office will also pick up the relevant information leaflet, but we do our best to ensure that people have the information they need.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the population do not need information about social welfare.  It is only when a person needs a particular payment, for example, unemployment assistance or disability, or when they come to the point of looking for an old age or retirement pension, child benefit etc., that they start looking for information.  The most important matters the Department has to publicise are where people may access information and the schemes for which the <Col N="1042" /> Department of Social Welfare is responsible. It is not unusual for people to assume that the Department is responsible for a particular scheme for which the Department of Health, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Education or the Department of Agriculture may be responsible.</P>
    <P>We are also trying to provide integrated services.  There is an excellent example of this in Tallaght which is providing services in one building in an integrated way for the health board, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Enterprise and Employment through FÁS.  There we have a building where a receptionist will direct people to the appropriate office.  If they are looking for a rent supplement, they can be directed to the community welfare officer.  If they are looking for unemployment assistance, they can be directed to the section of the building where unemployment assistance is dealt with.  If they are looking for assistance in relation to community employment schemes they can be directed to the FÁS office.  All this takes place in a bright, newly-constructed, purpose-built building.  That is an example of the future in the provision of our social services. I would advise any Deputy interested in seeing what the future holds for the provision of social services to contact the Department which will be more than happy to provide a guided tour to any Deputy who cares to go and have a look.  I think they will be impressed, as I have been, with the work that has been done.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that that building and the planning of it predated my coming into this Department. It was the foresight of previous occupants of this Department and the staff of the Department that resulted in that facility.  It is not a question of the world starting on 15 December 1994 as far as the Department of Social Welfare is concerned.  The Bill before this House and the changes and additions I have made since I came into office have <Col N="1043" /> enhanced the work that went on previously and I am quite proud of that fact.</P>
    <P>I support the objectives underlying the amendments being proposed by Deputies Walsh and Wallace, but I do not agree with the approach they adopt. I do not believe we should set out to achieve a better quality of social services in a fragmented way in the manner proposed by the Deputies.  We should take a more co-ordinated approach to social services generally, and the Government's strategic management initiative provides an ideal mechanism to enable this to be done.  Considerable progress has already been made by my Department in improving the quality of service in the context of the strategic management initiative.  This initiative has presented my Department with the opportunity to build on the various initiatives and developments of recent years.  High priority within the SMI process has been given to the development over the past year of a customer service strategic action programme, the primary objective of which is to develop and build upon existing customer service culture across all activities of the Department.</P>
    <P>This programme is now in place, and its principal objectives are as follows: to equip our staff to deliver quality customer service, specify and publish measurable customer service quality standards, and support action to ensure standards continue to be met; to identify new and improved methods for systematically measuring and responding to customer needs; to put in place participative structures for our customers, provide quality information and advice, provide reasonable choice for customers in relation to methods of service delivery, and promote an integrated approach with each other public service to the local delivery of social services and to develop the one-stop shop concept.</P>
    <P>The objectives of this programme are very much in line with the recommendations of the National Economic and <Col N="1044" /> Social Forum report on quality delivery of services which was published in February 1995.  My Department is giving priority attention to the implementation of the recommendations in the NESF report.  Significant progress has already been made, a fact acknowledged in the NESF report.  The following are some of the initiatives taken by my Department over the past few years: more services are now provided locally: there have been substantial improvements in the time taken to process claims; different methods of payment have been introduced; and new offices have been provided and older offices systematically refurbished with the provision of access for people with disabilities.  Better access and more privacy are also being provided for.  I visited last week an office in Drogheda refurbished in the past year, the front part of which has been redesigned to ensure that a person who wants a private conversation with an official can be facilitated in a private part of the reception area.  Increasingly, private rooms are provided for interviews where an official wishes to have a private interview with a claimant.</P>
    <P>Other improvements include the introduction of a regional management structure which has enabled a more focused and co-ordinated approach to the delivery of a quality service to customers at local level.  This has in addition enabled better co-operation with local and community groups involved with social welfare customers. Experience elsewhere indicates that the publication of a charter will not of itself improve the quality of service.  It is necessary in the first instance to involve those availing of the services and the front line staff in identifying how services can be improved in a realistic and meaningful way.  The objective essentially is to seek to improve the quality of services, where feasible.</P>
    <P>Charters, particularly those designed with a &ldquo;top down&rdquo; approach can, unfortunately, at times fail to make a real difference to the client and efforts tend to be directed at the exhaustive measurement and analysis it entails.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> In addition to work being undertaken in the context of the SMI, I bring to the attention of Deputies the commitment in paragraph 71 of the Programme for Government to introduce, following consultation with the social partners, an administrative procedures Bill aimed at securing the maximum compliance with the tenets of good public administration. As set out in the Programme for Government, this Bill will vest in the office of the Ombudsman monitoring and regulatory functions and will incorporate requirements on a minimum response time to a citizen's case, the level of guidance to be given to the public, the form in which decisions are communicated, setting out for instance the basis of the decision, the right of appeal, the right of access to all relevant information in the case and the right of citizens to confer with officials making the decision concerning them.  The Government programme also provides that legislation &mdash; including the administrative procedures Bill &mdash; will be introduced to extend the remit of the Ombudsman. Interdepartmental consultations are currently taking place with a view to finalising proposals for consideration by the Government in advance of the promised discussion with the social partners. The developments I have outlined represent a better and much more comprehensive approach than that proposed in the amendments for achieving the highest possible quality of social welfare service.  Consequently, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had been in any doubt about the desirability of and the need for a social charter, I am in no doubt now.  The Minister has shown a degree of ignorance of the system, how it works and the lack of facilities that is very worrying.  The evidence I used dates from January 1996.  The Minister cannot be content to rest on the good work of his predecessor.  We need some degree of imagination, innovation and good sense during his term.  He has to deal with the question of queuing.  I <Col N="1046" /> know the Minister has not been canvassing in the by-election and that he is cosseted in his Department with his apparatchiks who have a cosy arrangement. However, it does rain occasionally, during the winter the weather is inclement and it is often quite blustery and this is not conducive for people seeking information or claiming social welfare payments.  In case the Minister is still unaware of the problem, the organisation for the unemployed conducted a survey on the numbers who have to queue for social welfare services and it found that this happens in 71 per cent of cases.  To my certain knowledge that is the case in many towns throughout rural Ireland.  There are provisions for disability access in only 43 per cent of places which rises to 70 per cent in urban areas.  Is it right and proper to have disabled people further humiliated by being lifted into these buildings? That is not the way we should go about our business.  When other Departments have a more enlightened approach I cannot understand the reason the Department of Social Welfare seeks to further humiliate the unfortunate people who depend on dole.  We are not talking about a small number of people but up to 300.000.  The Minister went on to say that perhaps people do not need so much information but of course they do.</P>

      <P>If the Minister says he did not say it I accept it, but that was what I picked up.  We need the maximum amount of information.  I have examples and so do other Deputies every single week of people in difficulty because they did not have adequate information at the outset.  Why can we not inform people on the threshold of eligibility when they are making their application so that they might make a more detailed application in the first place?  One has to presume the claimant is honest before you do that and there is the underlying suspicion that people <Col N="1047" /> are not.  When I raised the question of the assessment of people's savings in the past couple of days, saying I felt it was wrong to charge a notional interest rate which was higher than those available, the Minister made a comment &mdash; this is certainly on the record &mdash; that perhaps these people were avoiding tax.  The presumption is that people are not honest and are in some way conniving to get something to which they are not entitled.  People are entitled and should be entitled to be presumed honest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of information, a Cheann Comhairle, I do not want it to stand on the record that I stated or implied that people who apply for old age non-contributory pensions were seeking to avoid tax, the point clearly was that where a person does not divulge the fact that he or she has capital is indicated by the fact that we have been able to recover £3 million from the estates of those who died.  The question arose as to why people do not divulge that they have capital.  It is alleged by Opposition Members that it is because of the notional rates of interest we apply to capital and I indicated that there are perhaps other reasons that people do not disclose they have capital.  One of the reasons may be that they are not prepared to pay tax on it.</P>

      <P>On a point of order it is important it does not go on record that the Department of Social <Col N="1048" /> Welfare presumes a person to be dishonest when he or she applies to it.  I stated on Committee Stage yesterday that the values of the Department clearly imply that a person is presumed to be honest in making his applications but it must be assumed that if a person fails deliberately to disclose the fact that he has capital, when he is obliged to do so on the application form, it gives rise to the belief that he is not acting honestly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <P>We are making slow progress on this amendment and we are anxious to bring it to a conclusion. I am sure the Deputy will bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Acting Chairman may not realise it was agreed that a number of amendments should be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a notion of a grudging acceptance that claimants are honest, but one never knows.  That is not good enough.  The Department has a responsibility to address the question from which this matter arose.  I cited the not unusual case of a person who, having met the necessary criteria, qualifies for a non-contributory pension but makes savings from his or her pension, bringing his or her means over the income threshold for pension eligibility, while being in receipt of meals on wheels and various other services.  That pensioner who is so concerned about the rainy day hardly dips into his or her pension.  The Department of Social Welfare has a responsibility regularly to review the means of non-contributory claimants in receipt of assistance or pensions. While the administrator or the executor has a responsibility to make a repayment in some cases, the Department also has responsibility to carry out regular reviews.  A claimant's means may have exceeded the income threshold for pension eligibility since he or she completed a pension application in a honest, careful and responsible manner. I do not know how often such <Col N="1049" /> reviews are carried out, but some order should apply to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy would accuse us of harassing elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department should ensure that it keeps up to date on these matters.</P>
      <P>This issue relates to the provision of more information and openness.  The Government has abused the term &ldquo;openness, transparency and accountability&rdquo;. The Minister is not adhering to those principles in blocking an attempt to make a charter of rights available to social welfare claimants.  This is another case of the Government paying lip service to openness, transparency and accountability, but not showing its commitment to those principles when it comes to implementing measures.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday a constituent who recently buried her mother called to my clinic to inquire about her entitlements. She told me she was 49 years of age and for the past 25 years had looked after her mother.  On inquiring if she was in receipt of a carer's allowance or an allowance from the health board or the Department of Social Welfare, she said she did not know she was entitled to any allowance.  I told her that was regrettable as she would have been entitled to an allowance under some of the schemes and that I would seek to rectify the matter.  This is a classic and not infrequent case of a person who did not have any idea of her entitlements.  A charter of rights would go some way towards improving that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On contacting the invariably courteous staff in regional social welfare offices to follow up a case, we are told that they can only take the essential details of the case from the computer as the file is kept in the offices in Ballina or Sligo.  I do not understand why such files cannot be kept in regional offices. That would allow claimants to have greater access to their files.  Claimants are informed in writing of the reasons their applications were unsuccessful but <Col N="1050" /> are not given the full information.  Such files may contain information which may not be credible.  The full facts are elicited only in cases where there is an oral hearing.  A charter of rights would ensure that claimants would have access to all the information on their files.</P>
    <P>Sections of the Bill deal with social insurance and provide for improvements in that area.  A provision improving the position of community employment scheme workers was discussed this morning.  All contributors and those who may be potential contributors to social insurance should be made aware of their rights and entitlements under social insurance schemes.  I asked a question in this regard on Committee Stage to which I was told I would be given an answer on Report Stage.  I was told that inquiries would be made to establish if Telecom workers are aware of their pension and other rights in respect of modified and full social insurance.  That type of information is elementary and should be made available. This amendment seeks the establishment of such rights.  There is no point in the Minister replying that we have a Constitution, statutory instruments and legislation.  I do not understand why a charter of rights, which other Departments and those availing of services from other Departments find useful, cannot be established by the Department of Social Welfare.  The right to confidentiality, an explicit and transparent complaints system, speedy responses, an oral hearing in the event of an appeal and access to all information, including eligibility criteria, is elementary.  It would be extremely helpful and go a long way towards demonstrating our maturity as a democracy if such information were available in a charter of rights.</P>
    <P>Claimants are entitled to be informed of the identity of the departmental staff with whom they deal.  A former Minister, Mr. John Boland, was a reforming Minister for the Public Service.  He introduced some worthwhile advances in this regard, but we have slipped back since then.  It is unsatisfactory that staff <Col N="1051" /> in various Departments do not state their Christian and surnames when dealing with the public.  Deputy Wallace highlighted this point.  Constituents who call to my clinic often indicate that they did not get the name of the departmental staff member with whom they were dealing.  That is not good enough.  This amendment goes some way towards addressing this problem and I intend to press it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I took part in the Middle East &ldquo;Summit of the Peacemakers&rdquo; at Sharm-El-Sheikh in Egypt on Wednesday, 13 March.  The Summit was convened by Presidents Clinton and Mubarak and I was invited on the basis of Ireland's membership of the EU Troika.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Summit was to demonstrate support for the Middle East peace process; to confront those seeking to undermine it by violence, and to show solidarity with Israel and with the Palestinian Authority.  The attendance of so many leaders from the Middle East showed very clearly the tremendous will for peace and peaceful <Col N="1052" /> co-existence in the region.  The international community's continuing support for the peace process was no less clear, as evidenced by the attendance of all of the G-7 group of nations, as well as representatives of the EU.</P>
    <P>Following the Summit, the co-chairmen issued a statement recording participants' political and economic support for the Middle East peace process, together with their agreement to increase co-operation in the prevention of terrorism.</P>
    <P>As well as contributing to the Summit, I had bilateral meetings with King Hussein of Jordan, President Clinton and Prime Minister Major.  I also had informal discussions with President Yeltsin of the Russian Federation; the UN Secretary General.  Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali; Prime Minister Peres of Israel, and President Arafat of the Palestinian Authority, as well as the Foreign Ministers of Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Yemen and Commissioner Marin of the EU.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Summit had both a practical and symbolic significance. Symbolically, it was very important that leaders from all over the world were willing to go to the Middle East to demonstrate in person their support for Prime Minister Peres and President Arafat.  While it would be wrong to under-estimate the symbolic importance of that gesture, with all the leaders converging in the Middle East at very short notice to demonstrate their commitment, in terms of practical follow-up, as the Deputy will see from the chairman's statement, there was agreement of continued support, economically and politically, for the peace process and for the negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis, which are ongoing.  There will be co-ordinated efforts to deal with terror and the source of funds and arms <Col N="1053" /> for those using terror in the Middle East.</P>

      <P>Obviously, the matters about which the Deputy is concerned were not matters of public concern at the time of the Summit in Sharm-El-Sheikh.  I had a brief conversation with President Mubarak and since he was co-chairman and joint host the opportunity for a lengthy bilateral discussion with him on Irish-Egyptian relations was not open at that juncture. I hope, however, to have a conversation with him later today.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my formal contribution to the Summit I drew attention to the importance of the role played by Irish troops in south Lebanon.  I particularly adverted to that as a practical and immediate contribution by Ireland in the matter, and I did not confine myself to drawing it to the attention of Prime Minister Peres but to the assembled gathering.  The position of the Irish Government in this matter is well known.  The fact that the Government is opening a resident embassy in Tel Aviv will enable us to present more directly to the Israeli authorities than was posssible by external representation Ireland's concern about the safety of our troops and about proper regulation of the position in south Lebanon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Taoiseach has made representations. Will he agree that rather than have a long-term presence of our forces in the south Lebanon area under the UN flag, the preferred solution would be to have peace in south Lebanon?  The role of the Syrians, and the need for peace between Israel and Syria, is of primary importance in that region.  Since that would have been a matter for discussion at the Summit, has the Taoiseach any comment to make on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Syrian track of the peace process is particularly important from the point of view of the position in south Lebanon and also the position around Quneitra in the Golan. Obviously that is a particularly difficult part of the peace process, involving a range of issues relating to military dispositions, settlements, access to water and other matters.  Unfortunately President El Assad was not represented at the Summit in Sharm-El-Sheikh, but notwithstanding his absence Syria remains committed to the peace process. Bilateral meetings, of which I was informed during the Summit, which others have had with President El Assad suggest that he continues to have a strong commitment to the peace process in regard to the matters in dispute between Syria and Israel and also in regard to south Lebanon.</P>

The Ambassador there, Ms Cross, is working effectively in Irish interests in so far as promoting trade is concerned.  The visit of the Czech Prime Minister also afforded as an opportunity to develop our links.  The Prime Minister wrote an article about his visit to Ireland in which he was very complimentary to it and expressed the view his country had known little in the past about Ireland but that he expected to have much greater economic and political links with it in future.  The discussions the Prime Minister and I had will be useful in developing trade links.  A number of business contacts were also made during the visit.</P>

It is one of the fastest growing markets in central Europe.  All agencies have been instructed to do everything possible to develop this market.  There is a question of resources involved.  A number of Irish companies are already active in the Czech market and there are a number of Irish business consultants working in Prague who understand the Irish and Czech situations and are available to assist Irish firms to develop this market.  They have the full support of the embassy.  I am not aware of any problems arising with regard to the potential of the Czech market which relate to a lack of commitment or resources but if such problems are drawn to my attention I will deal with them.</P>

We will do all we can during our presidency to advance the work of the Intergovernmental Conference and conclude it as quickly as possible. Thereby, we will create conditions in which negotiations for enlargement can begin.  However, they will not begin until the Intergovernmental Conference is concluded and, therefore, it would be premature to offer any indications of a <Col N="1057" /> timeframe for the enlargement negotiations.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the role he has outlined for the Government Press Secretary is as a spokesperson or mouthpiece for the Government and that the present incumbent does not have a policy function or grander role, despite rumours to the contrary?

      <P>Yes, I do take advice from my Press Secretary on matters of policy.  It is reasonable that I should do so, just as I take advice on matters of policy from others.  In Government it is best to work as a team, drawing on all the strengths available, and not take the approach that each member has a compartmentalised function entirely separate from those of other members of the Cabinet.

      <P>May I revert to the point made by Deputy Ray Burke on speeches the Taoiseach made aside from his script, particularly some of his American ones?  Fianna Fáil, on being asked to comment recently in America on many of his remarks not included in his script, followed the age old tradition of this House of not criticising the Taoiseach outside the country.  It would be very helpful if, in endeavouring to comment, we could know what he actually said.  Since the Taoiseach has a record, perhaps he could forward it to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In making public speeches it is very important to be able to speak directly to one's audience.  It is <Col N="1061" /> not a particularly effective way of communicating to have one's head buried in a script reading with one's eyes continuously on the page.  It is my view that speaking <i>ex tempore</i> is the best way of communicating not just the meaning of the words one uses but also the feeling that goes into them.</P>
      <P>Particularly when dealing with the peace process, with opposition to violence, it is very important to convey directly to people &mdash; without having to read from a script &mdash; the strong sense of revulsion felt by the overwhelming majority of people in this country at the use of violence.  This was the constant theme of all four of my speeches in the United States.  I will endeavour to obtain transcripts of those speeches, which I do not have at present, because I know the Deputy has a constructive interest in these matters.  I will endeavour to furnish them to him.  In fact I have been attempting to do so.  I can confirm that all of my speeches were based on careful thinking and on scripts I had prepared, which I use as the base document for what I say.  When I speak, I speak straight to my audience, not through a piece of paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No there is not. When one makes four speeches over a two day period, one subject matter will be treated in greater detail in one and another subject in greater detail in another.  One needs to take the composite speeches to get a balanced presentation of what was said.  I was asked questions in the House yesterday about my United States trip.  I clearly outlined the exact basis of what I had been saying there in a very formal way which I read word for word into the Official Report.  That represents the position.  I urge anybody who wishes to study the position in a constructive way, rather than simply endeavour to find something about which to complain, to read what I said yesterday because it sets out clearly the Government's view in regard to the talks that will begin on 10 June next.</P>
      <P>I must reiterate that it was a very difficult achievement to get agreement to a fixed date for talks to begin on 10 June next.  I hope everybody realises what a big achievement it was and what an historic opportunity it presents and will put themselves in a position to avail of it.</P>

I am not certain I have transcripts of all or any of those at present but I will endeavour to get whatever information I can and, on request, will provide it to anybody who is interested.  I should like to compliment my Press Secretary who, as I have now learnt from Deputy Bertie Ahern, is the first Press Secretary who ever placed a Taoiseach in a position to respond to such a request.  Previous Taoisigh would not have been able to provide the Opposition with such transcripts since they would not have taken the precaution of recording speeches.

The projects assisted were as follows: the Europe Week programme dealing with European Union issues on local radio; a project organised by the CARREFOUR network to raise European awareness through local radio and press; an essay competition on Europe for second level transition year students; publication of the information booklet &ldquo;Twenty Questions on the European Union&rdquo; and grants to the Institute of European Affairs, the Irish Council of the European Movement and to the Irish Country Women's Association.  I also circulated, separately, leaflets containing details of the issues which will be on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> The publication of user-friendly material on EU funded schemes was also identified as a priority to be addressed by the report of the Task Force on Communicating Europe and a comprehensive publication in this regard is now close to completion and will be published shortly.  I am satisfied that a comprehensive plan is in place to raise public awareness of important EU issues, including seminars on the Intergovernmental Conference with which I am co-operating with the Irish Council of the European Movement in each Euro-Constituency, and co-operation with the European Commission on a publicity campaign which will endeavour to make the public more aware of the issues being discussed.  The launching of the Government's White Paper on Foreign Policy also illustrates the Government's commitment to greater public awareness of the European ideal.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education, which is represented on the task force, is planning the introduction of a European awareness programme in the school second level transition year to commence in September 1996.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the communicating Europe initiative has been pursued in a balanced and pro-active manner.</P>

      <P>In accepting the Tánaiste's statement that foreign policy should be more accountable and accessible to the people, the publication of this White Paper two days before the Turin Summit represents the greatest fudge in recent times.  It is a waste of taxpayers' money although it is a very glossy production. The Taoiseach may smile but his party, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left put their toes in the water in this very sensitive matter and ran like hell.</P>

If the Minister is relying on the fact that he got two pages in <i>The Irish Times</i> and a nice headline from Paul Gillespie I would advise him to read the smaller print.  Will the Minister accept that the communicating Europe initiative gets only a line or two in the White Paper?  What role will the Task Force on Communicating Europe play in explaining Europe particularly in the light of the Irish Presidency of the European Union?</P>

It will be my pleasure as Minister of State at both Departments to advocate its contents and to ensure the public is made aware of it.</P>

      <P>The structures for the partnerships in County Cavan and County Monaghan were approved by me in January 1996.  Nominations for membership of the partnership boards have been sought from the State agencies, the social partners and the community and voluntary sector.  Nominations from these sectors are currently being completed.  The inaugural meeting for the Monaghan Partnership Board has been set for 18 April 1996.  It is likely that the first board meeting for the Cavan Partnership will also be held during April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past number of months 38 boards have been set up, 34 of which have had their inaugural meetings.  Some 18 months ago when the peace initiative was introduced, EU officials asked that programmes be refocused and that the Border region get specific recognition.  Why is it that counties Cavan and Monaghan are the last two areas where partnership boards are being set up?  A month ago, I outlined to the Taoiseach a number of initiatives where projects were approved all over the country but were not approved in the Border region.</P>

      <P>The setting up of the partnership boards awaited the completion of the structures for Leader II in May 1995.  The Leader companies were given the opportunity to take on the local development programme if they wished.  In counties Cavan and Monaghan it was considered better to do it separately.  The Taoiseach has already announced the appointment of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, to review existing arrangements in order to ensure that the funds for the development of the Border region are maximised for the benefit of those regions.  That is a welcome development.</P>

      <P>So far as temporary civil servants working in my office are concerned, I am employing fewer in that category than my predecessor.  I have seven people in that category.  My predecessor in 1992 had ten people: a <Col N="1077" /> special adviser, a special constituency adviser, a special communications adviser, an adviser on the environment, an arts adviser, a special economic development officer, a personal assistant, a personal constituency assistant, a personal secretary and a personal secretary to the special adviser.  There were ten people then but I now have seven. In 1993, under another previous Taoiseach, also a friend of the Deputy, there were eight people in the offices as against my seven: a special adviser; a special adviser on the constituency; an adviser on the environment; a special economic development officer; a personal assistant; and three personal secretaries. In addition he had the services of Carr Communications at the cost of £35,000.  I have no communications advice of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by the Minister for Finance and Minister for Social Welfare I last met the Central Review Committee on 14 December 1995.  I would be happy to meet the committee at any time that would be mutually useful.  Both I and my colleagues in Government have had a continuing series of high level contacts, both formal and informal, with the social partners, and we remain available to meet them individually or together as the need arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also attended a meeting of the NESC on 19 January 1996, where I requested the council to prepare a strategy report which will inform the negotiations on a new national programme to follow the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The NESF, which has an even wider range of representation than the NESC, is also being <Col N="1082" /> invited to prepare a report on the elements and consultative process of a new national programme.  In addition to the preparation of these formal reports, there is ongoing contact between relevant Government Departments as to the prospects and likely parameters of any successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>With regard to the membership of the CRC, I have received requests from a number of organisations for inclusion in the Central Review Committee which monitors the implementation of national programmes.  The existing Central Review Committee is working well and I have no plans to change it.  A wider range of organisations will contribute to a new programme through their membership of either the NESC, the NESF or both.  In addition, I intend to ensure that in the preparation of any new programme, mechanisms will be developed to allow for a contribution in particular in areas of direct relevance to their members from a wider number of groups than at present and would be happy to receive representation on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I had difficulty hearing most of what the Taoiseach said.  How does he respond to the criticism that there is not the same commitment to social partnership during the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> as existed previously?  There is now growing concern among rank and file trade unionists about a further programme. What is the Government doing about the issues raised by the various branches arising from the lack of tax reform in the last two budgets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is greatly committed to a new programme and I regularly met the social partners with a view to creating the conditions for one.  I am aware of concern in the trade union movement that social partnership exists at national level but not within firms.  However, the creation of social partnership at firm level is not a matter for Government; in the first <Col N="1083" /> instance it is for the employers with whom the unions are dealing.  In my meetings with IBEC, I have encouraged its members to put in place structures for social partnership at firm level.  My record in this matter is particularly good in that I was responsible for the introduction of tax incentives for employee shareholding over the last ten years, all of which give a concrete expression to social partnership at firm level.  My commitment to that is second to none, which should be reassuring to the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as to tax reform, in the last year there has been more rapid creation of employment than in any year in history.  Since I became Taoiseach the number in employment has grown on average by 100 every day. Mortgage rates are lower than ever and a person with an average mortgage is now paying £110 less per month than when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Government.  As far as the family budget is concerned, this Government is ensuring that people who send their children to third level education will not have to pay fees. These measures represent direct financial benefits for employees and workers and indicate a clear commitment on the part of the Government to enhance the living standards of Irish people.</P>

The membership of both bodies is composed of representatives from the organisations to which the Deputy referred.  I have indicated that I am willing to meet the social partners, individually or together, at any time.  I will be glad to meet the central review committee at <Col N="1084" /> any stage such a meeting is deemed useful. My door is open to the social partners at all times.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation's detailed response to the consultants' report which evaluated the completed refurbishment work in the pilot phase, and made recommendations on the future of the Ballymun flats complex, was received in my Department in mid-January. The corporation's proposals are being examined and a decision will be made as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Since completion of the pilot phase, I have approved the corporation's proposals for the reroofing of the spine and tower blocks at an estimated cost of £2.5 million.  I understand that the corporation has sought tenders for this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister of State received the final report of the corporation in mid-January.  I am sure she was not taken by surprise by that report.  The corporation has worked with her Department throughout the evaluation process and the Department received several draft reports on the matter.  Does the Minister of State realise that the previous phase of refurbishment was approved in 1991?  This action was carried out by a Fianna Fáil Minister and a PD Minister of State. Nothing has happened in the interim. Does the Minister of State realise that some people see the evaluation process as a delaying tactic and that morale is beginning to fall?  Unless action is quickly taken, many people will be disappointed and much of the community spirit that was built up will dissipate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It was quite recently that I received the evaluation report from Dublin Corporation.  It is understandable that such a period of time was spent on that evaluation.  This was not my doing.  It is the responsibility of Dublin Corporation and is understandable in the circumstances.  This is a major refurbishment scheme, on an unprecedented scale, and the cost involved is quite significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> I did not claim to be taken by surprise by the contents of the report.  However, I must inform the Deputy that the corporation's response is very extensive and comes to a total of 300 pages.  It includes a main report and two detailed technical reports.  I assure the Deputy that I take this matter seriously but the Department only recently received this extensive report from the corporation. The report contains much information and is being considered with great interest and commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is a very expensive job.  However, the refurbishment for the first two years would only amount to £10 million or £11 million. Does the Minister of State realise that a financial allocation would not be needed this year if she approved the scheme today because much planning and technical work needs to be carried out?  To ensure that work is carried out in 1997, the Minister of State must approve it now so that technical work may commence.</P>
      <P>If the Minister of State will not commit to the complete demolition of the tower blocks, will she permit the corporation to proceed to begin phase ll of the refurbishment?  Phase ll could be divided along the lines of the 1991 scheme and approval given for completion of the outside work.  A gesture is required, even if approval cannot be given for the entire scheme.  Will the Minister permit the corporation to proceed with the technical outside work on phase ll?  This would suffice at present.</P>

      <P>There is a major report from the corporation in my Department which outlines in full the work that must be carried out.  The estimated cost of such work is £110 million.  I have already indicated my desire for progress by sanctioning an allocation of £2.5 million for work for which tenders will be invited.  That is an indication of the commitment I am making to this project.  It does not serve anybody to view this project in terms of short-term, stop-gap <Col N="1087" /> measures.  Dublin Corporation's comprehensive report is being treated with immense seriousness by my Department. The project must be considered in its entirety because of its importance and the implications involved.  If the Deputy is seeking gestures, I have already made a commitment of £2.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>I have recently received a copy of the nationwide survey of public attitudes to litter undertaken by market research consultants for the Irish Business Against Litter Group.  The detailed findings of the survey are being examined in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the IBAL initiative in arranging this survey.  It <Col N="1088" /> complements the survey recently published by my Department which analysed the composition of Irish litter and classified typically littered situations. The results of both surveys reinforce my determination to promote the new Action Against Litter initiative on a sustained and powerful basis.</P>
    <P>The initial stages of Action Against Litter have already begun.  A full policy statement has been published.  I have met with local authority chairpersons and managers to enlist their full support, and my Department has issued guidelines to encourage better local authority performance in litter control.  I have also met with leading business and voluntary sector interests to mobilise their support for, and participation in, Action Against Litter.</P>
    <P>An aggressive multi-media campaign will begin shortly after Easter, aimed at raising public awareness and focusing attention on the incidence of litter in different situations around the country. Video and other educational material to encourage anti litter awareness will be distributed to schools in the coming school term.</P>
    <P>I am also preparing new legislation to replace the Litter Act, 1982.  The new Bill will provide stronger and better powers for local authorities to take more effective action in preventing and controlling litter.</P>
    <P>Information in relation to convictions to date in 1996 under the Litter Act is not available in my Department.  I have, however, given details of prosecutions and convictions in each of the years from 1992 to 1994 in the reply to Question No 34 on 12 December 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In the nationwide survey, 72 per cent of those questioned stated that litter legislation was not enforced. What action does the Minister propose to take to ensure it is enforced and that its enforcement is monitored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult issue. I called together the chairpersons and managers of each local authority to discuss this, one of the most important <Col N="1089" /> environmental initiatives I will undertake. We had an open discussion on law enforcement and I gave the statistics to the local authorities.  The Lord Mayor of Cork stated that one of the difficulties in enforcing the law was that one depends on the co-operation of the offender.  If a person is given an on-the-spot fine of £25 under the Litter Act, 1992 very often they do not give their proper name to the litter warden.  We must change people's attitude towards littering as many offenders do not regard it as a serious issue.  People must realise it is an unacceptable act of environmental vandalism.  I intend to strengthen the law and, through better enforcement procedures, ensure people are aware that we are serious about the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister is laden with good intentions but I am asking for action on the issue.  The Minister has admitted that the existing law is unenforceable.  He cited his encounter with the Lord Mayor of Cork who brought the difficulties experienced in that city to his attention.  The Minister must be convinced that the law is inadequate. When does he intend to update the litter legislation that will be enforceable? In a letter I received from the Minister dated 12 February he stated that he proposes to introduce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is under an illusion if she thinks enactment of a new Bill, which will be published before the summer and hopefully taken this year, will solve the problem.  We need to change people's attitude.  They are not aware of the damage caused by litter to the environment and the economy.  That is why I spoke directly to IBEC.  IBAR brought the industrial leaders together and they have my full support in putting the issue at the top of their agenda.  I outlined a range of initiatives.  We often regard enactment of the law as an end in itself but it is not.  If we are to resolve the litter problem we must do much more than enact legislation.  Not only will we enact legislation but we will launch a campaign to try to bring about a change in attitude.</P>

      <P>I expect to receive within the next week the report of the commission examining town local government, incorporating an earlier interim report. I will be making the report widely available as soon as possible following consideration of its proposals.</P>
      <P>The study on local government financing is being undertaken in two stages.  I received a report from the consultants on 21 February which, among other things, pointed to a need for further analysis of the future expenditure requirements of local authorities. After brief consideration of the matter, I extended the stage 1 contract on 15 March to enable the consultants to carry out, over a period of no more than four weeks, further work on the projected future expenditure needs.  The final stage I report will incorporate this analysis and I will be making it widely available as soon as possible after its completion.  It is my intention that stage 2 of the study will commence without delay after the extended stage 1 contract is completed.</P>

    <P>The terms and conditions for the finance study were set out in the Request for Proposals issued by my Department in April 1995, copies of which are in the <Col N="1094" /> Oireachtas Library.

If we are to sustain local government in the future we need to substantially change the funding arrangement and the powers and functions of local government must be changed.

      <P>I wish to refer to a number <Col N="1151" /> of questions raised by the Deputy during his discussion on the amendment.  In the Bill as initiated, Schedule I deletes obsolete references to the Land Commission in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  The Report Stage amendments which provide for disregarding awards by the hepatitis C tribunal for social assistance payments are being made by way of an amendment to Schedule I.  This approach was taken to avoid having to make a series of technical consequential amendments to other provisions of the Bill.  The existing references referred to land leased under a lease certified by the Irish Land Commission.  As the Land Commission no longer exists, it does not issue such certificates.</P>

      <P>In page 36, line 8, after &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in total&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 44 provides that: &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsection (2), the Minister may, where he considers that the circumstances so warrant, extend, by not more than 6 months, the period within which the Agency is required to draw up and submit for the Minister's approval a strategic plan&rdquo;.  The Combat Poverty Agency has been allocated increased resources in recent years and a substantial amount of its work is now farmed out to consultants.  These consultants have done well, whatever about the people whom the agency is supposed to help.  If consultants are well remunerated and in receipt of substantial amounts of taxpayers' money then they should be required to draw up and publish a report within the shortest <Col N="1154" /> possible period.  There is little point in spending an inordinate length of time drawing up reports when people need to have their situation alleviated or improved.  By the time many reports are published and debated the problem has moved on, so to speak.  If reports are to be of any value they must be published with a certain degree of urgency.  The report on the elderly was published within a few weeks and a considerable amount of money was allocated to deal with a particularly acute problem.  The publication of reports within a certain period is of value.  Six months is a considerable time.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the way in which I would like to see business being done. It is as easy to identify a problem in the short-term as it is in the long-term.  Consideration should be given to the expeditious publication of reports, particularly those of the Combat Poverty Agency which is not short of money and gives good remuneration to the consultancy agencies employed by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes to give the Minister of the day the power to extend the period by six months if he or she deems it necessary to enable the Combat Poverty Agency to produce its three-year strategic plan. It is not a report in the sense of identifying a particular issue.  Rather, it is a plan developed by the agency every three years based on the outcome and effectiveness of the previous three-year strategic plan and it is used to make projections for the following three years and to develop the work of the agency and the various people with whom it works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I took up office I initiated a review of the agency, as provided for in the legislation, and I expect to receive the results shortly.  In addition, the terms of service of most members of the board has expired and new members have to be appointed.  The obligation on the board to produce a strategic plan on 1 January this year was unreasonable given that a review of the agency was being carried out and new board <Col N="1155" /> members would be appointed.  It made sense to enable the new board to find its feet and to take into account the outcome of the previous three-year strategic plan and the review before finalising the next three-year strategic plan.</P>
    <P>That is the reason it is proposed to extend the period by six months.  This is not a permanent extension; it is an option which the Minister of the day may use if he or she sees fit at the time. The Deputy's amendment would effectively kill this provision as it would no longer be capable of being used after the first time &mdash; it could not be extended beyond that.  If the Minister of the day needed the extension at some stage in the future he or she would have to come back into the House to amend the legislation. In all the circumstances it is reasonable to enable the Minister of the day to use his or her judgment as to whether an extension of this kind should be provided.  As the extension may be not more than six months it is limited.</P>
    <P>I understand the thinking behind the amendment but do not necessarily accept the points made by Deputy Walsh about the agency.  My experience is that the agency has carried out all its work expeditiously.  It is involved to a greater degree than ever with a range of Departments, not just the Department of Social Welfare.  It is actively involved in the national anti-poverty strategy, the European Union peace package, in which my Department also has a role, and a range of other networks and research.  My proposal is reasonable and as the amendment would effectively wipe it out I do not intend to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for explaining his proposal as I had taken a different meaning from his refusal to accept Deputy Walsh's amendment in the first instance.  The amendment proposes to insert the words &ldquo;in total&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; in section 44.  Section 44 (4) would then read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" />&ldquo;(4)  Notwithstanding subsection (2), the Minister may, where he considers that the circumstances so warrant, extend, by not more than 6 months in total, the period within which the agency is required to draw up and submit for the Minister's approval a strategic plan.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh's intention is to ensure that the period within which the agency will be required to draw up and submit a strategic plan for the Minister's approval will not be extended by more than six months, but the Minister wants to have this option for use at any time in the future.  It seems strange to include in a Bill a provision whereby the time scale for completing a strategic plan can be extended at any time in the future. I understand that the Minister feels he should give the new board more time and that it might be desirable to make this arrangement to allow for that. However, that is not what the Minister is proposing.  He wants to have this arrangement in place for use by future Ministers.</P>
    <P>I was at first inclined to go along with the Minister's thinking.  However, Deputy Walsh's amendment would limit the extension of the time to six months in total.  That would mean that the Minister's objective of having this arrangement in place for use on further occasions would not be achieved.  We would be happy to go along with the Minister if he wanted to deal with a particular problem but not create an openended situation for the future.  What the Minister suggests is a formula for procrastination, for not achieving targets within the time set down.  That is not a good thing to do generally, and it is not something we should write into legislation. Legislating to allow a Minister to take an extra six months any time he feels like it is not a good principle to follow.  It is not a good precedent. Where a Minister has a problem and cannot meet targets he should come forward, explain the difficulty and ask for the opportunity to extend the time.  On that basis, I am sure the House would <Col N="1157" /> give the Minister the authority he needed.  This would only rarely occur and if, in accordance with the Taoiseach's statement, everything is to become much more efficient under the strategic management initiative, these things should be done not after the due date but before it.  There is no reason they could not be done before the due date.  Once the system is in place the officials will know exactly what they have to deal with and how to go about it in an efficient way.  That is our objective.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that we should build this option into the legislation and let the Minister go his way.  However, Deputy Walsh tabled this amendment because he believed in dealing with a situation whereby either the Minister or an agency under his aegis is embarrassed by not being able to meet targets. I am sure the Minister would have the support of the House in doing that, but to build into legislation on ongoing possibility of delay does not seem a good idea.  It would mean building into the next social welfare consolidation Act that one does not have to meet targets or get work done in time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh's amendment is an appropriate and correct amendment which we should make to the Bill.  If the Minister should find in future that he is not sufficiently in touch with his agency or not sufficiently on top of the work, or that the planning unit is not in touch with what is happening, that is a problem which should be dealt with.  It will probably not arise because there is a good unit in existence.  My experience in the Department tells me that its officials would be looking for the report.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to what the Minister had to say about the issue.  He said a great deal about it which was revealing and interesting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has revealed the thinking behind his objection to Deputy Walsh's amendment which is that he wants the arrangement to be in existence for the future and to build it in as a means of dealing with delays, when principally it is a question of dealing with a situation as it arises.  The Minister has given us some insight into the present problem.  He congratulated the outgoing board which he said was efficient and had its work up to date.  If that is the case, it must have had its strategic plan ready at least in draft form. The Minister has been in office since December 1994.  It is now 1996 and, presumably, this did not recently come out of the blue.  I expect that the board would have had a plan prepared, would have had its homework done and have negotiated with the Department.  The board is used to producing reports.  As Deputy Walsh said, the one thing the Combat Poverty Agency is particularly good at is producing reports.  There are so many reports that we should perhaps stop and instead do something for a while.  The reports have analysed nearly every situation, and that is valuable.  It is particularly important to have a good analysis of all the problems and the board has been particularly efficient in preparing reports.  It is very hard to believe the board would not have had its homework done leading up to the time when the legislation required it to have a strategic action plan ready.  I am quite certain the board must have had the plan ready but the Minister did not tell us that.  He indicated his reasons for providing this extension at this time.  If it was ready why was it set aside?  What is really happening?  Has there been a change in policy or in the orientation of the board?  The plan presumably was ready because the board would have the report in good time.  What happened? Having recognised and thanked the members of the board for their work, which presumably involved a strategic <Col N="1159" /> action plan, the Minister then appointed a new board.  Did the new board want a new plan?  From what the Minister has indicated that seems to be the case. Does this amendment reveal the political change that has taken place?  One might accept there will be delays in preparing a strategic action plan.  The Minister has indicated quite clearly that the new board will be producing a new plan. What is really happening?  Is the board changing its direction?  The Minister has not told us anything about that or why he wants it.  Perhaps he is changing the direction of the board.  I am not clear on that.</P>
      <P>We were given notes on the sections and the note on section 44 states:</P>
      <P>On section 44, amend section 5 (2) of the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986 to provide that the Minister may extend by not more than six months the period within which the agency is required to draw up and submit to strategic plan for its approval.</P>
      <P>That is a straightforward technical statement on the Minister's proposed amendment.  The notes, however, do not tell us the reason this is being done. Deputy Joe Walsh is seeking to amend that amendment.</P>
      <P>This issue becomes much more important because the question is whether this is a Democratic Left plan and that is the reason for the additional six months.  The former board was working under the legislative requirements of this House on the preparation and report of the strategic action plan. If what has happened is that the Minister has appointed a number of people, including a new Democratic Left chairperson.</P>

      <P>I would be concerned if the policy of the Combat Poverty Agency were to change.  I am also concerned that the purpose of the Minister's amendment is to give new appointees to that agency an opportunity to change its policy.  Given that the Minister said he wants to allow the agency time to review its programme, the question is whether Deputy Walsh's simple amendment almost inadvertently unlocked something that is happening behind the scenes when legislation requiring the agency to submit its plan within a specified time is to be set aside so that it can introduce a different policy. Such a policy would be more to the liking of the Democratic Left Party and would be more left-wing.  That is a <Col N="1162" /> serious question which the Minister can answer by stating the direction being taken by the agency now and in the future.</P>

      <P>In introducing his amendment the Minister said it deals with a simple matter of the Government wishing to extend by six months the period within which the agency is required to submit its plan.  It appeared reasonable that the agency should be granted more time if it is unable to submit its plan within the time specified.  The Opposition spokesperson questioned why that provision should apply every year and if it should not apply only on a once off basis, hence Deputy Walsh's amendment which provided that the period for submitting the plan should be extended by not more than six months in total.  A problem may arise in that six months may represent six consecutive months or be broken down over a number of years, but that puts a limit on the time by which the plan must be submitted. Deputy Walsh, perhaps inadvertently, was very wise to table his amendment for a number of reasons.  It will ensure that in future the Combat Poverty Agency will comply with the wishes of this House and will submit its plan <Col N="1163" /> within the period required.  It has been able to do that until now and should continue to do that in the future.  If the agency were to put forward a good reason for being unable to do that, it can inform the House that it is inefficient and would be able to submit the plan if it were given more time.</P>

      <P>What we are talking about here is deferral of the Combat Poverty Agency strategic plan.  The issue of delays, reports and plans has been raised time and again in the Bill, as if there are not already enough plans and reports in the Department of Social Welfare.  I am surprised that yet again we are enshrining in legislation a further deferral, particularly in view of the position outlined by my colleague, Deputy Woods that the outgoing Combat Poverty Agency board has its affairs up to date and its report in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment has uncovered the Minister's concern that a new board appointed by him should produce a different report &mdash; he said it is an opportunity to review the plan. Every reasonable person must ask why he is causing a further delay by seeking <Col N="1167" /> another plan.  Since the Minister took office there have been problems in making progress on a number of issues because time and again there have been deferrals and delays.</P>
      <P>On the issue of poverty which was discussed earlier, we endeavoured to enshrine in the Bill a basic principle which was advocated by the Minister when in Opposition.  At that time he was very concerned about poverty, yet now that he is in a position to do something about it he fails to accept an amendment in that regard.  Similarly, the Minister believed when in Opposition that it would be useful to implement the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare relating to the official poverty line, but he now refuses to accept such a recommendation.  In his view the establishment of an official poverty line is no longer useful.</P>
      <P>We are talking here about the Combat Poverty Agency, and the Minister who was so concerned about poverty when in Opposition is deliberately creating a further delay by deferring production by the Combat Poverty Agency of the strategic plan.  Any reasonable person who reads this debate will agree it is extraordinary that the Minister refuses to take on board the plan completed by the outgoing Combat Poverty Agency board.  He is creating a deliberate delay so as to have an opportunity to review the strategic plan.  Everybody knows there are too many reports, plans and delays in this area, and I cannot believe we are contemplating yet another deferral of this plan.</P>
      <P>We debated the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and we await with bated breath its recommendations.  It is very disappointing that in the past year every time we questioned the Minister on the issue of disability he used that report as a reason to delay matters.  I do not know why the Minister is so interested in delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke about the report of the Commission on the Family and said it <Col N="1168" /> would be published in June 1997, but by that time this Government will have gone out of office.  It is extraordinary that, as with the reports of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the Commission on the Family, even though it is enshrined in legislation that the report of the Combat Poverty Agency must be published at a certain time, the Minister is deliberately causing its deferral.  There is something amiss here.  A new board will be appointed by the Minister and extra time will be needed for that board to produce a different report.  Why has no real explanation been given of what is happening in this regard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the reason given by the Minister for not accepting this amendment, which would be useful not only to the Combat Poverty Agency and those who benefit from its work but also to the Department of Social Welfare under whose aegis that agency operates.  What we have here is a charter for procrastination, vacillation and delay, whereby people given a job to do, if it is not all right on the day will get another six months.  I am not satisfied with that nor am I satisfied the Combat Poverty Agency should get that concession.  It was established to do a job and it should get on with it.  I have not been impressed with its recent performance. An example is the failure of the organisation to highlight the scandal of the Minister's inability to get the Poverty 4 programme through the Council of Ministers.  The agency implemented measures under the Poverty 4 programme, yet all I read in its publications are soft articles and excuses for the Minister and his Department.  I do not agree with giving it additional time to draw up strategic plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my local newspaper <i>The Skibbereen Eagle</i> which is famous for keeping its eye on Russia, I will keep my eye on the Combat Poverty Agency's performance and the cosy new board, some of whose members have been appointed.  I will press this amendment <Col N="1169" /> because it is reasonable and should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 36, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Section 11 (1) (b) of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, is hereby amended by the insertion after &lsquo;Act of 1970&rsquo; of &lsquo;or Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71(1) of 14 June 1971&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 provides that the earnings of people who work in Northern Ireland will not be liable to the health and employment training levies. The benefit to a cross-Border worker with yearly earnings of £15,000 will be in the region of £337.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure arises from a committee which Deputy Wallace criticised.  An interdepartmental committee was established by the Minister for Finance last <Col N="1170" /> year and this measure is one of the fruits of that report.  This is another example of action by this Government, not procrastination or delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment as a positive step.  I have followed with great interest the Commission on the Status of Women and the Commission on People with Disabilities. The commissions and reports are important but the problem is that they are used by the Minister as a vehicle for delay.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Commission on the Family this morning saying it would report in 12 months and that we should wait for that report.  That is an excuse for delaying.  A Government or a Minister should not excuse themselves from taking action or delay taking action because research on an issue is in progress and a report awaited. It is important to have proper research and reports but they should not be used by a Minister as an excuse for doing nothing.  It is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>We welcome the amendment.  It arose because a worker in Donegal highlighted the issue prior to the budget. This is a big issue for people in Donegal and other Border areas as many will benefit from this change.  It keeps people in work and maintains the value of their employment.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that Deputy Wallace can, on the one hand, welcome the recommendations of a committee and the action taken by the Government, yet, at the same time, continue with her waffle about using committees as a means of delay.  She mentioned my reference this morning to the Commission on the Family.  Deputy Wallace and others opposite do not listen when I give an explanation of my position on an <Col N="1171" /> amendment.  They chat among themselves and discuss the weather or whatever else concerns them, but they do not listen to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reference to the Commission on the Family related to an amendment the Opposition tabled to insert in the Bill a 1985 based poverty line.  I indicated that it was ten years out of date and the ESRI had been requested to provide an up to date report on the adequacy of social welfare income and how it might be indexed.  We expect a report from the ESRI in the middle of this year.  As an example of the concrete action I was taking in relation to poverty, as distinct from including a poverty line in the Social Welfare Bill, I instanced the increases in child benefit etc. as concrete examples of how the Government is acting on its own initiatives and programme and on the recommendations of various reports.  I also instanced the report of the task force on security for the elderly, which was submitted within <Col N="1172" /> four weeks, following which Government decisions were made.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputy Wallace to stop wasting her time talking about commissions and committees being used to delay and procrastinate.  The evidence is that the Government acts on recommendations. It does not defer action, as was the case with previous administrations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It has had a good discussion on Committee Stage and on Report Stage.  It is very important legislation, especially because it affects so many people &mdash; approximately 1.5 million, with the entire population affected in an overall sense.</P>
      <P>The Minister has begun to deal with a number of smaller measures, which is to be welcomed.  These are very important to individuals and to groups of people, even though they may be small enough in themselves.  In this respect the Bill is more extensive than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major provisions in the Bill deal with the rates' increases.  These are disappointing, providing for only a 3 per cent increase this year.  While they at least bring the rates back to a more reasonable level following the 2.5 per cent increase last year, which was a big setback, they should have been associated with special increases in specific areas.  For example, in these times of plenty the Minister should have awarded more to the pensioners.  Even <Col N="1174" /> an increase of 3.5 per cent would not fully make up the ground lost last year.</P>
    <P>The increases only maintain the situation while generally providing a mere 1 per cent increase in the main rates of social welfare benefits as recommended by the commission.  This is a minimal improvement, which is confirmed by the Minister's advice that the total social assistance payment provided for in the Bill amounts to £56.9 million.  That is less, in real terms, than the payment in 1994.  It represents an increase on last year only because the increase awarded then was especially low.  The Bill does not do much for those pensioners, widows and others looking to the House for improvements.  It has disappointed, especially at a time of plenty.</P>
    <P>The Bill is historic in that it abolishes the deserted wife's allowance while preserving the entitlements of existing claimants and beneficiaries from the end of this year.  This represents a setback for women.  Various options could have been taken.  It is necessary to provide for equal treatment for men and women with regard to benefit.  This has not been done through amendment of this benefit but by expanding the assistance scheme.  The lone parent's allowance scheme is now to become the one parent family payment.</P>

      <P>The Bill introduces a new scheme, the one parent payment.  This is <Col N="1175" /> an important and historic development. There will be a means test under this scheme which will apply to everybody and it is a major change.  Deserted women who do not have children will no longer be covered for benefit.  This introduces a change to the social insurance fund in that approximately £75 million will be transferred from it to the new scheme.  It will be some years before this transfer is completed but at present women have a right to this money.  The Minister has absorbed the scheme which was introduced in 1974 into the new scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme does not cover women whose incomes exceed £12,000 per annum, which represents 85 per cent of average industrial earnings.  It excludes women on average industrial earnings who pay PRSI.  Some 30 per cent of the 13,600 women receiving deserted wife's benefit do not have children and as a result will not be entitled to payments from the end of the year.  The 7 per cent of women whose incomes exceed £12,000 per annum will not be entitled to payments under the new scheme.  The assistance side will receive an extra £10 million because of improvements in the means test, which is welcome, but it is regrettable that so many people will be excluded.</P>
      <P>We welcome the disability allowance for which the Bill provides.  This covers the administrative arrangements which were set in train in the Estimates at the end of 1994.  The scheme which the Minister introduced puts this on a legislative footing.  We also welcome the new homemaker's scheme which put the arrangements which were made on an administrative basis on a statutory footing. There is considerable scope in this scheme for development, improvement and expansion and I hope this will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike last year's Bill, this provides for increases in family income supplement which should result in more people benefiting from the scheme.  Lest the Minister suggests we do not welcome the positive aspects of the Bill, I <Col N="1176" /> want to make it clear that we do.  The overall increases for beneficiaries are the barest minimum which would be acceptable and this is unfortunate when the economy is experiencing strong growth.  Pensioners, widows and those receiving disability and invalidity payments need to keep pace with events in the community and need more than the Government has given them.  This is our greatest reservation about the increases provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We were promised that on Report Stage we would be given details of how many people would benefit from the proposals on disability allowance.  Perhaps the Minister will give these details in his reply?</P>
      <P>A number of the Bill's provisions are welcome.  I strongly welcome section 24, which deals with homemakers.  There was a major debate on the section on Committee Stage and we discovered that the Department does not seem to be well prepared for it.  There are no great plans with regard to introducing regulations and we eventually elicited from the Minister that this will be done after the Bill has been passed.  Section 24 is positive because of its identification of homemakers for pensions purposes. The years spent by a person as a homemaker may be disregarded from the point of view of pensions.  There has been little detail of how homemakers would be identified.  What should homemakers, who may apply for pensions in 15 years' time, now do to identify themselves? I hope this will be made clear by the Department following the extensive debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 4, it is extraordinary that the Department and the Minister continue to disregard the fact that twins are a multiple birth.  In Opposition the Minister held that they were but he has not provided for this in the Bill.  Important improvements are provided for twins but they only scratch the surface in terms of what is being sought by the group representing the parents of twins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Responsibility for disability allowance is being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  We welcome this administrative change but my concern is that people in receipt of this allowance should see an improvement.  Section 13 provides for the insertion of a new chapter in the Principal Act.  We discussed an amendment on Committee Stage which proposed to delete paragraph 191C of this chapter which would have helped to identify the real cost of disability as distinct from applying a means test to people in receipt of disability allowance.</P>

      <P>As my colleague Deputy Woods said, there are positive changes for many lone parents. However, these changes do not benefit women in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or those who may be deserted after 1 January 1997 as this benefit will be abolished after that date.  It must be borne in mind that one third of women who claim deserted wife's benefit do not have children.  This section, while positive for many lone parents in terms of the allowance does away with benefits for many women since the benefit will be stringently means tested from now on.  It does away with the deserted wife's <Col N="1178" /> benefit for many women who have been deserted but who work and continue to claim that benefit.  Under this section one third of these women who do not have children will be ineligible for this allowance.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to follow your guidance.  The Minister welcomed the changes for the self employed under section 9.  Anything to assist the self employed and farmers is welcome, but we must bear in mind that section 9 brings them in line with other social insurance contributions covered by the provisions in sections 8 and 10.  It is disappointing that the self employed and farmers are not included in the family income supplement scheme and that those who were over 56 years of age in 1988 are still not included.  We hoped this Social Welfare Bill would include these people who are approaching retirement age, and allow them their pension entitlements.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Clohessy a speedy recovery and I hope to see him back in the House soon. Leaving aside party political views, any objective consideration of the Bill would suggest that it is an innovative and important one.  I do not want to exaggerate but it contains many significant changes which will benefit many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I make points about the Bill I will answer some of the questions raised.  The measure connected with the rural environmental protection scheme will come into effect as soon as the Bill is signed by the President.  As to the <Col N="1180" /> maintenance of the modified rate of PRSI for Telecom workers, I have been in touch with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and been assured the workforce were consulted through their trade unions.  My advice is that staff interests indicated that any change in PRSI status as proposed by the Deputies opposite would in their view represent a loss of the employee status enshrined in the 1983 Act, which established the company and would, accordingly, have the most serious implications for their view of any such proposal.  The proposal to maintain the modified PRSI status for existing Telecom Éireann staff has been welcomed by them and by the company. It should ensure a successful conclusion to the strategic alliance proposals the Minister is currently pursuing.</P>
    <P>A number of other points were made and, as the Ceann Comhairle suggests, I will not go through the Bill section by section.  Significant changes have been made.  We are abolishing the concept of desertion, that is, of a woman having to prove she was deserted by her spouse in order to qualify for support for herself and her children.  That important advance in our social welfare code should not be underestimated.  For the individuals who find themselves in those circumstances, desertion can be upsetting in terms of human and personal relationship.  To then have go through the process of proving desertion can make the feeling of loss of self-esteem and confidence even worse.  I am pleased to be the Minister who introduced the one parent family payment, which abolishes the need to prove desertion and provides enhanced support for parents rearing children on their own, regardless of whether they are alone because of desertion, separation, divorce or for any other reason.</P>
    <P>The Department is taking charge of the disabled person's maintenance allowance and is creating a new scheme called the disability allowance.  There are changes in the rules for assessing unemployment assistance for part-time workers, which will simplify the system, <Col N="1181" /> make it more comprehensible to the person offered part-time work and, in the vast majority of cases, will enhance the amount of income the person will be able to retain.  The home makers scheme has been extended to cover caring for children up to 12 years of age and has been brought into the main legislation.  We have extended old age pensioners' rights to secondary benefits to those in receipt of occupational pensions; that includes people in receipt of pensions from other EU countries.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have introduced a new and enhanced grant scheme for twins.  I am quite proud of this also because it fully implements the commitment I made about twins as an Opposition Deputy.  I felt there was a case for assisting parents with twins so I have increased the grant at birth from £200 to £500 and have introduced new grants at ages four and five of £500 on each occasion.  That is a significant improvement for parents of twins.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on twins I mentioned a person by name, which was inappropriate.  I intended no criticism of the person I named, who is outside this House, and in no way did I wish to embarrass the person by doing so.  I was trying to explain a position but I should not have done so in that way and I apologise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods made comments about the Combat Poverty Agency.  It is because I believe in openness and transparency I offered the House a full explanation of why I sought an extention of the time the agency would need to prepare its strategic plan for the next three years.  Deputies Woods and Mary Wallace weaved a totally false story around this simple, innocent proposal. It was highly inappropriate to draw in the chairperson of the Combat Poverty Agency in this attempt to score political points off me.  I am able to defend myself in this House and can bat with the best in terms of political attack but it is unfair to apply inappropriate labels to people outside this House who are willing to take on, for no recompense, public service in the interests of <Col N="1182" /> the worst off in our society.  It was ungracious of Deputy Woods to do that. The amendment I introduced to the Bill was simply to provide the new board of the agency with an opportunity to ensure the strategic plan was a good one and so that the review of the agency which is currently under way would be taken into account in the production of the strategic plan.  That is a reasonable position and nothing Machiavellian is involved.  The approach adopted by Deputy Woods was unkind to a person who has given many years of personal service on behalf of the poor of our society.</P>
    <P>This Bill will shortly go before the Seanad and become law.  It supports families and enables people to move more easily into employment.  As Minister for Social Welfare and Leader of Democratic Left.  I am particularly proud of this Bill and have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.</P>

      <P>I moved the Second Stage of this Bill on Wednesday, 13 March.  I outlined that it is mainly a technical Bill based on reports made to me by the Pensions Board and is the completion of a cycle that began in 1990 when the Pensions Bill, 1990, was introduced in this House.  I draw Deputy Wallace's attention to the fact that this is another example of the Government's implementation of recommendations from a commissioned report.  It is also evidence that the Government does not procrastinate. I see the Deputy is ignoring the point I am making but that is not surprising.</P>
      <P>On 13 March I set out the functions of the Pensions Board, I highlighted the importance of the pensions industry with an estimated asset value of £16 billion and outlined recent developments in the occupational pensions area.  I also outlined how a period of legislative stability is now desirable but that further changes may be required in the equal treatment area where final clarification of European court cases is awaited and where draft directives on equal treatment are under consideration. I went on to outline the specific provisions contained in the Bill and had concluded my remarks on section 14 when time ran out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> Section 15 clarifies the priorities in relation to the winding up of a scheme. Section 16 defines the employer for the purposes of submitting a funding proposal under section 49 of the Act, including circumstances where a number of employers may be involved.  In addition it provides that such a funding certificate should also be signed by the trustees of the scheme as they may have a direct responsibility over some matters contained in the funding proposal. At present they are not obliged to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that where the Pensions Board, under section 50, directs trustees to reduce the benefits in a scheme, in a case where the trustees have failed to submit an actuarial funding certificate or a funding proposal, the trustees must take the necessary measures to carry out the direction.  It also provides that such a direction made by the board shall override any other provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that the trustees of a scheme must disclose information on that scheme to the Pensions Board. At present the board is not listed among the parties to which the trustees must disclose information.  Section 19 allows that an annual report of a scheme can be prepared for a period of up to 23 months.  This, however, could only be done in certain clearly defined circumstances and then only with the approval of the Pensions Board.  Section 20 clarifies some matters in relation to audited accounts and actuarial valuations. Section 21 allows trustees to meet the costs of appropriate trustee training from the resources of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the rules against perpetuities which require that trusts cannot continue beyond the lives in being on the commencement of the trust, plus a further period of 21 years.  It is considered reasonable that this should not apply to trusts that govern pension schemes.  The employer and the trustees will often intend that the pension scheme should continue indefinitely, or at least while the employer remains in business.  This section will allow this to <Col N="1185" /> happen.  Section 23 clarifies the conditions under which the board may seek from the High Court the removal and replacement of trustees.</P>
    <P>Section 24 allows the board to apply to the High Court for an order suspending a trustee or trustees.  It also sets out that the order may contain including the appointment of a replacement trustee and the transferring of the assets into the names of the new trustees.  It also sets out penalties for a person who might continue to act as a trustee while he or she is suspended.</P>
    <P>Section 25 streamlines the procedures for the board to appoint trustees where there are none or the existing trustees cannot be located.  Section 26 makes minor amendments in definitions dealing with equal treatment.  This limits jurisdiction to employment &ldquo;within the State&rdquo;, as otherwise it could be implied that the Pensions Act has powers outside the State, which is not the case.</P>
    <P>Section 27 clarifies the provisions which deal with differences in pension rules prior to the date of the European Court of Justice judgment of 17 May 1990 in the Barber case.  Sections 28 to 32 provide for equal treatment to apply to collective agreements, regulation orders, registered employment agreements and contracts of employment and provide for consequential amendments. Section 33 provides that an employee who liaises with the Pensions Board is protected against unfair dismissal provided, of course, that he or she acted in good faith.</P>
    <P>Section 34 makes it mandatory for certain persons to make a written report to the Pensions Board of any material misappropriation or fraudulent conversion of the resources of a scheme where they have reasonable cause to believe that this is happening.  The persons covered by the section are any auditor, actuary or trustee of the scheme, any insurance intermediary or investment business firm which has advised on the scheme or has received any payment in relation to any investment on behalf of the scheme, a person who has prepared an annual report of the scheme under <Col N="1186" /> section 55 of the Pensions Act and a person who carries out any of the duties of the trustees of the scheme under section 59.  This section provides protection to persons who make such reports. It covers not only mandatory reports but also voluntary reports made in good faith to the Pensions Board.  It also makes it an offence for a person to knowingly make a false report to the board.  There is also provision that any report published in relation to this section will be privileged.</P>
    <P>In introducting this provision, I am going further than recommended to me by the Pensions Board.  While myself and the board share the common objective of protecting the pensions of individual members of schemes, the board felt that this would best be achieved by encouragement rather than by compulsion. Nobody can, of course, say with certainty what the right approach is. However, following detailed consultation with the board, in the final analysis to afford maximum protection, the compulsory route is the correct way to proceed.  I hope that this section of the Bill will never need to be used, but nonetheless, it will act as another important safeguard for members and a deterrent to potential wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>Section 35 deals with applications to the High Court by the Pensions Board to seek orders to have the employer pay arrears of contributions, and for the restoration of resources of the scheme where they had been wrongfully paid or transferred to any person and such payment or transfer is likely to jeopardise the rights and interests of the members. The court may also make an order directing trustees to dispose of an investment where it is satisfied that the retention of the asset could again jeopardise the rights and interests of the members.  The section also deals with injunctions where a person could be prohibited from any misuse or misappropriation of any of the resources of the scheme.  It also provides that following an application by the board, the <Col N="1187" /> court may grant an injunction prohibiting an investment or for the freezing of the scheme assets pending the outcome of an investigation by the board.</P>
    <P>Section 36 clarifies the situation in the event of the chairperson of the board having to be replaced, for example, if he or she died or resigned.  This section also provides for the expansion of the membership of the board to include two new ordinary members.  This will increase the membership from 12 to 14 ordinary members.  One of the new members will be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; ICTU &mdash; and one by the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation &mdash; IBEC &mdash; and each must be a trustee of a pensions scheme.  Trustees are the main custodians of pension schemes.  This new provision will ensure trustees representation on the board, which I consider to be desirable.  Until now there has been no one specifically representing the concerns of trustees.  I believe this provision will add a further dimension to the board and will give it a wider representation.  This is especially important since the advent of statutory member trusteeship.</P>
    <P>Section 37 is a technical amendment that provides for the elimination of anomalies in relation to the calculation and revaluation of preserved benefits under the Second Schedule to the Pensions Act.  Section 38 similarly deals with practical difficulties in relation to actuarial funding certificates under the Third Schedule to the Pensions Act. Section 39 increases summary fines from £1,000 to £1,500.  Section 40 provides for fines where a person has been convicted of an offence and continues to contravene the provision concerned. Sections 41 and 42 deal with the saving of instruments and give the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are of course a number of other issues where the possibility of future legislation may arise for consideration. A few issues that spring to mind immediately would include the possibility of a compensation fund, the need <Col N="1188" /> for a pensions ombudsman, the extension of preservation to pre-1991 service, the accrued rights of people who remain in the scheme as opposed to those who leave the scheme and the encouragement of the extension of pension coverage to part-time and atypical workers. These are some of the many issues that face the new Pensions Board and which they will be considering in detail over the next five years.  I look forward to their deliberations, reports and recommendations during that period.</P>
    <P>This is an important time for the occupational pensions industry.  I aim to play my part in ensuring its growth and stability by keeping in place a strict but fair regulatory regime so that people who provide for their future can be confident and certain that their expectations will be realised when they retire.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to update the legislative provisions in place and introduce some new ones to ensure the continued safeguarding of individuals' entitlements. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill to update pensions legislation. Pensions are becoming increasingly important to society.  Pension rights under an occupational pension scheme are often a person's most valuable asset.  According to the most recent Pensions Board annual report, a pension can be even more valuable than the family home.  This puts in perspective the position of occupational pensions in the everyday life of many people.  It demonstrates clearly the importance of pensions to individuals, employees, employers, trustees and various organisations and bodies, including the State.</P>

    <P>Continuing changes in society mean there is a need to update the legislation at this time because the notion of a pension has changed dramatically over the past decade or two.  For example, the phrase &ldquo;a job for life&rdquo; has all but disappeared. More often than not, the norm nowadays is for people to change jobs many times during a working career, engage in casual labour or, indeed, <Col N="1189" /> transfer from the status of employee to that of self-employed.  It is a good trait that young people start off by getting some experience and move on to different jobs.  They have not the same requirement to stay in the same location, organisation or job.  Therefore, pension schemes should allow for a degree of flexibility and mobility.</P>
    <P>Few other activities have as many glossy brochures and advertising features as pension schemes and it is incumbent on the State to ensure the small print of these glossy brochures stands up to examination.  There have been some well highlighted scandals where pension funds have been raided and found inadequate to meet the demands made on them or where all that is invested is not put into the fund.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly this update of the legislation.  Before proceeding to the Bill, I want to refer to the principal Act upon which the amendments debated today are founded.  The Pensions Act, 1990 is one of the most significant pieces of legislation concerning occupational pensions.  Its purpose is to regulate occupational pensions schemes, ensure their proper administration and ensure the pension rights of members and their dependants are adequately safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The 1990 Act set out to lay down minimum standards in key areas by providing a framework for the regulation and supervision of schemes.  The Act sought to ensure members could change jobs without forfeiting their pension rights, schemes would be funded properly, employers delivered on promises made to employees and members would have full access to all information about the running of their schemes and the security of their pensions.  The Act also sought to provide for equal treatment for men and women in relation to the scope and conditions of access to schemes, benefits, rights and contribution levels.  I will return to the issue of equal treatment with regard to the scope of schemes because this is another classic case of women being shabbily <Col N="1190" /> treated.  We will try to address this under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Act, 1990 is a monumental piece of legislation.  Its enactment was a milestone in the history of the system to provide for adequate and secure pensions.  Five years on, it is appropriate that we update that legislation. As outlined in the introduction to the explanatory memorandum, the Bill provides for the amendment of the 1990 Act with the majority of the amendments being of a technical but important nature.  The amendments were brought forward following a review of the principal Act.  The Bill also introduces some welcome new provisions.</P>
    <P>Pensions are a minefield.  No matter how well people felt they were prepared in making contributions to pensions, when it came down to it they found they did not understand fully or were not made fully aware of the provisions of particular schemes.  They are a minefield, not alone in their technical and administrative complexity but also because of the explosive demographic time-bomb which will confront us all soon.  We have all been made aware of that by various reports.  The Pensions Board reported that demographic patterns indicate a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population during the first half of the next century.  If there is to be this increase in the numbers of elderly people, we should provide for them.  As far as occupational pensions are concerned, we should ensure people are treated fairly when they come to claim their pension.</P>
    <P>Politicians tend to be forgetful at times of the debt society owes to elderly people and of the important role played by them in society.  We sometimes forget there are almost 400,000 people aged 65 or over living in Ireland today, that is, about 11 per cent of the population. While this is significant, demographic projections from the CSO predict that the proportion of the population aged 60 and over will constitute 19 per cent by the year 2011 and 23 <Col N="1191" /> per cent by the year 2021.  These figures are in the public arena.  We should reflect on them and be aware of this demographic trend.  Concurrently, the ratio of those of working age to those over 65 is projected to fall from approximately 5 to 1 at present to 3 to 1 in the year 2035.  The Pensions Board noted that these demographic changes would result in an increasing burden of the costs of pensions falling in future generations of PRSI contributors and, of course, the general taxpayer.</P>
    <P>These projections provide a challenge for us all.  Many challenges must be met, not only in the provision of pension entitlements but also in additional health and welfare services.  We must address the issue of the participation of elderly people in the labour market, their general social standing and the respect for elderly people within society.  They have a valuable contribution to make to society from their experience.  In some countries, provision is being made to use the vast array of skills and experience gained by many retired people to ensure their expertise and the benefit of their experience is made available for the betterment of society.  Many of our elderly people are to be commended for their commitment to, and involvement in, many voluntary and community organisations and associations.  Their expertise and knowledge of administrative systems is invaluable in many communities and they give of their time unselfishly and without remuneration. We owe them a great debt.</P>
    <P>The changes taking place will have a massive impact on the future costs of social welfare pensions, which are estimated to increase by a phenomenal 90 per cent.  While demographic movements are removed from any Government direction or control &mdash; at least they have been to date &mdash; pension legislation is not.  It is the duty of any administration to ensure that all legislation is thoroughly debated.  Therefore, it is <Col N="1192" /> important that all necessary amendments to the pensions Acts are fully debated and considered.</P>
    <P>For reasons outside the control of everybody, we were constrained in our discussions on the previous Bill.  We did not have adequate time to consider amendments because they could not be printed on time.  There should be a gap of at least one week between the different Stages of a Bill, and I hope it will be the case with this Bill, because complex matters are involved.  The best legislation is that which has had the benefit of the collective wisdom of all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>Any debate on pensions must, of course, include an examination of the pension funds which represent a major investment in the Irish economy.  For example, the total assets of Irish pension funds at the end of 1994 was close to £14 billion and was nearly £16 billion by the end of 1995.  This massive amount of money is contributed by taxpayers and Irish workers.</P>
    <P>The type of pension funding in Ireland is deferred remuneration, money which would otherwise have been paid as a salary and is set aside to provide for a pension.  Ireland shares this approach to pension fund operations with most OECD countries.  Our taxation system is also similar to most other European and OECD countries. It is aimed at encouraging the development of occupational pension arrangements. Our taxation regime is benign and generous in relation to pensions. Up to certain limits, a person can get the full benefit of contributions to pension schemes against tax and that is welcome. This fact is especially important in the Irish context to ensure that people provide adequately for their retirement.  It is desirable that people who can afford to set aside part of their remuneration in their earlier years for their retirement should do so.  It is hard for people who have to depend on low levels of social welfare pensions. However, it is important for people who can do so to make provision for having an occupational pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> Some sectors in our society would like to have a social welfare pension but for a number of reasons they are not entitled to it.  I raised the matter of the workers in Telecom during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill 1996.  These workers should seriously consider not having such a pension.  While costs are involved and they would have to make contributions to it, it would be worth their while for their long-term planning to make alternative pension arrangements.</P>
    <P>There exists a specific problem in relation to a social welfare pension for self-employed people who have made less than ten years' contributions.  Many self-employed taxpayers continue to be denied the opportunity to qualify for a State old age contributory pension because of requirements laid down in legislation.  From April 1988, the self-employed were required to make PRSI contributions based on a percentage of their income; that figure is now 5 per cent.  They became eligible for a limited range of social welfare benefits, such as the State old age pension, the contributory survivor's pension and the orphan's contributory allowance, based on contributions, yet the Department of Social Welfare has stipulated that to qualify for the State pension, a contributor must commence paying PRSI before reaching 56 years of age.  This, of course, means that self-employed persons of 56 years of age and over in April 1988, when the PRSI system was extended to them, are excluded from State pensions despite the fact that they are required to make PRSI contributions until they are 66 years of age.  If they will not qualify because of age why should they contribute money to it?  They will not get a pension from it.</P>
    <P>This is totally inequitable.  It denies a pension to those nearing retirement age and stops them from getting access to, or use of, sums of money contributed to the State PRSI fund for which they will receive no value.  The Government must at least seriously consider one option which would overcome the problem, providing a <i>pro rata</i> pension based on <Col N="1194" /> the number of contributions made by the taxpayer on reaching retirement age.</P>
    <P>The 15 per cent earnings bar is unduly restrictive on employees.  Employers have no upper limit other then the actuarial valuation of the pension scheme. Self-employed contributors to pension schemes are particularly badly and inequitably treated.  For example, small shopkeepers, sole owners and farmers are limited to 15 per cent of their net earned income.  This restriction is unfair in many cases because these people spend most of their early years building up their business, farm or organisation and they have to reinvest all available resources.  Many of them do not get a chance to invest in a pension scheme until later in life.  Consideration should be given to allow personal contributions relate to age.  A person wanting to make extra contributions later in life, having built up a business should be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>There is approximately £16 billion in Irish pension funds.  However, only 23 per cent of this is invested in Irish equities. The total exposure to Irish investments, including property and fixed interests, is approximately 63 per cent. The main reason exposure to Irish equities is not higher is because of the necessity to maintain a reasonable level of investment return combined with security.  There are not enough Irish equities on the market that satisfy both conditions.  The sum of £16,000 million is substantial by any standard.  It is contributed by taxpayers and 23 per cent of it is a very small slice for investment in the productive sector.  There should be a greater degree of co-operation between the pension industry, the State and industry generally.  There should be greater discussion and debate as to how best more of this money could be invested in industry for the betterment of the economy, society and to create jobs.  It could lead to openings for an increase in the investment of pension funds in Ireland.</P>
    <P>An Irish pension fund manager may wish to gain access to, for example, the <Col N="1195" /> telecommunications field.  The Minister concerned is trying to dispose of a portion of Telecom Éireann to any multinational company which will show an interest in it.  It appears only one international company is showing an interest and for little enough money for the major asset which has been built up by our workers.  Pension funds managers might well examine the telecommunications industry to see how they might invest in it.</P>
    <P>With some ingenuity an Irish fund could be made available for investment, it could involve employing Irish workers.  Imaginative restructuring could create a forum for such investment.  The National Treasury Management Agency could issue special gilt-edged investments aimed at targeting the long-term requirement of the pensions industry.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I encouraged the forestry industry to avail of Irish pension funds.  I recall launching one fund which was a vehicle for investment by workers through pension funds. Forestry is an ideal vehicle because we have good tree production capability. We now have technology and expertise in processing timber.  It is a natural resource industry in which there are a tremendous number of jobs.</P>
    <P>Counties such as Leitrim and others in the west of Ireland do not have much industry and have been plagued by emigration for many years.  During my time as Minister with responsibility for forestry, I succeeded in attracting a major company to invest in the processing of our natural resource in Carrick-on-Shannon. The project was almost derailed but, thankfully, will come to fruition and provide valuable jobs.  I am not aware of further funds in the forestry area or any other area of industry which have been promoted and developed by the State.  I ask that the opportunity be re-examined.</P>
    <P>One of the most controversial aspects of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995 is what we might term the whistle blowing provision, which is section 34.  This <Col N="1196" /> section provides that professional advisers are obliged to report cases of pension fund fraud.  I accept that pension funds should be protected against fraudulent conversion but it appears that the wording of the provision is too wide.</P>
    <P>The provision, correctly, makes it mandatory for certain persons to make a written report to the pensions board of any material misappropriation or fraudulent conversion of the resources of the scheme of which they become aware.  Those who will have to blow the whistle will include auditors, actuaries, trustees, insurance intermediaries, investment managers, those who prepare annual reports and those to whom the trustees have delegated any trustee duty.  Failure to make a report is an offence.  A person found guilty shall be found liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or to imprisonment not exceeding one year.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the wording, specifically the words &ldquo;or is being contemplated&rdquo;. The Bill states there is a duty to report the contemplation of a misappropriation.  This poses problems since, from time to time, we have had linguistic difficulty regarding terminology in various areas.  At one time in the penny catechism it was a sin to contemplate certain activities.  Contemplation is a nebulous word and I am a little concerned about it.  I believe strongly that there must be the closest and most vigilant tracking of fraud and misappropriation but whistle blowing or informer sections, if too loosely worded though, will ultimately do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>A major anomaly in occupational pension schemes is that they have not kept pace with changes in work practices, particularly in the length of years of service.  As I said at the outset, the notion of a job for life has all but disappeared. For example, current pension legislation, which is largely tax driven, is based on the old norm of 40 years service which is no longer applicable.  At the end of 40 years one is entitled to a <Col N="1197" /> maximum pension of 1.5 times one's salary tax free, in a lump sum and the rest of the pension is paid in annuity payments.</P>
    <P>In modern society 40 years service is a typical and retirement age, rather than being 65 years of age as it was 20 years ago, is now more likely to be 55 years of age.  Years of service are more likely to be 20 to 25 years rather than 40 years. The revenue limit of 1.5 times a person's salary should take account of that change.  Our situation as Members of the House is that 20 years service allows for a maximum pension.  I am nearing that threshold.  If 20 years service applies to me and everybody else in this House, it should also apply to contributors to occupational pension schemes and allow them avail of 1.5 times their salary tax free in a lump sum.  This anomaly also has the effect of discouraging State bodies and employers from establishing early retirement schemes.  A person will say he has a few more years to work to completely fund his pension. Employees will be loath to leave employment and allow younger people take over from them because they have insufficient years of service to qualify for the maximum lump sum payment.  I will address that matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We must take account of changes generally in society.  I mentioned that women are treated badly under existing legislation.  I regret I see nothing in this Bill which would improve their situation. At present a person &mdash; much of the time it is the man or head of the household &mdash; contributes to a pension scheme and the householder &mdash; the partner or wife &mdash; does not, because she is not earning.  If the marriage breaks up and there is a settlement, the woman should be entitled to a 50:50 division of the pension fund.  That is not allowed but it should be because she is surely entitled to half the assets.  She is told she can have it when she retires but what will she do until she retires, which could be 15 or 20 years down the road?  Various other arrangements may be entered into in the meantime.  That matter should be <Col N="1198" /> addressed in this Bill and I will return to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The passing of the Bill will increase the strength of the pension board to act on behalf of members of pension plans and that is a good thing.  The general theme running through the Bill is a strengthening of the pension board's powers of investigation and intervention. The board will have authority to authorise a person, other than an employee of the board, to carry out investigations.  It also envisages that reports by authorised persons will be published.  This means legal action cannot be taken against the person who publishes the report.  The board will also have greater powers of removal and replacement of trustees.  In general, all those matters are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Another section which gives me cause for concern is section 21 which enables trustees to meet the cost of appropriate trustee training from the resources of the scheme.  The cost of trustee training is a clause relevant to trustees and it should again be looked at.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and its provisions which will give additional protection and safeguards to those contributing a certain amount of their remuneration which will be later available to them by way of pension.  It is only right to commend the Bill's positive features which address developments since the Pensions Act was introduced in 1990.  While I welcome the general thrust of the Bill, I will table amendments to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is welcome and on behalf of my party I offer the Minister broad support for it.  It is a fact that as people grow older their needs narrow and their demands become more modest. Essentially all they ask of life is that there is a place for them with proper health care, security and a reasonable pension to enable them to live out their days in some kind of decency and dignity. We are all concerned that proper pension provision will be in place for us so that when the time comes we can avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> The importance of pensions cannot be over-emphasised.  An occupational pension is the most valuable asset many people have, although it is not always recognised as such.  The value of pension entitlements can be worth far more than the family home.  In some instances they can be more important than the family farm or business.  It is vital, therefore, that the State does everything it can to ensure that the highest standards of honesty and probity apply to the pension industry, and that it is properly policed. That is part of the intention of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen a number of examples of the terrible difficulties that can arise when pension fund moneys are improperly managed.  The Maxwell case is the most notorious example, but less notorious cases here have given rise to grave concern.  On the basis of those experiences this Bill is significant and welcome.  It will strengthen significantly the Pension Board's power of investigation and intervention.  When the Bill becomes law, the board will have power to bring in outside expertise to conduct investigations which will greatly augment the resources available to it without any increase in the State's bureaucracy.  In a valuable addition to its existing powers, the board will also have the authority to reverse wrongful asset transfers or payments.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I welcome the provisions of the Bill, but I raise a question about section 34 &mdash; the &ldquo;whistle blowing&rdquo; section&rdquo;&mdash; even though it is essential. Section 34 imposes a duty on those involved in the pension fund industry to disclose and report any fraud or misappropriation of funds of which they become aware, and that is as it should be.  I have no objection to that requirement being enshrined in law, but the Bill will also require reporting where a fraud or misappropriation is being contemplated.</P>
    <P>Defining or proving contemplation in such a case would present enormous difficulties. We may well have to call in the assistance of the Jesuits if we are to put <Col N="1200" /> into law the kind of procedures that would enable that aspiration of the Bill to be implemented.  Having said that, I would welcome a mechanism to implement such an aspiration &mdash; if it can be found &mdash; in the Bill although I cannot see how it could be done.  However, we can tease out that issue in more detail on Committee Stage.  In the meantime, if any ideals can be brought in to enable that part of the Bill to be implemented there should be all party support.  In matters of this nature we cannot leave too much to chance.  It is a lesson we have learned, not only with pension funds but in many other areas.</P>
    <P>The Irish Association of Pension Funds has indicated that this provision might present great difficulties for its members.  It may be, however, that we can come up with something implementable having discussed the matter further.  If we do, we will have the makings of very fine legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the pensions board to give guidelines on the often complicated workings of the Pensions Act. This measure has been welcomed by the pension fund industry.  I know from experience the difficulties some people have in understanding the basic principles of how a pension fund works and what they are entitled to as a result of the contributions they make during their working lives.</P>
    <P>The importance of the pensions issue is highlighted by the country's changing population structure.  To put it simply, this country is ageing and the elderly, as a percentage of the total population, will increase significantly over the next 20 years.  There have been dramatic improvements in health services and living standards generally since the foundation of the State.  This means that people are now living longer.</P>
    <P>It is estimated, for instance, that the average life expectancy has increased by 15 years for Irish males since 1926, and by 20 years for females over the same period.  It is interesting to note that nature has given gains to females they have not achieved in other areas of life.  That presents us with another set of issues <Col N="1201" /> that must be confronted in relation to pension rights for women.  We will have to come back to that issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We are assured that this demographic trend is set to continue, and the result will be a substantial increase in the number of elderly people of pensionable age.  The 1991 census showed there were 403,000 people over the age of 65. On the basis of projections published by the Central Statistics Office last year, this figure is set to surge upwards in the years ahead.  The CSO estimates that within ten years the section of the population aged 65 and over will have increased by 43,000 above the record in the last census.  That would put the total number of people over 65 at 446,000 or 12.6 per cent of the population, as opposed to 11.5 per cent at present.</P>
    <P>Looking forward another 20 years the picture is even more dramatic.  By the year 2026, the number of people over 65 will have risen to almost 700,000 and, if present trends continue, will account for 19 per cent of the country's total population. These changes in the population structure will have an enormous impact on economic life.  It is imperative that politicians and policy makers make provision now for this eventually.  At present, the annual cost of old age pensions to this State is about £1 billion per year.  This figure will increase sharply as the number of elderly in the population rises.  Health care costs will also rise as the elderly are one of the groups most heavily reliant on the public health service. It is particularly important that we emphasise the need for all working people to make private pension provisions for themselves.  Otherwise, the pressure on the State's old age pension system will become unsustainable.  It is disturbing to note that a very large portion of the working population is not covered by any form of occupational pension.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account the changes taking place in the labour market. Traditionally, a person entered a job on leaving school or college and <Col N="1202" /> continued to work in the same organisation until reaching retirement age. That still applies to the majority of people working in the civil and public service.  Throughout the rest of the economy, however, the picture is changing dramatically.  The number of people working part-time or on contract has increased markedly in recent years.  I understand that about two thirds of the jobs now being created in the Irish economy are part-time jobs.  There is also the phenomenon of greater mobility, with people moving from job to job, while the unemployment crisis means that people may spend significant periods out of work.  Female workers may alternate between working and family duties, with significant breaks in service.</P>
    <P>We are moving into a highly changed situation and there is clear need for education on the whole area of pensions. We must engender in our young population a much greater awareness of the need to make provision for retirement. We must get the message across to people, regardless of their employment situation, that their post retirement living standards will depend crucially on the pension arrangements they make now.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate to have a well developed and professionally managed pension fund industry which is quite sophisticated by European standards. An essential prerequisite for any professional fund manager is investment freedom.  The manager must be able to invest the funds under his control so as to obtain the best possible return for scheme members.  In a small country like Ireland, where investment opportunities are necessarily limited, it is particularly important that fund managers are given the freedom to diversify their investment portfolios.</P>
    <P>Pension funds are among the main investors in the Irish economy. However, they could play a much greater role in financing Irish industry and commerce if they were allowed to so do.  The situation in this country is very strange.  Irish pension funds have <Col N="1203" /> invested substantial sums in companies such as British Telecom, British Airways and Northern Ireland Electricity, yet they are precluded from investing in any of these industries in Ireland.  This is because the Irish Government still believes the State should be directly involved in ownership of large sections of Irish industry.  Even when it is decided to dispose of all or part of a State controlled asset, the pension fund industry continues to be ignored.</P>
    <P>In the case of Telecom Éireann and TSB bank, the Government, under Labour Party influence, has opted for trade sales rather than stock market flotations. It is a very twisted kind of ideology indeed, that would prefer to see strong and successful Irish companies sold to foreigners rather than given the opportunity to thrive as independent entities financed by Irish money and the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>When my party was in power we presided over two successful flotations of State-owned companies, Greencore and Irish Life.  These flotations were successful from the point of view of the companies themselves, from the point of view of their employees, and from the point of view of the Irish taxpayer.  Both companies are now strong independent businesses, Irish-owned and controlled. Irish pension funds are major shareholders in the two companies and are ready to provide them with additional funding <i>via</i> the stock market should they need new capital to finance corporate expansion.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend the examples of Greencore and Irish Life to the present administration.  It is surely ironic that the Minister for Finance should tell the pension fund industry to invest more of its money in Ireland when his Government continues to deny that industry investment opportunities in the Irish economy.  Irish pension funds have proved that they will invest in Ireland if given the chance.  They will invest in Irish airlines and airports, telecommunications and electricity generation, <Col N="1204" /> but they cannot do so if the Government refuses them the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The pension fund industry in Ireland remains a great untapped source of capital, and that is something we should address.  If this Government was willing to sell commercial State companies to the pension funds <i>via</i> the stock exchange, the Irish taxpayer would benefit greatly, as would the State companies. The companies would benefit because they would have gained commercial independence and would be free from State and foreign control.  The taxpayer would benefit as the receipts from privatisation would enable the national debt to be reduced and also because he or she would no longer have to foot the bill for capital injections to fund the development and expansion needs of these companies.  It is a remarkable fact that we have such a highly developed pension fund industry and at the same time such an underdeveloped political understanding of how to use that industry for the greater benefit of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which sets out clear procedures designed to safeguard pension funds.  There is great scope for this Government to proceed on the lines that I have described in relation to Irish pension funds.  They could be used to assist the economy if the Government had the will to make it happen.  Much could be done to unleash their potential and the economy could be revitalised, with consequent benefits, not alone to people who are dependent on pensions to guarantee comfort in their old age, but to younger people contributing to their pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Bill will not be the talking point around the country tomorrow, it is most important. If people only knew of its importance in terms of their pension rights and retirement, there would be much greater interest in it.  I have noticed over the years that it is almost impossible to encourage people under the age of 35 years to think seriously about a retirement pension of any description.  This <Col N="1205" /> has not changed and it is important to encourage people in all walks of life to prepare at a young age for retirement. If they want a good quality of life in retirement, they must consider taking out a private pension.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of important points.  I have taken an interest in this issue over the years and &mdash; I hope I am not being over pessimistic &mdash; I am aware problems would arise if there was an immediate draw down of pensions.  I hope it would not happen but there would be a liquidity problem in the pension funds if people were allowed to draw down their pensions when they reached 45 or 47 years.  It is one thing to point out that various categories of people are excluded &mdash; I intend to mention a category which should not be excluded because it is most unfair &mdash; but we must take account of the likely demographic patterns in the future as outlined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The population is ageing and in the future a smaller number of people at work will carry a larger proportion of elderly people, those with disabilities and so on.  The engine room of the economy, that is, the people who make up the workforce, will reduce in size but the number of people who must be carried will increase.  I am oversimplifying the position but, given that background, the word must go out loud and clear that people should not just become interested in financial affairs relating to their retirement when they turn 40 or 50 years of age.  This message should be got across to young people in civics classes in schools.  They must get used to the discipline at an early stage in their lives of providing for their retirement.  The House should get that most important point across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pensions industry is a huge operation. It is much larger than most people realise given that it involves approximately 55,000 pension schemes of various sizes and has an asset value of £16 billion.  It is mind boggling to consider how that money could drive the economy in many ways.  There must be huge checks and balances and one of the <Col N="1206" /> reasons the Bill was introduced was to ensure that investment projects undertaken are successful and that there is a good return on the money invested.  I occasionally think we were over cautious in the past but I understand many of our fund managers are whizz kids possessing a high level of competence and expertise in that area.  It involves high finance and a certain amount of risk, but it is most important to relate that to the people paying weekly contributions from their hard earned income.</P>
    <P>Many people who contribute to private pension funds believe they are not entitled to know the stages their pensions have reached and how they are progressing.  They do not know where to get information on what is happening. This is one of the reasons for the appointment of a pensions ombudsman. I do not known whether it is the intention of the Minister, the Government or the pensions boards to appoint an ombudsman but it is important people can contact a person about such matters. I do not suggest this information is not available at present but an ombudsman should be appointed.  Many people share this view.  I have often heard people say they do not have a clue who is managing their pension, how it is doing or where they should go to get information.  Most important, they do not know whether their pension will be available when they reach retirement age.  That information may be readily available but it is not good enough that a great many hard working people are not aware of it.</P>
    <P>On the asset value of pension funds, I understand certain constraints on fund managers prevent them investng in Ireland and I ask the Minister to deal with this aspect in his reply to the debate.  As an engine for growth, one is not likely to find another economic operation in the State which has the strength of £16 billion behind it.  It cannot all be directed towards the State but it is most important that the parameters which exist are explained and, if necessary, changed to ensure greater investment within the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> In comparison with other countries in a similar situation, people receiving old age contributory pensions have been looked after relatively well in recent years.  We all wish they could receive a little more, but, given all aspects of the economy, they are being looked after quite well.  Nobody should take credit for this because people who have worked hard over many years on behalf of the State are entitled to that; it is the least any country can do for them.  The non-contributory pension is not covered by the Bill's provisions and I ask the Minister to refer to it.</P>
    <P>Many people, particularly the self-employed, are worried about their assessment for an old age pension because they did not pay self-employed PRSI.  They hope that whoever is in Government at that time will not tell them that they had their chance to invest in a pension and as they did not take it, they cannot have a pension. Some people are becoming suspicious of that.  I expect that is not the case but it should be said officially.</P>
    <P>In 1988 provision was made for huge numbers of the self-employed to pay for their own pensions, which I welcomed. Many farmers and the self-employed were not too happy at that time because they thought it was another form of taxation but they rapidly changed their minds when they understood the system. At that time it was decided the minimum period of paying contributions should be ten years.  A number of problems have arisen with that scheme in the past three or four years, in particular, which are now becoming acute.</P>
    <P>People such as small farmers, shopkeepers, plumbers, painters and so on who are now approaching 66 years of age have paid contributions for only eight or nine years and, under the legislation, are debarred from receiving a contributory pension.  Worse still, unless they divest themselves of their assets they will not be entitled to the non-contributory old age pension.  They have the worst of all worlds and the most <Col N="1208" /> they can expect to receive is a partial refund of the contributions they paid when they reach 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has sympathy for this group and I make an impassioned plea to him for his Department and the Pensions Board to do something to alleviate the problems which have arisen.  These problems will not exist in another couple of years because by that time those who have not paid contributions for the minimum ten year period will not deserve a pension as they will have been given ample opportunity to pay.  Through no fault of their own but as a result of their age pattern, this group could not have paid sufficient contributions before they reached the age of 66 years.</P>
    <P>This may prove costly on an actuarial assessment basis and there may be a case for paying a <i>pro rata</i> pension, in other words, to allow the person to continue making payments until they have paid for ten years or to pay them a reduced pension.  I am not talking about an indiscriminate opening up of this but of targeting a specific group.  The Minister is fully aware of what I am speaking about.  A national association was recently formed for the self-employed. That makes good sense and there is a case to be met.  I hope something will be done for them before another year passes.  They are morally right in what they are looking for and this problem occurred through no fault of theirs.  It will be a once off adjustment for a few years because the problem will not exist in the near future.</P>
    <P>Some of the Bill's provisions are very welcome.  It is a general tightening up of the checks and balances in the pension fund market.  It is galling for men and women who have worked hard all their lives and looked forward to their retirement to find that, through roguery or corruption, somebody has squandered their pension.  Apart from sickness, nothing could be worse.  I congratulate the Minister on the provisions of the Bill, with which I do not think there will be any problems in this House.  One would need to work closely with the <Col N="1209" /> industry to give a blow by blow analysis of what is needed on a technical basis.</P>
    <P>Whatever changes need to be made in our system, given our ageing population, fewer people at work and people living longer &mdash; which we hope will continue &mdash; must be made on time and take full account of the available research.  It would be easy to bring in grandiose schemes which could not be paid for later or would be paid for the wrong way by virtue of the fact there might not be a retirement pension scheme.  Some of the business which will have to be done over the next five or ten years will be costly and there are no free lunches for anybody &mdash; everything has to be paid for.  There will have to be major changes.</P>
    <P>It will be a huge help if the economy continues to grow.  However, it was not always as good as it is now and might not continue in the present vein.  As the Minister said, note must be taken of the liquidity of the system and the potential draw down.  I presume we have facts and figures which will show clearly every few years the exact draw down.  If the shortfall begins to mount up, there is no point in waiting until Doomsday, for which nobody would thank the Government &mdash; if there has to be some bad news over the next few years we must talk about it openly.  We must put in place a pension scheme which everyone will be proud of and feel secure with, and which will allow us to say we cherish our elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which, among other matters, provides for many technical adjustments.  The 1990 Pensions Act was, as several speakers said, a milestone in safeguarding and protecting workers' occupational pensions.  It was a particularly significant development and ensured that pension promises made to employees would become a reality in practice.  There have been cases where pensioners discovered their pensions did not exist because the funds had been used in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice it has worked well and has <Col N="1210" /> been acclaimed and used by other countries in framing their pension legislation and ensuring funds are neither abused nor misappropriated.  If the UK had similar pension safeguards in place the Maxwell disaster would have been less likely to have happened and probably could not have happened.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Law and order is the subject which most exercises the minds of Members of the House and the public, particularly those involved in efforts to ensure law and order by preventing crime.  As Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned, Article 43.1 of the Constitution enshrines the responsibilities we have to ensure citizens can receive the benefits of law and order.</P>
      <P>The issue has tended to become politicised recently.  Since the Minister for Justice took office there seems to have been an explosion in media coverage of debates on crime, the drugs problem. prison places and on comments from gardaí.  The difficulties the Minister faces did not begin when she took office &mdash; they have been building up for many years under many Ministers for Justice.</P>
      <P>I will not address the complexities and niceties of the law and court procedures, the changes needed, the intent of this Bill and the Minister's intentions. There are four elements which are important to the people.  We have a responsibility as legislators to ensure we have practical, intelligent and speedily implementable laws.  The responsibility for the implementation of those laws and dealing with those who infringe them falls on the Garda and then on the courts.  The prison system then has to cope with the outcome of the court procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> In taking stock of the four strands of law enforcement we have to admit that the Legislature has been remiss in its efforts to put in place proper, workable and effective laws.  In the last ten to 15 years we have had many reports from the Law Reform Commission, recommendations, discussions, study groups and position papers.  The Minister has an ambitious programme.  I hope our efforts in bringing forward Private Members' Bills will speed up the process.</P>
    <P>This morning the Minister suggested that she did not intend to get involved in a league table as to who produced the most paper on the issues.  However, the frustrations we feel have led us to draft various Bills, present them to the House and make a competent case for them in the hope the House will support them. If the Government rejects them, let it speed up its process so the House may give effect to the necessary measures.  I hope the Minister will bring forward her Bill speedily so that the best recommendations in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill can be incorporated in it and, more importantly, so that action is taken and the legislation required is put before the House.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have to accept that we have not adequately responded to the requirements.  No other issue is higher in people's minds.  This is brought home to us not only when we canvass door to door &mdash; as we are doing at present in my constituency &mdash; but also in our normal work and at public meetings.  This issue is above all others on the political agenda.  Erring on the side of action may bring criticism from some but the public wants us to err on the side of taking urgent action.</P>
    <P>One has to feel sympathy for the Garda.  I raised matters related to the Garda in my constituency on the Adjournment of the House and the Minister responded.  She does not need the Opposition to articulate in detail the various concerns of gardaí who risk life and limb in the process of arresting criminals, taking them to court to be <Col N="1212" /> charged and having them sent to prison only to have the revolving door system release them.  The gardaí are frustrated when they have honoured their duties, only to discover their efforts have been in vain.</P>
    <P>The representatives in this House in the past decade or so can collectively take the blame for the lack of prison spaces and facilities.  We will support the Minister if prison spaces and other necessary facilities are provided.  It falls to us to be constructively critical when we do not see decisive action.  When Fianna Fáil was last in Government it took decisions on what it considered to be necessary action.  For various financial reasons the present Government deferred certain of those decisions.  An attempt is now being made to put them back on the agenda.  Whatever may be the Government's priorities and financial constraints, the provision of prison spaces should not be retarded.</P>
    <P>We also have to examine the operation of the Garda.  How many times will manpower studies, realignments, readjustments, appointments of deputy commissioners, regionalisations and other managerial changes be put in train when there is disquiet and criticism of Garda management?  There is a perception among members of the community of a degree of concern about the commitment of the Garda to its tasks and responsibilities.  I urge the Minister through the Garda commissioner to ensure full commitment to the various tasks of the Garda.  It is not productive or helpful to be specifically critical because the vast majority of members of the Garda give that full commitment.</P>
    <P>We all accept that court procedures are archaic, ridiculous and a waste of manpower.  Gardaí are obliged to sit in courts for hours and days waiting for cases because of an incompetent listing system.  Some time ago this House undertook to look at waiting lists and emergency facilities in the health services. One must come to the conclusion that the operations of the courts are equally in need of intelligent, pragmatic and realistic timetabling.  Some degree <Col N="1213" /> of efficiency will have to be introduced into the system.</P>
    <P>The fourth point I wish to make relates to prisons.  According to tonight's <i>Evening Herald</i> the Minister will go to Mountjoy Prison tomorrow to open a new drugs free unit.  According to the newspaper's headline, the unit is being &ldquo;slated&rdquo;.  Gardaí and prison staff cannot understand why there is an acceptance of mediocrity within the vast operation of Mountjoy.  The newspaper states: &ldquo;Inside Mountjoy over 40 per cent of the 600-plus prisoners are said to be addicts with heroin, ecstasy, LSD and cannabis freely available&rdquo;.  If that is the case, it is deplorable and unacceptable.  The managerial staff of the prison system are either not effective or something is horribly wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>They come in as addicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Availability is the problem. It is accepted that drugs are available. Much of our crime is drug related and drugs are available in the prison system to ensure that addicts' habits are maintained.  Unfortunate prisoners who do not have the problem going into prison seem to have it on leaving.  That is an even bigger issue.  We are now sending people out of prison, having served their terms, who have become drug addicts.  &ldquo;I Started on Drugs in Jail&rdquo;, is another headline in the same newspaper. It states:</P>
      <P>A former prisoner in Mountjoy Jail has told how up to 20 inmates at a time would use the same needle on a landing in the prison.  They simply queued up outside the toilet at the end of a landing to inject drugs.  &ldquo;It was as if they're waiting on a toilet. But they're not.  They are waiting on a syringe to shoot dope into their arms,&rdquo;, said 22 year old...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Mountjoy, prisoners could actually buy heroin on a couple of the landings.  In St. Patrick's detainees had to get drugs on a visit.  &ldquo;I brought my own needles in with me ...There <Col N="1214" /> was times where I would have to share needles.  I would clean them with bleach and things like that.  That is not 100 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the story of one person and it conveys the point I wish to make about the managerial aspect of the prison system and what is wrong with it.  It will add to the difficulties associated with the breakdown of law and order in this country and particularly in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy O'Donoghue's efforts and those the Minister intends to make will result in a Bill which will give effect to the desirable changes we wish to see. It should not be a political issue.  This party might be on the other side of the House in the future and we have been there often enough in the past to know that this is not a party political matter. However, it is becoming one.  If we in Opposition are to secure support and gain office in the next election we can do nothing more significant than have an acceptable policy, in which the community will have faith, as our platform in the next general election campaign. The Minister will have to account for her stewardship of her complex and difficult ministry.  Whatever support is required to take the action that is necessary should and will be forthcoming from all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>I urge that such action be taken.  The Minister, my colleague and other party spokespersons should collectively try to ensure that whatever legislation is necessary is speedily put through the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on a point made by Deputy Lawlor.  Lest the House be led to believe that the Minister for Justice has been somewhat inactive during the past 15 months, the <Col N="1215" /> official record will show that we have had more debate, deliberation and consequent action in the area of justice than, perhaps, in any other area of the affairs of the State since the present Minister took office.  Without digressing from the subject of this debate, I wish to put on record many of the constructive, positive and necessary initiatives that have been undertaken by this Minister over a wide range of issues.</P>
      <P>We have seen the drugs initiative, the initiative to secure more prison spaces, the Garda initiative and the resolution to move on the long running dispute within the Garda Síochána.  The Court and Court Officers Act is a wide ranging reform that will improve our courts system fundamentally.  More judges have been appointed &mdash; there were further appointments last night &mdash; to tackle the backlog in the courts.  There have been wide ranging reforms in criminal procedure and criminal law.</P>
      <P>Rural crime has been tackled.  Following widespread publicity about rural crime earlier this year the Minister for Justice, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Welfare, took the initiative in appointing a task force.  It has reported in record time, although it was rubbished by Members of this House as being another talking shop.  That task force must have achieved unique status for the manner in which it produced its report in a number of weeks.  The report's recommendations were implemented by the Government without delay.  We have seen a programme of reform of a fundamental nature that we have not seen for decades.  It will undoubtedly ensure that the criminal justice system is reformed and that criminal law reflects the needs of the citizens, which is the objective of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will dwell on one aspect of the criminal justice system &mdash; the need for the Garda Síochána to be provided with permanent air support.  The Minister has commented on this recently and I hope positive action will be taken in the lifetime of this Government.  Deputy <Col N="1216" /> O'Donoghue's Bill is interesting although it is not earth shattering.  The Minister's response, that she will deal with it through a comprehensive criminal procedure Bill, is the best way to deal with this matter rather than initiate a number of piecemeal measures.  Small, rather inconsequential legislation must take second place to the overall and comprehensive review which is being undertaken at present.  I was pleased the Minister spoke last night about introducing the Criminal Law Bill which, I am sure, will receive widespread support from the House.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána needs to be equipped with the most modern technology. It is regrettable that the Garda does not have the services of a full-time air unit or helicopter, rather than having to borrow one from time to time from the Air Corps.  It is important that the country keeps pace with other European jurisdictions in crime detection and prevention.  Adequate and permanent aerial equipment should be made available to the Garda Síochána on a full-time basis.  At present, the Garda depend on the availability of Air Corps helicopters for surveillance.  In the recent publicised Operation Connacht, the gardaí borrowed an Air Corps helicopter for a few days to assist in crime detection.  Every effort should be made to ensure they have a helicopter staffed by trained Garda pilots.</P>
    <P>Traditionally we have been fed a diet by those on the opposite side of the House of more gardaí on the beat, on bicycles, on every street corner and at rural crossroads as a solution to crime. It must be recognised that the recruitment and training of new gardaí is becoming more expensive and consuming more of the Garda budget on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Helicopters have been used throughout the world for surveillance purposes since 1948.  International studies show that the helicopter or air unit acts as a major deterrent as well as a vital tool in crime detection.  The initial capital cost is approximately £1.5 million, but the maintenance costs are considerably less <Col N="1217" /> and it is more cost effective than the average patrol car.  Modern detective methods must be employed.  Just as the bicycle gave way to the patrol car and the corner telephone box gave way to the two-way radio, so too must a Garda helicopter become a vital part of the Garda equipment, enabling the delivery of better protection and services to the citizens while maximising the use of taxpayers' money.  In recent years a token sum of £100,000 was allocated for aircraft in the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  The Minister has increased this to £200,000 for 1996 as part of a continuous programme of financial support for an air support unit. A major capital investment in a Garda helicopter is essential if we are to win the battle against the crime bosses.</P>
    <P>The benefits are clear.  A helicopter is not affected by traffic congestion and it is possible to patrol a community in the same amount of time, regardless of population.  This is not true of the garda on the beat.  A helicopter can detect activity regardless of whether the terrain is mountainous or coastal or whether the roads are bad, or in remote areas such as forest and thick woodland. The ability to spot things from the air and the use of infra-red equipment at night has obvious advantages.  Airborne law enforcement in this jurisdiction should be given the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important for the Government to ensure that we acquire specialised helicopters which can be flown by specially trained gardaí, in line with most European jurisdictions.  We are dealing with upmarket criminals who have huge cash resources to finance their criminal activities.  It is vital that the Garda Síochána is provided with the necessary tools to deal satisfactorily with this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's approach to this legislation.  I commend her on the new criminal law Bill which she will publish shortly in response to crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I share many of the concerns expressed by the Minister during the debate yesterday.  It is difficult <Col N="1218" /> not to be cynical about Fianna Fáil's intentions as regards this Bill and its approach to the criminal justice issue.  It is also difficult to disagree with the Minister's assessment that this Bill is being pushed to a vote because of the forthcoming by-elections.  The Bill is another measure designed by Fianna Fáil to give the impression that it is strong on crime.  The Minister pointed out that if crime was solved by introducing more legislation we would have solved this problem a long time ago. Given that Fianna Fáil held the Justice portfolio for seven years prior to the change of Government in 1994, one would have expected it to have done more when in office.</P>
      <P>The delays in the courts system did not develop overnight.  I repeat the Minister's findings on the central tenet of the Bill.  Deputy O'Donoghue was right when he said that some of the delays faced by people in the courts system are unacceptable.  However, that does not mean one measure will solve the problem.  Last night the Minister revealed that of the 354 cases sent for trial by the Dublin District Court last year, sworn depositions were taken in only 27.  That rebuts one of the Bill's main premises.  People's right to have depositions taken does not appear to be the cause of the delays in the courts system as the Minister said that only a limited number of witnesses were called in those 27 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister reported that the committee on court practice and procedures recommended in 1989 the retention of preliminary hearings in the District Court.  It is not unreasonable to assume there are good reasons for doing so.  I do not believe it is trying to clog our courts system.  The provision for preliminary hearings in our legal system dates back to the 17th century, yet we are being asked to do away with it in a two day debate in this House.  The Progressive Democrats asked us to get rid of the right to silence in its Bill some weeks ago.  The Labour Party is prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to quell the current crime <Col N="1219" /> crisis, but they must be effective.  That is the difference between the Labour Party and the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue suggested that the Labour Party learned certain things on the doorsteps in Dublin West.  I am happy to share my experiences on the doorsteps of Dublin West and Dublin South West with the Deputy.  The people are fed up with Bills on this subject. They believe there is sufficient legislation on the Statute Book which is not being implemented.</P>

      <P>Deputies will recall the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1993, and the concerns of the civil liberties groups that this legislation was punitive and damaging to public liberty. Deputy O'Donoghue will recall that this legislation, introduced by his colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, received the full support of the Labour Party. However, two years later, there is little evidence of the Act being enforced, of which the Deputy would have been aware if he had visited the Dublin-West constituency this week.  He would have realised that Bills in themselves are not the panacea for all our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that we must, at the practical resource level, provide all the support necessary to those involved in tackling crime.  A complete review, perhaps even a commission, is necessary to review the operation of the Garda at all levels.  Everybody would benefit from this and I support any measure to facilitate the gardaí in their difficult task.  In this context I welcome the agreement on the new Criminal Law Bill, but there should also be a review of Garda operations.  The Minister recently announced a regionalisation programme <Col N="1220" /> with regard to the Garda Síochána which I hope will be effective.</P>
    <P>There are many serious problems facing the people in the constituency I represent. If there was a simple answer to these problems I am sure that both the last Government and this Government would have immediately solved them.  If this or previous Bills had been effective there would be no problems of the kind I experienced.  These include the removal of people from their houses because of threats and intimidation, which is widespread in many parts of my constituency.  Young people, especially young mothers with children, are subject to threats and abuse, usually from young men, who exert their influence on these families at the most vulnerable times in the evenings.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how any measure could deal with this problem instantly.  I have raised it at local authority level with our manager for housing.  I recall the concern of the nation when families in Nationalists areas in Northern Ireland left their houses because of threats and intimidation.  It was a major national crisis.  We have a miniature form of it in many of the estates in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I do not know the answer to the problem. The manager of a south Dublin county council housing department can only deal with it in a limited form.  Many of the young people responsible for the intimidation are brought into Garda stations under the legislation but the answer to the problem they create is not within the terms of this legislation alone.</P>
    <P>Those who do not attend school are asked if matters would be helped if they did attend.  However, this also does not appear to address the problem. There are many factors governing the situation and many difficulties associated with it.  While some further legislation is necessary, we need a co-ordinator to ensure that existing legislation will be used effectively, without fear or favour, and immediately, to deal with the serious problems which people in my constituency want to address here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> The Bills introduced by the Opposition are not the way to proceed.  Many Members on the other side represent constituencies with similar problems. They must agree that producing Bills is not the panacea for this problem.  We must ensure that existing legislation works effectively.  It can then be reviewed later at which point further legislation may be introduced if required.</P>

      <P>Since entering Opposition. Fianna Fáil has displayed an unprecedented commitment to legislative reform.  This contrasts markedly with its langour while in office.  Nevertheless, the current deluge of Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bills presents this House with a welcome opportunity to tease out some topical issues, which Fianna Fáil ignored while in office, leaving the Government to deal with them. These include the blood bank hepatitis C <i>débâcle</i>, entailing costs amounting to £60 million, the £75 million Goodman beef scandal fines and the more than £200 million that had to be paid to women entitled, in law, to equality payments. In addition Fianna Fáil, on leaving office, left behind a drug crisis of epic proportions for the Government to solve.  Sometimes, I feel sick when I hear members of the Fianna Fáil Party talk about action in Opposition, knowing that they will cut back on this action when in Government.</P>

      <P>There is agreement on all sides of the House that the criminal justice system, which we inherited from the UK, is cumbersome, unwiedly and in many cases outdated.  Some of the pre-1992 legislation has been amended or repealed on a piecemeal basis in recent years; other aspects have been comprehensively analysed by the Law Reform Commission and we are still awaiting implementation of its recommendations in a variety of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is a mass of <Col N="1222" /> anachronistic legislation on the Statute Book, ranging from the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, to the Probation of Offenders Act, 1901.  This legislation was drawn up to serve a society and a body politic very different from ours.  In a society then dominated by the relationship between landlord and tenant, offences against property were viewed in a far more serious light than offences against the person.  The Law Reform Commission Report on Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person states: &ldquo;Historically, offences against the person other than homicide were treated by the common law with surprising lenience, especially when compared to the severity of punishment provided for property offences&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The 1861 Act illustrates the different social mores in the 19th century.  It created offences of assault on specific categories of person, for example, clergymen, peace officers and seamen, with the clear implication that such persons were in some way more worthy of legal protection than others.  I am aware that the Minister is preparing new legislation dealing with non-fatal offences against the person.  Such legislation is more than a century overdue and I welcome her initiative.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's proposal to abolish the distinction between so called &ldquo;misdemeanours&rdquo; and &ldquo;felonies&rdquo;, and other anachronisms such as the concept of penal servitude.  I am pleased that the Minister has started clearing the cobwebs from our legislative <i>corpus.</i></P>
    <P>We might also usefully examine the issue of fines.  Many of the penalties laid down in our laws were set at a time when £100 would buy a decent car or pay for the holiday of a lifetime.  Today, any self-respecting criminal would shrug off a fine of that order as mere operating expenses.  I understand that inflation linking fines would be unconstitutional, but a mechanism must be found to ensure that penalties fully reflect the severity of an offence.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, however, we need to review all pre-1922 legislation, as well <Col N="1223" /> as much of what has been enacted since then, with a view to codifying our laws and bringing them into the latter part of the 20th century.  Thereafter, this codified body of legislation should be subjected to review every 20 years or so.</P>
    <P>Our cumbersome court procedures are just one aspect of an outdated body of legislation which badly needs overhauling and to that extent I welcome any attempt to streamline procedures.  It is unacceptable that either the accused or the victim should be forced to wait months or years before a case comes to court.  For the victim, delays simply prolong the pain induced by a crime and delay the resumption of normal life.  For an accused person, especially one who is innocent of any crime, delays are equally unacceptable &mdash; justice delayed is justice denied.</P>
    <P>However, we must ensure that in speeding up procedures we do not cut corners at the expenses of fundamental liberties.  In proposing this Private Members' Bill last night Deputy O'Donoghue said the growing jurisprudence dealing with the rights of the accused had all but eclipsed the rights of victims, but I do not believe the two sets of rights are mutually exclusive. Our justice system is founded on the presumption of innocence, which is central to individual freedom.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there is a growing and welcome recognition of the rights of victims.  Society is no longer prepared to treat victims as incidental to the criminal justice system.  We have come to realise the traumatic and lasting effects of crime on victims, many of whom find their lives altered forever by a single act of criminality.  In this regard we need to re-visit the criminal injuries compensation scheme and look more closely at the need to provide a charter of rights for victims.  We must not, however, expand one set of rights at the expense of another.  The challenge facing us as legislators is to balance all the rights involved.</P>
    <P>The need to address the failings in our criminal justice system has become <Col N="1224" /> more urgent as public concern about crime levels increases.  I share these concerns. My constituency, Dublin South-Central, is being ravaged by drugs and drug-related crime which, sadly, is growing at a rapid rate thanks to the inactivity of Fianna Fáil when it was in Government.  My constituents are quite rightly demanding action rather than mere promises.</P>
    <P>However, I fear that as legislators we are in danger of addressing many of the issues in the absence of hard facts.  In recent months one could not open a paper or turn on the television without learning of some new atrocity.  As a result, citizens find themselves living under siege and this sense of threat has been heightened by often irresponsible media coverage.  The acres of newsprint covering crime and crime-related matters in recent months have added little or nothing to our body of knowledge regarding crime and the social and economic context in which it occurs.</P>
    <P>It is clear from a brief glance at the Garda reports that there has undoubtedly been a steady increase in crime during recent years.  However, much of the current debate is being carried out in a statistical vacuum.  We know what crimes are being committed but relatively little about who is committing them, how many are repeat offenders, the kind of sentences they receive, the length of time they serve before being released, what path they take after being released and how many are recidivist criminals.  There is an urgent need to establish a criminological statistics unit under the auspices of either the Garda research bureau or the Central Statistics Office.  Until we start gathering reliable data, legislative proposals will continue to be little more than shots in the dark.  I hope the Minister will address this issue as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that the implementation of existing provisions is improved and that any current loopholes in the law are closed.  The need for this becomes evident when one examines, for example, the terms of section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, <Col N="1225" /> which provides for consecutive sentencing for crimes committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>The Bill being debated today is similar in direction to the Private Members' Bill introduced by the Progressive Democrats earlier this month, although the latter was rather more measured. There is an urgent need to speed up trials and to abolish the current bottlenecks in the courts system.  However, I am not convinced that abolishing preliminary hearings would effectively serve that purpose.  We cannot allow ourselves to be seduced into tampering with the foundations of our criminal justice system without giving very careful consideration to all the possible long-term implications.</P>

      <P>Through no fault of their own, I hasten to add.  Speaking generally, they live in an unreal environment and come to rely on the advice of their civil servants on how things should be done.  It takes a Minister of strong character to come up with innovative thinking and policies to reform an existing system, rather than go along with the way things have always been done and add to a system which plods along without effectively dealing with the issues of the day.  We need radical thinking about our criminal justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every day people ask me what is happening to our society, why such horrendous crimes are being committed, why <Col N="1226" /> murders are so commonplace, why human life is so cheap to our hardened criminals, why so many brutal rapes are taking place on a monthly basis, why so many aggravated sexual assaults are being reported, and why such horrendous violent crimes against women are being committed.  Women in particular have a right to be outraged.  Their lifestyles and even their freedom of movement have been curtailed.  Many of them are afraid to do things which would have been no problem to them ten years ago.  Recently there were public demonstrations by women's organisations and they are right to be concerned and demand action against criminals.</P>

      <P>The crime problem was not created by media hype although media organs have commercial agendas and often have a vested interest in hyping the effects of crime.  The current crime problem is the burning issue certainly on the doorsteps of Dublin West, although Members did not have to visit that constituency to establish this fact.</P>
      <P>Society has changed and we could spend many hours analysing the reason for this.  On a radio programme broadcast earlier today, a youth worker, when it was put to him that widespread disadvantage existed in the past and yet there was no crime suggested that disadvantage and inequality still exists but, regardless of it some people are doing very well for themselves.  However, the Bill is not concerned with this issue and we must return to it at another time.</P>
      <P>There is a public perception that the courts are not functioning properly and criminals are not being dealt with effectively. This Bill in an important step attempts to eliminate procedural delays in the courts system and to streamline an often cumbersome and archaic process. Deputy O'Donoghue pointed out that a person arrested today on a charge of murder or rape is unlikely to be tried before 1999.  That is unbelievable and it cannot be tolerated.  Has the public been fully briefed about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time to seriously consider a system which obliges District Court clerks to record the details of evidence in writing. This is the age of the word processor, the Internet and E-mail and we cannot tolerate such a system.  Where is the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill the Minister promised to introduce some time ago?  Why is its introduction not seen as urgent?  Deputy Walsh castigated the Bill before the <Col N="1229" /> House, but neglected to mention that the Minister will introduce a Bill with similar provisions.  The three parties in coalition have different ideologies and philosophies and do not seem able to reach agreement.  They seem to be immobilised by indecision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not capable of taking the necessary decisions to deal with urgent issues.</P>
      <P>The three parties failed to reach agreement on the Northern Ireland peace process.  They also failed to reach agreement on the issues of crime, the right to silence and bail.  The only way they can agree on public expenditure is to increase it to keep everyone happy. There was no agreement on the White Paper on foreign policy published yesterday and the major issues involved were fudged.  The three parties cannot agree on the decisions that must be taken with regard to crime which is the major issue at present.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the issue of bail. Deputy O'Donoghue introduced two Private Members' Bills in this regard. There is widespread public support to amend the bail laws, particularly where there is a probability that someone before the courts is likely to commit another crime while out on bail. However, because of disagreements between the Government parties, it does not seem that action will be taken in this area.  A referendum was promised but it seems that it will not take place.  I do not believe people are prepared to accept such a situation any more.</P>

      <P>It is a question of getting the priorities right.  Unfortunately the priorities of the Deputy's party have very little support among the electorate. Democratic Left policies are supported by a very small percentage of the people while those of my party have been voted on time and again by the electorate who have always returned Fianna Fáil as the largest party in the Dáil.  When Democratic Left is returned to the Dáil as the largest party, its policies will be given some consideration.</P>
      <P>When in Government, Fianna Fáil put forward proposals relating to Castlerea Prison which were published in the book of Estimates.  We managed to keep public expenditure within the guidelines laid down.  It is, therefore, possible to accommodate priorities, one of which is crime.  I do not know what are the priorities of Democratic Left.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on the number of Private Members' Bills he has introduced in this House. As Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on justice, he has developed a clear plan of action on the criminal justice system and the rise of crime in society.  The Bills he introduced are consistent and deal with all aspects of the criminal justice system, bail, drug trafficking, criminal procedures, etc.  We have a clear plan to put to the electorate, who are aware of the platform on which Fianna Fáil stands. The public know we are seeking action on crime.  The Private Members' Bills introduced by Deputy O'Donoghue are a matter of record and will be voted on in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An announcement yesterday that the Garda are to be granted powers to arrest people suspected of serious crimes without warrants sound very good, but how often will such announcements be made?  When will the heads of the Bill be published?  When the Bill is finally introduced it will have to be considered by committees, sub-committees and the Law Reform Commission.  The Minister's Bill will not see the light of day during the lifetime of this Dáil.  It is all very well to promise such measures <Col N="1231" /> but action never seems to be taken and the problem becomes worse.</P>
    <P>The question of the rights of victims was addressed by other speakers and Deputy Byrne referred to it.  However, the content of his speech militated against victims.  It is sometimes hard to deal with the notions put forward in <i>The Irish Times</i> by civil libertarians with regard to the criminal justice system. They advocate good academic reasons for their arguments but, as public representatives are aware, the reality is quite different.  The rights of victims were discussed on many occasions in this House but they seem to be ignored, particularly by the present Government with its three different philosophies.  To judge by its record, Fine Gael would probably be quite good on crime if in Government on its own.  However, it cannot promote its policies because the two other coalition parties are pulling in different directions.</P>
    <P>We are discussing a cumbersome criminal justice system.  The legal profession must seriously consider its procedures and traditions because it seems that those involved in this profession are perpetuating the system to suit their vested interests.  Unfortunately this is a large subject and requires discussion on another occasion.  However, the people involved in the legal profession &mdash; barristers and solicitors &mdash; have a major role to play in streamlining the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Haughey's statement that the legal profession has a role to play in progressing law reform.  The Law Society and the Bar have given the Minister a comprehensive list of proposals to reform the justice system.  I hope they will be accepted, particularly with regard to delays which dog the courts system and are, in themselves, a cause of injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on introducing this Bill which represents another valiant effort by the Opposition to highlight the inadequacy of the Government's response in the criminal <Col N="1232" /> justice area.  The Government claims, gloats and boasts that it is tough on crime and that tackling serious crime is the first priority on its agenda.  Getting tough on crime requires a concerted strategy which the Government has abjectly failed to deliver by legislation or operational means.  The Minister constantly says that it is not only by Bills that there can be changes in the justice area.  To what operational matters can she point as having made a difference?</P>

      <P>For the Progressive Democrats, getting tough on crime is not about knee-jerk, bring back the birch style proposals or a return to capital punishment which was abolished when we were in Government.  Getting tough on crime means making strategic decisions based on well thought out <Col N="1233" /> laws.  Our recent Bill, which represented a comprehensive, integrated set of proposals that would have updated our laws to meet the demands of modern Irish criminality, was spectacularly voted down by the Government.  The Minister for Justice said that the proposals in our Prosecution of Offences and Punishment of Crimes Bill, 1996, were unrealistic.</P>
      <P>Does she still believe it is unrealistic to restructure our creaking criminal prosecution service and to change our absurd bail laws given that in 1994, 4,500 crimes were committed by people on bail?  Is it unrealistic, in her view, to curtail the absolute right to silence which is so regularly abused by hardened criminals?  Is it unrealistic to seek to modernise and speed up criminal trials as is proposed in this Bill and which was inherent in our Bill?  Is it unrealistic for the Minister or the Opposition to bring our laws on sentencing up to date and to tackle the problem of revolving doors in our prisons?</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;revolving doors&rdquo; has become a cliché in discussions on criminal justice but no action in this area has been taken.  Not one strategic decision has been made by the Government to tackle this problem.  There has been no strategic decision to deal effectively with the so-called temporary release system, which is, in effect, an unconditional, unsupervised system of full release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been marked by indecision on the serious questions of law and order which confront us today. This area should not lend itself to indecision by the Government or ideological rows within it.  The recent budget saw the left get its way on the economy.  The left must not be permitted to block desperately needed reforms of the justice system.  It blocked the proposed referendum on bail, the curtailment of the right to silence and the allocation of more jail spaces.  Fine Gael, the so-called party of law and order, having caved in on the economy, is constantly caving in on law and order.  Those of us who here and elsewhere demand tough <Col N="1234" /> action are regularly attacked by the Government and the Minister and we are accused of hyping up public anxiety and being reactionary.</P>

Citizens regularly read in newspapers of the antics of well known criminal godfathers who flout every procedure and law of the State and are living examples of the notion that crime not only pays but prospers at our expense.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister sarcastically rubbished the efforts of the Opposition which on a weekly basis put forward legislative proposals.  We do so to compensate for the fact that she is failing to do her job.  She is frequently and legitimately under siege and her only line of defence is to attack or shoot the messenger. Last night she lectured us along the lines that &ldquo;it takes more than legislation to tackle crime&rdquo;.  She then announced legislation to modernise the powers of arrest of the Garda.  In a bewildered fashion on the Order of Business, the Taoiseach said her proposals will be implemented in the summer.  To which summer was he referring?  The Minister did not mention that these proposals have been in the Department since 1965.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not to mention her constant references to the election campaign in Dublin West, including the analysis of Fianna Fáil election literature. The Minister's contribution last night was the most pathetic response I have heard to a legitimate Private Members' Bill.  This Government has been uniquely ungenerous in its response to such Bills.  No Opposition party claims that Bills proposed by it are flawless.  The purpose of such Bills is to challenge Government inactivity and press forward the frontiers of reform, introducing them is a legitimate activity and is our job.  However, this is rubbished by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Government established a committee system notionally to enhance scrutiny of Bills on Committee Stage. However, it appears that the Government sees no role for the Opposition on committees except to make up numbers at meetings and to compensate for the absence of its own Deputies.  The committee attendance record of Government Deputies is appalling.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's proposals to replace the preliminary examination procedure established in the 1967 Act with the proposed procedure set out in section 5 is an aspect of reform which was included in our Bill.  The preliminary investigation procedure has been widely criticised for many years on the grounds that it is anachronistic, time consuming, expensive and largely irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The historical function of preliminary depositions was to gather information for the court of trial.  The motivation was that a person should not be put on trial on an indictable offence unless a <Col N="1236" /><i>prima facie</i> case was made against him or her at an early stage.  It must be remembered that since the mid-nineteenth century other safeguards for the citizen have emerged.  There is a constitutional guarantee of a fair trial.  In 1924 a system involving a centralised prosecutor was introduced; first the Attorney General and now the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The latter's decision to prosecute is based on an open-minded assessment of the legal and factual merits of a case and is, in itself, an effective filter for unsatisfactory cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Progressive Democrats did not like the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of criminal legal aid has removed the possibility that an accused's ability to defend himself on trial on indictment would be prejudiced by lack of funds. On the issue of anachronism, it must be borne in mind that in the mid-nineteenth century there was no appeal from a verdict of guilty on a trial on indictment except where it involved an exceptional point of law; this is no longer the case.  It is blatantly obvious that there are strong grounds for reform and curtailment of the preliminary examination procedure.  This long-winded, time consuming taking of notes in longhand is out of date and we need to change it. Our proposals in this area were superior as they dealt with the problem in the current system without abandoning many of its benefical features such as the ability to take depositions for use at the trial from a witness whose age or health created a risk that they would not be available at the trial.  We also proposed to give a District Court judge discretion to refuse an application for depositions and to empower the Director of Public Prosecution to direct that a preliminary examination be dispensed with in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  She rubbished this Bill because it <Col N="1237" /> was flawed and our more comprehensive proposals on the grounds that we sought to achieve too much and were unrealistic.  The Minister must realise that there is considerable dissatisfaction with this Government in relation to its performance in bringing forward realistic and effective changes which are needed.  May I share two minutes of my time with Deputy Gregory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donnell for sharing her time.  I welcome Deputy O'Donoghue's efforts in drawing our attention to a critical area in combating crime and drugs.  It seems that the courts are slow in dealing with serious drugs cases.  I know of one instance where a major heroin dealer was first charged two years ago.  Since then he has been charged on three occasions having been caught while on bail with large quantities of heroin.  That individual's trial has still not taken place, which is outrageous.  I do not want to become involved in a political slagging match but it is not enough to criticise Deputy O'Donoghue's efforts. It is essential to take action to speed up court cases rather than criticise the efforts of an Opposition party or Deputy drawing attention to a critical area in the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>Let me refer to another serious issue which has come to my attention.  As so much money is made from drugs, these people are represented by the most expensive and successful legal defence teams in the State when the Garda eventually bring them before the courts. It is essential that the State prosecution team &mdash; I am not casting aspersions on anyone &mdash; in drugs cases, in particular, must be of the highest calibre and experience because they are up against defence counsel with the most successful records in defending people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one instance the dogs in the street in my area knew an individual was guilty, but he got off on a technicality <Col N="1238" /> with a suspended sentence on a possession charge.  Although he was not an addict, he had a number of deals of heroin in his possession and over a two day trial his defence counsel used all their experience and knowledge to argue that it was for his own use.  The Garda unit which brought that man before the court felt totally disillusioned and undermined in their efforts to combat heroin in the area I represent.  It is essential that no effort is spared to provide the most experienced prosecutors in these cases to combat those defending drug barons and drug dealers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In an extraordinary outburst in this House last evening the Minister for Justice, in criticising Fianna Fáil's genuine attempts to modernise and reform criminal legislation, suggested that the gestation period of criminal legislation should equal that of the average elephant.  She ignored the fact that Fianna Fáil produced no less than seven valid and urgent Bills over the past year.</P>
      <P>It was strange that there was no elephantine gestation period in relation to any of that legislation, which included the Proceeds of Crime Bill, 1995, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (No. 2) Bill, 1995, the Criminal Law (Sexual Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995, the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995, the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 1995, the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996, and the Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995.</P>
      <P>A cursory examination of the Minister's reaction to this extremely important legislation shows clearly that her agenda is politically motivated when her responsibility should be to the thousands of past, present and future victims of crime.  She appears to be shackled in a prison of futility and despair by her partners in the Rainbow Coalition Government.  When confronted by the finger waggers, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, the Minister for Justice cowers and then surrenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This was evident when she beat a hasty retreat from her proposal to hold a referendum on the bail laws which she announced publicly in March 1995.  The Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare scowled at her unilateral audacity and the Minister beat a hasty retreat for fear she would further offend their political sensitivities. No doubt the Taoiseach wagged his little finger in her direction as well because when the Labour Party and Democratic Left say &ldquo;jump&rdquo;, he says &ldquo;How high?&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is apparent to everyone that the greatest merry band of advisers, media managers, spin doctors and handlers ever assembled in the history of the State will be unable to restore Fine Gael's reputation as the party of law and order.  The poodles of the Rainbow Coalition, held on a tight rein by the rottweilers of the Labour Party and Democratic Left, have gradually been reduced to a sad and sorry whimper. This is not the party of Liam Cosgrave, James Dillon or Paddy Lindsay for they were man enough to stand their ground, to say what they meant and to implement it without fear or favour. Fine Gael is in power for the sake of power and it has long forsaken any pride in its tradition.</P>
      <P>The Minister seeks to operate the Department of Justice as little more than a support agency for hardened criminals.  The sad litany of failures, contradictions, broken promises, procrastination, prevarication, relentless inactivity and ultimate surrender to her political masters, the denizens of the so-called left, bear ample testimony to that. I said last night that the much promulgated and heralded era of openness, transparency and accountability would surely enter the lexicon of Irish political mythology as the epitaph of the Rainbow Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's swan song is best illustrated by the Minister's statement to the House last night that &ldquo;the <Col N="1240" /> Government is not satisfied that the case has been made for the complete abolition of preliminary hearings in the District Court&rdquo;.  The Government is not satisfied simply because it does not care. No cogent reason was advanced to support the Government's position and the Minister was reduced to the insulting and ill conceived remark that it is &ldquo;simply not an option for the Government to throw together various half-baked legal proposals without the necessary analysis and research having been undertaken and then pretend that these will in some way alleviate our crime problem&rdquo;.  None of our legal proposals were half-baked and the Minister well knows it.  She was obliged to plagiarise our Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (No. 2 Bill), 1995 to allow for the reporting of the details of evidence in incest cases following Mr. Justice Carney's judgement because her Bill was grossly inadequate.  She was obliged to take large chunks out of our Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1995, to save her blushes following publication of our Bill.  Her statement is also contradicted by the fact that she was obliged to accept our Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995, lock, stock and barrel.</P>
    <P>I must put the proposition to the Minister for Justice that, since these three Bills were accepted in one form or another by the Government, she should not demean herself or her Department by even seeking to suggest that our legal proposals are half-baked.  Everybody knows who is doing the baking around here and it is certainly not the Minister for Justice.  She will be long remembered as the Minister whose legislative response to an extremely serious crime situation was to introduce a single piece of legislation, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996, which was copied for the most part from Part I of Fianna Fáil's Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1995.</P>
    <P>In the House last evening, the Minister, who would appear to be adept at plagiarising what she describes as &ldquo;half-baked legal proposals&rdquo; and presenting them as her own, sought to suggest that Fianna Fáil believed the crime problem <Col N="1241" /> could be solved by legislation alone.  I never said that.  Fianna Fáil never said that.  I have never believed that and Fianna Fáil has never believed it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is actually saying that in the latter part of the 20th century it is in the interests of justice that every accused person should have the absolute right to have every word of evidence dictated to a District Court clerk and transcribed in longhand before a trial can commence.  Surely she cannot argue that the people of Ireland are well served by this procedure.  It is a nonsense and she must know it.  It is cerainly not applauded by victims of crime as a fair and reasonable system.  It is protective of hardened criminals in that it delays justice.  It serves no useful purpose.  Either the Minister does not know that or she will simply not acknowledge it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> Some time ago, the Minister said in the House, regarding preliminary examination, that this was a matter she was examining in the context of measures which would speed up the trial process and that this, in turn, arises from the formulation of proposals in relation to bail.  In other words, nothing can be done until the Minister does something.</P>
    <P>There is something deeper and more disturbing in this statement.  It means that the Government's criminal justice policy is in chaos and there is no discernible pattern or plan on any one area.  As I said last night, everything is advanced, very advanced or imminent. When it has progressed from being &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; and over the hurdle of &ldquo;very advanced&rdquo; to being &ldquo;imminent&rdquo;, it must cross the Melling Road and on up to Beecher's Brook where it is referred to a committee, a sub-committee or, better still, an interdepartmental committee.  When all else fails, she can send it to the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I realise this is a difficult problem for the Government and the Minister in that it relates to the whole island of Ireland, but since so much employment in the Republic is involved in the production of concrete products and the delivery of same, I feel it is important to raise the matter.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that the producers of concrete products in the Republic are not looking for grants and subsidies. Many of them have invested their own money in setting up plants and expanding their trade as new goods were demanded.  We owe it to them to ensure that because of unfair competition or an absence of a level playing field, they will not be at a serious disadvantage when it comes to competing for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was under the impression that in the European Union, one had to have uniformity of support.  For that reason, I was surprised to find that many grants available in the North of Ireland were not in the Republic.  The North has, for example, employment grants for new jobs created in the industry, interest relief grants for loans in the commercial sector and factory rent grants of up to 100 per cent for five years.  It also has grants towards a company development <Col N="1246" /> programme of up to 50 per cent for training and development costs such as wages, travel, professional fees etc., and towards marketing development programmes of up to 40 per cent, or £180,000, to help plan and implement a marketing programme.  It also has research and development grants of up to £250,000 to define research and develop a product.  Tax incentives include accelerated depreciation on plant machinery and building and derating of premises used for manufacturing is also available.  Soft loans are also available, including an interest free period.</P>
    <P>One concrete company in Northern Ireland was offered £236,000 by way of capital grants and interest relief grants. Another was offered £300,000 capital and revenue grants to promote company competitiveness.</P>
    <P>All these incentives and grants are clearly a tremendous help and allow these companies to undercut in a big way those in the Republic who do not get grants.  I have been told that up to 50 per cent of some concrete products in Cork are supplied by companies in the North of Ireland.  If that is true, it shows the kind of competition our producers are facing.</P>
    <P>For this reason I raise the matter in defence of our enterpreneurs who invested their own money to produce goods and create employment.  They have their own internal competition which keeps prices at a reasonable level. However, it is impossible for them to compete with outside companies, which are subsidised to the extent that they can travel 200 miles from Northern Ireland and still undercut by almost 50 per cent the prices of their competitors.</P>
    <P>It is because of my interest in these companies, which have worked hard to promote the very important industry for the supply of concrete products, that I have raised this matter.  I am not looking for subsidies for these companies because they do not seek them but I would like the Minister to ensure some kind of level playing field that would remove the current, very sloped pitch. <Col N="1247" /> In the interests of those employed in the industry, I hope the Minister can give me a positive answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of concerns in the industry about the effects of competition from the North of Ireland.  Representatives of the industry recently met officials of the Minister's Department in this regard and have undertaken to furnish further details of specific concerns.</P>
      <P>There has been adequate capacity in the concrete products sector for some time now to meet the demands of the home market.  For this reason it is policy not to grant-aid further capacity in the sector.  Grant assistance is available for research and development projects.  Forbairt is working with a number of companies to develop new added value products for export markets.  The Minister hopes that more companies can be encouraged to follow this path.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my reintroduction of grant assistance generally would only lead to greater overcapacity and the displacement of jobs. I assure the Deputy however, that the Minister will have the industry's concerns examined and that both he and his Department will pursue any possible productive avenue in their efforts to assist the sector in this regard.'</P>
      <P>Many factors interact to determine the overall competitiveness of any economy compared with another.  In terms of overall cost increases, Ireland's record on inflation, assisted significantly by wage moderation over recent years, continues to be satisfactory.  Our annual rate of inflation has been below the EU average rate and that of the UK every year since 1989 up to end of 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The competitiveness of the North of Ireland relative to this economy is influenced by considerable funding transfers from the British Government towards industrial and infrastructural facilities generally.  This State has, however, also <Col N="1248" /> benefited substantially from major investment in infrastructural services, principally roads and transport and communications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware of the continuing efforts of the Government to enhance the competitiveness of Irish industry and business so they can compete successfully in all relevant markets. The Minister is particularly conscious of the competitive difficulties of some of the more labour intensive indigenous sectors in competing with UK and North of Ireland based industry.</P>
    <P>In the past three budgets substantial improvements have been made to the employers' PRSI contributions structure with a view to increasing the competitiveness of industry in this economy, particularly in regard to UK and North of Ireland based competition.  This year's budget also introduced a lower rate of 30 per cent corporate tax on the first £50,000 taxable profits for non-manufacturing activity.  The 10 per cent rate of corporate tax for manufacturing activity already represents a considerable competitive advantage for manufacturing firms in this State relative to the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister is conscious of the important contribution in indigenous industry to the economy and that both he and his Department will continue to monitor closely and to seek improvements in the competitiveness of Irish goods and services to maximise and protect employment levels in the economy.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Water Supply.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that our President is currently being escorted on her tour of South Africa by a very good friend of Ireland's, Professor Kadar Asmal, who holds the portfolio of Water Affairs in the South African Government.  In establishing a separate Cabinet position to deal with issues relating to water supply, South Africa has given full recognition to the importance of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> A clean and reliable water supply is not simply a matter of convenience.  It is central to public health.  That basic fact applies in Ireland as much as it does in South Africa.  Our citizens do not have to rely on water of questionable quality obtained as in South Africa, from a standpipe in the street or, in the more rural parts, from a cattle watering hole. Most Irish homes have adequate indoor sanitation.  I know the provision of bathrooms to local authority houses which do not currently have them is a priority of my colleague in Democratic Left, Deputy McManus.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, tens of thousands of Irish homes, including many in my constituency of Dublin South-Central, do not have an adequate and reliable water supply.  The seeming inability of Dublin Corporation to maintain a constant water supply to large parts of Dublin constitutes a health hazard for many residents.  There is an urgent need to implement the recommendation in the Greater Dublin Development Plan relating to water supply and to implement the recommendations of the water strategy study which was completed last year.</P>
    <P>Large areas of the south city, including Terenure where I live, Drimnagh, Crumlin, Walkinstown, Harold's Cross, Kimmage, the South Circular Road area and The Tenters are regularly affected by a cut-off of water supply due to the practice known as &ldquo;throttling&rdquo;, which involves water pressure being turned so low as to be effectively non-existent. The lack of a reliable water supply constitutes a potential health hazard and is especially inconvenient for families with small children.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Minister for the Environment make the resources available to Dublin Corporation to enable the relevant sections of the Greater Dublin Development Plan and the water strategy study to be implemented so as to ensure a constant and reliable water supply.  I hope he will take these concerns on board and act without further delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> Water pressure is not the only problem facing many of my constituents. Residents in the older parts of the city share a water supply with one and often two neighbours.  In some cases water supply is effectively diminished because of substandard, outdated lead piping and inadequate internal plumbing.  Residents are often unable to meet the costs of rectifying these shortcomings and I therefore urge the Minister to establish a grants scheme designed to help them meet costs.</P>
    <P>If there are schemes for rural electrification, surely schemes can be conceived to target parts of my constituency, particularly those with an old housing stock which is costly to upgrade.  A grants scheme would allow people to take in a fresh water supply from the corporation main pipe to the stopcock and beyond.  I encourage the Minister of State to urge the Minister for the Environment to introduce a grant aided scheme for many constituents of mine who are plagued by water shortages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The local authorities and my Department have different roles in the provision of water supplies.  Operation and maintenance of supplies and pressures is a matter for the local authority concerned. My Department's role is restricted to determining priorities, assessing and providing funding for new or improved water and sewerage facilities.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties the Dublin area is experiencing with regard to water supply.  Due to a progressive increase in water consumption in the region in recent years, the amount of treated water available for distribution into the network has not been enough at times to meet demand.  This problem has tended to be more acute in the winter months or, as happened last summer, during prolonged dry periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At an operational level, treated water reserves can be conserved by restricting the amount of water passing into the <Col N="1251" /> distribution system, particularly during off-peak periods such as between midnight and 6 a.m.  This strategy saves water by reducing the amounts of water lost through leakage in the distribution network and minimises the effect on consumers.  On occasion it may take some time to restore the supply to all consumers depending on the severity of valve throttling and the level of consumer demand and other such factors which vary from day to day.  Nevertheless every effort is made by the local authorities concerned to distribute water in as equitable a manner as possible during these periods.</P>
    <P>The problems experienced from time to time are related largely to quantity. An important factor is the level of growth in the area's economy.  A growing economy generates an increased demand for water.  These water supply problems are being addressed on a number of fronts.  My Department's water services investment programme has provided for a range of measures including source augmentation works, the provision of trunk delivery mains and the refurbishment of various distribution systems.  Investment last year alone in water supply projects in Dublin amounted to £18.5 million.  The 1996 investment programme also provides for the continued funding of a number of very significant projects in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Works recently completed include a phase of the north Dublin city arterial water main at a cost of almost £3.5 million. In addition a refurbishment programme for Dublin Corporation's Vartry water treatment plant has been substantially completed.  This project is intended to secure a good quality supply from this plant.  The estimated cost of this scheme is £2.3 million.</P>
    <P>A major expansion and refurbishment project is under way at the Leixlip water plant.  This project will increase the plant's treatment capacity from 22 million gallons per day to 38 million gallons per day at an estimated cost of £17.5 million.  The work already <Col N="1252" /> completed at the Leixlip plant has resulted in significant additional supplies being made available to the Dublin area.  Contract documents for a further phase of this work have recently been approved.  Major improvements to the Dún Laoghaire water system are also in progress at present at an estimated cost of £30 million.</P>
    <P>My Department is also supporting the implementation of a programme of works to tackle leakage in Dublin.  This work will involve the creation of metered zones and the provision of telemetry and computerisation to facilitate a co-ordinated approach to leak detection and repair.  The project will be implemented over a number of years and is expected to significantly reduce the amount of water lost through leakages, thereby making more water available for consumption.</P>
    <P>It is clear therefore that substantial investment has been made in Dublin's water infrastructure.  Further investment will be guided by the findings of a major study of the region's water requirements. This study, which will be available shortly, will provide valuable guidance for the future management of Dublin's water resources and will provide a strategic framework for investment over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the water supply needs of the Dublin region are being fully addressed.  These issues will continue to receive my Department's active attention in the months ahead.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Phonewatch System.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare for taking the debate on the Phonewatch system for pensioners.  I am surprised, however, that that Department is replying because I assumed the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, had responsibility for Telecom Éireann which is concerned with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister.  Deputy Lowry, on this issue and he disclaimed any <Col N="1253" /> responsibility for it.  Nonetheless, I am glad of the opportunity to raise the matter now.  Early in the new year a number of attacks on elderly people in rural areas received much media attention. The IFA, which is always quick to jump in to defend its members, managed to negotiate a good deal with Telecom Phonewatch for the supply of the medialert security system to elderly people living alone in rural areas.  Under the medi-alert system, elderly people wear a pendant around their neck and in an emergency can press a button on the pendant which is linked to a control centre.  Once alerted, the centre can notify relatives, the ambulance service or the Garda as appropriate.  It is a very good system which gives the elderly a great sense of security and peace of mind.</P>
    <P>However, it is expensive to install and costs more than £200.  There is also a monitoring charge of £87 per year putting it out of reach for many pensioners. The IFA negotiated a preferential deal with Telecom involving a reduced rate for installing the system.  The monitoring charge was also reduced to less than half the usual price.</P>
    <P>While I must congratulate the IFA on negotiating the deal, as a Dublin Deputy I represent many elderly people in Finglas particularly which has a huge older population.  Many of them are living in fear for their safety and their lives because of the high crime levels.</P>
    <P>In spite of high profile crimes against elderly people in rural areas, the overall rural crime rate is declining while in some parts of Dublin crime levels are 30 times higher than in many country areas.  Generally speaking, something that happens in rural Ireland receives far more attention than an incident in Dublin.  It is a problem that this House also gives the rural bias that we see time and again.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that Telecom, a semi-State company, should offer preferential rates to pensioners purely because of where they live and the fact that they are IFA members.  I cannot justify that to my constituents who are senior citizens, many of whom are in real danger of being attacked given the <Col N="1254" /> high crime levels in Dublin.  Why are they not also entitled to preferential rates?  This represents discrimination against urban pensioners.  It is unfair and cannot be justified.  It is not good enough for us to stand by and allow such discrimination take place.</P>
    <P>In the recent package announced by the Minister for Social Welfare we saw a number of initiatives designed to improve the security of elderly people. I expected these preferential rates to be included in that package.  I cannot understand why the Minister did not negotiate such rates with Telecom on behalf of the many thousands of pensioners in urban areas, particularly in Dublin.  It is disappointing that that did not happen.</P>
    <P>It may be said that, strictly speaking, this is not a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.  However, I appeal to the Minister of State to bring whatever pressure he can to bear on the Minister, Deputy Lowry, to put it to Telecom &mdash; a company with which he has close links &mdash; that the rates they have agreed for elderly farmers should also be available to pensioners in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the significantly higher crime levels in cities, this would only be fair to the elderly.  I appeal to the Minister to take action, and to ensure that there is fair play all around for our pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to reply to this matter in the House.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Social Welfare, in the context of his contribution to the budget debate in this House on 24 January announced the establishment of a task force on security for the elderly.  The purpose of this group was to make recommendations to the Minister by the end of February on how to meet the security needs of elderly people who would not benefit from the tax relief measure announced in this year's budget for the installation of security alarms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister attached considerable <Col N="1255" /> urgency to this issue and set a very challenging deadline to the task force which was asked to report by the end of February. I am happy this deadline was met and I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the members of the task force for conducting their work and producing their report in such a short timeframe.</P>
    <P>The Minister lost no time in bringing the report to Government, and I am happy to say that his Cabinet colleagues have dealt with it expeditiously.  The Government has approved a £6.5 million package of new measures to improve security for the elderly. In addition to the £1.5 million announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget, this brings the total to £8 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>The breakdown is as follows: grants to voluntary bodies, £2 million; additional telephone rental allowance costs due to expected higher demand for telephones, £1 million; income tax relief on security alarms, £5 million.</P>
    <P>Work on implementing the findings of the task force has already started and the Minister is pursuing the implementation of the various recommendations with his Government colleagues.  In doing so he is conscious of the fact that elderly people are most at risk in the winter months and he is determined to make significant progress in the areas identified in the report of the task force before next winter.</P>
    <P>Funding for voluntary and community schemes is being increased by £2 million in respect of initiatives relating to the security of the elderly.  We are just putting the final touches to the details of the scheme and I expect that Deputies will see notices in the national papers within the next two weeks requesting proposals from various voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>As the report of the task force indicates, the telephone can be a lifeline in many emergencies.  I am happy to say that follow-up action with Telecom Éireann, as recommended in the task force report, has already taken place. Telecom has agreed, for a period of six months, to reduce the cost of telephone installations from £145 to £75 for the <Col N="1256" /> 23,000 elderly pensioners whom the task force identified as living alone and without a telephone.  Pensioners will be expected to take up this offer within a short time in order to facilitate installation by Telecom Éireann between now and the end of September next.  Of course, these people will not have to pay the normal telephone rental as this will be covered under the free telephone rental allowance scheme that my Department operates.  Arrangements to bring details of this offer to the pensioners concerned are being worked out in discussions between my Department and Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am generally aware, however, of the technological and other security aids which are available.  These include the medi-system from Telecom Phonewatch to which the Deputy referred.  This is a personal protection system which includes a pendant worn by the person. Assistance is obtained by pressing a button on the pendant which alerts staff at a monitoring station who summon help. The user can determine the order of priority to be used in summoning help at the time of purchase of the system.</P>
    <P>The system is designed for use in medical emergencies and is not intended for use for other security purposes.  The Telecom Phonewatch medi-system is not the only system of this type on the market.  There are others which, no doubt, providers and their agents will advertise locally.  The agreement to which the Deputy refers is one which Telecom Phonewatch and the IFA concluded to their mutual benefit. It is a welcome initiative which will help allay certain fears among the elderly.  I agree with the Deputy that the need for security measures extends to urban areas also.  There is an opportunity for the security industry to capitalise on the concerns which attacks on the elderly have raised.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot endorse the product of any particular company in a competitive environment. I exhort the industry to seize the opportunities to expand their business through promotional offers and <Col N="1257" /> active marketing.  There is obvious potential for reduced charges to generate additional business to the benefit of the industry and the consumer alike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday, 12 March, the weather forecast predicted heavy rainfall.  Unfortunately, in the Comeragh Mountains in County Waterford, there was a severe blizzard which lasted 24 hours.  There were accumulations of snow as high as 20 feet in places.  A considerable number of sheep were lost as a result.  The areas worst affected were the upper regions of the Nire Valley, Ballymacarbry, the Glenpatrick area of Rathgormuck, the Glendalgan and Comeragh areas of Kilrossanty and also the Kilbrien area in Ballinamult.  Few sheep farmers were affected, but those who were affected suffered huge losses. In some cases over 50 per cent of their flocks have apparently been lost.  The full detail of the losses will not be known until the snows have melted and an exact count is done.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been quite busy and today six or seven officers from the Department, together with local sheep farmers, carried out a count as best they could but there is still ten feet of snow in places and until it has disappeared the exact losses will not be known.  A considerable number of sheep have been washed away in the streams and rivers which flow through the areas in question, so it will be quite a while before there is a full tally of the losses.</P>
      <P>The weather forecast was wrong.  It is not fair to blame the people who compile the weather forecast because it is only an educated guess, but the sheep farmers in question were taken totally unawares.  They would have moved their sheep down the mountain had they known there was to be such a huge fall of snow.  They did not have any prior warning of the blizzard and the consequences have been dire for about 25 or 30 mountain sheep farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of representations I made to the Minister's office I know Department officials have been quite active <Col N="1258" /> and are sympathetic.  One official stated last week that he considered the situation to be <i>force majeure,</i> which I understand means that when it comes to payment of premia, the contract cannot be fulfilled because the sheep no longer exist.  At this time of year sheep flocks are usually punched by officials from the Department to verify payment of premia but only half the flocks had been punched before the blizzard so the losses are difficult to ascertain and they will be dependent on the earlier departmental records.</P>
    <P>It is very important to understand that the sheep farmers in question do not want immediate compensation. Many laymen do not understand that mountain sheep cannot be bought in from other areas and assimilated into a flock.  They must be brought up where they were born.  If they are brought in from a strange area they simply stray away and do not come back.  Compensation to allow farmers to buy in sheep would not solve the problem.  The sheep farmers want the premium to continue to be paid for the next four or five years in respect of the sheep which have been lost so that they can build their flocks back up to their former level.</P>
    <P>This has been a tragedy for a couple of dozen sheep farmers who have seen their livelihoods wiped away in the course of a few days.  Unfortunately, after the blizzard, which contributed to snowdrifts of over 20 feet in places, there was substantial rainfall and the snow was consolidated, sheep suffocate in consolidated snow.  If snow is powdery, sheep can survive for days and weeks because they can breath through the snow but when snow turns into half snow and half ice, when it becomes consolidated, they suffocate within a matter of hours.  The losses have been severe and I would like the Department to take a sympathetic view and to abide by the wishes of the farmers.  They are not looking for anything special, they are simply looking for the opportunity to rebuild the stocks they have lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I have noted with concern that <Col N="1259" /> following blizzard conditions and heavy snowfalls in the area of the Comeragh Mountains and in the Nire Valley in County Waterford on 12, 13 and 14 March, many sheep producers suffered large scale losses and will consequently face a difficult financial year.</P>
      <P>On learning of this, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, immediately instructed departmental officials to visit the area and assess the damage done, with a view to providing assistance to these producers. The initial report indicated that losses are indeed substantial and some flock owners may have lost more than half their flocks.  The ongoing difficult weather conditions in the Comeraghs have contributed to the problems in making a full evaluation of the losses but a further inspection took place today when a more thorough examination of the damage done was possible. I have received oral reports that as many as 700 dead sheep have been located and there may be more.  The impact on the flock owners is clearly serious especially as there may be more dead sheep in the higher mountain areas.  My first endeavour has been to provide some means of minimising the hardship of the producers in this area who will have suffered not only the loss of valuable livestock but of income earning potential in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that under EU regulations an annual premium is paid for ewes, subject to an individual limit or quota, provided certain conditions are met.  Among those conditions is the requirement that flocks are maintained by the owner for a specific retention period, in 1996 the retention period is 9 January to 18 April.  In normal circumstances EU regulations do not permit the payment of ewe premia if the animals have not been kept on the holding for the period specified. <Col N="1260" /> However, the regulations make an exception in circumstances of natural disaster or, as the Deputy mentioned, <i>force majeure.</i></P>
    <P>To my mind the current circumstances fall into the definition of natural disaster and my officials will be in touch with the EU Commission to ensure that <i>force majeure</i> conditions can be applied in this case.  The fact that the heavy snowfall was unexpected will be significant in convincing the Commission of the authenticity of this case.  Met Éireann has been most co-operative in supplying details of the weather conditions in that period and I believe we have a good case.  The Commission's agreement to this request would allow the full ewe premium and headage payment to be paid in 1996 for the sheep lost in this disaster.  In 1995 the ewe premium, rural world premium and headage together were worth £36.10.</P>
    <P>In addition, EU regulations provide that producers who may be unable to fully replace lost stock this year will not suffer loss of their sheep quotas.  A provision will be made exempting the producers affected by this disaster from the requirement to fill 70 per cent of their quota this year.  I intend to apply this provision in this case.  I am also concerned that the death of sheep in such numbers on the Comeragh Mountains may cause environmental damage in the region, leading to pollution of rivers and watercourses.  I urge the producers who lost animals to ensure that they are disposed of safely so as to avoid a further disaster in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I will do all in our power to assist this group of producers and we have already set in motion measures to ensure that premium and headage payments will be paid this year in respect of eligible animals which were lost in this disaster.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 March 1996.</P>

      <P>I am not refusing to accept a nomination from the NYCI to the NESC, rather I have requested that it nominates a female to the council.  The NYCI has had a nominee on the NESC for the past 12 years, and this nominee has always been a male.  It is Government policy to have at least 40 per cent of both men and women in appointments to State boards and the Government has requested all of the social partners to observe this gender balance in making nominations to the NESC. The other social partners have made efforts to enhance the proportion of women in their representation on the council.  I accept the difficulty that an organisation which only has one representative may have with this Government policy, however, as the representative from NYCI has always been male, I decided to request them to nominate a female representative for this term of the NESC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform and I announced earlier today the Government's comprehensive response to the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  The Government's announcement is the <Col N="1097" /> development of a national strategy for traveller accommodation with the necessary financial and legislative support to provide a framework within which the accommodation needs of travellers can be met.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the strategy are as follows: Each major local authority, &mdash; county borough, county council and, possibly, some larger urban councils &mdash; will be required to prepare and adopt a five year plan for the provision of traveller accommodation in their areas.  The plans would be subject to periodic review by the authorities in the light of progress and developments otherwise, including changes in the local traveller population, etc.</P>
    <P>The local plans would be co-ordinated by the Department with the assistance of a National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group into a national plan to deliver the 3,100 units of accommodation required as determined by the task force.  The types of accommodation as set out in the report of the task force are permanent halting sites &mdash; 1,200 serviced bays &mdash; and 900 houses; and a network of serviced transient halting sites &mdash; 1,000 bays.</P>
    <P>The total cost of this accommodation was estimated by the task force at £158 million in 1994 prices.  The extra cost over and above the present levels of expenditure is £14 million annually over the six years implementation period of the plan.  The increase in expenditure would build up from 1997 onwards.</P>
    <P>The housing Acts and the management Acts will be amended to impose on local authorities the obligation to prepare and adopt their plans by a specified deadline and to provide that, in the event of the elected members not adopting a plan within the time allowed, the manager would then be empowered and required to formally make the plan. When a plan had been made the authority would be required to take the necessary steps to secure its implementation.</P>
    <P>The planning Acts will be amended to put an effective planning framework in <Col N="1098" /> place which would facilitate implementation of the traveller accommodation plans.  These amendments would be comprehensive, dealing with a range of planning considerations, for example, development plan, zoning, consultation process, etc.  Again, a power for the manager to act independently of the council would be provided to ensure, for example, that the development plan includes the necessary provision for zoning etc. for halting sites.</P>
    <P>A special unit will be established in the Department of the Environment to oversee the preparation, monitoring, implementation, co-ordination, etc. of the programme for traveller accommodation, including the preparation and enactment of the necessary legislation. The unit will also service the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group.  The unit to be headed by a principal officer and have appropriate support staff.</P>
    <P>A national traveller accommodation consultative group will be established on a statutory basis to monitor preparation, adequacy and implementation of the local accommodation programmes and to advise the Minister as necessary.  The committee would consist of seven members nominated by the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, and relevant national traveller organisations and be chaired by a nominee of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Wider legislative powers will be given to local authorities to deal with illegal, indiscriminate and unauthorised parking by travellers and related matters. Consideration will be given to prohibiting parking of caravans and temporary dwellings within a specified distance, say, one mile, of traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>Measures will be taken to improve the management and maintenance of traveller accommodation by local authorities with a view to securing higher standards of upkeep.  The task force recommended 75 per cent recoupment of local authority expenditure at an estimated average annual cost to the <Col N="1099" /> Exchequer of £7.5 million over the six year period.</P>
    <P>There should be a statutory requirement that traveller accommodation committees, representative of the elected members and officials of the local authority, and travellers, be established in each local authority area to facilitate consultation and to assist in the development and implementation of the local programmes.</P>
    <P>The strategy represents a focused, coherent and balanced policy designed to achieve real solutions to the difficult problems of traveller accommodation.  It is a break through in our approach to the accommodation of travellers.  It reflects my desire and that of the Government to act decisively in favour of one of the most marginalised groups in our society. It is a commitment to deliver on the recommendations of the task force that 3,100 units of accommodation be provided for travelling families in the shortest practicable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="1100" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>From a value for money viewpoint, the report referred to examined means testing arrangements for schemes administered by Government Departments and a number of State bodies. The report identifies certain inefficiencies in the administration of means tests, and also certain impediments to the harmonisation of such tests including reservations by the Data Protection Commissioner about any further augmenting of information-sharing systems. The report makes a number of suggestions on how efficiencies might be achieved, although it acknowledges there are practical problems associated with the implementation of some of these.</P>
      <P>Means testing is not carried out by my Department.  The report adverts to means testing by local authorities in regard to the local authority house purchase and improvement loans, and shared ownership schemes, for which financial allocations are made by my Department.  While the numbers involved are relatively few, my Department would be prepared to co-operative with any workable arrangements that may emerge from interdepartmental consideration of the report.  Arrangements for the assessment of income under differential rent scheme, while not a means test as such could also be reviewed in this context.</P>

      <P>The case for additional EU funding for roads in Border counties was, of course, put forward in discussions with the European Commission on the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. However, the programme as adopted by the Commission gives priority to measures such as promotion <Col N="1103" /> of social inclusion; facilitating cross-Border reconciliation, links and co-operation; supporting productive investment; and promotion of employment; the more traditional infrastructural programmes, such as roads, for which other means of financial assistance are available were assigned a lower priority.</P>
      <P>Within the limited provision for infrastructure in the programme, a sum of £3 million has been made available to my Department for roads investment in 1996.  Of this, £2.5 million will be used to restore the Aghalane Bridge on the N3 Dublin to Enniskillen road, which is a key element in improving cross-Border infrastructure.  On 5 February last I notified indicative allocations amounting to the balance of £0.5 million in Border counties for improvement works on non-national roads.</P>
      <P>Special grants, amounting in total to £1.812 million were made available in 1994 and 1995 by my Department to Border local authorities for the reopening-restoration of cross-Border roads.  Grant allocations totalling £220,000 have been made in the current year to complete this work.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management Bill, 1995, currently before Seanad Éireann, provides for substantial amendments to existing controls in relation to the collection, transportation, recovery and disposal of hazardous waste.  The Bill provides for the preparation by the Environmental Protection Agency of a national hazardous waste management plan, the licensing by the agency of waste recovery and disposal operations and the issue of permits by local authorities for waste collection activities.

      <P>There are no plans at present that national lottery funding should be applied for expenditure of the kind referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that the report of the Task Force on Security for the Elderly was published last week by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.  Arising from the recommendations in this report, the Government has approved a £6.5 million package of security oriented measures for the elderly living alone. This is in addition to the £1.5 million tax relief initiative I announced in the budget to assist elderly people living alone to purchase alarm systems for their homes.</P>
      <P>Among the range of initiatives being implemented are the availability of £2 million in grants this year from the Department of Social Welfare to voluntary groups to support the installation of security equipment in the homes of elderly people living alone and the provision of £1 million under that Department's free telephone rental allowance scheme to meet the expected increased demand for telephones.</P>
      <P>The Government is satisfied that implementation of the recommendations of the task force report will significantly contribute to the improvement of the security of elderly people who reside alone and also lead to greater peace of mind among this group.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The question of possible improvements in the security of our elderly population was considered by a task force established by my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare.  Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, at the end of January this year.  The task force has since reported and the Minister for Social Welfare announced last Thursday that he has received Government approval for a £6.5 million package of new measures to improve security for the elderly.  This is in addition to the £1.5 million announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  The principal measures agreed are outlined as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;The extension of the budget tax relief measure to include relatives who install security systems in the homes of elderly people living alone.  Provision for this measures will be included in the Finance Bill to be published shortly.  The budget <Col N="1111" /> package provided for tax relief of up to £800 at the standard rate of income tax for people aged 65 and over and living alone for the purchase cost of alarm systems.  The total cost is expected to be £5 million.</P>
    <P>&mdash;£2 million in grants to be made available this year by the Department of Social Welfare to voluntary groups to support the installation of security equipment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;FÁS to encourage the development of special schemes aimed at enhancing the security of the elderly. Local voluntary and community groups to be encouraged, when planning for this year's students summer jobs scheme, to consider projects which would provide greater security for elderly people living alone.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Measures to be finalised with Telecom Éireann to provide for a substantial reduction in the cost of installing telephones in the homes of elderly people.  It is expected that the grants and the tax relief measures will generate increased demand under the Department of Social Welfare free telephone rental allowance scheme.  This is expected to cost about £1 million. The Department of Justice and Social Welfare will co-operate in a renewed campaign to be undertaken to provide elderly people with specific information and advice on how to improve personal security both inside and outside their homes.  Local authorities are to be encouraged to erect community alert and neighbourhood watch signs for community groups. The Garda as part of the operation of their community policing activities, will encourage greater co-operation and liaison at local level among service providers including all State agencies.  A comprehensive evaluation and assessment to <Col N="1112" /> be carried out of all the community based initiatives in relation to the security needs of the elderly to identify gaps and to ensure that all areas of the country are adequately covered.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department and &mdash; or the health boards will carry out the tasks which have been assigned to them on foot of the report.</P>

My Department has no specific scheme to provide such adaptations. However, on occasions and as an exceptional measure, health boards have assisted families with extensions and adaptations as a top-up to the disabled person's grant provided by the Department of the Environment through local authorities.  Health boards' main involvement in this area is the provision of aids and appliances such as hoists necessary to enable people with disabilities to live at home.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers and they have agreed that couples living in a partnership are to be treated under <Col N="1115" /> the same income guidelines as a married couple when medical card eligibility is being assessed.  They have also agreed that lone parents with dependants are to be allowed the same income guidelines as a married couple with dependants.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers and the manner in which the income guidelines applicable to married couples are applied to lone parents I am satisfied that the arrangements currently in place ensure lone parents are not denied access to a medical card when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>The case referred to in the question relates to a tyre produced in the UK in 1981 and used on a vehicle involved in an accident in the UK in 1988.  While it is very unlikely that similar tyres would now be in use on a significant scale in this country, if at all, my Department is in contact with the tyre company about the matter.  I will advise the Deputy of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda were given new powers to tackle motor tax evasion under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which came into operation in April 1995.  This new provision empowers the Garda to impound vehicles in respect of which motor tax has not been paid for a continuous period of three months or more. This adds considerable strength to existing motor tax enforcement measures <Col N="1119" /> which include an on-the-spot fine system operated by the Garda and traffic wardens, and a system of issuing second or final reminders to vehicle owners who have failed to tax their vehicles by the due date, with Garda follow-up.</P>

      <P>I have no proposal to introduce restrictions on newly qualified licence holders such as apply in Northern Ireland.  Such a system does not apply in the rest of the UK or in most other EU states, and there is no evidence to suggest that it would be a useful road safety measure.</P>
      <P>The requirement that provisional licence holders must be accompanied by a qualified driver at all times was introduced in 1964.  In 1979, a concession was introduced permitting holders of provisional licences to drive unaccompanied provided L plates were displayed.  In 1985, the display of plates was made mandatory and the accompanied rule was reintroduced for all provisional licence holders, except the holders of second provisional licences for class C vehicles &mdash; cars and light vans; the reasoning at the time was that driving unaccompanied, after the initial period, would build confidence prior to undergoing the driving test.</P>

      <QRef>[6670/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the comprehensive reply to Questions Nos. 4, 59 and 182 of 7 November 1995 in which I outlined in some detail the statutory position governing the tolling of roads, including the powers and responsibilities of the different bodies involved; the procedures which must be followed before tolls can be introduced on any route; the extent of public consultation involved; and my quasi-judicial role in reaching a decision on any individual toll proposals.  In that reply, I also outlined the guidelines on the tolling of national roads set out in the National Development Plan, 1994-1999 which are similar to those adopted by successive Governments since 1985.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan envisaged the development of toll proposals to generate a sum of up to £100 million to be used to accelerate the development of the national road network. The plan specifically indicated that the assessment of all toll proposals would have regard to the diversion of traffic likely to be caused by tolling; this would have to include consideration of the types of traffic likely to be diverted, the probable impact on adjacent residential areas and the expected additional road construction-maintenance costs arising from the diversion.</P>
      <P>The Dublin C Ring will operate as a by-pass of Dublin for North-South traffic and will also function as a distributor route for Dublin traffic.  With unrestricted access, traffic volumes could quickly reach capacity levels. With this in mind, the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative specifically identified road user charging as one of the measures which could be considered to control the growth in traffic on the route and obviate the need for heavy additional investment in expanding capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is clear there is a significant level of opposition to any proposals to impose tolls on the C Ring in its present incomplete condition and I have received a considerable level of correspondence from groups representing motorists, from residents' organisations and from individuals on the subject.  Apart from the additional expense for individual motorists, there is significant concern that the imposition of tolls could divert large volumes of traffic away from the motorway on to the surrounding network, resulting in a detrimental environmental impact and loss of residential amenity, and giving rise to demands for additional road construction and maintenance costs at other locations.  These concerns have considerable validity and they would bear heavily on any decision I might be called on to make should the NRA proceed with proposals for tolling the C Ring.</P>

      <P>In common with those suffering from disabilities generally, I am conscious of the problems faced on a day-to-day basis by deaf people.  With that in mind, this year's Social Welfare Bill marks a major step forward in our provision for people with disabilities. The Bill provides for the introduction of a new disability allowance which will be administered by my Department as a replacement for the disabled person's maintenance allowance currently payable by the health boards.  This new allowance will complement the existing schemes of disability benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit schemes currently administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>I understand that the disability living allowance payable in the UK is designed to provide assistance to people with the extra costs arising from their personal care and mobility needs.  The allowance has two components; a personal care allowance which has three rates of payment depending on the degree of care required and a mobility allowance which is payable at two rates depending on the degree of disability.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce a similar scheme under the social welfare system. The health boards administer a range of schemes and services for people with disabilities, such as the domiciliary care allowance and the mobility allowance, and these are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>The categories of payments to which the Deputy refers can be broadly classified into two supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; SWA &mdash; payment types.  These are exceptional needs payments &mdash; ENPs &mdash; and rent supplements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  There is no automatic or statutory right of entitlement to ENPs.  Furthermore, the legislation does not allow the Minister to prescribe either the circumstances, or the nature of the need, in respect of which a payment may be made.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>In the interest of equity and transparency, my Department undertook to publish all guidance relating to the SWA scheme.  The guidelines on ENPs were published in October 1995.  In so far as it is possible, these guidelines are intended to ensure equitable treatment for all applicants and consistency in discretionary decision making both within and between the health boards.  The guidelines make it clear that nothing in them must be taken as limiting or fettering the health boards' discretion to grant or not to grant a payment or the extent of the grant in each case.</P>
    <P>Detailed statistical information on the SWA scheme for the past five years is not available.  The following tabular statement provides details of the number of cases in respect of which ENPs were paid in 1994 and 1995.  This shows that, apart from ENPs in respect of fuel, including ESB and gas and rent and mortgage arrears, there has been an increase in the number of ENPs awarded for all other categories between 1994 and 1995.</P>
    <P>The decrease in the number of ENPs paid in respect of fuel may be attributed to the introduction and successful operation of a code of practice on ESB and gas bills.  This code was agreed between the health boards, Bord Gáis.  ESB and the Department of Social Welfare.  Its purpose is to assist people who regularly have difficulty meeting their ESB or gas Bills by setting up a repayment agreement with the company involved.  The <Col N="1137" /> repayment agreement takes account of the customer's income and general circumstances. The implementation of the code has contributed to a reduction in the need for ENPs in cases where fuel arrears have accumulated.  Health boards may still provide assistance in the form of ENPs in cases of particular difficulty.</P>
    <P>In considering the decrease in the number of ENPs paid in respect of rent and mortgage arrears, it should be noted that whilst the number of cases has fallen by approximately 20 per cent there has only been a reduction of 10 per cent in terms of expenditure on rent arrears and 5 per cent in terms of expenditure on mortgage arrears.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the number of cases for all these categories of ENPs may be further explained by the introduction of the household budget deduction scheme and the extension of the money advice and budgeting service &mdash; MABS.  The household budget deduction scheme has been in operation since 1993 and provides for deductions from social welfare payments in respect of local authority <Col N="1138" /> rent or mortgage and utilities such as ESB, Bord Gáis and Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>MABS provides general money advice for families who have particular problems with moneylenders and suggests practical measures that will assist people in the long-term to manage their budgets.  The number of such projects has increased from five in 1992 to 35 in 1995.  Proposals are being examined at present to have the service available nationwide by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>With regard to rent supplements payable under the SWA scheme, in the majority of cases, entitlement is now determined in line with the legislative provisions set out in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and S.I. No. 382 of 1995.  The legislative provisions of the S.I. commenced on 1 January 1996. Prior to that, the same principles applied to applications for such supplements but on an administrative basis in the form of guidance and direction issued by the Minister under section 175 of the Act.  Between 1994 and 1995 the number of cases in respect of which a rent supplement was paid has increased by 6.2 per cent.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years or over and also to certain disabled people under the age of 66.  The other free schemes, such as free electricity allowance and free telephone rental, are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>As announced in this year's budget, the free telephone rental allowance, free electricity allowance and free colour television licence will be extended from next July to low income pensioners who do not qualify at present because they are not in receipt of a social welfare pension.  The weekly income limit that is being fixed for this purpose will be the new maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension &mdash; £75 per week &mdash; plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.</P>
      <P>In the event of the cessation of the free schemes owing to the death of the pensioner or transfer to institutional care, it is open to other members of the household to apply for the allowances in their own right.  In those circumstances, the applicant would be required to satisfy all the eligibility conditions for receipt of the allowances and in the case of the free electricity scheme, for example, to apply to become the registered consumer of electricity in the household.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in response to a previous similar question, the provision of tourist accommodation is a matter for the tourism industry and depends primarily on individual operators commercial judgment as to the manner in which to respond to levels of demand.  In general the sector has responded well to market forces without grant assistance and there has been a steady expansion in tourism accommodation in recent years.  Consequently, <Col N="1141" /> the <i>Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999</i> provided only limited financial assistance for specialist accommodation needs in certain specific circumstances and a maximum grant aid level of 25 per cent applies.  Grant aid levels under other programmes that assist tourism projects as part of their overall objectives are compatible with those in the Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>
      <P>To assist accommodation providers with further expansion plans, all registered and approved tourist accommodation has been deemed eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment &mdash; £52 million of this £208 million fund has been specially earmarked for tourism projects.  A similar scheme confined to the Border counties was recently introduced under the &ldquo;Peace and Reconciliation Fund&rdquo; and certain tourism projects are also eligible under this scheme.  Moreover, investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for tax relief under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Grant aid rates available in Northern Ireland are a matter for the Northern authorities and I would not accept that these should, necessarily, be mirrored in the southern Border counties.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a statement by a United Kingdom Minister in the House of Commons suggesting a link between BSE disease in animals and CJD disease in humans; whether he will give an assurance to the public regarding the safety of Irish beef; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6660/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement in the House of Commons <Col N="1143" /> suggesting a possible link between BSE disease in animals, prior to the introduction of additional controls in 1989, and CJD disease in humans.</P>
      <P>The information, which is part of an ongoing review of BSE, was evaluated by the EU Scientific Veterinary Committee, a group of independent scientists from the 15 member states.  The committee concluded that, while there was no direct evidence that BSE is transmissible to man, the risk of transmission could not be excluded and it recommended the adoption of special measures to deal with the problem pending a more detailed examination of the matter.  The recommendations were considered at some length by the EU Standing Veterinary Committee which advised that a ban should be imposed on the export of live animals, meat and meat products, including products destined for use in medicinal and other products, and derived meat and bone meal from the United Kingdom.  The European Commission adopted such a ban today.  This measure is, I believe, necessary to restore confidence in the beef market.</P>
      <P>The incidence of BSE in Ireland is, of course, totally different from that in Britain.  Since 1989, there has been a total of 124 cases in Ireland representing an annual average incidence of 16 animals in a cattle population of over seven million.  All cases were aged four years and over and the age profile continues to rise.  By comparison, there have been over 160,000 cases in Britain which has a cattle population of about 12 million.</P>
      <P>Ireland is classified by the Office Internationale des Epizooties &mdash; OIE &mdash; as having a low sporadic incidence of BSE for the purposes of its international trade code which facilitates continued trade in Irish cattle and meat products. The World Health Organisation &mdash; WHO &mdash; has endorsed this recommendation. Ireland has not been included in the scope of measures adopted by the EU in relation to BSE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, a series of stringent control measures have been put in place <Col N="1144" /> in Ireland to protect consumers and to maintain and safeguard our trade.  These measures include the compulsory notification of BSE, alerting veterinarians and farmers on the nature and signs of the disease, the veterinary examination of animals presented for slaughter and the slaughtering and, more recently, the destruction of the entire herds in which BSE has occurred.  Furthermore, the controls on the movement of cattle from Northern Ireland have been reviewed and, with the co-operation of the Garda and the Customs authorities surveillance along the Border has been stepped up significantly to ensure that cattle are not smuggled into the Republic.  Cattle will not be slaughtered at our factories unless veterinary officers are fully satisfied as regards the origin and status of the animals.  The measures in place go well beyond the internationally recommended guidelines and serve to ensure the continued safety and quality of Irish beef products.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied as regard the safety of Irish beef.</P>

      <P>The information requested was supplied to the Deputy by letter dated 14 March 1996 in respect of the years 1992 to 1995 inclusive.  The only figure not provided in respect of 1995 was the number of animals that were identified in subsequent reactor retests to initial pre-movement positive index tests.  Based on comparable data for previous years this figure is currently estimated at 1,000 reactor animals for 1995.  The actual figure will be determined by analysis of a separate research data base which is due to be updated with the 1995 data in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>In my speech at the launch of the Teagasc advisory programme I referred to the amount of direct income payments to farmers which had either been introduced or increased as part of the arrangements which accompanied the reform of the CAP in 1992.</P>
      <P>Between 1992 and 1995 the value of gross agricultural product i.e. the value of farm produce sold from farms, increased by 7 per cent &mdash; from £3,364.1 million in 1992 to £3,592.3 million in 1995.  During the same period the level of direct income payments rose from £405.3 million in 1992 to £747 million in 1995 &mdash; an increase of 84 per cent.  The result was that direct income payments to farmers went from being 22 per cent of aggregate farm income in 1992 to 35.5 per cent in 1995.  It can be seen, therefore, that much of the increase in agricultural income since 1992 has resulted from increased direct income payments. Further increases in payments on this scale are not in prospect and, therefore, farm income increases in future will be more reliant than heretofore on income generated on-farm through increased efficiency.  Teagasc's advisory and training strategies are aimed at ensuring that farmers achieve this objective.</P>

I would, however, advise farmers wishing to enter the scheme to obtain quotations from a number of agencies before selecting a specific agency.</P>

      <P>Under revised control and monitoring measures implemented by my Department under the REP scheme, all participants must now certify that they have farmed in accordance with their plans and that they kept specified records.  Additionally, their REPS planners must now certify that the plans submitted on behalf of their clients comply with the scheme and that the participants kept appropriate records.  Until such certification is received no second year payment can be made.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department are in contact with participants and planners with a view to having the necessary certification supplied where second year payments are now due.</P>
