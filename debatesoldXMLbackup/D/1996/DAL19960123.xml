      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>At our meeting in Dublin on 21 December, Prime Minister Major and I reviewed developments in the twin-track initiative which we had launched on 28 November in Downing Street. Good progress has been made on the political track, where the work is being carried forward by the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. On the decommissioning track, the Tánaiste and I had a very useful meeting with the International Body on 12 January of this year.  I do not propose to comment on the substance of the meeting. As Deputies will be aware, the International Body will publish its report tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The communiqué of 28 November makes clear that both Governments plan to meet again by mid-February to review progress in relation to the International Body report and in relation to the preparatory talks for all-party negotiations, which we wish to see beginning at the end of February.  It is the intention that this meeting should take place as planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At our pre-Christmas meeting, the Prime Minister and I also approved a report from our officials on developing <Col N="240" /> economic, social and cultural co-operation between Ireland and Britain.  This stemmed from earlier discussions which we had on the scope for strengthening and complementing existing co-operation and on extending it to all areas of bilateral interest.  Among the issues covered in the report are joint infrastructure planning, for example, the ports on both sides of the Irish Sea and access thereto, joint trade and tourism activities, and greater exchange of ideas and personnel in the areas of culture, education and the public service.  We look forward to following through with an intensive series of meetings between respective Government Ministers.</P>
    <P>At our meeting, we also reviewed a number of European issues &mdash; principally, the Intergovernmental Conference, European Monetary Union and particular foreign policy issues facing the European Union &mdash; including Bosnia and the political and economic situation in Russia.  This was a very useful exchange in terms of preparing for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union later this year.</P>
    <P>I also had a meeting with the Leader of the British Liberal Democrat party, Mr. Paddy Ashdown, on 14 December. Issues which arose included the uncertainty then surrounding the future of Irish Steel and of course the twin-track initiative, where we exchanged views on how the commencement of all-inclusive three strand talks might best be achieved.  I believe that this meeting also made a useful contribution to developing Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the the Taoiseach not prepared to answer questions about meetings he had with Sinn Féin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a supplementary question.  Why was the Taoiseach not prepared to tell us today about meetings he had with Sinn Féin, the Alliance <Col N="241" /> Party and the SDLP during the Christmas break?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I did not have any; the Tánaiste had those meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach telling me he had no discussions since the Dáil adjourned with representatives of any of those parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no formal meetings of any kind with any of those parties. The Tánaiste is conducting meetings with those parties in the twin-track process.  I had some informal contacts at the Forum, for example, with members of those parties but these do not come within the category on which I would normally report to the House.  There was no formal meeting of any kind.  The formal meetings are being undertaken by the Tánaiste and in order for the Deputy to get an authoritative answer from somebody who was at the meetings, I referred those questions to the Tánaiste for answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Taoiseach's meeting with the British Prime <Col N="242" /> Minister before Christmas did he discuss the possibility of holding elections to a convention in Northern Ireland? Has the Taoiseach an open mind about that as part of the three strand approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not very much discussion about that at the meeting, which concentrated primarily on European issues and on the general question of the progress of the twin-track approach.  We did not get into any great detail on that particular topic.  I have indicated the view of the Government on this matter on many occasions, including here in this House, and in a statement issued during the Summit in Formentor last September.  The position is that under the communiqué agreed between the Prime Minister and myself, this is a matter which we have invited the parties to consider in the political track.  That is proceeding and meetings are taking place in the political track between the Secretary of State and the relevant parties on the British side and the Tánaiste and the relevant parties on our side.  A number of joint meetings have also taken place.  The question of an election can and, we hope will, be discussed in the political track.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach confident that both Governments will be able to give their support to the Mitchell report and be able to move forward to all-party talks before the end of February?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Governments have agreed that their firm aim is that all-party talks should begin at the end of February and are both working together to achieve that objective.  The Prime Minister and I have stressed repeatedly &mdash; most notably at the joint press conference held in Downing Street &mdash; the need to ensure that the entire initiative is a truly joint exercise between our two Governments and that both Governments will work together to ensure that we reach the objective we <Col N="243" /> have set, which is the opening of all-party talks before the end of February. Obviously, intensive discussions are continuing between the two Governments on all the difficult issues to ensure that we are able to achieve that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What active steps is the Taoiseach taking in Government and with the British Government to ensure that the talks start before the end of February?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is well aware, there has been an intensive series of meetings in the political track &mdash; I have referred already to the Tánaiste's, the Ministers for Justice and Social Welfare meetings with various parties on a number of occasions.  Furthermore, the Irish Government has made a full contribution to the work of the body on the decommissioning track and is looking forward to the publication of that report tomorrow.  Following from that the Government will be working towards the firm objective, which it shares with the British Government, of commencing all-party discussions by the end of February in accordance with the communiqué agreed with the British Government at Downing Street on 28 November 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What policy is the Taoiseach pursuing on the matter of an assembly in the twin-track appoach?  Is his policy the same as that of the Tánaiste or the Minister for Social Welfare, or has he an alternative strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to see all-party inclusive discussions started by the end of February.  We want to have everything in place so that all the parties participate.  We have invited those parties that have views on matters such as <Col N="244" /> the role an elected body might perform &mdash; there are views both for and against that &mdash; to present their views within the political track.  Obviously, it would be very unwise and unhelpful for the Government to adopt firm positions which appear to anticipate those discussions on the political track or foreclose the option of accepting views that have been put forward by others within the political track.  We want the political track to work so therefore we will not pre-empt its deliberations by announcing a fixed firm irrevocable position in advance.  The position is, as set out in the communiqué, that all parties that have views on an elected body have been asked specifically to put them forward in the political track and that track of discussion is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If all parties, not merely the Governments, accept the Mitchell Commission's findings, does the Taoiseach share the view that this could break the logjam and facilitate the beginning of all-party talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost certainly the case that if everybody accepted the Mitchell report, it would break the logjam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with a number of issues in the Taoiseach's response.  Has the Taoiseach changed his policy on replying to questions?  The Taoiseach has ruled out questions that he would have been quite happy to answer in November or December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not deviate from the questions before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach disappointed that the DUP has refused to be involved in talks on either track of the twin-track approach and that the UUP has effectively snubbed the Government and dealt only with the Mitchell Commission?  What is his view on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, we want <Col N="245" /> all parties to participate in the twin-track approach.  The Unionist parties have views in favour of an elected body of some kind assisting in the process. We believe the best way for a party to advance its views is to talk in whatever forum is available to all the people willing to listen.  Enlightened self-interest on the part of the Unionist parties would suggest that they should participate in the political track because both Governments have specifically invited them to do so and referred specifically to one of their ideas in the communiqué as one of the issues that could be discussed in the political track.  The political track, therefore, would be attractive to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach and the Government anxious to talk to the UUP in particular regarding the assembly proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and the British Government in the communiqué published on 28 November 1995 agreed that they would institute a two track process, one of which would deal with decommissioning related issues and the other which would deal with political issues.  We said, specifically in regard to political issues, that proposals for an elected body could be discussed in the political track and that was the only specific political idea mentioned, although obviously it is open to other parties to put forward ideas.  We did that to facilitate participation by Unionists in the track by indicating that their ideas were not only not excluded but were specifically included on the agenda for discussion to make the political track useful and attractive to them. That is the position of the Government. We want to see everybody taking part. Just as we want everybody to take part in all party negotiations, we want everybody also to take part in the preparatory work for the negotiations.  We want the negotiations to operate on a truly inclusive basis both in terms of participation and on the basis on which negotiations are taking place.  We want those <Col N="246" /> negotiations to have, of course, a three stranded element.</P>
      <P>On the matter of transfer of questions, the Government operates on a collective basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He is the one who will be able to give the most authoritative answers to questions on meetings in which he has personally participated. There has been no change of policy and I have answered questions today on the meeting in which I took part.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress in implementing the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, is reviewed on a continuing basis at the weekly meetings of the programme managers who report to the three party leaders.  It is not intended that there should be any additional review, formal or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The Government is satisfied with the progress being made in implementing the programme as a whole, it is also satisfied that the existing review arrangements are appropriate given the nature of the commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Taoiseach's comment that the programme is reviewed weekly but in the last paragraph of the document there is the undertaking that it would be reviewed on an annual basis and a steering committee established.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to offer an opinion on that promise? In the context of Oireachtas reform, and having regard to the row we have had today and to the rows which occur regularly during Question Time, <Col N="248" /> the House has not encountered much of the openness, transparency and accountability outlined in the second paragraph of the Government programme. Is the Taoiseach satisfied with progress in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The steering committee, which functions in accordance with the programme for Government, is the committee of programme managers. They conduct an ongoing review, but also in-depth reviews from time to time on particular areas of work.  The Government partners are satisfied with the way the system is working.  All relevant parties are party to Cabinet discussions and may raise any issues they wish to raise.  That is working well.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, is at an advanced stage regarding proposals for further reform of the Oireachtas. These will be presented in the near future.  However, I do not expect any reform of the Oireachtas will entirely satisfy the Opposition, any more than Oireachtas reforms would satisfy any Opposition.  From time to time it is the Opposition's job to appear dissatisfied and the Government anticipates that.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to make the House more open.  Is the steering committee made up of programme managers? Are there no politicians on the committee overviewing progress in relation to the Government programme? Regarding a specific promise in the Government programme, what is <Col N="249" /> the position in relation to the third banking force?</P>

      <P>Regarding political involvement, the programme managers report regularly on their work to their Ministers.  In that sense, political direction is given.  In addition, the leaders of the three parties meet at least weekly, and often more frequently, to review progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the legislative programme, a committee consisting of some of the programme managers is examining <Col N="250" /> priorities in terms of drafting.  This committee is chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Higgins.</P>

      <P>I did not accuse the Taoiseach of misleading the House, rather of evading answering parliamentary questions.  Why has no member of Government been held accountable for the procedures adopted with regard to the QMP contract?  Why have we only heard from an unelected official?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>In a written reply on 14 December 1995 I set out in some detail the job specifications and functions of the research unit established to provide me, as leader of one of the three parties in Government, with advice and analysis on policy issues which arise outside my departmental responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the unit is to enable me to contribute optimally to the formulation of Government policy across the spectrum of social, economic and fiscal issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to repeat the details I set out on 14 December.  The research unit has a civil servant at principal officer level assigned to it and is also staffed by five non-civil service staff employed on a contract basis; namely, one senior research assistant, one research assistant, two part-time research assistants <Col N="255" /> and one administrative assistant.  That is a staffing complement of four full-time equivalent posts.  The estimated annual cost including PRSI of these contract posts is £91,718.  The cost in 1995 was £7,770.  The salaries relating to each of these positions are shown in the tabular statement which I will supply to the Deputies.  The payment rates are equivalent to the rates for grades of comparable responsibility in the established Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The usual approach taken by Ministers and party leaders, both in this and in previous administrations, in making such appointments has been on the basis of a personal assessment of the individuals. There has never been a practice of advertising such posts and I have not departed from that norm.</P>
    <P>If one appoints contract staff to analyse and consider policy options from a Democratic Left perspective, of course one appoints politically informed people rather than political agnostics.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to take account of actual interest rates, rather than a notional 10 per cent rate when calculating income from deposit accounts in relation to the means test for social welfare recipients.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1445/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance schemes include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments which the applicant may have.  Different methods of assessment are applied in the various social assistance schemes.  For example, in the case of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and capital in excess of this amount is assessed at 10 per cent.  For old age pension purposes, an initial disregard of £200 is allowed, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about 430,000 people in receipt of a social assistance payment at <Col N="260" /> present.  In view of the large number of recipients involved, it would not be feasible from an administrative point of view to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments as this would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients as rates fluctuate.</P>
    <P>I have plans, however, to standardise the method of assessing capital across the various social assistance schemes so as to improve the equity of the system. This will have to be done progressively over a period, in view of the administrative implications involved and I intend to commence this process in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is a load of nonsense.  The Minister should check with the Minister for Health as, in the case of health, interest is taken into account in means testing.  A print out is readily available from financial institutions. It is unsatisfactory that elderly people particularly are charged an excessive and unreal amount of 10 per cent.  The dogs in the street know one cannot get 10 per cent interest on a deposit account.  Why is the system not changed?  Why not have the actual interest charged rather than a notional amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by the Deputy about rates are valid but I am sure he is aware income is not assumed on the basis of all savings of the person concerned.  As I already pointed out, there are disregards.  I intend to review the system with a view to standardising the process of assessment of savings for all schemes.  It should be borne in mind that there are 430,000 people in receipt of assistance schemes.  It is not a matter of reading the rates available on any one day from the Stock Exchange and Government securities; all applications have to be examined to see whether the rate should apply and that is not an easy task.  Some system must be put in place to ensure <Col N="261" /> stability of income for the people concerned. Obviously returns from investments may fall as well as increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is mind boggling that the Minister is making an excuse for this unsatisfactory position.  Anybody who seeks from a financial institution the interest accruing on their account for a month, six months or a year is given it readily.  This matter has serious consequences because many elderly people, rather than being over-charged for their accounts, keep money under the mattress, and that leads to problems.  I am not blaming the Minister for difficulties in rural Ireland but as a result of the present system people are reluctant to put the few pounds they put aside for their burial expenses into the credit union or post office because they will be charged at a rate of 10 per cent.  People who put their money in a financial institution are lucky to get a few pounds interest after handling charges are deducted &mdash; the actual rate is nearer to 1 per cent than 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said it is relatively easy to get an annual figure from a financial institution.  I will read out the representative yields on Government securities, the most important aspect in terms of investment, from January 1995 so that he will appreciate the position is not as simple as he believes.  On five year gilts the end of month returns in percentage terms are: January, 8.6; February, 8.68; March, 8.69; April, 8.66; May, 8.07; June, 8.45; July, 8.07; August, 7.72; September, 7.61; October, 7.33; November, 6.76; December, 6.60 and January 1996, 6.38. On ten year gilts the figure ranges throughout the year from 8.66 to a present figure of 7.16.  On 20 year gilts the figure ranges from 8.37 to 7.36 in January of this year.  It is not a simple matter to establish what would be a fair rate.  It must also be borne in mind that elements of savings are disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not arguing that the current system is a fair one but it is a complex matter to resolve and I intend this year to <Col N="262" /> seek to resolve it.  It will take some years to deal with the matter because a range of schemes are involved and assessments of this kind apply differently to each scheme.  If the Deputy was really concerned about this matter he might have taken action before now bearing in mind that his party was in Government for most of the last ten to 15 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wondered when the Minister would fall back on the old reliable of blaming the former Government. The Minister said he would change the system but I find it incredible that he talks about five and ten year gilts and Government securities.  Elderly people do not have the money to invest in Government gilts.  They deposit their money in the local post office, credit union or bank where they are charged 10 per cent on it.  Rather than pay that rate many elderly people keep money in their homes and as a result are attacked and beaten up.  I would ask the Minister to change the present system.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a proposal for a fourth EU Poverty Programme to combat social exclusion, which requires unanimity, has been blocked by Germany and the UK. The German Government objected not only to the timing of the new programme and to the doubling of the budget, but also raised objections in principle to the proposal.  To date, all efforts by the Commission and other member states, including personal interventions by me on behalf of the Irish Government, have not succeeded in changing the German and UK Government's opposition to this proposal.  It is clear that the objections to the specific proposal put forward by the Commission are deeply rooted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> At the Social Affairs Council meeting in October of last year, which I attended, it was decided, following suggestions which I raised in order to advance the matter, to refer the issue to the Social Exclusion Expert Group meeting of 12 December 1995 with a view to breaking the deadlock in that forum.  Ireland was specifically requested to address that forum, in the context of advancing the argument in favour of a specific programme to combat exclusion.  Once again, however, while there was strong support for a poverty programme in general, the German and UK delegates reiterated their Government's objection in principle. The issue has remained unresolved now for some time and there are no indications that the situation will change in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that the EU Commission, as an interim measure, launched during the final months of 1995, a &ldquo;European Funding Initiative for Projects seeking to overcome Social Exclusion&rdquo;.  Under the programme, groups were offered once-off grants in support of innovative projects against social exclusion; invitations to apply for funding were sent directly from the Commission to interested groups.  I understand a total of nine Irish projects have now received funding under this initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has dragged on for all of last year and part of 1994. We were told on several occasions last year that major victories had been achieved at Council of Ministers meetings &mdash; one headline indicated this matter was kept on the agenda.  Following on previous poverty programmes which were very successful, has the Minister failed to convince his colleagues in Europe to give the go-ahead to this programme which is valued at about £10 million and aimed at poverty black spots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous poverty <Col N="264" /> programmes were very successful.  Projects which were funded under the Poverty III Programme and which no longer receive European Union funding are now funded by my Department.  On the question of support by the Council, in order for this programme to be proceeded with, unanimity is required.  If one member state objects to it, it cannot proceed.  The programme has been supported by all member states except Germany and the UK who adamantly refuse to allow it to go forward.  The question of overcoming those objections is currently being addressed by the expert group.  The German objection is specifically a constitutional objection relating to subsidiarity.  Germany argues that the European Union has no right or responsibility under the Maastricht Treaty to be involved in national antipoverty programmes.</P>
      <P>All member states, including Ireland, have found it impossible to overcome that objection.  The United Kingdom Minister opposes it purely and simply because of his refusal to accept a doubling of the funds provided for the programme. The current position is that it has been impossible to overcome those objections.  The success spoken about with regard to my endeavours in this matter was to the effect that there had been moves to kill off the programme at the last and penultimate Council meetings when I succeeded in maintaining it on the agenda so that it would not be abolished.</P>

      <P>In August 1995, responsibility for the funding of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme was transferred from the Department of Health to my Department. The necessary legislative provisions for the transfer of responsibility for the administration of the scheme to my Department will be included in the Social Welfare Bill, 1996 and the transfer will be effected as soon as the necessary administrative arrangements are put in place.  My priority is to secure a smooth transfer of the scheme and, in doing so, to maintain and, hopefully improve, the quality of service to recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On completion of the transfer I will be examining all aspects of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to see what changes are necessary or warranted.  In this context I will take account of any recommendations emerging from the work of the Commission on the Status of People with <Col N="266" /> Disabilities and from discussions with organisations representing people with disabilities.  I intend to address such issues as soon as the scheme has been transferred and as soon as I have had an opportunity to see how it is operating in practice.  In the meanwhile, however, I propose to provide for certain improvements in the existing conditions for entitlement to disabled person's maintenance allowance, particularly in so far as the provision for the assessment of means are concerned.  These improvements will be provided for in the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, which I expect to publish at the beginning of March.</P>

      <P>In the transfer of the administration of the scheme from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare it is most important to ensure that those at present in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance continue to receive that weekly allowance on time. That is not an easy task given that it involves the transfer of the records of eight health boards to my Department's systems, all of which have to be amalgamated. We must ensure that every single beneficiary is accounted for and, since we are talking about the delivery of expenditure in excess of £100 million annually among 30,938 recipients, the Deputy will readily understand it is not a task which can be carried out overnight. A working group is examining all aspects of how that transfer can be done effectively and efficiently and all our efforts are geared to that purpose.  As soon as we have that running smoothly we will have an opportunity to ascertain how the disabled person's maintenance allowance can be improved.  As I already indicated, I will be introducing <Col N="267" /> refinements in the means-testing of disabled person's maintenance allowance in the Social Welfare Bill, 1996.</P>

      <P>Being aware that a number of groups of people with disability have been in touch with the Minister with regard to a disability allowance, what is the Minister's attitude to it?  Is that one of the improvements he envisages bearing in mind that 80 per cent of people with disability are unemployed; indeed, whether employed or unemployed, they incur extra costs for food, accommodation and transport? If such disabled people are to be enabled to avail of employment in the workplace one of the main incentives would be their entitlement to a disability allowance.  Does the Minister intend granting such allowance among the improvements he has in mind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>I have already indicated to the House I am conscious that, while my Department administers a disability benefit scheme &mdash; which provides income to people during illness preventing them from working &mdash; it does not administer a disability allowance scheme not based on contributions, whereas disability benefit is available only to applicants with a certain number of contributions and credits. There have been suggestions to the effect that the disabled person's maintenance allowance could form the basis of a disability allowance scheme which I am prepared to examine.  I will be examining the recommendations from the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in addition to representations from other organisations before deciding what route we should take in improving the disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, while the concept of a disability allowance is a good one, its retention when in employment is an even better one?  Will he agree also that, whether a disabled person is employed <Col N="268" /> or unemployed he or she incurs extra costs for additional daily food, accommodation and transport which this allowance would cover?  Can we give the 80 per cent of unemployed disabled people some incentive to seek employment in the workplace knowing that, in that event, they will retain such disability allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that people with disabilities, particularly those in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, object to the contention that their income is regarded as some type of &ldquo;health income&rdquo;, that because of their disability, they are regarded as being unhealthy, since many of them would consider themselves to be as healthy as any other person without an obvious physical disability. For that reason they argue they should be eligible for unemployment assistance in the same way as others. There are complex issues involved in the integration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance into the general system of allowances administered by my Department.  I know there is general welcome on the part of organisations representing people with disabilities for the transference of the scheme from the Department of Health to my Department. They perceive that as an abandonment of the view that disabled people present a &ldquo;health&rdquo; problem; rather that they will be treated as ordinary individuals who happen to have a disability.  I reiterate my priority is to ensure that the administration of the scheme is transferred to my Department in a manner that will ensure, the day after transfer has been effected, that no beneficiary will miss a cheque because of inefficiency.  As soon as the transferred scheme is working smoothly, the staff at present engaged in that type of operation can begin to ascertain how the system itself can be improved.  That will not be achieved overnight or solely on the basis of an internal departmental review.  We will be listening to the views of those who represent people with disabilities and examining the report of the <Col N="269" /> Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  We will consult widely, including discussing the point Deputy Wallace made, that people with disability do incur additional living and transport costs.  At this point I am not prepared to indicate what direction we may go because all these matters need to be examined in detail.  However, I am determined that the system will be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in the Minister replying about an unemployment or disability allowance which ceases whenever a beneficiary obtains a job.  I am referring to the cost of disability allowance.  Irrespective of whether people with disabilities have a job, they should be entitled to that allowance.  I call on the Minister to adopt that thinking.  Replying in terms of an unemployment allowance or disability allowance is not adopting desirable thinking in terms of the cost of disability allowance.  It would be helpful if the Department were to carry out research into the cost of disability and that issue were addressed in line with the Minister's reviews of the disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated to the Deputy that those are the issues we intend to look at and on which we intend to consult the representative organisations.  I have no doubt that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will address this issue also.  We will take account of the views expressed by them and their recommendations.  Any decisions in this area must have regard to the resources available to my Department to implement desirable changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>Addressing the issue of the cost of disability should ensure that people with disabilities will be able to secure employment, make a contribution in the workplace and a return to the State in terms of PAYE and PRSI contributions.  Assistance should be given to people to meet the <Col N="270" /> cost of their disabilities and to ensure that it is worth their while to take up employment.  At present 80 per cent of people with disabilities are unemployed mainly due to the fact that if they take up employment they will lose their disability allowance.  The cost of disability must be addressed to ensure that people with disabilities are encouraged to take up employment.</P>

      <P>Before calling on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, to make his Budget Statement I am pleased to inform Members of the House that, in line with recent precedent, a copy of the Minister's speech is being made available to all Deputies in accordance with the arrangements agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I must request, however, that Deputies wishing to leave the Chamber, before the Minister has concluded, relinquish their copies of the speech to the usher on duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Today I am presenting my second budget to Dáil Éireann.  The budget is a central part of the way in which we organise our nation's finances.  It indicates choices and highlights priorities for us and for our society.</P>
      <P>Last year's budget was a success.  The nation has had a very good year.  In fact, Ireland's economic performance in 1995 was better than that of any other economy in the European Union or the OECD.  This was achieved through the efforts and co-operation of workers, managers and entrepreneurs in both the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy, including the public service. I want to congratulate all those involved in this success, particularly those who helped to create the thousands of new jobs throughout this island.</P>
      <P>The budget reaffirms the three main objectives of last year.  These are:</P>
      <P>(i) to reward work,</P>
      <P>(ii) to promote enterprise, and</P>
      <P>(iii) to strengthen social solidarity.</P>
      <P>Work is central to all our lives.  It is one of the ways in which we define ourselves to each other.  It is the process that enables us to create wealth as individuals and as a community.  People enrich themselves through work.  Without it they may not only become impoverished, but remain unfulfilled.  Society loses its full potential if it cannot ensure that all of its people are able to work. That is why unemployment affects all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise creates work and generates wealth.  It is the central energy in each of us that develops our society by applying our skills and talents to meet the needs of both our own markets and the markets of the rest of the world.  It involves risk, effort and judgment, as well as skill, dedication and integrity. We need to promote enterprise throughout our society in both the public and private sectors.  We must recognise that enterprises grow and develop and pass from generation to generation. <Col N="720" /> We now have a growing number of first generation Irish firms that are preparing for this critical stage.  We must ensure that they continue to be productive and secure throughout this process.</P>
    <P>The work and enterprise of our society enables us to generate the necessary wealth to build and sustain a community. That wealth is the means by which we can ensure that the young and the old, the sick and the disabled, remain part of our community with a sense of purpose and belonging.  We have all been young and we are all getting older.  We are, therefore talking about ourselves when we look at how we develop new ways of strengthening the bonds of social solidarity within our society.</P>
    <P>We have many needs which require resources but such resources must first be generated and developed by each one of us working together.  Everyone has a contribution to make to the development and growth of our economy. No one who is able, or capable, can be excluded or excused from participating in our society.  When normal markets, including labour markets, do not function efficiently, then we must intervene within the economy to correct these market failures.  In particular, we must deal with the major problem of structural long-term unemployment in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The economy in 1995</i>
    </P>
    <P>We have been successful in achieving the objectives which I set for my first budget.  The results speak for themselves:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;employment increased by some 45,000, or 3.75 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the overall growth rate as measured by GNP was over 7 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;investment grew by almost 11 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;private consumption increased by almost 4 per cent in real terms reflecting higher living standards;</P>
    <P>&mdash;mortgage and short-term interest rates are at historically low levels;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" />&mdash;export volumes increased by over 13 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;unemployment on the same basis as measured by the Labour Force survery, decreased by some 25,000.</P>
    <P>The economy has grown by an annual average of 4.7 per cent over the past five years, compared with the EU average of 1.5 per cent.  This rate of growth was achieved while inflation was kept to 2.5 per cent on average over that period compared with the EU average of 4.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Most encouraging of all, there are clear signals that rapid economic growth is now being translated into very impressive increases in the numbers of people at work.  There are now some 1,230,000 people at work, the highest figure since the 1930s.  By improving the conditions for enterprise and work in last year's budget we underpinned the real improvement in economic prospects and sustainable employment which came through in 1995.  Our social cohesion measures have ensured that those who are less well off in our society have been cared for.  In fact, taking pay, tax and PRSI changes together, the gains for employees in particular, have been ahead of those expected when the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was negotiated.</P>
    <P>I want to say something more inclusive. This strong economic performance is a tribute to the success of the fiscal policies which have been pursued by different Governments in recent years in co-operation with the social partners. The commitment by all concerned to sound public finances has enhanced confidence in the management of the economy.  This has helped to secure and maintain low inflation and low interest rates which have contributed to a sustainable expansion in domestic demand. In turn, this has provided the conditions for converting economic growth into additional jobs.</P>
    <P>This process has been aided by:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which kept domestic cost <Col N="722" /> increases moderate and ensured the maintenance of our international competitiveness and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the tax and PRSI initiatives in recent budgets which aimed at improving both the incentives to employers to offer jobs and to employees to take them up.</P>
    <P>The progress which I have just outlined has a message for all of us, as politicians, workers and citizens, that is working together is an effective and powerful way forward.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Outlook for 1996</i>
    </P>
    <P>This year is expected to be one of continuing economic growth, as confirmed by the following indicators:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Employment will increase by 31,000;</P>
    <P>&mdash;GNP will grow by 5 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Inflation will average about 2.25 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Consumer spending will grow by about 4.5 per cent in real terms;</P>
    <P>&mdash;An increase of almost 8 per cent in the volume of investment is expected and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the balance of payments will remain in substantial surplus.</P>
    <P>Our economic and other policies have brought about our good economic performance. Our task now is to adapt them as necessary to the rapidly changing economic conditions facing us over the rest of this decade.  We will continue to pursue a stable exchange rate for our currency to ensure the maintenance of low inflation and, consequently, competitiveness. The full details of the performance of the economy in 1995 and our economic forecasts for the year ahead, are contained in the Economic Background to the Budget which is being circulated today.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of the 1995 Budget Outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1995 budget outturn showed an Exchequer borrowing requirement of <Col N="723" /> £627 million, or 1.9 per cent of GNP as against our budget target of 2.4 per cent. In fact,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the outturn was £186 million below the EBR target of £813 million set in the 1995 budget;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the general Government Deficit, calculated in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, is estimated at just over 2 per cent of GDP, compared with the budget estimate of 2.5 per cent; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the general Government debt declined as a proportion of GDP from almost 92 per cent at end 1994 to about 85 per cent at end 1995.</P>
    <P>The outturn for current expenditure was only slightly ahead of that targeted in the budget, despite our having set up a fund of £60 million for hepatitis C sufferers, and the extra cost of higher than anticipated numbers on the live register. This overall result reflects the Government's commitment to keeping expenditure levels under strict control.  The budgetary outturn once again places Ireland among the strongest in terms of fiscal performance in the European Union in 1995.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the general Government deficit which is rapidly becoming dominant in the context of our qualification for European Monetary Union, our Maastricht Treaty obligations and our continuing eligibility for the Cohesion Fund.  This measurement also gives a better indication of the underlying trend of the budgetary balance than our traditional measure, the EBR. Accordingly, while I still propose to use the Exchequer borrowing requirement, it has to be recognised that the general Government deficit as a ratio to GDP will be focused on more in the future. This measurement is attractive because it tends to level out the effects of onceoff factors as it is wider and partly based on an accrual system of accounting.  This is in contrast to the EBR which is simply a cash figure, but which has been an <Col N="724" /> important focus for the financial markets. For the same reasons, the General Government debt as a proportion of GDP will, in the future, be used more rather than the national debt as a proportion of GNP.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic and Monetary Union</i>
    </P>
    <P>When Ireland voted for the Maastricht Treaty, we, the citizens, voted for Economic and Monetary Union, European Monetary Union, which includes the single currency.  The Madrid Council in December, confirmed the starting date for European Monetary Union and decided that the new currency will be known as the Euro.  European Monetary Union will be introduced on 1 January, 1999 and Ireland intends to be among the initial group of EU member states who qualifies for membership. The policies required to ensure our successful participation within European Monetary Union are already being implemented, and will need to be intensified in the lead-up to January 1999.</P>
    <P>EMU will be good for Europe and Ireland.  It will provide us with a stable currency, low interest rates and low inflation.  It will also remove currency risks as well as reducing transaction costs.  European Monetary Union also provides challenges, particularly as regards the relationship between the countries taking part at the outset, and the other member states.  Accordingly, I have commissioned a study of the economic implications of European Monetary Union.  This study will be completed by mid-year and its findings will be made public.  The purpose of the study is to provide us with more detailed information which can be used for decision-making purposes.  This will facilitate better planning for European Monetary Union, both in terms of qualifying for it and, more importantly being successful within it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Renewal</i>
    </P>
    <P>One of the challenges we face in this regard is the modernisation and renewal of our public service.  The Government will soon decide on a programme, based <Col N="725" /> upon the report of the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries of Government Departments, on how to proceed with the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>The SMI process has the full support of the Government and the programme is designed to empower and energise the public service, devolve decision making and make the entire process more transparent and accountable to the citizen as customer and client.  There will be full consultation with the staff associations involved and other interested parties as the process evolves.</P>
    <P>Such a transformation is necessary if we are to achieve our goal of having the most efficient public administration system within the European Union.  This reform is essential to improving our economic performance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Administration</i>
    </P>
    <P>Tax compliance costs are always a source of concern to business, small businesses in particular.  The Revenue Commissioners have made considerable progress in this area.  They have assured me that they plan to introduce further important measures to simplify and streamline tax collection procedures. Details of a number of planned measures are given in the Principal Features.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay and Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>This Government is committed to the process of social partnership.  It has worked well for the nation in the last ten years.  We must build upon its success. We are, therefore, confirming here and now that we are meeting all our commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement. Accordingly, the 1996 Estimates include provision for the cost of the general increases in the public sector of 1.5 per cent from 1 June 1996 and 1.5 per cent from 1 October 1996.  They also provide for the estimated cost in 1996 of the settlement of claims under the local bargaining or restructuring provision of that agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> It remains crucial that all negotiations under this latter provision adhere to the cost parameters underlying the pay agreement and have regard to the need for flexibility, change and improvements in efficiency and effectiveness.  The need to contain overall pay costs is also being tackled through a rigorous approach to the creation of new posts within the Civil Service and certain restrictions on the filling of vacancies arising in 1996 as part of a wider strategy to stem the growth in numbers employed in the public service.</P>
    <P>The effect of meeting our pay agreement commitments, with other costs such as increments and the carryover effects of extra employment in 1995, has been to increase the cost of Exchequer pay and pensions by £249 million to an estimated £4,813 million in 1996, an increase of 5.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Voluntary Early Retirement Scheme for the Defence Forces</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government has accepted in principle the conclusions of the Efficiency Audit Group on the need for reform in the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces.  These reforms will give the Defence Forces the capability and flexibility to meet and adapt to their roles in the most efficient and effective way.  They will also bring best practice to bear on the management, organisation and operation of the Defence Forces.  Accordingly, I am providing £13 million for a voluntary early retirement package for the Defence Forces to facilitate the implementation of these reforms.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Debt Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1996 debt service estimate of £2,310 million takes account of £119 million in savings carried over from 1995 and a target of £100 million in savings to be achieved by the National Treasury Management Agency in 1996.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Finances</i>
    </P>
    <P>In referring to Economic and Monetary Union earlier, I acknowledged the need to position ourselves for entry to <Col N="727" /> the third stage of European Monetary Union.  One essential ingredient in this regard is to ensure that our public finances are in a healthy condition.  I am pleased to be able to confirm that they are.</P>
    <P>The real increase in current supply spending for 1996 at 2.5 per cent contrasts with an annual average of about 5.5 per cent over the past five years. Despite restraining the growth in expenditure, this Government:</P>
    <P>&mdash;introduced free third-level fees;</P>
    <P>&mdash;secured the highest rates of pupils remaining in the education system to leaving certificate level;</P>
    <P>&mdash;approved the largest programme of capital spending in the health area, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;introduced, for the first time, a comprehensive programme for women's health.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to firm management of the public finances.  A prudent and cautious approach is necessary with current supply spending as with other budgetary aggregates.  The prudent approach over the last few years is evident from the fact that each year since 1993 the budgetary targets have been more than achieved.  Keeping the general Government deficit below 3 per cent of GDP each year is crucial in the context of the Maastricht Treaty criteria.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in framing my targets for 1996, I have adopted a similarly prudent approach to that adopted in other years.  The opening EBR, having allowed for departmental balances of £38 million, is £583 million.  Having made provision for the measures I am announcing today, my targets for this year are:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I also wish to confirm that the non-capital supply services expenditure figure for 1996 will, as a result of my budget day proposals, remain unchanged at £12,087 million, the figure I announced with the publication of the Estimates in December.  I have maintained that figure intact despite the many pressures for increased expenditure.  To the extent that any expenditure measures I announce today are not already provided for in my post-budget target, their cost is being met from savings elsewhere in supply spending.  Full details are set out in the Principal Features of the Budget.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REWARD WORK</P>
    <P>I now turn to the first of my objectives, namely, rewarding those at work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employees' PRSI</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, the Government announced a series of measures to reduce the burden of income tax and PRSI and direct relief to those on low incomes generally, especially those outside the current income tax net.  These initiatives were favourably received and have contributed significantly to reducing the tax and PRSI wedge on lower incomes.  The principal innovation was the allowance for full rate PRSI contributors, under which the first £50 of weekly wages is disregarded in the calculation of PRSI contributions.  I am happy to announce that this allowance will now be increased to £80 per week. To part fund this increase, it has been decided not to renew, from 6 April next, the existing £140 per annum income tax PRSI allowance available to full rate contributors.</P>
    <P>This increased allowance will result in gains of up to £86 per annum or £1.65 per week for those full rate PRSI contributors exempted from income tax or on marginal relief.</P>
    <P>It has also been decided to increase the corresponding allowance to those on the modified PRSI rate and the self employed by £10 to £20 per week.  These <Col N="729" /> groups do not get the income tax PRSI allowance and are thus not affected by its non-renewal.</P>
    <P>The PRSI ceiling applicable to employees and the self-employed will increase from £21,500 to £22,300.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard rate income tax band is being widened by £1,000 to £18,800 for married couples and by £500 to £9,400 for single persons.</P>
      <P>The personal allowance is being increased by £300 to £5,300 per annum for married couples and by £150 to £2,650 per annum for single persons with an increase of £150 being applied also to widowed, single parent and widowed parent allowances.</P>
      <P>The general income exemption limits below which no income tax is payable are being increased by £400 to £7,800 per annum for married couples, or £150 per week, and by £200 to £3,900 per annum for single persons, or £75 per week, with a similar increase in the age exemption limits.  This will remove around 18,000 persons who would otherwise be in the tax net.</P>
      <P>The thresholds for payment of the employment and training levy and the health levy are being raised by £500 to £9,750 per annum or from £178 to £188 per week.</P>
      <P>The impact of the tax/PRSI package on a family with two children and only one spouse earning £15,000 on full PRSI and PAYE, will be to leave them better off by £129 per annum or £2.48 per week.  For the same family on £10,000 per annum the increase is £246 or £4.73 per week.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Taxation of Unemployment Benefit/ Disability Benefit (UB/DB)</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special tax relief on unemployment benefit payments to systematic short-time workers introduced in the Finance Act, 1994 is being extended for a further year.  The exemption of the first £10 per week of unemployment <Col N="730" /> benefit from tax, introduced in last year's Finance Act, will also continue at its current level.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Benefit-In-Kind Cars</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to introduce a focused relief in regard to the taxation of car benefitin-kind. The present tapering relief provisions for high mileage create difficulties for company representatives, particularly in urban areas, who use their cars intensively and indispensably in their work, but who do not accumulate enough mileage to avail of the present reliefs.  In recognition of the imbalance in the current provisions I propose to introduce a 20 per cent relief from BIK on cars for those company representatives who spend 70 per cent or more of their time on business away from their place of work.  This relief is an alternative to the existing high mileage tapering relief and will be available only where the business mileage exceeds 5,000 miles per annum.</P>

        <i>Cross-Border Workers</i>
      </P>
      <P>Cross-Border workers who work in Northern Ireland but reside in the State are liable for the health and employment and training levies at 2.25 per cent. Arising from the report of the special inter-departmental committee which I established, I propose to exempt their Northern Ireland earnings from these levies.  Accordingly for a person with yearly earnings of £15,000, the saving is £337.50 per annum.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Cost of income tax and employee PRSI measures</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total cost of the income tax and employee PRSI measures, after taking account of the non-renewal of the annual £140 income tax PRSI allowance, is £119 million in 1996 and £204 million in a full year.  This includes the <Col N="731" /> cost of a number of further income tax reliefs I will mention later.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PROMOTE ENTERPRISE</P>
    <P>I now turn to ways in which I propose to fulfil my second objective, that of promoting enterprise.</P>
    <P>In order to enhance the capacity of the economy to create self sustaining employment over the longer term, it is necessary to build on the progress made in last year's budget in reducing corporation tax and PRSI on businesses.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employers' PRSI</i>
    </P>
    <P>With that aim in mind it has been decided in the case of Employers' PRSI</P>
    <P>&mdash;to reduce the standard rate from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to reduce the lower rate from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent and increase the threshold below which this lower rate applies from £12,000 to £13,000 per annum, or from £231 per week to £250 per week, in terms of weekly earnings.</P>
    <P>The ceiling on employers' PRSI will rise from £25,800 to £26,800 broadly in line with wage inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of these reliefs is to target reductions on lower paid employments in order to secure a competitive reduction in non-wage labour charges.  The cost of these measures is £31 million in 1996 and £51 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Corporation Tax</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my first budget, I cut the standard rate of corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  I made it clear that the Government intended to reduce this rate further to bring our structure into line with overseas competitors.  The Government have given careful thought <Col N="732" /> as to how this objective can best be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the demands being made for a special low rate of corporation tax for small firms in the services sector of up to a certain size of turnover and profit level.  The Government believes that the calls for a reduced rate on small companies' profits and the need to continue progress in getting the standard rate down can be met by the introduction from 1 April 1996 of a new lower rate of corporation tax of 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of taxable income for all companies or groups irrespective of size.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a rating structure means that for service sector companies the effective rate of corporation tax will be between 30 per cent and 38 per cent depending on the size of taxable income.  This measure will cost £1 million in 1996, £23 million in 1997 and £31 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>To benefit certain smaller firms, I am also reducing from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, the surcharge on the undistributed trading profits of professional close service companies.  Full details are in the Principal Features.</P>

The operation of BES has been subjected to a thorough analysis by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners. In addition the Tax Strategy Group has been consulted as have the main interested parties &mdash; the Small Firms Association, ISME, the major designated funds and the Dublin Business Innovation Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this review it has been decided to retain the current BES, including the limits of £1 million per <Col N="733" /> company and £25,000 per annum per investor, but to introduce a statutory certification system for all BES projects which raise over £250,000 in total under the BES.  The certification process, which will be undertaken by the main development agencies, is aimed at ensuring a better jobs return from the significant Exchequer relief under the scheme.  Further details of changes to the BES are set out in the Principal Features and in the Financial Resolution, to be moved later in the House, to come into operation on and from today.</P>

      <i>Film Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>Because of its importance to the Irish film industry, the Government has decided to continue section 35 film relief for another three years.  However, certain modifications designed to improve the targeting of the relief and make it more cost-efficient from the point of view of the Exchequer are being introduced.</P>
    <P>This amended relief will be given effect by a financial resolution which will be moved later in the House and come into operation on and from today. The more important changes to the relief include:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a reduction in the amount of expenditure on larger films which qualifies for relief,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a significant increase in the limit for corporate investment,</P>
    <P>&mdash;restricting the tax deduction to 80 per cent of the investment, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;substituting a one year holding requirement for capital gains tax purposes for the current three year holding period for investments.</P>
    <P>Further details are contained in the Principal Features.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will be making a more detailed statement on the revised relief and of the Irish film industry.</P>

      </P>
      <P>Last year, I increased the business relief under capital acquisitions tax to a flat 50 per cent on all qualifying assets. I have decided to increase the flat rate to 75 per cent in order to reduce further the tax impact on the transfer of family businesses.  As before, this increased relief will also apply to agricultural property.  However, the new relief will be subject to a revised clawback arrangement to ensure that the full 75 per cent will only apply if the assets concerned are retained in the business for ten years or more.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time that the Dublin docklands area, which is no longer required for its original purpose, should be developed and planned in a coherent way.  The Custom House Docks Development Authority has made an impressive and successful contribution, but there is a large area, on both sides of the River Liffey, which is now in transition.  A substantial portion of the land is in the ownership of State bodies.  The Grand Canal Harbour basin, a key amenity resource, is also located in the heart of this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire area, at the centre of Dublin, has great potential for the continued redevelopment and rejuvenation of the <Col N="736" /> city, but it requires a planned and coordinated approach.

      <P>There will be a corresponding increase in the associated VAT rate for livestock which will also increase to 2.8 per cent with effect from 1 March 1996.  This change, which is based on a calculation of the level of VAT on farming inputs, is in keeping with the Government's statement in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to retain the flat-rate arrangements on the existing basis as provided for by EU legislation.  The cost of this increase to the Exchequer is £6.3 million in 1996 or £9 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The Government is determined to ensure that the long-term unemployed share in the benefits of economic growth along with other sectors of society.  The following new measures have been agreed by Government on foot of recent proposals which have been made in this area:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a recruitment subsidy of £80 a week will be paid to employers in respect of new employees who have been unemployed for at least three years. Up to 5,000 places will be provided under this arrangement;</P>
      <P>&mdash;an additional 1,000 full-time places will be provided on community employment, on a pilot basis, for people over 35 years of age who have been unemployed for at least five years;</P>
      <P>&mdash;25 per cent of the 40,000 part-time places on community employment are to be reserved for those over 35 years of age and unemployed for three or more years, with up to 75</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> per cent of places reserved for those over 21 years and unemployed for at least 12 months;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a scheme of work trials lasting five weeks will be introduced with a target of 5,000 places.  Participants will be unemployed for over six months and in danger of drifting into long-term unemployment, or be long-term unemployed but considered to be ready for employment.  They will continue to be paid their social welfare entitlements and, in addition, receive a contribution towards outof-pocket expenses;</P>
    <P>&mdash;persons who have been unemployed for at least one year will retain their medical cards for three years after entering employment; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;special measures will be introduced for 18 and 19 year olds: after six months on the live register, there will be a requirement to register with FÁS or the Local Employment Service, or to participate on a work progression programme consisting of intensive counselling and progression to a job, training option or youth employment option.  Details of the measures will be announced by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in consultation with the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Social Welfare</i>
      </P>
      <P>The primary objectives underlying this year's social welfare budget changes are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to help the long-term unemployed obtain work;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to make the social welfare system more work-friendly, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;to improve the position of families, pensioners and carers.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Pro-Employment Social Welfare Measures</i>
      </P>
      <P>While increases in payment rates are an essential element in assisting the unemployed, the Government believe there must also be accompanying changes which facilitate them in seeking and taking up employment.  Towards this end, we have reviewed the existing range of social welfare work-related incentives.  In the light of this review, we have decided to make a number of modifications and improvements in the family income supplement, FIS, child dependant allowances, in the assessment of earnings from employment for unemployment assistance purposes, and in the back to work allowance scheme. These changes are interrelated, particularly those in respect of FIS and child dependant allowances.  Overall, they constitute a significant package of pro-employment measures.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Family Income Supplement</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family income supplement is aimed at increasing the disposable <Col N="740" /> income of families in relatively low paid employment.  At present, nearly 12,000 families are receiving payments under the scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to improve the attractiveness of the scheme and hence its incentive value, the Government has decided that the existing income thresholds used to calculate entitlement to FIS should be increased by £10 per week.  This will mean that FIS recipients will get an additional £6 per week and the average payment will increase to over £37 per week.  Other improvements will reduce the qualifying period of employment from six to three months, extend the scope of the scheme to include job sharers for the first time, and relax the eligibility criteria used to determine entitlement to allow more part-time and casual workers with dependent children to claim FIS.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Dependant Allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>In a related move designed to increase the take-up rate of FIS, the Government have decided that, in respect of people unemployed for 12 months or more, any full-rate child dependant allowances which they currently receive as part of their weekly social welfare payment should be retained by them for a period of 13 weeks after they take up employment. The Government sees this initiative as providing an important bridge to cover the period of uncertainty which arises while the person is waiting for a decision on whether he or she is entitled to a family income supplement payment. The expectation is that this change will help to smooth further the transition to work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unemployment Assistance</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government has decided to simplify greatly the basis for calculating entitlement to unemployment assistance by moving from an approach based on a day of unemployment to one based on a week of unemployment.  This will enable those who can avail of part-time and casual employment opportunities to calculate more readily their overall <Col N="741" /> income position, and will improve the incentive to take up such opportunities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Back to Work Allowance Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>In addition to the facilitating measures which I have just announced, the Government have decided to extend the availability of the back to work allowance scheme.  Under this scheme, a long-term unemployed person or lone parent who is at least 23 years of age can retain, in addition to their wages, a certain percentage of their previous social welfare payment at a reducing rate on taking up employment or becoming self-employed.  At present, there are about 10,000 participants on the scheme.  The scheme has been successful in encouraging many long-term unemployed people to move into paid employment.  Accordingly, the Government have decided to provide for an increase in the number of participants from 10,000 to 15,000 during 1996. Taken together, these measures represent a cohesive and focused approach to providing real opportunities to break the cycle of long-term unemployment for many people.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Weekly Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>In addition to these employment related measures, I am providing for a 3 per cent increase in all personal social welfare weekly payments and adult dependant allowances from mid-June 1996.</P>

This will increase the rate to £29 for each of the first two children and to £34 for the third child onwards.  Combined with the general increase of 3 per cent I have just announced, the enhanced child benefit should result in a real increase in the income position this year of all families dependent on social welfare.</P>

        <i>Miscellaneous Improvements</i>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also providing for a number of other improvements in the social welfare system aimed at meeting the particular needs of certain categories. These include an increase to £6 per week in the living alone allowance payable to pensioners; the extension of the free schemes to certain low income occupational pensioners who do not qualify for these benefits at present; the extension of the free travel companion pass to visually impaired children; improvements in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, and <Col N="743" /> additional funds for the community and voluntary services operated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>One-Parent Family Payment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government has decided to proceed with the introduction of a new oneparent family payment scheme, with effect from January 1997.  This will replace the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit schemes.  Payments under the new scheme will not be conditional on claimants having to prove that they have been deserted.  The scheme will be available on an equal basis to men and women.</P>
    <P>Details of the full range of social welfare measures are being announced today by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Total Cost of Social Welfare Package</i>
    </P>
    <P>The total cost of the social welfare package which I have outlined today will be £80 million this year and £161 million in a full year.  This is a significant level of additional resources.  It brings the full-year level of gross spending on social welfare to almost £4.4 billion.  It also underlines, in a very real sense, this Government's continuing concern for the disadvantaged in our community.</P>

        <i>Income Tax Allowances</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards income tax allowances for carers and others, I propose to increase to £7,500 from £5,000 per annum the <Col N="744" /> maximum allowance which people can claim against tax where they employ a person to care for them or their spouse. I also propose to increase from £600 to £700 per annum the tax allowance in respect of an incapacitated child.  The blind persons' tax allowance will also be increased by £100 single and £200 married where both are blind.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Alarms for persons aged 65 and over</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to introduce a tax relief of up to £800 at the standard rate of income tax for persons aged 65 and over living alone for the purchase cost of alarm systems.  This relief will be available for a period of two years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Relief for Donations of Works of Cultural Importance</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year I introduced a relief for donations to the major cultural institutions of important heritage items.  An annual cap of £500,000 was put on the maximum value of the donations which could be accepted under the scheme. This will now be increased to £750,000 for 1996.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Indirect Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The initiatives announced by me earlier require that certain revenue raising measures be taken.  Accordingly, in the excise area, I propose to seek an additional contribution through a VAT inclusive tax increase of 10p per 20 cigarettes, with <i>pro-rata</i> increases on other tobacco products, and a VAT inclusive increase of 1p per litre on petrol and diesel, all of which will take effect from midnight tonight.</P>

This will bring the duty rate into line with that of leaded petrol and reflects environmental concerns over <Col N="745" /> the use of this product as against ordinary unleaded petrol.  These increases will raise £40 million in 1996 and £47 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>I also propose to increase the stamp duty on ATM cards from £2 to £5 per annum with effect from 1 February 1996.  This will raise £1.7 million in 1996 and £3.4 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>On the positive side, I propose to cut the excise duty on non-automotive LPG for consumer and industrial use by 0.44p per litre with effect from 1 July next.  This will be of assistance to industrial users of LPG, such as the production and processing of poultry, and glass making.</P>

      <P>The proposed increase on super plus unleaded petrol, the reduction on LPG and the mining tax relief mentioned earlier are all environmentally sound initiatives.  This Government is fully committed to improving the environment.  The tax system can clearly play a key role in environmental policy and in eliminating activities which destroy our environment and deplete natural resources.</P>

        <i>Post-Budget Expenditure and Revenue Position</i>
      </P>
      <P>The cost of the various taxation and capital and current expenditure measures is some £247 million.  Details of all the measures are contained in the Principal Features.  The budget targets already indicated take into account these costs, along with certain estimating savings, departmental balances and the effects on revenue buoyancy of the totality of the measures introduced today.  The budget targets are prudent, and reflect the Government's full commitment to maintaining firm fiscal control in the light of the clear economic benefits from doing so.</P>

      <P>To begin with, the Government, when completing the expenditure Estimates, also agreed on the final budget day figure for non-capital supply services expenditure.  I subsequently published that figure in conjunction with the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>Following this budget, I intend to publish within a couple of weeks an outline of the main features of the Finance Bill so as to enable interested parties, both inside and outside the House, to prepare for the detailed discussions and debate of these provisions when they are published in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <i>Multi-annual budgets</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is also my intention, in accordance with the strategy statement drawn up by my Department in the SMI context and the recommendations of the steering group, to begin to provide for multi-annual budgets.  This will involve a three year cycle and will be based, initially at least, on a projection of the budget position assuming existing levels of programmes and services along with existing tax rates.  This new arrangement will enable us to move away from the restrictive straitjacket of much of the ritual which tends to characterise our departmental expenditure estimates each year.  Already, many companies and organisations are involved in multi-annual budgetary arrangements.  It makes good sense for us to do the same, because of the complex and ongoing nature of budgetary commitments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pre-Budget Submissions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The number of pre-budget submissions being sent to the Minister and the Department of Finance has increased enormously in recent years.  It continues to grow and it is not possible to comply with the requests from all of the groups for meetings.  Where meetings are arranged, the process is unsatisfactory as the dialogue is one way, with each group stating what it wishes to have included in the budget to meet the interests of its organisation or association.</P>

      <i>Timing of Budget</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, we must consider the merit of bringing forward our budgetary arrangements, in line with our European Union partners, so that the budget process is completed before the commencement of the year for which it is intended.  Such a reform will impose new pressures and strains upon existing arrangements and procedures. We need to move carefully, but move we must.  Because of the need to plan fully for this change, and the pressures which will arise from the EU Presidency in the second half of this year, I envisage the 1998 budget as the first to be brought in under this timetable.  In other words, the budget for 1998 should be delivered in late autumn of 1997.</P>

      <P>The benefits which we will derive from these changes will improve our efficiency and our effectiveness. Ireland will be a better place for these reforms.  They are a part of the objective of ensuring that we have the most efficient and effective public administration system in Europe.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Social Partnership</i>
      </P>
      <P>Ireland is now entering an exciting new phase of European development. The Intergovernmental Conference, which begins in March, will consider changes in the European Union Treaty now that developments arising from Maastricht are well under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will take up the challenge of the Presidency of the European Union from 1 July to the end of the year.  We remain committed to economic and monetary union and are one of the few member states that continue to meet the Maastricht criteria through our efficient and effective management of our economic and social affairs.  We have only been able to manage these affairs successfully because of the way in which the social partnership has developed in our country.  We have had three national agreements since 1987.  The <Col N="750" /> present one, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, is coming to a close at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that we must continue to build on the consensus approach to managing the economy which has served the country so well in recent years, underpinning high levels of growth, improvements in competitiveness and, above all, substantial employment creation.  We are committed to commencing work on the followup to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and we look forward to an early dialogue with the social partners on the strategic issues which arise for all sectors of the economy in that context.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that its development of a three year multi-annual budgetary scenario will provide a fresh context for these deliberations.</P>
    <P>The deliberations with the social partners would be informed by the features of the medium-term budgetary position, including capital and current expenditure. Such deliberations would, of necessity, include discussions on the priorities of social expenditure as well as numbers and pay in the public service.</P>
    <P>It would be our objective to attain a balanced current budget in the follow up to the present programme, so as to strengthen the economy and position our society to face the new century with both optimism and flexibility.  The strengthening of our economy and the development of our society require the sound and prudent management of our public finances, the necessary modernisation of all of our public services and the efficiencies which will be brought about by the strategic management initiative.  We may only achieve that desirable goal if we ensure that the social partners can achieve a consensus on how those objectives are to be achieved.  The result, if successful, would provide us with a certainty and a security which would be invaluable.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a new agreement, then its timetable will take us past the launch of European Monetary Union <Col N="751" /> and the present phase of Structural and Cohesion Funds, right to the threshold of the 21st century and the next millennium.</P>
    <P>We need to prepare.  We need to analyse, and to propose new ways of enabling all of our people to position themselves, as individuals and as a nation, so as to ensure that we are ready to meet the challenges of the next century.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> We will only do that together if we know where we want to be.  We will only start to get there, if we begin to take small steps together.  This budget is one of those steps.  Let us take it together.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>(1) The figures for 1992, 1993 and 1994 reflect actual audited expenditure.</P>
    <P>(2) The 1996 Estimate corresponds to figures published in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure 1996.</P>
    <P>(3) To allow for comparison the 1992-94 figures have been adjusted to exclude expenditure and receipts in respect of the Air Navigation Services Office whose functions were transferred to the Irish Aviation Authority on its establishment in 1994.</P>
    <P>(4) Payments in 1996 in respect of the Exchequer's liabilities to the An Post and Telecom Éireann Pension Funds are provided for in Central Fund Services rather than in the Vote for the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications as was the case in respect of part of the 1995 liability.</P>

      <P>This budget is somewhat similar to the song &ldquo;The Teddy Bears' Picnic&rdquo;.  If you go down to the woods today you are sure of a nice surprise, particularly if you are a Democratic Left bear, or even a Labour Party bear.  I remember a day when there were little blue-beribboned Fine Gael bears who believed in the principle of rewarding people who made a contribution to Irish society&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and who believed in supporting those who were prepared to work hard.  There are not many surprises in this budget for that type of person. I concluded my budget remarks last year by telling the Minister for Finance that I hoped he would not be pulled and dragged by his partners in Government in the future.  Over the past number of months, particularly in the lead-up to this budget, we have seen a spectacle which we have never before witnessed in the history of the State.  There are supposedly three parties in Government who agreed to a programme at the outset of their term of office.  However, for several weeks it has been clear that one party in particular is running the Government.  The Minister for Social Welfare and his party have decided what should and should not be Government policy, what should be and what cannot be in the budget.</P>
      <P>It is no secret that there are ideological differences between all of the parties in this House, otherwise we would all be members of the one political party. However, notwithstanding ideological differences, there was agreement at the start of this Government's term that it would do certain things on foot of the agreed programme.  What we have seen in the past while is outrageous.  Two parties on the Left are jockeying so much for position and are so busy keeping an eye on one another that nobody is prepared to make any decision without consulting the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has been <Col N="764" /> ignored during this process.  For a number of months his press officer, I presume, and people in his Department have been using the Monday morning papers to plead with his Cabinet colleagues not to be too hard on him in the run-up to the budget.  At least 20 editions of Monday morning papers have run with some headlines definitely inspired by the Minister for Finance or by somebody on his behalf, saying that the Government cannot afford increases which will be looked for by other partners in Government.  Week after week, the opposite happens.</P>
    <P>After the last election, Labour Party gurus and people close to it had in mind the position of rotating Taoiseach for the Leader of that party.  However, I do not believe they had in mind the position of rotating Taoiseach or Tánaiste for the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, but that has effectively happened.  We have reached a situation where the Labour Party cannot be seen to oppose anything which comes from the Democratic Left.  That is why this budget was decided by a group who are in the minority and for whom the people did not vote in the last general election.</P>
    <P>A small percentage of the people voted for parties of the Left.  Some 3 per cent voted for Democratic Left, but 97 per cent did not.  It is not acceptable that such a small group should control the Government and decide economic and fiscal policy.  When the people exercise their vote at elections, they decide, in their wisdom, what party should be in Government and who should be in the Dáil.  According to the last opinion poll the Democratic Left commands the support of only 1 per cent of the electorate, yet it decides economic policy.  The two Government parties of the Left decide what will happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A few months ago the Minister for Social Welfare and recently the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment said that there was too much lobbying by business people and that they did not deserve to get any tax cuts.</P>
      <P>I have heard of a number of things which have afflicted Governments over the years and I checked with my colleagues to see if they had learned of the recent problem facing this one.  In the past few weeks we have heard of a new disease known as PBT &mdash; pre-budget tension &mdash; which was heralded in <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>

      <P>Members will know that I believe everything I read in that newspaper, which I believe is impartial. However, it believes that the Government's difficulties were due to pre-budget tension.  I checked with Deputies Bertie Ahern, Ray Burke and O'Rourke, who were in Government longer than I, but none of them could remember this phenomenon when in Government.  In the past couple of weeks the Minister for Social Welfare criticised the proposals of his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, which he said were daft.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, announced on the airwaves that the Tánaiste did not know what he was talking about.  This weekend a Labour source was quoted in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> as saying that what Deputy Rabbitte did was an outrageous intervention by a junior Minister whose ego is spinning out of control.</P>

      <P>In the same article a member of the Democratic Left said of <Col N="766" /> the Tánaiste: &ldquo;Dick is so bloody touchy, dealing with him is like walking on eggshells all the time&rdquo;.  This must be a result of pre-budget tension.  It seems the Taoiseach is not in charge of the Cabinet, but is running an asylum and needs the assistance of Dr. Anthony Clare.  It looks as if he is running a home for the bewildered rather than the Government. Perhaps the Taoiseach could ask Deputy Bhamjee to deal with these problems.</P>
      <P>Before Christmas, during the lead-up to the budget, there was much debate as regards creative accountancy by the Government when dealing with the hepatitis C fund.  Some £60 million was miraculously taken from the 1996 Estimate in 1995 and there was considerable debate about the real increase in spending by the Government in 1995 as opposed to 1994 and previous years.  I advised the Minister for Finance to spend some time looking up the terms mentioned because there was some confusion which was caused deliberately.</P>
      <P>About one month after last year's budget Dr. Garret FitzGerald said in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the increase in the net estimates, which have always been used to compare like with like since budgets were introduced, that the Minister's speech showed sleight of hand but that was not how they were now being prepared.  He said he was able to prove that was the case. I asked the Minister for Finance not to use phrases to try to confuse people. The Minister said the real increase in current supply spending for 1996 at 2.5 per cent contrasts with an annual average of about 5.5 per cent over the past five years.  That is being liberal with certain figures because Table F of the Principal Features of the Budget states it is estimated that net current supply services spending will increase by 6.2 per cent over the 1995 provisional outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year after one month's analysis by various commentators and, before Dr. FitzGerald came up with his figure of 6.8 per cent, when researching that budget I found that some good civil servant in the Department of Finance had <Col N="767" /> put down the figure of 6.8 per cent in the same place.  While public servants might advise a Minister of any Government against a particular course of action, one can be sure they will cover themselves by including the exact figure somewhere.</P>
    <P>The increase in net current supply spending in 1996 over 1995, which is the parameter used in all budgetary arithmetic since budgets were introduced, is 6.2 per cent according to the Minister's figures.  The Minister did not mention that figure in his speech, but it is there, and nobody tumbled to it except by accident at the weekend when the figure of 6.8 was given in a small table.  Someone in the Department of Finance put it in last year also.  This year's Table F in the Principal Features of the Budget is similar to last year's and, therefore, the Minister's remarks in this regard are not true.</P>
    <P>Comparing like with like, the increase in 1996 over 1995 will be 6.2 per cent in net current supply spending.  This is the barometer which has always been used because we have no control over the amount of money we will pay in the Central Fund, etc.  The gross figure for current supply spending takes into account the amount of money raised in PRSI and does not take account of appropriations-in-aid.  In my last contribution in this House before Christmas I told the Minister to stop the nonsense of trying to confuse people.  He has done so again today, and I refer people to Table F of the Principal Features of the Budget.</P>
    <P>The macro way in which this budget has been prepared is ridiculous.  In a few short years we will be facing the slowing down at least of European Structural and Community Funds coming here.  We hope to be in a position to join the economic and monetary union when our chances of being able to control our own public spending will be lessened and we will not have the flexibility of having current budget deficits and Exchequer borrowing requirements. <Col N="768" /> Also, we are at the height of the economic cycle.  Within the past 12 months, although the Irish growth figures have been outstanding given our past performances, all our competitors and major markets are experiencing a slowing down.  Whether now or later, there is a danger that by the end of this decade these three features will be affected together.  Until Deputy Bertie Ahern eliminated it at the end of 1994, current budget deficits had been a feature of the economy for nearly 25 years.  There will never be a better chance than this year of having no current budget deficit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister was able to keep the increase in current spending to just 2 per cent we would have no current budget deficit and that could be done if the Government stuck to the parameters set out in its programme of renewal.  We will pay a heavy price in the future if we do not face up to our responsibilities now.  We do not have to look across the water or anywhere else for examples of daft economic policies that do not work.  We have examples here, and we are hell-bent on doing nothing about them.  The Government cannot do anything because it is pulling in at least three different directions. I would have the height of respect for the Minister for Finance if he was allowed to do what he knows he should do.  He asked me how I would get rid of the current budget deficit this year.  The Minister should stick to his own proposals as put forward in the Programme for Government and we would not have a current budget deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is foolish to adopt the upper limits of the guidelines in the Maastricht Treaty in controlling debt, because should anything happen this year regarding economic growth, we would be outside those liberal parameters.  Has the European Commission been made aware of some of our fancy accounting footwork?  Eliminate the hepatitis C payment of £60 million which was <Col N="769" /> included in last year's accounts but not this year's and the savings of £119 million for the NTMA which was brought forward from one year to another, and that will bring the Exchequer borrowing requirement up by another £180 million. If there is any slippage we will fall outside the Exchequer borrowing requirement needs as outlined in the Maastricht Treaty, and at the end of 1997 we will be judged on those criteria.  It is, therefore, extraordinarily foolish and risky to play at the upper end of this market, particularly at times of high economic growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If over the last six years we could keep the rate of public spending to the rate of inflation we would have today in excess of £2.5 billion to spend on tax reforms, social welfare and any other changes we want to make.</P>
      <P>I note that the phrase &ldquo;tax reform&rdquo; does not appear in the Budget Statement.  It has been forgotten.  When times were tough people on both sides of this House said that if we ever managed to correct the imbalances in the public finances and had good economic growth they would do something about tax reform.  Today that is not even mentioned.  In fairness to the Minister, he did not insult the House by mentioning it, because this budget is not about tax reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked where cuts should be made.  At the end of 1994, when we had a balanced current budget deficit, I do not remember hearing an outcry from any sector of the community for increased public spending.  If the Minister for Finance and the Government cannot face up to the pressure groups, it is time they stepped aside and let somebody else do the job.  That is what happens in business organisations.  When the chief executives or board of directors cannot resist demands and face up to their responsibilities they step aside.</P>

      <P>The Minister does subscribe to the theory of getting rid of current budget deficits.  I hope I helped him over many years to come around to that way of thinking.  He agrees at least that it might be a good thing, but he does not say when it will occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No economic commentator in Ireland or elsewhere has ever subscribed to the notion of giving a stimulus to the economy at the height of the economic cycle.  We are experiencing growth rates never before experienced.  No economist has ever advocated stimulating the economy by current budget deficiting at times of high growth.  If there is an economist anywhere who subscribes to that view, let him come to Kildare Street where every adviser will tell him that this is not the thing to do.  The Minister is limiting his room to manoeuvre in the future. Future Governments and Ministers for Finance will have to impose stringent corrective measures in the future just because we cannot face up to it now.</P>
      <P>The Minister made some tax and PRSI changes, but their effect will be minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could pick any category from the table of the Principal Features.  For example, a single person taxed under PAYE on an income of £12,000, taking into account the PRSI and tax changes, as well as any other changes in this area, will have an increase in income of 1 per cent.  Looking through the table one finds that most people will have an improvement in their incomes of only 1 per cent, and that is before changes in <Col N="771" /> the prices of petrol, cigarettes and other indirect taxes.  A married couple with one earner and two children with an income of £18,000 per annum will have an increase in net income of 1.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>For weeks we have been hearing about the wonderful changes the Government will introduce to give people more incentive to work and about what this budget would do in that regard.  It has done absolutely nothing.</P>

      <P>All of the fruits of economic growth has gone into extra spending and given the extremely favourable conditions, this must be the most disappointing budget in years.  The phrase &ldquo;tax reform&rdquo; is not used and, as far as I can determine, the phrase &ldquo;tax reduction&rdquo; is not used either.</P>

      <P>The real budget was in the Book of Estimates.  Another couple of hundred million pounds has been spent today and that is where the fruits of economic growth have gone.  If the Minister had adhered to his figures for increases in public spending he would have been in a position today to allocate another couple of hundred million pounds which would have had a real impact on tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes the Minister has made regarding PRSI, income tax, etc., and having regard to the expected buoyancy <Col N="772" /> from tax revenue in 1996, will cost £12 million in one year.  That is the effect of all the tax changes taken together with the proposed increase in tax revenues. In net terms the Minister is handling back approximately half a penny in the pound which only costs him when buoyancy is taken into account.  In other words, he is foregoing approximately 1p in the pound for every £10 collected. The total tax concessions in the Minister's two budgets will have cost him the princely sum of £9 million in lost revenue out of a total of £12 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the type of nonsense that has been engaged in the past two budgets.</P>
      <P>The Minister has widened allowances and the standard rate band by a little more than the rate of inflation.  That is less than was done in the 1994 budget by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, when he increased those bands by between 7 and 8 per cent.  In gross terms, Deputy Ahern gave back approximately £200 million in tax reliefs in 1992-94 compared to approximately £100 million this year and last year under the Minister Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>We made those changes in PRSI to give the lower paid some incentive to work.  The changes the Minister made to PRSI last year and this year have resulted in such a multiplicity of PRSI rates for many businesses that they have to get new software packages on a weekly basis to work them out.  Small businesses find them too complicated to operate.  For many years our goal was to simplify the system but we have now made it so complicated, nobody can follow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept it has been the intention of Governments to provide people with an incentive but it has not worked.  We now have such a multiplicity of exemptions, different thresholds and rates that if an employer gives an employee an increase, the employee is worse off. What kind of ridiculous system have we perpetrated upon the Irish people <Col N="773" /> whereby an employee who is given an increase is actually worse off?  That is the effect of the PRSI changes and the thresholds we have introduced in this House.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister from practical experience that the effect of the changes proposed today will lead to further anomalies and complications in the PRSI system and people who get increases will have less take home pay when they reach certain thresholds.  I say to the sensible Members in the Government, particularly those who implement these changes, that we cannot continue down this road because we are making the system so complicated and non-productive that nobody can follow it.</P>
    <P>On the taxation rates, whether we like it or not, there is considerable disincentive among people who would like to take up a job but who will not do so because of the tax and PRSI rates.  In regard to small businesses, there is not any incentive for an employer to employ people and there is little incentive in our social welfare and tax system to take up the option of employment in low paid jobs.  We have compounded that problem in this and last year's budget.</P>
    <P>People make conscious economic decisions.  Those of a left wing or socialist persuasion may not like to hear this, but most people I know make economic decisions based on what is good for them.  Employers will only take on additional staff if it increases their profits. Ninety nine per cent of the employers I know do not take on extra people just to satisfy the Government or out of some sense of social good.  The main consideration is whether it will be worth it for them and if it proves too difficult they will not take on additional people.  Employees make the same economic choice, but if to choose to work is not for their betterment or is too much hassle, they will not take up employment.  That view may be surprising to people of a left wing disposition, but for those of us who live in the real world, that is what happens.</P>
    <P>A Government Minister living in a protected world tends to forget what <Col N="774" /> goes on in the real world.  People will not get up at 6.30 on a Monday morning if they do not come home on Friday night with more money in their pockets than they would get if they stayed in bed for the week.  That might be anathema to many people but it is the reality. Neither do employers take on people for the fun of it.  The employers I know only take on additional staff if they will make an extra few pounds as a result.  If we face up to that reality we will be far better off as a society, politicians will respond more favourably to problems and media commentators will write about them more realistically.</P>
    <P>My party has proposed an introductory tax rate of 20 per cent for the first £1,500 of taxable income for a single person and £3,000 for a married couple. We also propose that no employee earning a marginal income should pay tax or PRSI at a rate greater than 50 per cent because, in the real world, people who earn extra money but have more than 50 per cent of it taken in taxation will not bother working unless they have to. If people are reasonably well off and have a choice on whether to do more work, but can do without the hassle, the employee will not choose to do overtime or the employer to take on more staff if more than 50 per cent of the reward is taken in tax.  That is the reality of today's tax and PRSI system and that is why we have proposed that the top rate of tax, with employee's PRSI, should not exceed 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I term levies, services charges and residential property tax as &ldquo;excuse me tax&rdquo;.  I know that tax was beloved by the Labour Party in the 1980s but in 1992 the Labour Party was elected on the backs of the middle classes who may not love residential property tax.  I am surprised it has not been abolished because in effect it is only an &ldquo;excuse me tax&rdquo;. Levies such as the youth, employment and health levies as well as service charges upset a great many people. People feel that if they are to pay tax, it should be taken out of their wages or in a lump sum if they are self-employed. <Col N="775" /> Our goal is to get rid of what I term &ldquo;excuse me taxes&rdquo; and have a proper system of taxation without in-built anomalies.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, the champion of the poor, has made great play of increases in social welfare in the past number of weeks.  The allowance for those over 80 has been increased to £5 from £4.80, a total of 20p for which I am sure they will be delighted.  All the increases are listed in the Principal Features of the Budget but it would be far better if the Minister were to target a few groups.  I thought that the Minister would follow on from the logical step of targeting child benefit by channelling resources to areas which would have a real effect on the poor. Instead, there has been a return to the belief of looking after everybody.  I believe society has a duty to look after the sick and the old and those who are not able to fend for themselves, but society should not actively encourage able bodied men and women to stay out of the employment force.  These young able bodied men and women could take low paid jobs but do not think it worth their while to do so because of the tax and social welfare system.  I do not believe a system which is such a disincentive. My party believes in looking after the old and the sick and in allocating enough money to combat crime so that people can live in their homes without fear.</P>
    <P>We do not believe in the ridiculous anomalies in the tax and social welfare system that allow able-bodied men in their 20s who prefer to lounge in bars to live off the rest of us when there is plenty of work to be done.  I make no apologies for saying that, even though it may not be politically correct, it is the truth.  The people at work believe that to be the case.  In last year's budget the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, excelled himself by giving a 2.5 per cent increase, this year he has given a 3 per cent increase to impress the old and the sick but I do not think it will wash with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> I read in the past few weeks that the Government has put off a decision to increase the TV licence fee but that will be announced later.  The increase in ESB charges was not announced on budget day.</P>
    <P>There are 286,000 people unemployed, of whom 134,000 are long-term unemployed and out of work for more than one year.  Of that figure, 68,000 have been out of work for more than three years and 37,000 have been unemployed for more than five years.  There has been spurious arguments on the merits of the labour force survey over the live register statistics.  The live register, at least counts the numbers of those who sign on every week.  As a matter of interest the labour force survey shows that 80,000 are long-term unemployed whereas the live register shows that only 68,000 are long-term unemployed.  It is ridiculous to give more credence to the statistics from a survey than from the numbers signing on every week.  If there was the political will to have exact statistics on the number of long-term unemployed, it could be done.  Millions of pounds have been spent on computerising the Department of Social Welfare, its computer system and that of the Revenue Commissioners is as good as anywhere in the world and the best in Europe.  By universal use of the RSI number and the click of a few buttons it is possible to categorise people signing on.  As a former Minister for Social Welfare, I know this can be done if one wants to.</P>
    <P>Last week the deputy leader of my party, Deputy O'Rourke and I launched our proposals to tackle long-term unemployment. We accept that every party has done its best to tackle this problem but with limited success.  No party has had outstanding success in this area. Will the Minister sincerely consider our proposals?  We believe that the employee must make a conscious decision to enter employment and should be targeted by giving him or her an additional tax free allowance.  In addition the employer should have an incentive, all things being equal, to <Col N="777" /> choose a person from the long-term unemployed by getting a double allowance for taking on that person.  We believe this system is less open to abuse, will work well and deliberately target the long-term unemployed.  Nobody has a panacea for this problem but our proposal is worthwhile and should be considered.</P>
    <P>A considerable number would take up employment if they were not disadvantaged by so doing.  During the past number of years we have endeavoured to tackle this problem by allowing people to retain their medical cards and secondary benefits for a period.  The certain way to achieve this is by reducing taxation and PRSI and then people will have a real incentive to work.  A percentage of the long-term unemployed should probably be on disability allowance but we do not have such a system.  A number of those classified as long-term unemployed are not capable of working and I suggest it may be up to one third of the number.  They have to be looked after but it would be more appropriate if they were to receive disability allowance.  We should simplify the rules and regulations governing allowances because confusion over allowances creates problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some changes in corporation tax as applied to companies earning less than £50,000 profit.  Last week we proposed that the figures should be of the order of £100,000 but the Minister has gone some way down this road and I welcome that.  It is estimated that approximately 150,000 people operate small businesses.  Unemployment would be wiped out if small business were in a position to take on two additional people.  I make the point to those of a left wing socialist persuasion that small business people are not sharks; they are not living off the system.  They are doing their best, working hard and do not like it when politicians make little of their contribution. It is only through the efforts of people who create real wealth, that others, such as those in the public service and politicians, can be paid.  They provide the <Col N="778" /> money for social welfare and education. They are creating employment, but some commentators and many politicians belittle them at every turn.  They are the real wealth creators to whom incentives should be given.</P>
    <P>On the sterling crisis, officially, Irish growth rates are most impressive but there are two economies within those figures.  The multinational economy is export led and provides the reason for the increase in the growth rate figures. The other economy involves indigenous firms which are experiencing much lower levels of growth.  Many are in severe difficulty due to the increase in the strength of the pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling. Our dependence on the British market has decreased over the years but it will always be our main market and approximately 50,000 jobs are at risk due to the depreciation of the pound.</P>
    <P>The ingenious solution to this problem identified by the then Government may have encountered some difficulties in the interim with the EU Commission, however, I am sure another ingenious solution could have been found if the Minister is afraid to offend our European partners.  The firms facing pressures as a result of the depreciation of the pound against sterling were identified the last time this occurred.  A body of information exists which can be used for the type of industries which are most vulnerable and consideration could be given to lowering the employers' rate of PRSI for those firms.  This would not contravene any European directive.  If the pound continues to depreciate against sterling, many people in the Irish economy will go out of business. They will end up on the dole queues, their jobs lost forever.</P>
    <P>In the past we heard much from members of the Government about openness, transparency and accountability. The Minister outlined his new process of dealing with pre-budget submissions, but it is in total contradiction to his well rehearsed phrase of openness, transparency and accountability. This is the first year the select committee, of which I am a member, has been <Col N="779" /> in operation and it did good work. It intends to take pre-budget submissions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When one is a Minister, the useful aspect of meeting lobby groups is that one hears about what happens in the real world.  Notwithstanding the good advice one receives from professional civil servants, lobby groups highlight what is really happening. A journalist writing an article on this matter contacted me recently and I told him that when I was in Government I changed my mind totally about lobby and pressure groups and that a Minister who brought a good idea into effect probably heard it from a lobby group at some stage.</P>
      <P>One cannot accommodate about 90 per cent of the matters about which one is lobbied and a fair percentage of them are nonsensical in the first place. However, most of the gems of good administration and proposals in recent years resulted from pressure groups meeting Ministers.  If the proposal regarding pre-budget hearings is implemented, the Minister and the Government will lose out.  It would be easier for the Minister and departmental officials if they did not have to arrange a long series of meetings in that regard.  The Minister said he will not attend the pre budget hearings at the committee.  I ask him to reconsider his proposal and not to go ahead with it. The committee will hear the submissions but the Minister will lose out.</P>

      <P>I am not impressed if that is his idea of openness, transparency and accountability.  It makes a joke of the whole matter.  I mention the example of Democratic Left because the House has gone to ridiculous and nonsensical lengths with regard to the goddess &ldquo;OTA&rdquo;.  We should consider the lessons of the past year.  This policy was put forward by the Labour Party and served it well in the last general election.  It was followed up incessantly by people in the media, who love it. However, it is nonsensical.  The example in recent weeks regarding the award of a contract in the Department of Equality and Law Reform bears out that point.</P>
      <P>The Department of Equality and Law Reform gave the contract to a certain firm, which was probably the best or at least equal to others on the day. However, the Labour Party, in subscribing to the theory that all things are equal, gave it to one of its own.</P>

      <P>The Minister should have told the House his party gave it to one of its own, because it could communicate with them, knew their thinking and so on.  The Irish people would have understood it, although <i>The Irish Times</i> will not understand it or anything else.  It would have been the truth.  All the humbug and nonsense should be cut out.  It does not fool anybody.  It should apologise to the Dáil for the little lie told in the summer because the contract had already been awarded.  However, it continues this nonsense that the right questions were not asked.  It should admit it was a little fib and get on with business.  It would be more honest than continuing this nonsense of which people are sick and I am heartily tired.</P>
      <P>Last year, the first person to suffer from the OTA policy was Deputy Phil Hogan who sent documents to the Fine Gael headquarters.  He was not leaking information every day to journalists in the run up to that budget.  None of those people was sacked but Deputy Hogan lost his job to offer up another person at this high altar.  A few weeks later Deputy Hugh Coveney was demoted to Minister of State as a result of the same nonsense.  It did not impress anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We make political points on that issue with some grave doubts.  As this side is well aware, the impression is that anything hooky only happens when Fianna Fáil is in power.  The impression given is that we are well known muck savages who cannot be trusted with anything. However, ordinary people do not believe that.  The recent book by the former Government Press Secretary puts across that point well in a few quotes.  I <Col N="782" /> appeal to the Government to cut out the nonsense.</P>
    <P>I wonder what our founding fathers &mdash; de Valera, Collins, W. T. Cosgrave, Griffith, Lemass and O'Higgins &mdash; might say about our budgets and the system we have put in place?  We have so complicated our affairs that when we get a pay rise we are worse off than we were; we are better off staying at home than going out to work; there is a faculty in one of the Dublin universities to explain our complicated social welfare system; we have rules, regulations, schemes, etc; and a National Treasury Management Agency that can bring savings forward.  If such leaders could see what we created, they would say what they did was not worth it.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House has good intentions but we cannot see the wood for the trees.  Turnover tax at 5 per cent and wholesale tax at 10 per cent were replaced by VAT.  We brought in VAT rates of 5.26 per cent and 16.37 per cent and increased it by 10 per cent one year to 19.37 per cent.  A query was then raised as to why we had a 15 per cent rate.  That is the kind of system we have today.  If our founding fathers saw the mess we have made, not through malfeasance but through stupidity, they would not be impressed.  We need a new vision of Irish life and a &ldquo;can do&rdquo; philosophy.</P>
    <P>Those who have been in Government know about Government memoranda which are sent to Departments for observations.  That is a clear recipe not to do anything because by the time the memorandum comes back the person who had an idea has forgotten what it was and what it was intended to do.  It is usually sent to a committee where it is further changed and a task force may be set up.</P>
    <P>We are hung up on openess, transparency and accountability.  We continually analyse everything, forget what the original idea was and end up with a nonsensical proposal.  It is time politicians were not afraid to make mistakes.  There is only one safe mechanism to ensure mistakes are not made in taking policy <Col N="783" /> decisions and that is not to make any decision on anything.</P>
    <P>Let us have a philosophy of creating wealth and encouraging people.  Let us not be afraid to take decisions and make mistakes.  Let us have an uncomplicated social welfare system as was originally intended.  To hell with the begrudgers and opinion makers who write long, boring articles about openness, transparency and accountability, the reasons we cannot do things and why this and that would be a good or bad idea.  Let us have a simple philosophy where we would encourage people to work and take chances.  We will make mistakes and bad policy decisions.  Seán Lemass made many bad decisions but he also made hundreds of good ones which he would not have made had he not made the bad ones.  Let us get rid of our fear and do something for ourselves.  If we do not, we will submerge the country in layers of bureaucracy and form filling. We have taken away from people the incentive to take chances.  Let the next Government decide it will take risks and make mistakes.  If it does not, it will not tackle the problem of long-term unemployment, more people will be unemployed and society will not be healthy.</P>
    <P>This budget fails on all counts.  That is not surprising as the Minister was pulled in every direction by his partners. This failed ideology, beloved of some socialists, will fail here as it has everywhere else.  It is time for us as politicians to get on with the job.  The sooner the people are given a real choice in the next election the better.</P>

      <P>We should begin by apologising to Deputy Hogan for having created a fuss last year which led to his departure from office.  When I read page 14 of <i>The Irish Times</i> today where not only were the contents of the budget set out but also the chapter headings and the structure of the Minister's speech, I realised we live in a very strange world where the Department of Finance leaks in advance, through I presume, its Minister, the entire Budget <Col N="784" /> Statement to a highly respected journalist. It makes one wonder if there is any sense of occasion on budget day.  Those who think there is not and that it is an anticlimax should not be deluded.

      <P>I am interested in what the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, said in 1994 in the context of the tax leaks which took place then: &ldquo;This Government is the only vessel I know of that leaks from the top.&rdquo;  It is strange that he is in a Government that is so riven with leaks that on Monday mornings it debates Cabinet matters on the front pages of newspapers, on Tuesdays the Government parties complain about each other to the media and they reprimand each other on Wednesdays.</P>

      <P>Although Deputy Rabbitte is a junior Minister he occupies a high chair slightly removed from the Cabinet table.  We must ask what all this division betokens.  It is very clear, as this budget proves, that the Government is completely divided on basic economic strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from last Sunday's newspapers that a financial journalist is being interviewed by detectives regarding other Department of Finance material.  I presume we will not have the same regarding the structure of the Minister's speech in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  The story stated that there were 12 investigations in hand involving detectives from Garda Headquarters trying to determine where the leaks originated. They are coming from Ministers and programme managers.  It is about time these detectives were told to deal with <Col N="785" /> crime and real work instead of acting as the pawns of cynical Ministers who pretend they abide by convention as far as secrecy is concerned while they give the entire Budget Statement and its structure to be set out in the financial page of <i>The Irish Times.</i> It is time to face reality.</P>
    <P>Public spending has increased in terms of current supply service net expenditure by over 6 per cent.  That is a far cry from the figure of 2 per cent the electorate were told about.  Taxation and expenditure are set to increase significantly next year.  The Government is not willing to admit that but will use any formulation of figures to deny the truth and persuade people that the post inflation increase is of the order of just over 2 per cent when we know the net increase in supply service expenditure for this year is well over 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the changes the Minister has made in the tax and PRSI system.  He has exchanged some PRSI breaks for an abolition of the PRSI allowance.  I want everyone in this House to realise what is involved.  The change in tax allowances of £150 for a single worker on the 27 per cent rate is worth 41p per week.  The change in the 27 per cent band is worth just over £1 per week.  Because the Minister scrapped the PRSI allowance and substituted for it a PRSI break on income up to £80, a single man or woman must pay the top rate of tax at earnings of £247 per week, £30 less than the average industrial wage.  That is the radical change the Labour Party and Democratic Left have achieved.  Before this budget a person had to earn £237 per week before paying the top rate of tax. This budget moves the goal posts between paying 27 per cent tax and 48 per cent tax by an infinitesimal amount which is well below the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has always stated that he is interested in widening the 27 per cent tax band.  He is not interested in the tax rates and he is mistaken in terms of his analysis of tax rates.  The £500 increase in the tax band for a single person is only double that required by <Col N="786" /> inflation &mdash; the figure would have to be £230 or £240 to satisfy inflation &mdash; and the difference for an employee in those circumstances is roughly £1 per week. As will be seen from the Principal Features of the budget, ordinary people are expected to fall down in admiration for this radical, pro-jobs budget when they find they are better off to the tune of 1 per cent.  Some people are better off by only 0.6 per cent and some by 2 per cent, but the average is between 1 and 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>A man with a wife and four children, earning £18,000, which is above the average industrial wage, will gain by £155 per year from this budget. However, as is provided in sections 6 and 7 of the Finance Act, 1994, mortgage and VHI relief are reduced by a half in one case and a quarter in the other.  For many people there will be no improvement whatsoever from the budget.  By the time they pay the extra money for cigarettes, petrol and their ATM card, taking into account all the clawbacks of tax and the loss on mortgage and VHI relief, they will find they are no better off.  The Minister must face up to the fact that because of political pressures the Government has totally failed to put in place a strategy which the ordinary people can understand. What is the point in giving PRSI breaks when in the same breath the PRSI allowance is taken away?  What is the point in moving money from one pocket to another when in the last analysis there is very little improvement for the ordinary worker?</P>
    <P>In this budget the Government has completely given up on the process of tax reform.  Since Labour came to office in 1993 the only changes of significance in our tax system have been the following. A 1 per cent income levy was imposed for one year but was abolished after pressure from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Government attempted to widen the residential property tax but took fright at the political consequences and reversed that decision.  That is the total tax reform under the Labour Party.  In the last <Col N="787" /> three years during which the Labour Party has been in office the process of tax reform has juddered to a halt. Today's budget is not a tax reforming budget but a PRSI tinkering budget which will have very little effect on what ordinary people will do.</P>
    <P>Is there a single person in this House who believes that the effect of scrapping the PRSI tax allowance and increasing the amount of income exempt from PRSI will encourage more than a handful of people to change the decisions which govern their lives?  Where is the analysis of the interplay between the social welfare system and the taxation system?  Where is the analysis and the strategy that deal with the fact that people earning £247, well below the average industrial wage, are faced with a 57 per cent rate of tax on all their extra earnings?  Why does the Minister, Deputy Quinn, demand 57p out of every pound earned by a single man or woman earning below the average industrial wage?  Why does our tax system extract that much money from people earning below the average industrial wage?  The simple answer is that political decisions have brought us to this pass.</P>
    <P>In 1973 when the first of the recent Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Governments came to office 1.8 per cent of taxpayers were taxed above the standard rate.  More than 98 taxpayers in 100 were taxed at the standard rate and did not pay surtax.  By the time the second Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government left office in 1987 the proportion paying above the standard rate had increased to 43 per cent.  Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; I blame both parties equally for this &mdash; increased taxation to the point where almost one in two people paid super tax rates.  Fine Gael and Labour in Government are the parties who brought super tax to the masses.  When they initially came to office less than 2 per cent of taxpayers paid above the standard rate of tax and in a short period of time almost 50 per cent paid above the standard rate.  Not satisfied <Col N="788" /> with that &mdash; it is not as if this was a Government of financial stringency &mdash; in its second period of office, from 1982 to 1987, that Government doubled the national debt.</P>
    <P>These parties stumbled into office by a set of unforeseeable political circumstances at a time when the fundamentals of the Irish economy were in a dramatically improved condition.  They not only have an opportunity to transform the country between now and 1999 or 2000 but they have an imperative to do so.  When the Euro funds begin to scale down at the end of this century this country will be in a very different position.  In the context of European expansion the Common Agricultural Policy will not be the source of huge transfers to the Irish economy that it was in the past.  In that context there is an imperative to change the way the country works, to make it a country where working is worthwhile.  What did this Government do when it had an opening surplus in its accounts?  It produced a budget where the difference between the 27 per cent rate and the 48 per cent rate for single workers earning well below the average industrial wage is changed by £10, from £237 per week to £247 per week.  That is the extent of radicalism in this budget.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was in the first flush of enthusiasm in his initial budget that last year the Minister for Finance began his Budget Statement by saying that the budget he was about to deliver was radical.  At the end of his statement &mdash; it is worthwhile noting his exact words &mdash; he said: &ldquo;This budget is but one small step in that direction&rdquo;.  Therefore, having read through his script, he had convinced himself he was not a radical.</P>
    <P>The same applies today.  We were told at the end of the Budget Statement that this is but one small step in the process of bringing Ireland in the right direction. The time is over for small, faltering, ideological motivated, tottering steps.  The time is ripe for a Government which has the appetite, sense of direction, coherence and strategy to put in <Col N="789" /> place a plan for the period between 1997 and 2001, the term of the next Government.</P>
    <P>This Government has a neck to talk about three year budgetary plans.  Of course we need three year budgetary plans; of course we need a Government and a country not managed on a hand-to-mouth basis whereby nobody looks at the medium or longer term but this Government has not demonstrated any strategy.  The Labour Party has not demonstrated a willingness to change the climate for work here.  Many employers find their biggest competitor is not necessarily a British manufacturer but the Minister for Social Welfare.  In a survey published today 22 per cent of manufacturing employers indicate they find it difficult to recruit people because of our tax and welfare laws.  One might think that a party devoted to the interests of Labour or Democratic Left &mdash; supposed to be a socialist party &mdash; would have been prepared to insist that something radical was done to improve the climate for work in our economy, rendering work a value we hold in high esteem.  After three years of Labour Party participation in Government the only answer the electorate can glean from what is now taking place is that there is no appetite for change on the part of this Government.</P>
    <P>I come then to the Fine Gael Party. In the 1994 budget debate the present Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, said: &ldquo;The Labour Party in Government always means higher spending and higher taxes.</P>
    <P>It is strange to note that the Fine Gael Party has not changed its thinking since. I read in a newspaper on Sunday last that one of the 47 Fine Gael Deputies in this House said:</P>
    <P>We are enjoying the perks of office but the Labour Party and, in particular, Democratic Left, are enjoying power.  Our Ministers are making no impact because the important portfolios are held by the Left.  Our Ministers carry out reviews.  Nora Owen is reviewing the prison system, Michael <Col N="790" /> Noonan is reviewing health care and Richard Bruton employment policy. Meanwhile Democratic Left and Labour Ministers are spending the money.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Connor, who represents Longford-Roscommon, was reported as having said:</P>
    <P>In the last budget it was all concentrated on the lower paid.  I think that middle income people would like to get some relief too.  I would like to see the 27 per cent rate going down to 20 per cent and the 48 per cent rate going down to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley said that the rate of personal taxation in this country is far too high and acting as a disincentive to employment or improving your job.  He too called for reductions in the 27 and 48 per cent taxation rates.</P>
    <P>Why does nobody listen to Fine Gael Deputies?  Whenever the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, says something there is a hullabaloo about it; whenever the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, or one of his advisers, Mr. Fergus Finlay, says something everyone snaps to attention?  Why, when Fine Gael Deputies &mdash; based on what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry said on one occasion &mdash; know that the Labour Party in office means high spending and high taxation, and do not like it, they cannot do anything about it?</P>
    <P>Where in the Budget Statement is there one policy initiative which could be laid at the door of Fine Gael?  Where is there one input by Fine Gael to this disastrous budget?  Nowhere.  Indeed it reminds me of the Light Brigade at Balaclava.  We are now in the position that the Fine Gael Party is merely required to maintain this battle to remain in office despite any damage it may have to suffer: &ldquo;Theirs not to reason why; theirs but to do and die; boldly they rode to die, the gallant half hundred&rdquo;.  Where is this Light Brigade? Why is it that we only read about them in the newspapers?  Why is it they have <Col N="791" /> no influence on the manner in which this Government is run?  The answer is that effectively they are captives, political hostages of the Left.  As if that were not bad enough, the Left itself seems to have been taken hostage by Democratic Left, which represents a tiny fraction in terms of overall political outlook in support of our electorate.</P>
    <P>We are in a most extraordinary position &mdash; facing into what must be an election year, with three parties in Government who have no mandate, and know it.  If opinion polls are to be believed, those three parties between them have approximately 30 to 35 per cent support nationwide.  They know they cannot win the next election and none of them even thinks there is a chance they will be reelected. They are holding on grimly to office, fearing the consequences of losing it far more than they fear damaging their credibility with the electorate.</P>
    <P>The Government talks about reforming the way this country is run, about making plans and producing a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> but, in every single respect, it has run out of steam, burned out its boiler and has no steam left with which to operate; it is dead on its feet.  In the most auspicious circumstances in which any Government has come to this House it came here today, offering the electorate nothing but confusion, dissent and lack of leadership; that is what we had today, no coherent strategy.</P>
    <P>Since so little has been done in this budget perhaps we should consider what should have been done.  If the Government had seriously contained the growth in public spending this country would be in a position to embark on a programme of fiscal transformation in relation to taxation, public spending and borrowing.  Today should have been the occasion on which medium-term targets were established even though the Government has run out of steam.  If the Government had set some medium-term targets it could have led to circumstances in which the electorate could <Col N="792" /> learn to live, in terms of what their Government spends next year, on more or less what it will spend this year.  If we had begun to approach our economics from that perspective the road to greatly reduced tax on work, greatly increased productivity, greatly reduced borrowing and repaying some of our national debt within three to five years would be open to us.</P>
    <P>The fact is that choices have been made which have brought us to the present juncture.  It is not an accident that the national debt doubled between the years 1982 and 1987.  That occurred because the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs made <i>pronunciamentos</i> from the hospital bed that there were to be no cutbacks in public spending and Fine Gael capitulated.  That doubling of the national debt to £10 billion costs £700 million annually on an open ended mortgage.  If we had contained the public sector pay bill, not by way of a freeze, but by allowing it to increase at the same rate as the wages of average industrial workers since 1989, another £700 million would be available to cut taxation. Of those two sets of political decisions, one was embodied in a Government which would not face up to its borrowing problems and had to hand over the country in a shambles to its successors, and another arose from three successive pay deals negotiated by a Government intent on driving up gross wages while doing nothing about the taxation system.  Had those decisions not been taken our position would be radically different.</P>
    <P>It is time to implement a plan for our economy which would start off on the basis that we must contain public spending and tackle taxation and that a Government should not enter the Estimates campaign with all its players attempting to prove their macho political prowess by maximising the amount of money Departments get but rather all members of a Government should operate on the basis that the more it can save taxpayers, the better this country will be.  That is a radically different approach from the one being followed <Col N="793" /> by this Government and it is the only one that will effect the necessary transformation of our economic fortunes if we are to survive in a post-EMU Europe.</P>

      <P>At present Ireland seems to comply with economic monetary union convergence criteria, but if we join the economic monetary union in the year 2000 or 2001 without having transformed our system of taxation on enterprise and employment and as a high spending and high taxation economy, at the very best we will survive as the sick man of the union, will limp as economic cripples into a system and thereafter be dependent on the charity of the other larger players in Europe.  If this country has the sense at the next general election &mdash; and the sooner it comes the better &mdash; to elect a Government which would be determined to face up to the question of public spending, to radically transform our taxation system and to face up to a regime where it does not borrow money annually to keep the show on the road as is being done in this budget, I am confident this country could prosper within the economic monetary union and not merely survive but begin to create in Ireland a society in which there would be sufficient enterprise and incentive for people to work and earn a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on remarks made in public recently about what is involved in tax reform.  Some people on the Left seem to think that tax reform and tax reduction amounts to the politics of selfishness. They seem to believe that high expenditure and high taxation are good and low taxation and disciplined expenditure are bad, selfish and redolent of Thatcherism.  I am talking about social justice, people earning below the average industrial wage, men and women in Coolock and Ringsend from whom more than half of every extra penny they earn is taken by the State.  Those <Col N="794" /> people are looking to this House to do something on tax reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hypocrisy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; in society or the people who are driving a process of political change in pursuit of selfish goals.  They merely want to live in a society where they would get more than Minister Quinn if they work harder.  That is a reasonable and not a very ambitious sentiment.  I suggest that TDs from left wing parties who suggest that to transform the system to give people back more than half what they earn, especially those earning below the average industrial wage, is pandering to the rich and to the selfish in our society do not know what makes people tick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>TDs who talk about a society in which low taxation is sought in order to encourage work and describe it as Thatcherite and obnoxious do not realise that the real answers to Ireland's unemployment problem do not lie in make-work elastoplast economics such as we have seen proposed today.  The idea that £80 a week may be given to certain employers to take certain people off the dole and put them at the work bench beside other people ignores the fact that such subsidisation will result in one employee in that factory being taxed at the crippling rate to which I referred.  What is the ultimate end of that process?  It is the displacement of employment from those who are highly taxed to those who are subsidised.  How long do Members think that an £80 weekly subsidy will be maintained? How many previous schemes which sought to encourage employers to take on the long-term unemployed by means of a wages subsidy survived more than 18 months?  How many had significant uptakes?  How many made a significant dent in the dole queue?  Practically none.  All those work trials and different modes of massaging the live register proposed by the Government with an increasing sense of urgency which is welcome are nothing compared to one <Col N="795" /> basic duty of Government, to create a society which encourages everyone to work hard.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report which was widely based and generally accepted identified one element as the most important contribution a Government could make to employment, reform of our taxation and PRSI system.  That report recommended such reform but since it has been put on the shelf beside the report of the Commission on Taxation and various others nothing has been done to implement that basic message that the Government's biggest contribution to the employment prospects in this country is to stop taxing employment as if it were a luxury.  Has that happened in today's budget?  Is there anything in it which indicates that the Government realises that taxation on work is a real problem? There is one message of hope.  It is beginning to see that PRSI operates as a disincentive; it is a regressive tax on employment.  That message is beginning to sink in, but the Government has merely shifted the burden of PRSI from the lower paid to the top of the structure. The bands for employer's and employee's PRSI payments have increased by £1,000 from £21,000 to £22,000.  It has shifted the burden of taxation but has never considered reducing it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McCreevy said, the global totals from taxation anticipated for next year have not changed much as a result of this budget.  In circumstances of unprecedented economic growth this society seems incapable of addressing the taxation issue.  If it is Labour Party policy to claim that it needs more of every extra tenner earned by a single man or a single woman earning £247 per week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad that at least two parties in this House are committed to the repeal of residential property tax.  I am particularly glad that it will happen as a consequence of the next general election.  That tax must go. The efforts of the Labour Party to widen it in 1994 resulted in an ignominious U-turn in that it reduced its band and scope in 1995.  I am sorry if its enthusiasm for that tax will be ignored by the Irish people.  It is worthwhile putting on record what was the Labour Party's real agenda on house property taxation. I wish to refer to a 1988 document which bears the picture of a red rose and the signature of Labour Party Leader, Deputy Spring.  It stated:</P>
      <P>A house property tax will be instituted calculated on the market value of the house less the first £25,000.  Therefore, all house property up to a value of £25,000 will be exempt from tax.  There will be an annual tax of 2 per cent on the value of property between £25,000 and £100,000 and 3 per cent on the excess over £100,000.  Examples of the tax are shown below.</P>
      <P>Members will be glad to know that on a house worth £120,000 the Labour Party was proposing that the annual RPT payable would be £2,100.</P>

Those in the House who favour the abolition of RPT will get public opinion behind them in their campaign and this tax will be swept aside.  I am amused to see that members of the Labour Party are already preparing to ditch their RPT policy by saying it can be the subject matter of a review.  I would like to see that review take place and I am glad the Labour Party is now prepared to see the light on this subject.  It will only see the light if public opinion forces it to face up to the realities.</P>
      <P>This is the second budget by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and it was supposed to be the occasion on which he could put his stamp on the policies implemented by his Department. His last budget was delivered shortly after his accession to the office of Minister for Finance.  One would imagine that having had 13 or 14 months in which to acclimatise himself and to face up to the problems confronting that Department he would come to us with a set of proposals that would begin to transform this country's economic prospects.  It would be charitable to describe today's budget as a damp squib.  It is wringing wet.  We came into this House to see a budget delivered. Most Members have left utterly demoralised because they realise that a Government which is only intent on remaining in office has fumbled, in a way which Deputy Spring, looking back on his rugby career, would understand, the greatest opportunity to score a try.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two serious sins in Irish politics: one is to criticise Deputy Spring and the other is to make a criticism of Mr. Fergus Finlay, his adviser.  One is much more serious than the other but I will not say which.  We have now fumbled the greatest opportunity we <Col N="798" /> have had in recent years to set a new course in taxation policy.  The Government has examined the problems of taxation policy and has said the real issue lies with PRSI.  Instead of looking at the healthy position of the Exchequer, it has thought up a number of ways, to a value of £80 million, to spend more money on a series of schemes designed to help the long-term unemployed.  The long-term unemployed, the short-term unemployed and the children attending school and college need a break but the big break they need is from an anti-work tax system.  This was the opportunity for this country to face up to that fact but it has been totally squandered. Effectively we are now marking time. Doubtless the budget aggregates will be good next year as well.  There is no reason, apart from entirely political and electoral ones, to expect there would be any difference in approach if this Government were to linger on to the next budget or that it would do any better next time.</P>

If this is the best the Government can do then God help us if there is a downturn in international economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>This is not an occasion on which this country is dividing between right and left.  The left in any society is supposed to be on the side of working people, not taxing them with super tax as though they were millionaires.  This is an occasion on which common sense lies in radical tax reform because something is radically wrong with our economy and something radical needs to be done to put it right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need gimmicks.  This is an occasion on which a strategic approach is necessary.  The Government, given every opportunity, ought to have given the country leadership. This was an occasion on which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, backed by his Government, ought to have set out a strategy which the average person could understand on where our tax system was going.  The people looked to this House for some sense of leadership, hope, guidance, planning and strategy.  In return they get absolutely nothing, a collection of half thought-out schemes, work trials.  What are they?  Nobody reading the speech knows what the Minister is talking about.</P>
      <P>The budget is a collection of half thought-out, half-baked subsidies and elastoplast economics which are no substitute for real politics.  I would not mind if I could discern any coherent strategy in the budget, even if I thought it was misguided, or if some plan was being followed.  I have come to the conclusion, having listened to the Budget Statement, that any Government that can scrap the PRSI allowance for tax and at the same time give a PRSI break and claw back even the reliefs being offered by measures designed to tweak and to fine tune a system that is not working does not deserve to continue in office. If this budget was an opportunity for radical change it has been lost.  The Progressive Democrats has published a document on a different way in which to approach the economics of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way in which the Labour Party in Government has operated since 1993 has been disastrous.  The Labour Party &mdash; not the Opposition &mdash; has increased the dole queue.  According to this document the dole queue was supposed to be going down to 265,000, but it is ending up at 283,000.  What does Labour do?  It comes to this House and says the live register is no longer a reliable indicator of unemployment.  The live register consists of real people, queuing at real hatches to receive real money every <Col N="800" /> week.  There is nothing unreal about that.  If there are people who ought not to be on the live register collecting their money then I have yet to hear one of the left wing Ministers tell us why that is the case.  The references in the labour force surveys to an increase in employment reflect a fragmentation of jobs into part-time jobs.  This explains why there is such a divergence between the live register and the labour force surveys.  If that is the case the budget has done nothing to address the problem.</P>
    <P>This budget will go down in political history as the worst by far.  Nobody will be satisfied with it tomorrow.  A few benighted ideologues in the media may see something in it for them but the great majority of ordinary people will see through it and release that on the occasion when most was possible least was done.  In fiscal terms, the Minister for Finance and his colleagues have snatched political defeat from the jaws of victory.  They have written their epitaph as a Government which cannot lay any claim to economic competence and have sealed their fate in the next election, whenever that takes place.  From today on we will see a rapid political and economic decline in the fortunes of the Government.  I hope this happens because the sooner the better the public has an opportunity to set the Government aside and to put in its place one which has a coherent view of what it wants to do with the economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Resolution No. 1 provides for excise duty increases on tobacco products from midnight tonight which, when VAT is included, amount to 10p on a packet of 20 cigarettes with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products.  The Resolution will give effect to these increases.  It is expected that they will yield £21.3 million in 1996 and £25.2 million in a full year.  The increase in the consumer price index will be 0.14 per cent.  It is expected that the 10p increase on a packet of cigarettes will lead to a reduction in cigarette consumption by about 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 2:</P>
      <P>(1) That in this Resolution&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Act of 1994&rdquo; means the Finance Act, 1994 (No. 13 of 1994);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Order of 1975&rdquo; means the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975).</P>
      <P>(2) That the duty of excise on mineral hydrocarbon light oil imposed by paragraph 11 (1) of the Order of 1975, shall, in lieu of the rate specified in section 84 (1) of the Act of 1994, be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 24th day of January, 1996, at the rate of £307.65 per 1,000 litres.</P>
      <P>(3) That for the purposes of the rebate of duty on mineral hydrocarbon light oil provided for in section 56 (3) of the Finance Act, 1988 (No. 12 of 1988), section 89 of the Finance Act, 1990 (No. 10 of 1990), shall apply as on and from the 24th day of January, 1996, as if the reference therein to section 40 (1) of the Finance Act, 1989 (No. 10 of 1989), which, by virtue of section 84 (2) of the Act of 1994, is construed as a reference to section 84 (1) of the Act of 1994, were instead a reference to paragraph (2) of this Resolution.</P>
      <P>(4) That the duty of excise on hydrocarbon oil imposed by paragraph 12 (1) of the Order of 1975, shall, in lieu of the rate specified in section 84 (3) of the Finance Act, 1994, be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 24th day of January, 1996, at the rate of £243.75 per 1,000 litres.</P>
      <P>(5) That the duty of excise on substitute motor fuel imposed by section 116 (2) of the Finance Act, 1995 (No. 8 of 1995), shall, in lieu of the rate specified in the said section 116 (2), be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 24th day of January, 1996, at the rate of £243.75 per 1,000 litres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6) It is hereby declared that it is <Col N="805" /> expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution provides for an excise duty increase on petrol, including unleaded, which, when VAT is included, amounts to 1p on a litre or 4.5p on a gallon, and an excise duty increase on auto diesel which, when VAT is included, amounts to 1p on a litre or 4.5p on a gallon with effect from midnight. There is also, technically, an excise duty increase on substitute motor fuel which, when VAT is included, amounts to 1p on a litre or 4.5p on a gallon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on this side of the House, particularly those who live in Dundalk in which there is a successful industry as my constituency colleague, Deputy McGahon, is aware, are particularly unhappy that, yet again &mdash; Governments of which my party formed part also did this &mdash; extra expense is being added to cigarette smokers and the beleaguered tobacco industry.  This issue has been the subject of discussion in recent days and it must be accepted that we are reaching the point of diminishing returns.  Because of the advice being given many people, particularly males, have changed their habits and given up smoking, but some, no matter what the cost, will continue.</P>
      <P>It has to be borne in mind that this industry is the source of employment for many people and because of cutbacks some of them have been let go in Dundalk. I did not realise until a few minutes ago that there is a cigarette factory in Deputy Eric Byrne's constituency. When my party introduced a Resolution to increase the price of cigarettes I did not speak against it in the Chamber and then walk through the lobbies to vote in favour.  I expect Members of the Government parties to do likewise tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the increase in the price of petrol, unfortunately, Governments <Col N="806" /> of which Fine Gael has formed part have not addressed the difficulties encountered in Border areas.  I am aware that we will receive another lecture from my constituency colleague, Deputy McGahon, to the effect that all Governments have neglected these areas &mdash; I can speak about macro as well as micro economics &mdash; but a number of issues are looming of which I hope the Taoiseach is aware.  The blind pursuit of economic and monetary union will have an effect on Border areas, particularly if Britain fails to participate.</P>
    <P>When my party entered Government in 1987 &mdash; Deputy McGahon will bear testimony to this &mdash; the town of Dundalk was on its knees.  Thankfully, the position has changed and many of the petrol stations which closed down have been reopened by people with business acumen who decided to take a risk and sell petrol at a much keener price than anywhere else in the country and to at least try to match prices in the North. Petrol was 30p a gallon dearer in petrol stations 20 miles from Dundalk.  These people are now reaping the benefits because of petrol price increases in the North and Government action.  They are attracting half their customers from the North &mdash; for the first time in 20 years people living north of the Border have come South to buy their petrol. We welcome this.  This Resolution, however, may lead to a reversal.</P>
    <P>Many petrol station owners along the Border will be concerned about this proposal which points to the Government's lack of commitment.  Not one member of the Government or Minister of State represents a Border area.  It is a pity the Taoiseach did not put a hand on Deputy McGahon who might have been able to exert some influence.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance he had cups of tea at the Lisdoo Arms and told us what the Government of 1982-86 would do, including the designation of certain parts of Dundalk. However, it welched on the proposal to introduce the 48 hour rule.  Thankfully, it was introduced by my party when it entered Government in 1987, regardless <Col N="807" /> of whether it was in keeping with EU rules.  Deputies McGahon and Harte must acknowledge that it had an immediate effect.</P>
    <P>I hope that in 12 months' time, irrespective of which Government is in office, we are not told that further price increases are being imposed on petrol. If so, the beleaguered motorist, particularly in the Border region, will suffer. Those who derive their livelihoods from the motor industry in that area will suffer more than their counterparts in other parts of the Twenty-six Counties. The risk taken by those in towns such as Dundalk of reducing petrol prices has been thrown back in their faces by this increase.  The price of petrol has not been increased in a budget for some considerable time and this increase is one of the worst features of what, in effect, is a very poor budget.  I am not trying to score political points in this regard.  It is pointless coming in here and speaking against an issue and then voting for it.  Members should put their money where their mouths are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Ahern said, but it is a little ungracious of him to start nit-picking.  I realise that in the circus in which we participate and in the game of confrontational politics one must nit-pick, but I gently remind him that his party colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, did not do much for the cigarette industry when he, as Minister, imposed a staggering increase on the price of cigarettes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past 14 years on budget night I have lamented the unfair taxation with which the cigarette industry is burdened every year.  Like most other Members I believe smoking is injurious to health, but I also believe in the right of freedom to choose.  It is necessary to contrast the hypocritical policy of all Governments &mdash; Deputy Ahern's included &mdash; to home in on the <Col N="808" /> cigarette industry, which is in serious decline, with the propping up of the drinks industry which has wreaked havoc.  It is a shame that Governments have been reluctant to curtail the advertising aspect of an industry that kills more people and wreaks havoc on more families than the cigarette industry.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my cousin, the Minister for Finance, for listening to my entreaties on behalf of the workers of P.J. Carrolls. I thank him sincerely for listening to the other side of the family in that regard.  He has looked after both sides of the family with equal success in recent times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Quinn, listened to my lobbying in the past year.</P>
      <P>We all know the cigarette industry is vulnerable to price increases on budget day and the industry accepts that will always be the case but, unfortunately, it has been taxed unfairly in many budgets &mdash; for example, last year's increase was double the rate of inflation.  That is unfair by any standard, particularly as the industry subscribed £600 million to the Exchequer last year.  When East European countries begin to get the largesse from Brussels, how will we raise such large sums of money?  Six hundred million pounds is a sizeable contribution to the Exchequer of a small country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cigarette industry accepts it is in a precarious position in that their product raises question marks about health. It also accepts that each year on budget day Governments, including Fianna Fáil in ten years' time when we have spun full circle, will penalise the industry.  It would be a shame if the goose that laid the golden egg were killed as that would lead to smuggling on a horrendous <Col N="809" /> scale, it is prevalent at present.  One has only to walk down Henry Street to see people publicly selling cigarettes at reduced prices.  The cigarette industry estimates that at least £10 million is lost to the Revenue by such practice which is taking place under the noses of politicians and the gardaí, but nothing is being done about it.  If we kill the cigarette industry, do Members believe smuggling will cease?  It will not because large markets will open up between here, the continent and South America. Cigarettes are already coming in from those places and the Revenue loses out. Personal taxation, PRSI and company taxation will also be lost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We must support legitimate industry and close the door on brigands and bandits in the smuggling industry.  I applaud the Government for imposing a realistic increase of 10p on a packet of 20 cigarettes. Deputy Ahern should acknowledge that this year's increase is 10p less than that imposed last year.  He should stop nit-picking.</P>
    <P>The increase of 1p per litre on the price of petrol is minimal but what Deputy Ahern said in that regard is true.  All Governments, including his, in the past 25 years allowed the Border area to haemorrhage almost to death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  The Deputy should not misquote me.  I said that about cigarettes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has bigger fish to fry and should leave that to the media to comment on.  That increase will not really be felt in Border areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To comply with Revenue regulations, on 4 September last cigarette companies were obliged to append a stamp to cigarette packets at a cost of £1 million.  This stamp is fool proof.  It cannot be copied and every cigarette packet can be traced to its source yet, on a recent radio programme, Deputy Eric Byrne found fault with this system.  As I said it is fool proof and cigarette manufacturers should be commended on introducing it. <Col N="810" /> I hope that allays Deputy Byrne's concerns. In conclusion, I congratulate the Government on bringing in a realistic measure with a degree of sympathy and I again thank the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy McGahon in applauding the Government on the increase in the excise duty on cigarettes.  I am consistent; I still believe it is right to increase the excise duty on cigarettes.  I respect the opinion of all my colleagues from Dundalk in this House but there are nevertheless very good health reasons we should look forward to the day when people do not smoke cigarettes and to the day when children ask their grandparents what cigarettes were.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I cannot go any further in applauding the Government because like my colleague, Deputy Ahern, I am very concerned about the increase in excise duty on the price of petrol and diesel.  There is an increase of 4.5 pence in the price of a gallon of petrol and diesel, and about 14 pence per gallon on the price of super unleaded petrol.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGahon referred to the fact that successive Governments allowed the Border area to haemorrhage almost to extinction.  It was almost at the point of extinction during the lifetime of one Government, between 1982 and 1987. The start of that problem was an increase, in December 1982 and again in January 1983, in the excise duty on petrol. As a result, people started flocking to the Six Counties to buy their petrol. At one stage there was a differential of £1 per gallon in the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows what happened during that period.  In 1980 the town of Clones had eight petrol stations; in 1987 it had none.  The situation was ludicrous because State vehicles in the town, the Garda and the fire brigade, had to drive seven miles to Smithborough for petrol. Post office vans, which used diesel, had to drive 15 miles to Monaghan.  That was the situation in just one town along the Border.  The Fianna Fáil Government which came to power in 1987 <Col N="811" /> redressed that situation when Mr. Ray MacSharry introduced the 48-hour rule. But for that, as Deputy McGahon has said, the Border areas might have haemorrhaged to extinction; the town of Clones almost did.</P>
    <P>The increase in excise duty on petroleum products is a retrograde step. For the first time in a number of years vehicles were coming to this side of the Border to buy petrol because while Fianna Fáil were in Government there were no increases in the price of petrol. The gap in the price of petrol was closed over the years specifically because of the impact it would have in the Border area.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Ahern, about the lack of commitment by the present Government to the Border area.</P>
    <P>For the life of me I do not understand why the price of petrol was increased.  I see no justification for it.  Competitiveness in industry is particularly critical in the Border area.  It is very difficult to compete with the North of Ireland in regard to the terms and facilities that are available to people establishing new industry there.  We are trying to compete with them and the Government has just increased the price of an essential commodity which, in its own way, increases the cost of production.  It was recently announced that the Government has approved of the ESB taking another £65 million from the people; this will also be detrimental to our competitiveness on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>I wish to make an important point about the crisis in the relative values of the Irish pound and sterling.  Over the last 15 months we have watched the Irish pound go from 95p to its present value of almost £104p sterling.  That has made it extremely difficult for labour intensive producers and manufacturers in this country to export their products. In my constituency the food processing and mushroom production sector is very highly labour intensive with small profit margins.</P>
    <P>The increase in the value of the Irish pound has been totally ignored by the <Col N="812" /> Government.  In 1992 the Fianna Fáil Government took emergency steps in similar circumstances and redressed the situation in a couple of months.  I expected some relief in the budget for this very critical situation.  According to many economists the value of the Irish pound will go as high as £106p sterling and cause very serious problems.  We have not heard from anyone in Government about that very serious situation. What do we get today?  We get an increase in our production costs at a time when the labour intensive industries are already under pressure.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider this tax.  He must have some explanation for it because it is a retrograde step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I came in to listen but I am tempted to contribute in view of the fact that three of my colleagues, my friend Deputy McGahon on this side and Deputy Ahern and Deputy O'Hanlon on the other side, all Border Deputies, have done so.  The problems on the Border stem from the blind economic thinking of Fianna Fáil who created two different economies, one north of the Border, and one south of the Border.  Until we realise that it is not possible to achieve political unity without economic untiy, we are going nowhere.</P>
      <P>We can see what change the European Union has made both north and south of the Border; all that is happening in Ireland would not have happened without the European Union.  We in the Border area, would not be where we are today, nor would there be peace in Northern Ireland.  an outside force has compelled the Irish to see reality. Fianna Fáil broke the link between the Irish pound and sterling because it could not fulfil the promises it made in 1977. Within two years the economy which Jack Lynch said was buoyant was in dire straits.  The Government had to get money somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was sitting where Deputy O'Hanlon is now when I was suspended from the House for protesting against the break with sterling.  I said that it was blindness <Col N="813" />&mdash; and not alone on the economic front &mdash; to enter a situation where we would be making Irish money foreign currency in Ireland.  By making sterling foreign currency in the Republic, we made Irish money foreign currency in what Fianna Fáil used to call the Six Counties. Deputy Dermot Ahern in referring to the Republic of Ireland calls it the Twenty-six Counties.  I thought we got away from that kind of jargon years ago. This is the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the South of Ireland, the other is the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the Republic of Ireland.  I agree with what Deputy O'Hanlon said about the petrol filling stations in Clones.  We experienced all that in Donegal.  Petrol stations became monuments to the bad economic thinking of Governments and Ministers for Finance who did understand the effect the budget would have on cross-Border relations.  On budget day decisions were taken without considering our feelings or aspirations in relation to Northern Ireland and we preached economic independence.  However, the following day we returned to the old cliché of Irish political unity, which was a contradiction. When we talk about economic unity between North and South, we are really talking about economic unity between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  There is a group of people in Northern Ireland who will not alter their economic position in relation to Britain.  We must first face economic realities when we talk of unity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the economic situation in the 1980s.  I am convinced that the economic convulsions the South experienced at that time can be traced back to the break with sterling.  We got a piggyback on sterling and on the British economy, which were weak.  We decided we wanted a stronger economy.  what we were told would happen when we joined the EMS did not &mdash; in fact, the opposite did.  We have never really broken with sterling and we are now living in the <Col N="814" /> worst of both worlds.  If sterling becomes weak against our currency, we are in trouble, but if it becomes strong, we can devalue, as we have done three times.  We devalued against sterling not European currencies which proves that it was wrong to break with sterling.  If we are really thinking about political unity, we must settle our differences on that score whatever the European currency has in store for us.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy O'Hanlon's view on cigarettes.  I smoked 80 cigarettes a day until it became too expensive because of a growing family, the increase in the price and, above all, because I spent four hours holding a friend's hand knowing he was going to die that night. He made me promise that I would not leave his bedside until he died.  He died of lung cancer and blamed cigarettes. He pleaded with me to give them up for the sake of my family.  For those reasons, I stopped smoking 80 cigarettes a day in 1964 and I do not intend to smoke again.  It would not bother me if the price of cigarettes increased by £1 a packet.</P>
    <P>Nothing annoys me more than to see a young person, particularly a female, with a cigarette stuck in her mouth or in her hand.</P>

      <P>If there was economic harmony between North and South, the problem of cross-Border employment would not be an issue.  I give credit to the Minister for Finance because he is the first, since this obnoxious Act was passed in 1977 or 1978, who has listened. I lobbied all Ministers repeatedly to do something for cross-Border workers.  This Act tells somebody from County Donegal working in County Derry or County Tyrone that they had better live in Northern Ireland or they will be taxed; in other words, if they do <Col N="815" /> not want to pay tax in the Republic they should move to the North.  That is partition and for parties which preach anti-partition it is a very big inconsistency. Border Deputies will know of people who received bills from the Revenue Commissioners in the Republic demanding in one case £15,000 and this worker did not know he had to pay this tax.</P>

      <P>Although I am not from the Border region, I have an interest in the issue.  As regards companies like P. J. Carroll and Players, it is often forgotten that apart from the employment they create, they have provided considerable sums of money for events which have done much good for the <Col N="816" /> country internationally.  For example, P. J. Carrolls was involved in the Irish Open golf tournament for many years. It made an enormous difference in making Ireland an attractive venue for those who wanted to play golf.  One only needs look at the money spent developing golf courses over the past number of years to see the tremendous contribution made to tourism and employment.  It should not be forgotten that Carrolls not only has an effect in its area but nationally.  Much of the income it earned over the years was not distributed among shareholders in terms of profits but was invested in events that would not otherwise have got off the ground and which had an international impact which has been good for this country.</P>
      <P>The 10p increase on 20 cigarettes will not make any difference to me, although I wish I could give them up. However, it will affect old people, this is typical of this Government.  Many old people are smokers and they will have seen the minimalist increases granted to them earlier by the Minister for Finance. They enjoy a cigarette sitting by the fire in the evening and the 10p on a packet of 20 will make an enormous difference to them over a week or a month.  I would lay odds that the increases in pensions and social welfare will be clawed back substantially in this measure and in the increases in ESB costs to be implemented this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly about the increase in the price of petrol, diesel and super unleaded petrol.  It demonstrates the skewed judgment and mismanagement of the economy by this Government.  On numerous occasions when he was on this side of the House the Taoiseach's brother, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, very capably enunciated on the artificial costs we have in the context of our competitiveness. The cost of transport is one of the greatest costs we, as an island nation, suffer that puts our competitiveness at risk.  Central to the efforts of the Government, to economic drive, economic growth and employment <Col N="817" /> creation must be our competitiveness in moving goods to the United Kingdom or the European mainland, yet these increases are being imposed, and they are not marginal increases.  It is interesting that, for the first time, we see the increases in litres instead of gallons. What we are looking at are quite substantial increases of 4.5p per gallon on the cost of petrol and diesel and 14p on the cost of super unleaded petrol.  These increases are extraordinary in the context of this country's requirements compared with those of any other country operating in Europe.  Being the only country without a land link to Europe, our costs are very substantial indeed.  If, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Finance were to say that the reason he was doing this was that he recognised that county roads are at the point of collapse and he needed to create income to enable the Government to do something substantial about them, I might have a different view.  However, not one penny of the money taken from the motorist in this manner will go towards solving that problem.  I wonder if this Government is in touch with real people because, even before the massive flooding, not least of which occurred in my own county of Waterford and in my neighbouring county of South Tip-perary, roads were disintegrating.  Since then that disintegration has been accelerated.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should quiten down; he has not contributed a word since he went into Government. The point I make is legitimate.  The Government has seen fit to penalise Irish industry, and particularly those directly involved in transport, by imposing very substantial increases on the price of a gallon of petrol, diesel and super unleaded petrol.  What I was suggesting was that if the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, had recognised that there was a serious problem with county roads and he was introducing this measure to raise substantial funds to do something about them, he might have a case.  There would be nothing illogical about that because there is a direct connection between the motorist and the road.</P>

That is what he did in this budget today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any brief for tobacco, having given up smoking cigars about a year ago.  I am only a passive smoker now.  The last decent gasp of Havana smoke I got was during negotiations which led to the non-inclusion of the Progressive Democrats in Government in which the Minister, Deputy Quinn blew two entire Havanas into my lungs.  Nothing is too good for the working class, I have discovered.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the second resolution &mdash; increasing the price of petrol which is to raise £12 million in extra taxes for the Government and increasing the price of diesel which will yield over £8 million in a year.  Because it is expressed in litres it is regarded as practically nothing, but it is to collect a further £20 million and somebody has to pay it.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in what the Border Deputies on both sides of the House had to say about the North/South issue in this context.  It is worthwhile reminding ourselves that a single worker earning £300 in Newry is £20 a week better off than a single worker earning £300 in Dundalk &mdash; and that is before they pay different prices for petrol.  It would cost an employer in Newry an extra £1.67 to give an extra £1 in take-home pay to a Newry worker whereas it costs an employer in Dundalk £2.54 to give a £1 increase in take-home pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile reminding ourselves too that the weakness in sterling which has been mentioned by several Deputies is an important issue.  There are 60,000 vulnerable jobs dependent on a decent exchange rate between the punt and <Col N="820" /> sterling.  Let me give an example relating to motoring and petrol which might bring this home.  High levels of direct and indirect taxation have created an economic border on the island.  If a person on £300 a week living in Newry wants to buy a 1.3 litre hatchback car, he needs 38 weeks' take-home pay to buy it, but if he lives in Dundalk he needs 56 weeks' take-home pay because the car is nearly 50 per cent dearer in the South than it is in the North.</P>
    <P>What concerns me about the petrol and diesel increases is that they are hidden transport costs which will affect the competitiveness of this country <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland.  It is worth reminding ourselves that this is not an isolated increase in energy costs because the Government is proposing to bring in increases in electricity charges which will seriously affect our fundamentals in terms of energy pricing.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ESB proposal I do not accept the proposition that it was right to give an undertaking to the workforce in the ESB that all the new investment will take place by the ESB. I believe that breaches EU law in relation to competition and we have not heard the last of that yet.</P>
    <P>When it comes to petrol and diesel, it is not insignificant that an extra £20 million is being raised in this way, that buying diesel in the South will be more expensive than buying it in the North and that it will set the industries located in the South, which are in competition with each other &mdash; in Newry and Dundalk &mdash; at a further disadvantage.  We should not forget what we are doing here tonight.  The increase may sound tiny when put in terms of litres, but when it is all added up, it is an extra £20 million in revenue to the State next year.  That will be paid by ordinary people moving around the country.  This increase was not necessary.  We could have lived without it.  The State could have lived within its means if some decisions had been made in today's budget which were not made.  This is an unnecessary tax and it will damage <Col N="821" /> Ireland's competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United Kingdom, and jobs will be lost, in a subtle way, which is difficult to appreciate when we are talking about a penny or two on a litre of petrol.  It does not sound much of an increase but it will affect Irish costs and the relative attractiveness of the Republic as a location for industry.  From the figures I have quoted, it is already obvious that one part of the peace dividend for Northern Ireland is that, under English tax laws, it is far more attractive to industry than the Republic of Ireland, and the last thing we need to do in that context is to run up energy costs in the South.</P>

      <P>This budget echoes the budgets of the early 1980s when excise increases were imposed on petrol. Increases in the price of petrol were imposed in various budgets and prior to budgets and there were so many that they devastated the Border region.  Last week we had a meeting about the Delors package with traders and community groups in Clones and the view was expressed that the retail traders in Clones never recovered from those tragic years.</P>
      <P>In 1982 and 1983 there were many deputations to the Minister from the chambers of commerce in the region.  I recently read some of the notes taken by me when we met the then Minister, Deputy Dukes.  We highlighted the damage that had been done as a result of the excessive excise duties imposed on petrol and diesel.  When we asked for some concessions his reply was &ldquo;We cannot legislate for a region&rdquo;.  That Government was certainly in a position to legislate against a region at that time.</P>

      <P>I made those representations but there is not a single word about the food industry in the budget. The food industry is currently in such a serious position that the processors have asked the primary producers, who work to very low profit margins, to accept a 20 per cent cut in production fees.  As I said, I made representations to Ministers but what did we get?  We got a hike of approximately £20 million in transport costs alone.  Transport and the exchange rates are the two main problems facing us, and they are aggravated by the change in packing regulations. Because of that change a producer exporting 24 tonnes of cartoned product to England must have half that amount palletised and, as a result, costs are doubled.</P>

      <P>Irrespective of whether the increases are due to excise duties, if the primary producers and processors do not get some help they will find it difficult to continue their operations. When Fianna Fáil was in power it took action to help producers and processors. I discussed the problems on several occasions with Deputy Bertie Ahern at <Col N="824" /> that time.  His swift response was to provide £50 million which ensured that the industry would continue.  The business has been built up and there are now 2,000-3,000 working in the food industry. We are asking that this business be allowed to continue to have an export base, that is not outlandish.  The Government has not done anything up to now for this industry and it is time the Taoiseach did something for it.</P>

      <P>These resolutions impact on the cigarette industry and have implications for transport costs.  The presentation of the financial Statement would delude one perhaps that these two provisions would have a minimal impact. However, in 1996 the yield from the increase in cigarettes will be £21.3 million and £25.2 million in a full year.  The estimated yield from the petrol increase in 1996 will be £10.8 million and £11.9 million in a full year.  With the proposed increase of 1 p per litre of diesel, the estimated yield will be £7.7 million in 1996 and £8.2 million in a full year. These are two serious revenue impositions and if we were to allow a flippant debate on it the public may get the impression that very little was involved.</P>
      <P>My constituency colleagues dealt at some length on its implications for the cigarette industry.  Although this is a declining sector nonetheless it is a core industry in Dundalk.  The Minister for Finance may endeavour to tell us that this provision will encourage people to smoke less and that, consequently, they will be healthier.  While I do not doubt that cigarettes are a contributory factor to lung cancer, the Radiological Protection Institute has identified pockets of radon gas which is clearly a serious cause of lung cancer.  I wonder if the Minister for the Environment will be making provision for special grants for remedial works as a result of radon gas.</P>

    <P>At one time an increase in the price of petrol could have been the death knell of previously prosperous retail outlets on this side of the Border while <Col N="825" /> at the same time enhancing the prosperity of outlets on the other side.  Having represented a Border constituency for approximately 14 years I think we should try to establish an equilibrium so that the retail trade would not blow hot and cold and people could plan with reasonable certainty that they would still be in business 12 or 18 months hence.  Clearly, the proposed increases on petrol, diesel and fuel will impact on everyone who owns a vehicle.  Deputy Michael McDowell outlined the comparative costs North and South, it goes without saying that we are at a serious disadvantage on this side of the Border and this increase will exacerbate an already difficult situation.  Increases in transport costs impact on business, industry and on every family who owns a car.</P>

      <P>My colleagues from the Border constituencies outlined the problems that the increases in petrol, diesel and liquid petroleum gas will cause in their constituencies but lest it be seen as impacting only on Border areas, it will have an effect generally on the economy.  It will be an added burden <Col N="826" /> on the middle classes and those who own cars at a time when they are getting miserly relief in the budget.  It will impact on tourism.  Dublin Airport is in my constituency of Dublin North, one of the criticisms of the industry is the cost of self-drive holidays and this will further increase motoring costs.  It will have an effect generally on trade in the economy as it will be an imposition on all companies, whether a service company with company representatives on the road or a manufacturing company exporting or selling products on the domestic market.  These extra burdens are being placed at a time when the Government should have taken advantage of the booming economy it inherited from the then Finance Minister and Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Instead of taking advantage of the expansion in the economy the Government has a budget deficit and a 6.2 per cent increase on last year's expenditure while at the same time imposing excise duties which will impact on every householder who owns a car, a necessity for most people to get to work. This is an unnecessary imposition and the Government should have tackled its estimates properly but failed to do that because it is being pulled and dragged by the left and the far left and the Fine Gael Party has abdicated its responsibility. I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider this imposition.</P>

      <P>I am not a smoker and I do not represent a Border county but the case for the Border counties has been well put.  I think that all Governments have a schizophrenic attitude to the tobacco industry.  We want the jobs in the tobacco industry but disagree with tobacco products for health reasons.  I have no objection to the extra millions the Exchequer will gain from this increase but I object to making <Col N="827" /> extra money for the criminals involved in selling tobacco products.  The tobacco business has been almost taken over.  In town, they are almost tripping over one another at every corner.  Will the Taoiseach provide statistics on the loss this involves to the Exchequer?  Can it be quantified?  How many people have been arrested in the last year and how much tobacco has been confiscated?  It appears selling tobacco on the street is increasing daily and this puts legitimate operators at a disadvantage.  There is no point introducing this measure if it just improves criminals' margins, which is what it will do.</P>
      <P>Regarding excise on petrol, I listened to accounts of what happened in the Border counties in the last 15 years.  I understand this increase will more or less bring prices in the South into line with those north of the Border. However, there are forecasts of a petrol war in the UK and the North.  What will happen if that occurs?  The price will have been increased and petrol will be more expensive in the South than in the North.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance genuflected at the environmental lobby with a little paragraph on environmental taxes. However there has been a 1p increase on all types of petrol.  The Minister should have used the opportunity to favour unleaded petrol.  Will the Minister explain why EU approval must be sought for the increase in the price of super unleaded petrol?  I am a little bewildered.  The Minister made a statement about a commitment to the environment but then took a decision in the opposite direction.</P>

I represent the Border area and I intend to put the facts straight on diesel and petrol excise duties.  I am amazed Deputy Burke fell into the trap set by his colleagues from the Border region.  He obviously does not have the facts.  At present, there is <Col N="828" /> an advantage of 12p to 14p per gallon in southern Ireland as against Northern Ireland.  There is a variation of from 1p to 3p per litre in the price of diesel or petrol in any group of petrol stations.  I advise people to shop around.  They have an advantage in southern Ireland at present as against Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>If a business collapses as a result of 1p per litre on petrol or diesel, it had already gone beyond redemption.  That suggestion was frivolous and it does not stand up to any measure of debate.  The reduction in the cost of LPG is welcome.</P>

      <P>The budget will generate activity. People will be relieved there is no real increase in taxation and that there are opportunities for them to shop around and improve their lifestyles.  People expected the price of a pint to increase by the usual 3p.  However, the price remains the same and there will be no cross Border trading in that regard.  The Government has done an excellent job today and I look forward to the benefits of the budget.</P>

      <P>I wish to put the debate about petrol prices in context. Between 1984 and 1995, petrol prices decreased by 3 per cent compared to an inflation rate of 41 per cent in that period. With regard to auto diesel, similarly, there has been a decrease in prices <Col N="829" /> over that 12 year period of 3.2 per cent as against&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a general inflation rate of 41 per cent.  Points were made about the Border areas.  However, petrol is cheaper on this side of the Border and it will be cheaper after the budget than in Northern Ireland.  The same applies to auto diesel.  The comparative advantage in terms of buying diesel or petrol is to buy it on this side of the Border.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to the Opposition Deputies.  They mentioned things which happened in the 1980s but did not mention 1995 or 1996.  All their anecdotes are 15 years out of date.</P>

      <P>It is consistent with their general approach of living in the past.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noel Ahern made a number of interesting points with regard to smuggling tobacco.  As the Deputy is aware, there has been a problem in this area and the Revenue Commissioners introduced a system to deal with it.  The Deputy does not smoke but if he examines a packet of cigarettes he will note special Revenue stamps have been placed on boxes since 1 September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was previously impossible to deal with smuggled cigarettes because at the point of sale one would not know from where the cigarettes came.  However, any cigarettes without the Revenue stamp, indicating that the duty has not been paid in this jurisdiction, can be seized and the seller prosecuted.  This is not yet in force because the stamps have been required since 1 September but the penalty for selling unstamped cigarettes only comes into effect from 1 March. This is to allow people to clear stocks. <Col N="830" /> However, from 1 March, a person selling unstamped cigarettes will be liable to a fine of £1,000 on each conviction. To coin a phrase, this will stamp out the problem.</P>
    <P>A number of comparisons were made with the allegedly benign situation north of the Border.  Deputy McDowell referred to the wonderful system of taxation and public expenditure control in Britain compared to Ireland.  Commentators who think public spending is growing in this country and not in others should consider the following figures. In 1988, public expenditure in Britain was 38 per cent of GDP.  This has increased to 41 per cent of income. However, in Ireland in 1988, public expenditure was 46 per cent of GDP; it is now reduced to 38 per cent of GDP.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that public expenditure in this jurisdiction, which has been governed by a series of coalitions of varying hues, has reduced while public expenditure in Britain &mdash; which has been governed by a monoglot Government of a particular anti public spending bias in terms of its oratory &mdash; has increased as a share of national income.  This country is progressively reducing public spending. Furthermore, this Government, consisting of Fine Gael, Democratic Left and the Labour Party this year will have the lowest increase in public spending this decade.</P>

In 1991 when Fianna Fáil was in Government and had the now absent Progressive Democrats as its partner, public expenditure grew by 6.4 per cent.  This year with Fine Gael, Democratic Left and Labour in Government public expenditure will increase by 2.5 per cent.</P>

    <P>(6)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>This resolution implements changes in the business expansion scheme which were announced in the budget and are set out in greater detail in the Principal Features thereof.  The changes which will apply in respect of eligible shares issued on or after today are as follows. First, the scheme which was due to expire on 5 April 1996 is being extended for another three years, with the existing limits of £1 million per company and £25,000 per investor being retained.</P>
    <P>Second, a statutory certification scheme which will be operated by the development agencies for all BES projects which raise a cumulative amount of <Col N="846" /> more than £250,000 is being introduced. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that a reasonable level of employment is created or safeguarded in those projects.  Experience has shown projects that raise smaller amounts give the best return in terms of employment. The certification process is being put in place in regard to the larger funds because it has been shown that the employment intensity of investments by the larger funds is very much lower than the employment intensity of investments in smaller projects.</P>
    <P>Third, a number of measures are being introduced to counter abuses of the business expansion scheme which have developed since it was last reviewed in 1991.  Those abuses include company splitting to circumvent the £1 million limit and the use of &ldquo;hiving down&rdquo; and &ldquo;facility sharing&rdquo; devices with little or no net new activity or employment.  While this resolution will deal specifically with company splitting, it will deal only generally with &ldquo;hiving down&rdquo; and &ldquo;facility sharing&rdquo;.  Measures to counter these latter abuses will be incorporated in the certification process which will be subject to ministerial guidelines.</P>
    <P>The new certification process will not apply to what are known as &ldquo;pipeline cases&rdquo;&mdash; cases in the pipeline &mdash; which can prove to the Revenue Commissioners that they had <i>inter alia,</i> before today, already entered into contractual commitments to spend 25 per cent or more of the business expansion scheme money they intended to raise under the scheme on buildings, plant and machinery.  Of course, these &ldquo;pipeline cases&rdquo; will have to comply with all existing rules.  However, the special &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; provisions do not cover cases affected by the new company splitting rules, as to permit transitional arrangements in these cases would defeat the basic objective, which is to put a stop to such schemes from today.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the review of the business expansion scheme which has led to the measures I have outlined in general terms has been <Col N="847" /> quite detailed and far-reaching.  At the outset the business expansion scheme, in the introduction of which I was involved, was intended to be of assistance to encourage two objectives: (1) making available medium to long-term capital to small manufacturing businesses at low cost and (2) to encourage greater diversification and shareholding, in particular &ldquo;outside shareholding&rdquo; in small manufacturing businesses.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the scheme has achieved its first objective.  The business expansion scheme is providing competitive, low cost finance to small businesses, obviously not as competitive as it would be if interest rates were not as low as they are, but still very competitive.</P>
    <P>It is probably the case that it did not achieve its other objective I had hoped it would achieve when the scheme was introduced over ten years ago, to bring outside shareholders into companies on a long-term basis.  In practice what happened in the way the scheme has been structured is that, after the expiry of the five year period, a business expansion scheme investor ceases to have any involvement in the company, is repaid, and that is the end of the matter.  It is a pity but that is the way it has developed. At this stage it would be impossible to achieve that objective without radically changing the nature of the scheme.</P>
    <P>However, the scheme has achieved its first objective, which is to make available low cost finance to manufacturing companies from sources from which finance would not otherwise be available to them.  Of course, there are questions that might be posed about the operation of our banking system: why it has not been providing this type of finance for those types of companies?  Essentially, those are questions which ought to be addressed to the banks themselves.  Why has it been necessary for a special tax incentive to be devised to bring that type of five year finance into companies where there is risk-taking on the part of <Col N="848" /> the investor in common with the receiving company?  Why has that type of risk finance not been made available by other institutions?  It has not and never has been made available here.  As a result, the business expansion scheme is fulfilling a need that is not otherwise being fulfilled.  That is why I am glad the Government is renewing it.</P>
    <P>I am also very glad the scheme is being focused, through the certification scheme, on genuine employment creation.  The original intention of the scheme was seriously diverted from its purpose in the late 1980s when it was extended from manufacturing to include apartments, hotels and other fixed assets, property-type investments.  That was not a good use of the scheme because the risk element was not present.  It is possible to raise finance quite easily for buildings &mdash; the building is there and can be used as collateral for the loan, so there is not a risk involved.</P>
    <P>There is a limited amount only of business expansion scheme-type money around because there is a limited number of taxpayers with a tax liability of the size that would allow them to become involved in the scheme.  If that type of money is invested in building apartments or houses it will not be available for manufacturing or some other genuinely employment-creating risk content business.  Broadly speaking, there is a fixed amount only of this type of money available.  In the Government's view, therefore, it is a question of where one wants to direct it as a matter of priority.  Obviously, it would be great if we had additional funds for everything but we do not and it is a matter of establishing priorities in its allocation. The correct priority is the one contained in this Financial Resolution, which is on manufacturing, accompanied by a certification process, to ensure &mdash; through the agencies &mdash; that a genuine employment creation purpose exists.</P>

    <P>(b)  thereafter, and only thereafter, in respect of any other amount of relevant investment in respect of which a relevant deduction is to be given in that year of assessment.</P>
    <P>(11) (a) A claim to relief under this section may be allowed at any time after the time specified in paragraph (b) in respect of the payment of a sum to a qualifying company, which, if it is used, within two years of its being paid, by the qualifying company for the production of a qualifying film, will be a relevant investment, if all the conditions for relief are or will be satisfied, but the relief shall be withdrawn if, by reason of the happening of any subsequent event including the revocation by the <Col N="858" /> Minister of a certificate under subsection (2) or the failure of an event to happen which at the time the relief was given was expected to happen, the company or the individual, as the case may be, making the claim was not entitled to the relief allowed.</P>

    <P>(4) THAT this Resolution shall have effect as on and from the 23rd day of January, 1996.</P>
    <P>(5) IT is hereby declared that it is <Col N="865" /> expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution relates to a special tax relief for investment in films introduced by section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, and amended in later Finance Acts. There has been a dramatic increase in the level of film production in Ireland in recent years, one of the major reasons being the section 35 relief.  I was reading in a British newspaper today there is great jealousy expressed by people in the film industry in Britain that they do not have a facility of this nature, as a result of which, they contend they are losing certain film production to Ireland.  I had the opportunity earlier in the year of meeting members of the Heritage Committee of the House of Commons, chaired by a former Labour Foreign Secretary, who were over here and were particularly interested in this matter.</P>
    <P>Since the relief is due to terminate on 31 March next for corporate investors and on 5 April next for individual investors, a detailed study has been carried out into its operation.  Following an assessment of the study, it has been decided to renew the relief in an amended form for a further three years because of its importance to the Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this Financial Resolution amends the section 35 relief with effect from today, the new arrangements to apply for a further three years. The main changes being effected in this relief are: first, there will be a reduction in the amount of expenditure on larger films which qualify for relief.  At present, the relief applies to 60 per cent of the total cost of a film, irrespective of its size.  This will be reduced to 50 per cent of the total cost in the case of films with a budget in excess of £4 million, with a maximum relief of £7.5 million in the case of films with a budget in excess of £15 million.  Where a film budget is between £4 million and £5 million, the <Col N="866" /> qualifying percentage will be between 50 per cent and 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>These changes will considerably reduce the Exchequer cost of this tax relief while not greatly affecting the producers of smaller films as the 60 per cent limit will still apply to smaller productions. It is estimated that Irish resources are more highly concentrated by Irish film makers in smaller films. Second, only 80 per cent of investment in the film, instead of 100 per cent at present, will qualify for relief.  This will also reduce Exchequer costs.  Third, the annual limit for investment by a company of a corporate group will be increased to £2 million from the present level of £350,000 per annum or £1.05 million over a three year period.  That will mean in the case of any particular film budget the Exchequer cost will be reduced if all the investors are corporate rather than individuals because the marginal tax rate for a company is 38 per cent as against 48 per cent for an individual making such as investment.  The annual investment limit for an individual will remain £25,000, the same as for the BES.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the holding period for investment in a film for capital gains tax purposes is being reduced from three years to one year recognising that a film is usually made within a year.  Obliging investors to retain shares for three years does not serve a useful purpose.  Fifth, investments must be made directly by the investor into a qualifying film company and such a company may make only one qualifying film.  This change addresses a problem where money was being raised before projects were available which can result in moneys having to be returned to investors if a film project did not materialise.  Sixth, tax relief will be available only from the date of commencement of what is known as principal photography.  This change ensures tax relief is not given before the film-making commences, which has occurred in some instances and is not desirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> The changes we have made will maintain the very attractive nature of this tax relief while ensuring the ordinary taxpayer, who cannot avail of tax relief to the film industry, is not exposed to undue loss of revenue.</P>
    <P>It is important to quantify the rate of growth in film-making here.  In 1987 two or three films were made here.  This increased to 18 in 1992 and 33 feature films and 16 television productions in 1995.  Under the BES if tax loss is compared to tax gains and additional employment created through PRSI receipts, income tax paid by employees and so on, there is no net loss to the Exchequer, but in the case of tax relief on the film industry there is a net cost to the Exchequer.  The cost to the Exchequer of tax relief to the film industry in lost revenue is greater than all the taxes paid by film makers making films and employing people here.  This has been established in the Indecon study, the basis for the Government's estimated changes.</P>
    <P>The annual amount invested under section 35 is approximately £42 million which involves an annual cost of £19 million in tax relief.  The increase in revenue from PAYE, PRSI and so on from extra film-making activity generated by the tax relief is between £1 million and £13.5 million.  The net cost to the taxpayer after all benefits are taken into account is between £5.5 million and £8 million.  Effectively this tax relief is a straight subsidy to film-making on the basis that it has other non-economic and non-financial benefits of between £5.5 million and £8 million a year.</P>
    <P>It is argued that wider benefits are gained from making films here.  Irish made films project an image of this country, make it known to people and encourage them to visit here for various reasons because of familiarity with the country through film-making.  The attractions of the United States of America and of Australia are not disassociated with the fact that many more films are made in those countries than in others.  It is important to recognise <Col N="868" /> that this tax relief is a direct subsidy to film-making because the net benefits in terms of direct taxes paid by film makers are not as great as the tax foregone as a result of the tax relief.  These taxes would otherwise be paid mostly by corporations which are well positioned to pay them; hence the need to ensure that the State does not suffer excessive Exchequer losses by the modest reining in of the scheme I announced.  We have struck the right balance and we will continue to give this straight subsidy to film-making, but it will be given on a slightly less generous scale than previously.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested there is a need to pace the growth of the film industry to avoid bottle necks in particular skills. We want to ensure we can provide trained Irish people based here to avail of jobs in the industry and that we do not give tax finance subsidies to technicians and others who come over from Britain for a few weeks to make a film here and then return there.  We also want to ensure that we develop the industry at a pace that enables us to fill the job vacancies being created with people who are home trained, pay taxes here, live or spend most of the year here and that they get the benefit of the tax relief on the industry rather than people who simply come here and do not pay taxes here because they have a residency for tax purposes elsewhere.  The growth in the industry should be managed to the point that we get the maximum benefits from what is straight subsidy to the film industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine most of my remarks to Resolution No. 3 regarding the BES and my colleague Deputy de Valera will deal with Resolution No. 4.  I appreciate these matters will be dealt with again in the Finance Bill when there will be more time to debate them at length.  Resolution No. 3 extends to eight pages and resolution No. 4 to 12 pages.  I congratulate the officials in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners who drew up such lengthy sections, but they <Col N="869" /> are incomprehensible, difficult to follow and it is not possible to decipher them in the short time available.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was the originator of the idea behind the scheme which I considered an excellent one at the time.  I agree with most of his comments on the business expansion scheme.  As he said it has worked, with some limitations. Over the years restrictions have been imposed on the BES.  I would possibly be in a minority in my party about the BES.  The reasons put forward by many people for amending it over the years are the same as those put forward by the Taoiseach.  The principle of the BES shows something about the Irish psyche and the Irish taxpayer which could be tapped to fruitful benefit by politicians and the system.</P>
      <P>I know, from my business experience, that from January to March each year when the BESs were unrestricted, accountants' offices were inundated with people willing to put their money &mdash; many of whom could not afford it &mdash; into a BES rather than pay additional tax.  I am aware of people who borrowed reasonable amounts of money to invest in such schemes and they never worried whether they got the money back as long as they did not have to pay tax.  I argued, unsuccessfully over the years, that that matter should be tapped into. If people are anxious to invest money in a scheme in the belief of saving tax I thought it could be put to useful benefit.</P>
      <P>Over the years business expansion schemes have been restricted and I readily recognise the reasons, some of which were given by the Taoiseach.  The scheme has been restricted so much over a period and resulted in such a loss to the Exchequer in tax foregone that the principle is in danger of being lost. The Taoiseach rightly said that his original ideas in putting forward the BES were the three objectives which he set at the time, clearly he said he did not succeed in the other two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the question of banks financing and giving equity to small and medium sized enterprises.  Despite the best efforts of many governments <Col N="870" /> nobody has been able to crack that particular nut and I do not believe they will because banks do not wish to invest in risky undertakings.  They would say their job is to protect the funds of their shareholders and depositors and that they should not engage in that type of risk business.</P>
    <P>The successful £200 million small business loan scheme is a matter for another day and I intend to raise it with the Minister of State at his Department. We had £100 million when I was Minister for Tourism and Trade, £25 million of which went to tourism.  The recently announced scheme has been over subscribed. Will the Department investigate whether all small businesses got these loans?  There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that some of those moneys have been given by banks to their best customers and that they have not gone to the areas for which they were intended by the Minister and his Department.  If this is the case, and this loan has been available through a wide range of banks, unlike the previous scheme which was administered strictly by the ICC, it will have to be investigated further.</P>
    <P>This raises the question of objections which the banks have to any risk taking. They should be able to tap the BES psyche for what it is worth.  The restrictions introduced today means there will have to be a certification process by the relevant agency.  From my brief reading of the section, in the case of tourist undertakings Bord Fáilte will have to approve the development plan.  In the case of manufacturing undertakings the development plan would have to be approved by Forbairt, the IDA or whatever.</P>
    <P>I would be loath, even though this would be done on foot of guidelines set down by the Minister for Finance, the relevant Minister under whose aegis the agency will come, to tamper further with the scheme.  I admire the work of the Department of Finance in trying to protect the public purse.  That is its duty. It is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to enact the law as set down <Col N="871" /> and to protect abuses of it.  I have no objections to officials in the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners putting forward ideas to restrict schemes but the Minister and politicians should take a broader view of this matter.  The scheme should not be restricted in such a way that the whole purpose of the BES is lost.</P>
    <P>The most striking aspect of the business expansion scheme is the degree to which people are prepared to go to invest money in such schemes to avoid paying tax.  This raises an interesting point.  People prefer to save on taxes because they can see where the money is going on individual projects and if they succeed whereas when the money goes into the general maw of the Revenue they do not believe they get value for what they have done.  We should not tamper further with the BES although I recognise the difficulties with it and the restrictions which various Ministers have imposed.</P>
    <P>The film resolution is restricted in the same way as the BES began to be restricted.  It went through exactly the same process.  It took years for a Minister to have the courage to get a BES in operation.  That Minister is now the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton.  It was so successful that restrictions had to be imposed.  It took much effort on the part of many people to have section 35 amended in a way that would benefit.  In fairness, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, had a hand in doing that.  The restrictions has been more or less lifted and it has worked effectively. However, because of its success it will be limited.  There is no denying the figures put forward by the Taoiseach.  It is better to have activity in Ireland getting the name of a film place and a place for arts and culture and there is a spin off in that area.  Furthermore, I held that view as Minister for Tourism and tried to put some of these into effect through my Department and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I believe Australia's success as a tourist destination has nothing to do with marketing abroad but because of its <Col N="872" /> myriad TV soaps and films.  It may amuse people to know that the film which is watched most and the one which gives Ireland a better image abroad is &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo;, made many years ago.  It is shown regularly on airline flights all over the world.  That has a much better chance of bringing tourists to Ireland than many of the millions which I and others have spent in official tourism promotions.  The section 35 scheme has worked so well that I do not like to see it tampered with.  I recognise the loss that has resulted from it but a broader view must be taken of it.  This is the way in which the BES was restricted. Mark my words, in three or four year's time, irrespective of who is Minister for Finance, it will be restricted even further.  That would be a bad move.  It has worked well and we should not tamper with it because it has been going well only for the past three years. We should let it run without restricting it further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to take Deputy McCreevy seriously.  The next time Deputy McCreevy takes a trip to Australia will he do so because he spends much time watching &ldquo;Neighbours&rdquo; or is &ldquo;Crocodile Dundee&rdquo; the attraction?  I wish to say a few words about Resolution No. 3.  As Deputy McCreevy said, the whole idea of this scheme has been through several revolutions since 1984 when it was first introduced in the Finance Act of that year.  I remember it well because I was the Minister who introduced it and the then Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, complained about the number of restrictions in the scheme.  If I recall the debate correctly I remember saying to him that the scheme, as it was conceived, was like one of the bows used in archery competitions which has a series of weights built in at various points around the shaft of the bow.  The then Deputy O'Kennedy was not too impressed with that and we had the usual claptrap from Fianna Fáil about signals and road signs about which Deputy O'Kennedy was so <Col N="873" /> good at the time.  Lo and behold in 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990 and every year since then we have had more modifications to this scheme.</P>
      <P>Every time the scheme has been broadened, it galloped ahead an we had holiday homes being built in Ballsbridge and Sandymount.  Every time a Minister for Finance imposes a restriction on the scheme the whole &ldquo;investing community&rdquo; rise up in a body and say the scheme has been totally destroyed and robbed of all meaning and, lo and behold, the following year the total amount of investment going through the scheme is increased.  I suspect this is partly due to the propensity of many people to believe that it is much better to invest money in something regardless of whether it is good or bad value than to pay income tax.  As long as we have a BES type scheme in operation we will have this kind of alternation between years of slackening and years of tightening-up. It is in the nature of the scheme that that kind of thing should happen.</P>
      <P>Financial Resolution No. 4 deals with relief for investment in films.  I am delighted some of the most interested parties are present, as rumours have been going around the House thick and fast today that Deputy O'Keeffe is very disappointed with this measure because he has been offered the contract to star in &ldquo;Babe II&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Son of Babe&rdquo;&mdash; they have not yet decided on the title &mdash; but he feels it is not as good as it might otherwise have been.  It is interesting that the Taoiseach should have pointed out that although there is a gain of between £11 million-£13.5 million to the State from the activities covered by this resolution the gross tax cost is approximately £19 million per year, giving a net cost to the State of between £5.5 million-£8 million per year.  We might all decide that this is not a bad thing to do and it is worthwhile having a net subsidy of between £5.5 million-£8 million a year for this activity but that was not the choice we had to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government said that starting from scratch this year it would make £8 million available as a subsidy for film <Col N="874" /> making I wonder if we could choose to write the scheme in such a way that we would make assistance available to a company set up to make one film only. The same principals can be involved in several companies but under the terms of the scheme the company has to be set up to make one film only.  If we decided to spend money to promote the making of films would we decide to spend it that way?  I am not sure it is obvious that we would.  For example, instead of attracting in the mixture of films which happenstance produces with a scheme like this &mdash; some big, others small, some popular blockbusters, others made for a more restricted audience, some made for people like me who like to have escapism but do not want to work too hard at it and others made for the devotees of the more intellectually demanding films which unfortunately are shown at times when Members cannot see them &mdash; we might try to build a different quality of film industry if we deliberately decided what we would do with £5.5 million-£8 million per year.  If the Government put the proposition to us that we should make an extra £8 million a year available for the arts I am not sure we would necessarily decide to make it available exclusively to the film industry.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile reviewing this type of scheme from time to time.  We are all greatly pleased that particular parts of the country are seen on film.  However, I often wonder what effect this has.  It is nice to look at a film and to recognise some of the places in it.  I have not yet seen &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; but when I do I will look out for the parts of the Curragh with which I am familiar and wonder if the actors had to jump over the same ruts I would jump over if I was riding across those areas.  I wonder if the average filmgoer in the United State pays much attention to such detail.  If that theory worked, all of us would flock to the United States or Australia on our holidays every year because we liked the look of the background scenery in films we had seen.  I am not persuaded <Col N="875" /> this aspect of films has a huge effect on people.</P>
    <P>The recent report carried out on these issues was very illuminating.  It is useful for us to see these results.  While I agree with this measure for all the reasons outlined by the Taoiseach I have always found it somewhat curious that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should be so fond of the scheme. I can understand why Fianna Fáil and some members of my party are fond of it, but it is anomalous that a Minister who is probably the only real Marxist left in Government should be a devotee of giving substantial amounts of taxpayers money to what is arguably the most exploitative industry in the world, an industry which employs nobody on a permanent basis and which gives everyone a one film contract.  I remember the consternation &mdash; Deputies Ahern and O'Keeffe tried their best to crank it up &mdash; when a certain film came to a dead stop in Ballycotton.  It was very instructive to watch the interviews with some of the people involved in that film.  For example, I watched the interview with technicians after they had received the bad news and they said not only would they not get paid after that day but they would have to find their own way home. These people who were domiciled elsewhere for tax purposes came here to make the film &mdash; I am sure they carried out the job expertly &mdash; and when the contract came to an end they had to go away again.  However, because there was no money to pay them they had to pay their own way back.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and some of his party colleagues found an industry which operated exclusively on that basis they would be very upset to think we were giving it a subsidy.  I am thinking of the indignation rightly expressed about a large retail chain which employs people on what are called contracts, but which really amount to day-to-day employment where even on days they are not working people have to stand by the phone and be available to come into work at short notice.  If they do not <Col N="876" /> come into work on short notice that day they are told they have broken their contract and will no longer be employed.  The film industry seems to be almost 100 per cent casualised in terms of the people who work in it.  I am not sure that there are many people who would say &ldquo;yes, we want to spend between £5.5 million-£8 million a year subsidising a 100 per cent casualised industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a timely measure which, by providing that the provisions of section 35 will continue in modified form for another three years, gives us an opportunity to see the value for money we get out of this expenditure of taxpayers' money.  I hope at the end of three years we will have another examination on which to base our verdict of the expenditure like the one which led to the measure before us this evening.</P>

      <P>I will bear that in mind. Financial Resolution No. 3 extends the BES scheme until 1999 and retains the individual investment limitation of £25,000 and the global investment limitation of £1 million.  I welcome the extension of the scheme until 1999.  It is stated in the Principal Features of the Budget, however, that a certification scheme will be introduced for investments in excess of £250,000 to &ldquo;ensure that the money raised is intended to or has the potential to create a reasonable level of additional sustainable employment&rdquo;. In other words, the Government intends to target the larger BES investments more properly to ensure the maxmum benefit is gained by way of extra employment, but I am not sure this Resolution has been properly thought out and that, as drafted, it will achieve that, admittedly desirable end.  It seems another layer of bureaucracy will be <Col N="877" /> inserted into the BES process by getting the relevant agency, defined in the basic legislation, depending on which business one is talking about, to issue a certificate to the effect that this criterion has been met.</P>
      <P>It is not clear from the Resolution that guidelines will have to be drafted. Although it is envisaged they may at some stage be drafted as I understand it, there will be no absolute requirement to do so.  If we do not see the guidelines we will not be in a position to judge whether the insertion of an extra layer of bureaucracy will achieve the Government's goal of targeting the larger BES investments more properly.  Am I interpreting the Resolution correctly in stating that guidelines will have to be drafted before the certification process commences and, if so, why can we not see them?  That is not an unreasonable request.</P>
      <P>I am not familiar with the terms of section 35 which deals with film industry reliefs &mdash; I have not come across it much in practice &mdash; but I note Financial Resolution No. 4 states that the Minister may amend or revoke any conditions specified in a certificate.  This seems to imply that in certain circumstances he will be able to revoke a certificate which enables a person to claim tax relief. How will this operate in practice and under what conditions will the Minister revoke a certificate?  If the Minister revokes a certificate, as well as losing their money, bona fide investors in a film project which collapses will also lose their tax breaks.  In other words, they will be punished on the double so as to teach some of the film production companies a lesson.  Frankly, I do not understand the logic behind that and require clarification.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Taoiseach and Deputy Dukes I can see how the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht lost the battle in Cabinet on this issue.  He cannot be happy with what has been proposed in Resolution No. 4.  If I understood him correctly, Deputy Dukes suggested it <Col N="878" /> would be more beneficial to give £8 million to the arts rather than as a subsidy to the film industry.  I was amused by that because, as anyone who has followed the debate on the arts plan in this House will be aware, there was a shortfall of £3 million alone in 1995.  The period of the plan has now been extended to five years.  In advancing that argument the Deputy was being disingenuous.</P>
      <P>Section 35 which deals with film industry reliefs and was initiated by Fianna Fáil, needs certain improvements. There is a need to accelerate the provision of infrastructure and expertise in the industry.  This can only be done by attracting blockbuster films.  Indigenous productions can tap into this expertise and avail of the infrastructure provided.</P>
      <P>If the argument was that we would be in a position to support indigenous productions by doing away with the blockbusters it would be worthy of acceptance, but, sadly, there is no evidence of this.  It is unfortunate for the Minister that if there is a reduction in the number of blockbuster films as a result of this Resolution, he will not have the same number of photocall opportunities he has had to date with stars such as Mel Gibson.  Instead of meeting them in the House he may have to go further afield.</P>
      <P>Everyone would agree in relation to section 35 that there has been a net benefit and that it would not be a positive move to create any disincentives in attracting blockbuster films because of the economic benefits that accrue to local communities.  I hoped the Government would be in a position to address the matter of seasonality in film production. Filming usually takes place between the months of May and September. Measures should be introduced to ensure Irish workers in particular are given an opportunity to work throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed increase in the limit on corporate investment is not significant. It is important to point out that the bulk of investment has not been made by the <Col N="879" /> corporate sector but by individual investors. This provision will not change anything substantially.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to continue the section 35 reliefs for a further three years.  That section has been the driving force in ensuring a net benefit.  It has to be accepted, however, that this is marginal. By restricting relief to 80 per cent of the investment we could chip away at the attractiveness of the section.  It will be appreciated that the film industry has yet to reach its full potential and is in a period of transition.  It would be most unwise, therefore, to accept this proposal.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes that many countries look on the section with envy and are considering the implementation of a similar provision.  This would lead to greater competition.  I question whether we would be able to withstand this given that we are chipping away at the attractiveness of the section, the benefit of which has been marginal.</P>
    <P>I would have thought the Government would address some of the problems facing the film industry.  I refer specifically to the Ballycotton incident &mdash; the film &ldquo;Divine Rapture&rdquo; has now become known as the &ldquo;Divine Rupture&rdquo;. Because of the problems encountered many individuals and service industries find themselves in difficulty.</P>
    <P>Last July I outlined three issues that should be examined and I am disappointed none of them was incorporated in the Taoiseach's proposals for the film industry.  They would have a much more positive effect on our film industry than the negative proposals he put forward.  I proposed that section 35 certificates should not be granted unless there is proof that the necessary funding is in place for a film to be made and that the Minister should also make it a condition that disputes over contracts should be settled in this jurisdiction.  I also proposed that film producers should be required to present a bond that would guarantee all moneys due to Irish workers and suppliers and that he should consider new measures to <Col N="880" /> encourage the establishment of a truly Irish film industry, with Irish script writers, producers and directors.  Our objective should be to build an indigenous film industry, but that can be done only with the infrastructure created by large blockbuster films.</P>

      <P>I welcome the extension to 1996 of the business expansion scheme.  Since its introduction some loopholes have been identified.  For example, it covered asset back schemes for which it was not originally intended and as time elapsed money was not invested in risk industry which is necessary for job creation.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to introduce a system of certification, but delays in getting certificates would discourage people from investing in industry.  What are the Minister's plans to ensure rapid processing of certificates?  People should be advised of the conditions that apply when investing their money.  Will the Minister expand on these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>While it may have taken some time to get off the ground, the business expansion scheme is excellent and Fianna Fáil has always supported it.  It represents innovative thinking by the then Minister for Finance. While I welcome its extension to 1996, it will be impeded by bureaucracy and red tape.  Having to consult with Bord Fáilte, Forbairt and so on will involve additional costs and make the scheme less attractive.</P>
      <P>The scheme is ideal for medium to long-term capital but in general the money has to be repaid within five years.  Given the risks involved in some projects, in many cases the money is not paid back within five years.  The scheme is ideal for the hotel industry and helped alleviate a crisis in the tourism industry when capital was not available from other sources.  Many leisure centres have been built and heritage projects completed under the BES.</P>
      <P>The scheme is an ideal source of funding for the food industry, particularly for small to medium sized projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> However, the increase imposed on the price of petrol will have an adverse effect on food exports in terms of transport costs, thus creating a disincentive for development in the food sector.  The banks are not interested in taking risks. Impediments will discourage investors and those who avail of the capital.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to introduce a simple certification scheme.  Some projects, for which substantial investment was secured under the BES, failed to get a Revenue certificate.  Therefore, a degree of protection is in place.  A project in my area failed to get the necessary certificate even though it had the necessary funding.  That case is still before the Revenue.</P>
    <P>Business expansion schemes have been successful in many other countries, particularly in New Zealand where the scheme was pioneered.  It is an important source of funding for risks projects.  Financial analysts and economists claim that the punt may soon be worth £1.05 against sterling.  If that happens it will be difficult for people to get capital to invest in the processing area. The BES would be an ideal source of funding in those circumstances.  A ceiling of £1 million is not a significant sum of money when one considers the amount of capital invested in projects. Funding under the BES is risk capital which very few people are willing to offer.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that many people borrow money under the scheme to avail of tax relief.  People do not borrow money lightly because it must be paid back. Those who avail of funding under the BES are mainly in the 48p in the pound tax bracket.  I hope the guidelines proposed by the Minister will be simple, workable and will not discourage BES investment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Financial Resolution No. 4 and support Deputy de Valera's comments regarding restrictions.  While I may not be politically associated with the arts, I enjoy going to the theatre or cinema.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> The Taoiseach spoke in a simplistic manner about subsidisation.  He said if this section were not inserted in the Finance Bill and if efforts had not been made to develop the film industry, we would not talk about a contribution of £13.5 million from people directly employed in the industry.  He said that in real terms the gross loss to the Exchequer would be £19 million and the actual cost would be somewhere between the two figures.  It is disingenous of him to say that in such a simplistic manner.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, instigated an awareness of the arts and heritage here and since then we have endeavoured to attract investment. We promote Ireland as a suitable location for film making in terms of professional and technical expertise and encourage film producers to film here by providing tax incentives.  I listened to what Deputy Dukes said on films and I totally disagree with him.  I suspect he does not go to many films, judging by the way he spoke about them.  I saw &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; but I did not sit watching it thinking I was on the plains of the Curragh.  A person looking at any film, no matter where it is made, does not have a particular awareness of where it has been filmed.  However, international awareness of that film and the publicity that promotes it creates an awareness of the place where the film is shot.  It also creates an awareness within the industry of the opportunities in a particular location.</P>
    <P>The real benefit comes from the technical people, producers and directors who come here to shoot films.  It is not necessarily that the few minutes of footage seen on the screen makes everybody want to visit the location.  It is not as simple as that and Deputy Dukes was wrong in the way he approached the subject.</P>
    <P>The arts have an extremely positive effect on young children.  We see a growth in small drama groups.  Disadvantaged children are becoming directly involved in the arts, acquiring an awareness of what it is like to be involved with <Col N="883" /> a team and learning to accept the responsibilities involved in being part of a team.  I have seen a growth in youth drama in my Waterford constituency. Children who ten years ago would have had no awareness of threatre, arts or culture now find themselves not alone aware of it, but directly involved.  That does not necessarily stem directly from the section 35 film making reliefs. However, the awareness of what we are doing in the arts in its widest sense, in film, in theatre, with adults or children, had had a huge impact, domestically and internationally.  That is the totality of what we are talking about rather than trying to nit-pick at some of the minor points.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera is right that the Minister should not reduce the large film budgets, because the larger films afford the greatest employment opportunities. Many international production companies have small units of technical staff that will always be involved in a film with them, no matter where the film is shot, so the larger the budget, the bigger the demands, the bigger the technical requirements, the more people will be employed.  The Minister is wrong to restrict the limits of investment in such films, particularly as we are still at a fledgling stage when one compares the money involved in the film industry world-wide with the share this country has in that market.  We should broaden our horizons and think in the context of the overall moneys available in the film industry.  It is one of the biggest industries in the world, and our share of it is minuscule at the moment.  We should aim for a huge increase in involvement. In terms of the money involved in the industry world-wide, our increased involvement would be not hugely significant.</P>
    <P>In the financial resolution the Minister is quite specific in excluding films made for exhibition, as advertising programmes or as commercials.  The world has changed much, particularly in the area of producing videos for the music industry.  Staggering amounts of money <Col N="884" /> are involved in some of those productions today.  Anything from $1 million to $25 million dollars can be spent. I believe $25 million was the most spent on a music industry video.  Some of these videos are not three minutes long, they are a whole production with a film or with a music album and can last up to 30 minutes.  Is that sort of involvement excluded from the definition under financial resolution No. 4?  Some of the world's leading film directors, who make the most successful blockbuster films, also shoot videos for mega stars on incredibly large budgets.  It would be a mistake to exclude that sort of filming under this section.</P>
    <P>It is stated that the BES will also be extended under the Finance Bill to the music industry to apply to investment in the production, marketing and promotion of new artist's studio recordings and associated videos, subject to the detailed certification system.  There is confusion.  We are defining the requirement differently in two different sections when this should be simple and understandable under section 35 for the reasons I have outlined.  If the Minister includes this under the financial resolution No. 3 dealing with the BES he is wrong to negate the opportunity that exists for very serious, expensive and technical filming in the world of commercial advertising, were we are talking about substantial budgets, technical requirements and numbers of people.</P>
    <P>It seems that non-commercial advertising videos are automatically excluded. That does not make sense.  It is incorrect to include that in financial resolution No. 4.  We will come back to this during the definitions in the Finance Bill.  The provision is very short-sighted, and too narrow.  It should be broadened to include the type of film production that accompanies many major musical videos.  I suspect this part of the industry has grown from quite a small base to a very substantial size world-wide and this country could fruitfully get involved in it.  It would be a very terrible shame if because of this oversight in the way this financial resolution is drafted, we <Col N="885" /> excluded a whole area of opportunity.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments in that regard.</P>

      <P>I do not know that the criticism which Deputy McCreevy made in respect of the small business loan scheme applies.  I will seek to establish if it does.  The information we have is to the contrary, that in fact it is oversubscribed at this point in terms of the projections for it.  Our information is that it is working as intended and it is greatly appreciated by SME's up and down the country.  However, if Deputy McCreevy has a point to make I will be very happy to look at it.</P>
      <P>On resolution No. 3, there seems to be general approval in the House for the extension of the scheme for another three years.  It is perfectly normal to examine a scheme like this from time to time.  The first examination I recall was by the Comptroller and Auditor General who examined the efficacy of the scheme as it applied at that time and identified certain weaknesses in it.  Subsequent examinations have identified further weaknesses, attempted to counter the facility for abuse and attempted to ensure that changes were introduced in the House commensurate with getting the maximum value added for this economy.</P>
      <P>None of us can complain about schemes like this, the central idea of which might be a very good one. However, the efficacy of the operation of the scheme should be examined from time to time.</P>
      <P>Virtually all the organisations which commented on it requested that the focus of the scheme be on smaller projects.  The irony of the studies done is that they show the smaller schemes have generated the optimum employment, while larger ones which have used an amount of the funds available have not been nearly as good in terms of the generation of employment, which is critical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies O'Dea and O'Keeffe raised <Col N="886" /> the question of the certification process by the development agencies.  That is a prudent provision as the development agencies are in a position to look at the employment content which is, after all, the purpose of the exercise.  It is not devised as a financial instrument to avoid paying tax but to create wealth in the economy and generate employment. I assure Deputies O'Dea and O'Keeffe that the certification process will not be unduly difficult.  Draft guidelines have already been prepared and the final version should be available in a week or two.  The fears both Deputies raised can be assuaged.</P>
    <P>I again refer to the review carried out of the number of jobs created in manufacturing and international services from 1984 to 1994.  According to the review by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the number of additional jobs created was just short of 5,000 &mdash; 4,979.  The 1991 review indicated that 3,138 jobs had been created. This indicates that BES investment per job has risen from £11,790 to £16,200. The principal reason identified for the increased investment per job is that a significant number of companies raised substantial funding under the BES in recent years and provided few, if any, jobs.  There have been a few remarkable examples of that.</P>
    <P>Significantly, however, the current review has identified that a number of companies raising funds of the order £20,000 to £100,000 &mdash; in other words, at the lower end of the scale &mdash; created significant new jobs.  The importance of the BES to these companies tends to be overshadowed by a number of larger companies which raised amounts between £0.5 million and the ceiling of £1 million and created few jobs in the process.  I do not believe any Deputy would consider a Government responsible if it did not review the lessons of those studies.</P>
    <P>The BES investment cost per job of £16,200 for the ten year period to which I referred implies a cost to the Exchequer, in terms of tax foregone at say the marginal rate, of £7,776.  We <Col N="887" /> must not forget that many of these projects would also have qualified for IDA assistance.  It was incumbent on us to take on board the lessons pointed up. Grants would further increase the average Exchequer cost per job by about £12,000 so we are talking of a figure of about £20,000 per job.  The corresponding total Exchequer cost per job was calculated at £14,300 in the 1991 review, which was at the time roughly the IDA's average per job created.</P>
    <P>In addition to the current review a random survey by the Revenue Commissioners from their files of 100 cases tended to reinforce the findings of the Department of Enterprise and Employment. The companies chosen accounted for some £17 million of the total £52 million investment.  The result of the survey confirms the findings of the Peat Marwick study of the UK's scheme that the smaller investment projects account for the greatest increase in jobs.  At the time of application, the company seeking investments of up to £50,000 and representing a total investment of £1.08 million expected to take on 550 additional employees.  Applicants at the other end of the scale, representing investments of over £500,000 and a total investment of £11.5 million, expected to take on 190 additional employees.  The lesson is clear and there is no great dispute in the House about the wisdom of the measures proposed in the resolution.</P>
    <P>I refer to the involvement of the tax strategy group which supported changes in the tax relief designed to refocus this scheme on the provision of employment generating risk capital to small and medium sized firms unable to secure ready funding in the market place.  In particular, the group recommended a certification system to be operated by the industrial development agencies which would be based on agreed ministerial guidelines and would set out satisfactory business and employment targets, which we are doing.</P>

    <P>I refer to resolution 4 on section 35 relief.  It is important to put it into perspective which Deputy de Valera, in particular, seems to forget.  The genesis of this measure was in the abolition of the Film Board and this was put forward as a type of alternative.  The performance, until the present Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht took office, was weak.  The Taoiseach said two to three films on average were made in 1992 compared to 33 feature length films and 16 television productions in 1995.  It is only the impetus given to the industry by the present Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht that has generated the kind of economic activity <Col N="889" /> referred to by Deputies on the other side of the House.  I note that Deputy McCreevy implied that the net cost to the Exchequer was well worth while. Deputy Cullen went on to say, if I have his words correctly, that the Taoiseach dealt with this simplistically and disingenuously. We are all aware from Irish history of the phenomenon of <i>Ipsis Hibernicus Hiberniore,</i> but Deputy Cullen has become more Fianna Fáil than Fianna Fáil themselves.</P>

The total spent between the years Deputy de Valera referred to, 1987 and 1993, was negligible by comparison &mdash; some £12 million.  In the last 20 months alone the spend has been of the order of £217 million and, on the focus that we have just been discussing in respect of the BES generally, similarly it is the case here that the effect of what we are trying to do in Resolution No. 4 is to focus the development on the indigenous sector.  I have no doubt but that that, again, is where the benefit to this economy is greatest.</P>

      <P>It is important to recall that, without this resolution, section 35 would be determined under the terms of the 1993 Finance Act.  The extension by the Government here is welcome.  It is clear that there are spin-offs to this <Col N="891" /> country that cannot be calculated in terms of a straightforward comparison of the kind of statistical work that is being done by Indecon.  That alone does not tell the whole story.  There is a spinoff to this country from the point of view of tourism, culture and jobs created here.</P>

      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 5:</P>
      <P>(1) THAT, as respects cash cards (within the meaning assigned by subsection (1) of section 203 of the Finance Act, 1992 (No. 9 of 1992) which are&mdash;</P>

      <P>(2)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>This resolution provides for an increase in the duty charged on ATM cards, that is, automated teller machine cards.  It is proposed that the charge of £2 per card be increased to £5.  This is the first time the duty has been increased since its introduction in 1992.  The increase will apply to all cards valid from 1 February 1996.  The additional yield as a result of the increase is expected to be £1.7 million in 1996 and £3.4 million in a full year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" />&ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; means the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972);</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Act of 1993&rdquo; means the Finance Act, 1993 (No. 13 of 1993).</P>
    <P>(2) THAT the rate of value-added tax on livestock, live greyhounds and the hire of horses be increased from 2.5 per cent. to 2.8 per cent. of the taxable amount or value of such goods and services, and that, accordingly, the Principal Act be amended in subsection (1) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1992 (No. 9 of 1992) of section 11 by the substitution, in paragraph (f), of &ldquo;2.8 per cent.&rdquo; for &ldquo;2.5 per cent.&rdquo;  (inserted by the Act of 1993).</P>
    <P>(3) THAT the rate of flat-rate addition to prices of agricultural produce or agricultural services supplied by unregistered farmers be increased from 2.5 per cent. to 2.8 per cent., and that, accordingly, section 12A (inserted by the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978 (No. 34 of 1978)) of the Principal Act be amended by the substitution in subsection (1) of &ldquo;2.8 per cent.&rdquo; for &ldquo;2.5 per cent.&rdquo;  (inserted by the Act of 1993).</P>
    <P>(4) THAT this Resolution shall have effect as on and from the 1st day of March, 1996.</P>
    <P>(5) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution deals with farmers' flat rate refund scheme and provides for an increase from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent in the farmers' flat rate refund scheme together with a similar change in the VAT rate on livestock.  These changes will have effect on and from 1 March 1996.  The reason for these changes in that most farmers are not registered for value-added tax and <Col N="896" /> under this provision they can get refunds for the value-added tax they have paid in respect of inputs that are subject to VAT &mdash; the main inputs being fuel, vehicles, machinery and certain services.  The value of VAT refunds to farmers will be £6.3 million in 1996 and £9 million in a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief. Financial Resolution No. 6 on value-added tax is the standard provision that has been used for a number of years and can work one way or the other for farmers. In this instance it is a plus for farmers. Let me repeat that the reference to value-added tax for farmers was the only reference to farmers in the entire Budget Statement and if this had not been a necessary provision, this reference to farmers would not have been included.</P>
      <P>The stamp duty on ATM cards has not been amended since I introduced it in 1992.  In 1988 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, brought in a resolution on stamp duty on ATM cards that was subsequently withdrawn. Considering the amount of money involved, will it not open up a great deal of argument?  As the Minister who brought in the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, to try to assist the economy to move to a cashless society, I am not sure if this measure will be of much benefit. I recall the argument that such a move caused in 1998 &mdash; I am sure the Minister's officials will confirm the great storm among students and others caused by the proposed increase in stamp duty.</P>
      <P>We intend to vote on Financial Resolution No. 5 but have no objection to Financial Resolution No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There were other issues relating to farmers dealt with in the budget, specifically the provision on farm leases.  Of course, farmers will benefit significantly from the capital acquisition tax provisions which provide additional relief &mdash; an increase to 75 per cent from 50 per cent &mdash; where a farm <Col N="897" /> or business is being handed on to the next generation.</P>
      <P>Farmers will benefit significantly from the increase in the refund of VAT. The Deputy knows from experience that the refund scheme is based on an assessment by the Revenue of the inputs used by farmers relative to the output produced which shows clearly that farmers' increasing mechanisation in recent times and other changes have this brought about.</P>
      <P>The Deputy makes the point that the increased stamp duty on ATM cards could militate against cashless transactions. However, in mitigation of that, it is important to bear in mind that it will be a single charge and will not apply to the number of transactions.  For that reason I think it will not discourage the use of cash free methods of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in stamp duty on ATM cards will yield £1.7 million in 1996.  Surely this is a regressive step in the light of the move from cash transactions which the Government and Members are trying to encourage for security reasons?  I find it difficult to understand how the Government can stand over this measure which is sending the wrong message to the public.  We should be encouraging the public to use the ATM system.  The increase in the once off charge will send the wrong message, to students in particular.  There is evidence of crime where cash is involved.  Will the Minister defend this regressive step which is not in line with what the business community has been saying about the use of ATM cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is a non-event for the farming community and no matter what cosmetics the Minister for Enterprise and Employment uses to colour it, his party has totally disowned the farming community; there is not a single worthwhile relief for farmers in their daily operations at farm level.  We are well aware of the major problems facing the beef industry but nothing has been done to alleviate that problem.  There will be a real crisis in <Col N="898" /> the short-term if the Minister does not come to the rescue.  It is not good to walk out of meetings in Brussels because that gets up the backs of the Commissioners and they are not interested.</P>
      <P>The farming community has been the backbone of the Fine Gael Party and they feel they have been let down by that party.  I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues to remedy this.  It is about time something was done.  The Minister did not touch on capital allowances in the income tax area.  The VAT increase of 0.3 per cent is an insult and it was obvious today that some of the Minister's farming colleagues were disgruntled. I could see it in their faces that they were upset.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was a lonely man on the Government benches.  He was totally isolated by members of Cabinet.  This is what the Minister is doing to Irish agriculture.  I appeal to the Government to do more than the measures contained in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I note Deputy Kitt's comments on the ATM charge. However, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, this charge was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Administration in 1992.  It is not a new charge.  It is important to bear in mind the huge increase in the number of transactions through the ATM system &mdash; from 44 million in 1991 to 74 million in 1994.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Kitt is aware, the banks charge up to 20p for each transaction and they are generating significant sums of revenue from the ATM system. Against that background, the Exchequer maintaining a contribution from these financial transactions is in line with existing practice, such as a 7p charge on each cheque and charges on credit cards.  It is modest in comparison to those charges.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe returned to the farming issue.  However, the solid fiscal approach adopted by the Government in the budget will be welcomed by the farming community.</P>

      <P>Farmers' incomes have increased substantially.  In recent years, the income tax yield in respect of farmers has increased from £48 million in 1992 to £70 million in 1995.  Significant earnings are being made in the farming community at present and they are enjoying the fruits of the solid economic progress made in the last year and earlier.  Against that background, the farming community will welcome the VAT change which gives them a significant rebate in respect of VAT payments. It will be an incentive for them <Col N="900" /> to continue to invest.  This is evident from their confidence in investments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for the National Social Service Board was transferred to my Department in June of last year.  The NSSB is an independent body directly involved in the provision of information <Col N="271" /> through its network of over 80 citizens' information centres and it also provides training and supports to a variety of other organisations.  Almost 290 organisations throughout the country now make use of the NSSB information files as the basis for their own information, advice and advocacy services.  I recently provided funds to enable the NSSB to computerise their information files and to provide the necessary equipment to ensure that this information can be accessed at local level.</P>
    <P>My Department also works closely with many other voluntary organisations providing welfare rights and information services.  Supports provided in recent years include financial assistance towards the cost of developing information services and also joint training seminars for staff and volunteers on social welfare matters.</P>
    <P>The further development and co-ordination of independent information services will continue to be examined in consultation with the NSSB and other relevant organisations in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The average time taken to process appeals during 1995 was just under four months.  Appeals involving oral hearings would tend to be above this figure whereas those where the appeal can be determined on the basis of the documentary evidence would be below the average figure.  This average period includes all phases of appeals and is inflated by additional time involved in the determination of a number of appeals where, for example, <Col N="272" /> adjournments have been sought or where questions affecting the estates of deceased claimants are at issue.  When the slowest 10 per cent of cases is discounted the average falls to approximately three months.  A survey of appeals during the second half of 1994 and 1995 found that approximately one third were disposed of within two months of being registered in the Appeals Office.</P>
      <P>Appeals to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office involve cases where there is a difference between the position taken by the Department of Social Welfare and the claimant and consequently involve a degree of conflicting contentions which must be resolved.  For an appeal to get the attention it merits, the grounds advanced in support of it must be investigated.  This will often require a further report by an investigating officer where, for example, a person's means are at issue or, for disability benfit claimants, a further examination by a medical referee.  The periods indicated above cover the time taken to deal with all phases of the appeal including additional investigations into the grounds advanced, the arrangement of oral hearings, adjournments which may be requested by the appellants or their representatives, determination by an appeal officer and notification of the outcome to appellants.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Appeal Office has made significant progress in the five years since its establishment in 1991. During that period over 80,000 appeals have been processed and the number of appeals on hands has decreased from 8,287 at 31 December 1991 to 4,116 at the end of 1995 and this has brought about a significant improvement in the service provided to appellants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of a prompt service is a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This was so recognised by the chief appeals officer in his report for 1994 and this aspect of the service will continue to receive attention.  The achievement of further improvements in response times by reducing the time <Col N="273" /> taken to process appeals has been given a high priority.  It is important to ensure that progress in this area is achieved in a manner which is consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all of it merits.</P>

      <Quest>the number of cases known to his Department regarding employers who failed to honour their obligations under the PRSI system for the most recent year for which figures are available; the amount lost to the social insurance fund from such cases; the number, if any, of such cases which were prosecuted; the plans, if any, he has to further improve collection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>PRSI is an important part of our social welfare system.  It provides a range of benefits to employee and self employed contributors at certain specified times in their lives.  The strength and integrity of the PRSI system depends very much on the appropriate contributions being made to the Social Insurance Fund in time by employers, employees and the self employed as laid down in social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>Contributions due to the social insurance fund are collected in the main by the Revenue Commissioners, together with income tax due.  The measures taken by the commissioners to ensure that all tax due is paid also help to ensure that all PRSI due is paid.</P>
      <P>In addition, in so far as PRSI is concerned, the measures taken by the commissioners are augmented by inspections of employers by officers of the Department of Social Welfare.  One of the groups of officers on this work also includes Revenue Officials.  These inspections by my Department pay particular, but not exclusive, attention to areas and to employers where there is a greater likelihood of non-compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> The employer inspections by my Department comprise a number of tasks such as detailed examination of employers' records to ensure that correct PRSI payments are being made in respect of all their employees; outlining employers' responsibilities with regard to Social Welfare legislation and, where Revenue staff are part of the inspection team, tax legislation; giving advice and information on matters such as insurability and the correct classes of contributions applicable; checks to ensure that employees are not concurrently working and claiming social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In general employers honour their PRSI obligations.  As a result of the Department's programme of inspections in 1994 over 1,500 of the employers investigated had failed, either completely or to some extent, in their PRSI obligations.  This represents an improvement of 2 per cent over the previous year in that of those investigated, some 79 per cent were found in 1994 to be fully satisfying the requirements and in 1995 this had increased to 81 per cent.</P>
    <P>Arising from these inspections PRSI arrears amounting to £8.3 million has been assessed, of which £3.6 million has been collected by my Department's inspectors.  The outstanding amount falls to be collected by the Revenue Commissioners and the relevant details have been forwarded to them.</P>
    <P>As a result of the inspections carried out by the Department a total of 25 employers were prosecuted in 1995 for failure to carry out their PRSI obligations. Of these, 24 were convicted.  In addition, where appropriate, civil proceedings are considered to collect any outstanding moneys.</P>
    <P>The Department will continue its programme of employer inspections in 1996.  This programme is seen as having a key role in detecting and curbing the non-payment, or payment at the incorrect rate, of PRSI by employers and any concurrent working and claiming of social welfare payments by their employees.</P>

      <P>Combating long-term unemployment and social exclusion is a priority for the Government.  Funding for local socio-economic development, in so far as my Department is concerned, is available through the mechanisms of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, the URBAN Initiative and a small amount through a Discretionary Grants Scheme for projects in certain areas.</P>
      <P>I have overall co-ordinating responsibility for the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, with specific responsibility for the integrated development of designated disadvantaged areas element.  The other elements of the Operational Programme, which target enterprise and the renewal of the physical environment in towns and villages, are the responsibility of the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Environment respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas element is managed by an independent intermediary company, ADM Ltd.  ADM's role is to assess local development plans prepared by Partnerships and other groups and allocate funds accordingly.  This process has been completed in the case of the Northside, Ballymun and Finglas/ Cabra Partnerships.  I have no role in relation to the allocation of funds to Partnerships by ADM Ltd.  In addition, the northside area of Finglas/ Ballymun/Darndale is one of only three areas nationally included for funding in the URBAN initiative, with project funding to be concentrated on Ballymun. This will involve additional expenditure estimated to be in excess of £5 <Col N="276" /> million in the Northside areas &mdash; not available to most regions of the country.</P>
    <P>There is also a limited Discretionary Grants Scheme available to support socio-economic development principally in urban areas which will not benefit from URBAN.  Applications received in response to a press advertisement on 6 December, 1995 are being processed. To date three grants have been paid to organisations on the northside of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Sub-Programme 1 of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-1999 &mdash; Local Enterprise, deals specifically with enterprise creation and is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Its prime objective is to provide a basic support system for micro/small enterprises to increase the start up rate of these enterprises, improve their survival rate and to support viable existing firms to survive and expand.  The Laois County Enterprise Board administers this Sub-Programme for all of County Laois. From 1993 when the Board was created, to the end of 1995, 987 grants were approved by the Laois County Enterprise Board with a total of £551,000 being paid out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The partnership areas designed under Sub-Programme 2 of the Operational Programme were selected by the Government on the basis of objective indicators of disadvantage, feasible <Col N="279" /> operational boundaries and viability in terms of size and economic base.  Based on these criteria, County Laois was not one of the areas selected and it is not proposed to relax the criteria for selection.</P>
    <P>Sub-Programme 2 of the Operational Programme &mdash; Integrated Development of Designated Disadvantaged and Other Areas, is managed on behalf of the Government and the European Commission by an independent intermediary company Area Development Management Ltd., (ADM).  While this Sub-Programme has specific provisions for designated disadvantaged areas &mdash; and it is accepted that degrees of disadvantage and unemployment exist in all areas &mdash; designated Partnership Areas are just one of the categories eligible for funding.  The others are communities in other areas and organisations representing or working on behalf of travellers and selected organisations with the capacity to make a contribution to the achievement of the sub-programme's objectives.  These can be assisted in the same way as Partnerships if they meet the given criteria.  The intention is to enable as many communities as possible to have access to the opportunities available under the Sub-Programme.  In County Laois, two community organisations have been granted technical assistance of £10,000 each to enable them to draw up area action plans for ADM's appraisal, which could lead to substantial funding for them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Sub-Programme 3 of the Operational Programme &mdash; Urban and Village Renewal, which is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and is implemented through Local Authorities, has also benefited County Laois.  It includes a range of measures designed to rejuvenate the social and economic life of inner urban core areas and villages, improve the built environment and restore and conserve elements of the architectural heritage. In 1995, funding in County Laois under this Sub-Programme came to £185,000.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the concern which exists at the very high number of licensed firearms in Northern Ireland.  The British Government announced on 25 November 1995 that a review of the law on firearms in Northern Ireland would be carried out.  I trust that this review will address the concern to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>The Government places particular importance on the provision of greater access to RTE television services throughout Northern Ireland.  The availability of RTE television in Northern Ireland can make a major contribution towards the creation of better North-South understanding and it can also assist in the process of <Col N="290" /> reconciliation between the two main traditions in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The desirability of enhancing RTE service in Northern Ireland is fully supported by the Irish and British Governments.</P>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference established a bilateral broadcasting group comprising officials and technical experts to examine the issue of RTE television reception in Northern Ireland.  The group identified that the most significant improvement in the short-term could be achieved by increasing the power northwards from the RTE transmitter at Clermont Carn in County Louth.</P>
      <P>However, the British side maintained that the increase in power could have adverse effects on the reception of its local services in Northern Ireland.  Representatives of the two relevant regulatory agencies, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications in Dublin and the Radiocommunications Agency in London, have been meeting to discuss ways of overcoming any problem of interference which could arise from an increased power output from Clermont Carn.  While there are still difficult technical issues to resolve, they are confident of a successful outcome to the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from Clermont Carn, the RTE transmitter network is constantly being enhanced as part of its ongoing reception improvement programme.  This programme will also result in further improvements to reception in Northern Ireland.  However, improvements or enhancements to the RTE network will not in itself result in blanket coverage of Northern Ireland.  Some geographical locations which include, <i>inter alia,</i> the Glens of Antrim and the Ballycastle area on the North Antrim coast, present particular problems for cross-Border broadcasting which are unlikely to be solved by improvements or enhancements on this side of the Border.  The two Governments, through the broadcasting group, will continue to explore all available technical options with a <Col N="291" /> view to achieving satisfactory reception of RTE programmes in these areas.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy to refer to the major report on the food and nutrition situation in Iraq which was published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation last September and which included details of the effects on children of the low food supply in that country.  I am deeply concerned at the seriousness of the position described by the report, and subsequent reports, especially as this affects children.</P>
      <P>While UN Security Council resolutions have prohibited oil sales by Iraq, the Security Council has adopted a number of resolutions allowing Iraq to export substantial quantities of oil in order to fund the purchase of food, medicines and other items for essential civilian use.  The most recent such Resolution was Security Council Resolution 986 which was adopted in April last and which considerably expanded the terms under which Iraq could sell oil for this purpose.  Like its predecessors this Resolution is intended to help relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people.  There have been encouraging indications over the past week that Iraq may be moving towards acceptance of this Resolution and I very much welcome this development. However, it remains a matter of great concern to me that it is not possible for the UN and other humanitarian agencies to operate throughout Iraq and provide assistance because they are denied access by the Iraqi authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international community is continuing to look for ways of relieving the situation.  The Security Council is at <Col N="292" /> present preparing to send a special mission to Iraq to investigate the economic and social situation there, the effect of the policies of the Government of Iraq and the impact of the deteriorating conditions of the Iraqi people.  I understand that the Security Council may request the mission for an assessment of the extent to which implementation of Resolution 986 would alleviate the present situation.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Iraqi authorities will co-operate with the mission and grant it the freedom of movement needed to carry out its task.</P>

      <P>I have conveyed to the Chinese authorities the deep concern of the Government at the recent allegations contained in the Channel Four programme &ldquo;Return to the Dying Rooms&rdquo; and also in the report by Human Rights Watch-Asia concerning practices of letting China's unwanted children die of starvation and abuse in State-run orphanages.  I have made clear to them the deep sense of outrage which has been expressed by many Irish <Col N="302" /> people at the practices described in the programme.</P>
      <P>A visiting European Union troika mission, in which Ireland will participate, will raise the matter at meetings with the Chinese authorities in Beijing this week.  A separate EU mission, in which Ireland will also participate, has requested a visit to the two orphanages in Shanghai which featured in the programme.</P>
      <P>The Government is availing of all appropriate opportunities to pursue the matter in international fora.  Minister of State Burton has been in contact with the EU Presidency and EU Commission to urge consideration of possible areas for technical co-operation and dialogue with the Chinese authorities including, for example, in the training of staff in orphanages.  The Minister of State has also been in contact with the Executive Director of UNICEF.  Minister of State Mitchell has drawn the issue of the orphanages to the attention of the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>I would also note that many Irish citizens have come forward with financial contributions or a willingness to assist in whatever way they can in regard to the plight of the children.  We are endeavouring to make sure that this goodwill is channelled in the best possible way.</P>

      <P>I am aware of this project, which as the Deputy knows is one of the largest hydro-engineering projects ever undertaken.  I have closely followed the debate on its feasibility, <Col N="303" /> efficacy and environmental and social consequences.  I appreciate the significance which the Chinese Government attaches to the completion of this project as a means of increasing very significantly the supply of clean hydroelectrical power thereby lowering China's over-dependence on coal fired energy.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Chinese Government are well aware of the serious environmental concerns which attach to a project of such vast dimensions. Similarly, I would hope that the Chinese authorities will take fully on board the concerns regarding the social consequences of this project, which is expected to involve the relocation of over one million people.  We would wish that the realisation of the objectives of this project could be achieved in a way which took full account of important environmental and social consequences for the Yangtze basin.</P>
      <P>The Government, with our partners in the EU, have consistently raised the issue of human rights with the Chinese authorities at every appropriate opportunity and will continue to do so.  The Chinese Government has been made aware of international concern about this project.  I would emphasise that the successful completion of a project of this vast scale requires the backing of public and private investors worldwide.  International concern about the environmental and social consequences of this project are shared by leading international lending agencies.  The World Bank for example has withheld funding.  It is in the first instance a matter for the Chinese authorities to determine how to meet these concerns so that the objectives behind the project can be realised.</P>

      <P>The question relates to a death in London.</P>
      <P>In November 1994 the Embassy in London wrote to the Home Office giving a general outline of the grievances and suspicions of the family of the deceased person and asking that these be investigated.  Subsequently, the Embassy discussed the matter with the Home Office and indicated that we would be taking up with them any additional specific points identified by the family's legal advisers as requiring explanation or clarification.  As solicitors for the family were examining the case it was suggested to the Home Office that a formal reply could be deferred until a more comprehensive picture of the matters at issue was presented to them.</P>
      <P>The family have new legal advisers whose work on the case the Embassy in London are monitoring.  I have instructed the Embassy to assist the solicitors in any way they can.  They are currently in contact with the London Metropolitan Police about obtaining access to their file.</P>

      <P>In common with all self-employed taxpayers, the income base on which farmers' income tax liability is reckoned is the gross income from all sources before adjustments are made in respect of capital allowances, qualifying deductible expenditure and personal allowances and reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest year for which income distribution information on farmers is available is the income tax year 1992-93. The gross income of identified full-time farmers who were assessed to tax for <Col N="306" /> 1992-93 was £590 million, excluding employment income of £203 million liable to tax under PAYE.</P>
    <P>The corresponding income of identified trader-farmers who were assessed to tax for the same year was £271 million. This amount includes income from trades and professions other than farming and is not distinguished in the total.</P>
    <P>The new tax arrangements introduced in 1988 for all self-employed persons, including farmers &mdash; generally referred to as the self assessment system &mdash; imposed on each chargeable person the obligation to pay preliminary tax if liable and to furnish, without notification from an inspector of taxes, a completed tax return.  An inspector of taxes can, however, by written notification exclude an individual from the obligation to file a return.</P>
    <P>The number of individuals with income from farming who were assessed to tax in respect of the income tax year 1992-93 is estimated at 81,000.  A further 19,000 farmers are on tax record as having been notified by inspectors of taxes that a tax return is not required from them until their position is further reviewed.</P>
    <P>Other individuals on the tax record are not identifiable as having income from farming, such as individuals with a relatively small income from farming which is taxed through the PAYE system and not distinguished.</P>
    <P>Following is a distribution of the numbers of full-time farmers by range of tax liability and by range of gross income in respect of the income tax year 1992/93 in so far as it is available.</P>

Excise duty was first imposed on non-automotive fuels including liquid petroleum gas (LPG) in 1976, before natural gas was available for supply in the State.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the concerns of exporters to the United Kingdom about the impact of the higher exchange rate of the Irish pounds against sterling. However, I would point out that the change in the value of Irish pound against sterling is due to the weakening of sterling in international markets and has occurred despite the different evolution of interest rates here compared with the UK over the past 18 months or so, such that Irish interbank rates are now about 1 per cent below corresponding UK rates.  In addition, the weakness of sterling is providing offsetting benefits for some exporters, in terms of lower import costs; furthermore, the Irish pound has depreciated against the Deutsche Mark and certain other currencies, a factor which should be of advantage to exporters with markets in various EU member states other than the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that manufacturers are moving processes or production to the UK as a result of the Irish pound's exchange rate against sterling.  As the Deputy will be aware, decisions on where to locate production are clearly made for reasons other than exchange rate movements alone.  Other factors are bound to come into play, including, for example, likely developments as regards economic growth, inflation, wages, interest rates, suppliers' costs, levels of diversification to other markets, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is primarily a matter for exporters themselves, along with their employees, suppliers, etc., to cope with the economic environment in which they find themselves.  Of course, the Government has a role in helping to make this environment as conducive as possible to economic activity, including exporting: in this context I would point out that the <Col N="310" /> economic environment in Ireland is characterised by high growth, low inflation, interest rates at historically low levels, high levels of investment under the National Development Plan and moderate wage developments in line with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> all of which are of benefit to exporters.  Moreover, in the 1995 budget I introduced measures in the tax and PRSI areas partly designed to benefit Irish industry with markets in the UK, while the 1996 budget which I am announcing today, as the Deputy will see, has also been framed with the needs of the Irish economy generally, including those of exporters to the UK, kept fully in mind.</P>

      <P>Designation of towns and areas normally come under the Urban Renewal Scheme.  The present Urban Renewal Scheme was introduced on 1 August 1994 and will operate for a three year period.  The scheme applies to 35 cities and towns throughout the country including the towns of Letterkenny, Sligo, Monaghan and Dundalk.</P>
      <P>Late last year, my colleague, Ms Liz McManus TD, Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal announced a comprehensive review of the entire urban renewal scheme to assess the experience gained over the last ten years.  At that time, she said that until the outcome of this review was assessed no new areas or towns would be designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In last year's budget I announced a new scheme of relief for Traditional Seaside Resorts.  This pilot scheme came <Col N="312" /> into effect last July for a three year period. The scheme is in operation in 15 seaside towns around the country, including the seaside resorts of Bundoran, Enniscrone and Clogherhead.  As I have said in the past, until this pilot scheme is firmly established it would seem inappropriate to consider the extension of this scheme to any further towns either in the Border regions or elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>There are over 50 areas in cities, towns and seaside resorts already designated either under the Urban Renewal Scheme or the pilot scheme for Traditional Seaside Resorts.  To introduce additional designated areas under either of these two schemes or to introduce a completely new scheme could, in my view greatly dilute the benefits of the existing schemes.  Consequently, there are no plans to extend designated status to any additional areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works who have been assigned responsibility for administering the Government's Humanitarian Aid; Home Relocation Scheme for the victims of flooding in 1995, sought legal advice from the Chief State Solicitor's Office on 1 November 1995 on the terms of the proposed Home Relocation Scheme, which has been devised and developed in consultation with interested groups representing the flooded victims.  Having investigated the matter, the preliminary opinion received orally from the Chief State Solicitor's Office raised queries regarding the powers of the Commissioners to implement the scheme, indicating that it would be necessary to have the matter clarified by reference to the Attorney General, who immediately nominated an eminent Senior Counsel to advise on the matter.  Counsel's opinion, dated 29 November 1995 confirmed that the Commissioners did not have the requisite powers to implement the Home Relocation Scheme and recommended that this should be rectified by means of legislation.  The advice was received by the Attorney General on Thursday 30 November and it was conveyed to the Commissioners on the same date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners were further advised in relation to the matter by the Attorney General on Friday 1 December.  An urgent meeting was convened for 4 December 1995 between representatives of the Office of Public Works, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Attorney General's Office at which the decision was taken to immediately draft legislation to deal with the Office of Public Works power to implement this scheme, and with certain other perceived problems in the powers of the Office of Public Works.  That legislation was ready in a matter of days. The Commissioners of Public Works <Col N="314" /> (Functions and Powers) Bill, 1995 was introduced into Seanad Éireann on 19 December 1995 and passed by the Seanad on Wednesday 20 December 1995.  It is expected to be brought before the Dáil in the coming days.  Hence, it can be seen that with the action taken to draft remedial legislation, which was presented to Seanad Éireann with quite exemplary speed, there were no undue delays in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the legal questions regarding the commissioners' powers to implement the scheme, which unfortunately delayed matters, there are no official objections to the terms of the Home Relocation Scheme, as drafted.</P>
    <P>The reason for the delay in making offers to the flood victims is that the Commissioners of Public Works do not have power at present to implement the scheme.  As soon as the necessary legislation is on the Statute Book the Commissioners of Public Works will be able to implement the proposed scheme and make offers to the effected house-holders. I have in the meantime written to all of the applicants for relocation and given them details of the proposed scheme for their information.  I have also provided details of the scheme to the South Galway IFA and the South Galway Flooded Victims Action Group.</P>

I have been advised that the pension of the taxpayer in question amounted to £770.86 gross up to and including October 1995.  In November <Col N="315" /> 1995, his pension increased to £790 per month.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, persons who earn £178 or less per week are exempted from paying the Health and Employment &amp; Training Levies, amounting to 2.25 per cent.  However, as the increase in this taxpayer's pension brought his income over the threshold, his income became liable for the levies. It was this element which effectively offset the increase in his pension.</P>
      <P>The threshold has been increased progressively in recent budgets to try to deal with such problems but, unfortunately, given the nature of the levies in question, it is not possible to address every particular case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to access by professional grades to promotion posts not within their traditional structure and, in particular, to promotion posts which fall to be filled under the terms of the Scheme for Interdepartmental Promotion to posts at Principal level.  As the Deputy may be aware, principles governing promotion in the Civil Service are a matter which is discussable under the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme. While I favour the removal of barriers to promotions, under existing agreed arrangements, professional grades do not, in general, have access to promotion posts not within their traditional structure.  Similarly, general service grades do not have access to promotion posts in the professional structure.  The existing arrangements for promotion to Principal level posts have been agreed with the staff side under an agreed <Col N="316" /> scheme which clearly defines the posts which fall to be filled under the terms of the scheme and the grades eligible to compete for posts at Principal level. Certain professional grades do not have access to this scheme.  Some years ago my Department made proposals which would have effected significant changes in this regard but it was not possible to secure the agreement of the relevant staff interests to those proposals.</P>
      <P>I should note, however, that eligibility for the most senior civil service posts &mdash; those filled through the Top Levels Appointments Committee &mdash; is open to all civil servants within a certain salary band regardless of whether they belong to the general service or the professional structure.</P>
      <P>I am positively disposed to the removal of traditional promotion barriers. This matter has been reviewed in the overall context of proposals for reform of the Civil Service by the co-ordinating Group of Secretaries.  These proposals will be considered by Government shortly.  In that context I would hope that progress can be made on this issue.  The Deputy will no doubt appreciate that any proposed changes will be a matter for discussion with staff interests generally.</P>

      <P>In 1995 a global provision of £10 million was provided under subhead M of the Finance Vote.  This provision covered the total 1995 requirements of the various Departments involved in the programme. The 1996 provision on the Finance Vote reflects only that proportion of funding which is required by the Department of Finance to fund its own elements of the programme.  The amounts required by other Departments in 1996 are included in their respective Votes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to estimate the amount required to meet outgoings under this subhead in any given year as there are several variable factors involved: such as the number and complexity of cases in which costs are <Col N="321" /> awarded and the point of time when the bill of costs is presented for payment. The increase is attributable to the fact that it is expected that a number of large bills will be presented for payment in 1996.</P>

      <P>The decrease in the estimates for 1996 under subheads A2, A4, A7 and A8 relates mainly to an expected downturn in activity in the Civil Service Commission following the completion of major recruitment programmes for clerical staff and Garda trainees, initiated in 1994, which continued during 1995.</P>
      <P>In addition there is one less national daily newspaper on the market, which has the effect of further reducing expenditure under subhead A8.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> The Deputy will note that the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement was the main factor responsible for the increase in national debt in 1995. Adverse exchange rate movements, which raise the price of foreign debt in domestic currency terms, also made a significant contribution to this increase. However, in the case of borrowings in currencies such as the yen, Deutsch Mark and the Swiss franc, lower interest rates would provide an offset.</P>
    <P>The heading &ldquo;Discounts/Premia on Domestic Bond issues, etc.&rdquo; refers to the net effect of issuing bonds above or below par value &mdash; thus, a bond issued at a discount would result in an addition to the national debt greater than the actual amount received for the bond. This arises because the amount included in the national debt is not the market value of the debt but the capital amount payable on redemption even when the redemption date is a number of years away.  The extent of discounts or premia in any period is largely a reflection of current market conditions.</P>
    <P>The increase in cash balances in the Capital Services Redemption Account reduced the net addition to the national debt required to fund the 1995 EBR and is, therefore, a deduction from the debt as derived from the headline EBR figure in the above table.</P>

      <P>The Convention on the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the Convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises, (opened for signature in Brussels on 23 July 1990) was signed in Brussels in December 1995.  The Convention is to be ratified by the Signatory States.  The instruments of ratification are to be deposited with the SecretaryGeneral of the Council of the European Union.  The Convention will be ratified by Ireland as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.</P>
      <P>There are two new Double Taxation Conventions which while signed and ratified by Ireland, have not yet been ratified by the other parties to the respective Conventions.  These Conventions are with Hungary and the Czech Republic.  Consequently, while Ireland has completed all necessary procedures to bring these Conventions into force, we must await ratification by the Hungarian and Czech authorities before they may come into effect.  It is hoped that this will take place during 1996.  Both Conventions were ratified by Ireland in December, 1995 when formal notification of the completion of our legislative procedures was delivered by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the respective Foreign Ministries in Budapest and Prague.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs purposes, also known as the CIS Convention. The Convention was drawn up by the Council of Ministers of the European Union and recommended to Member States for adoption in accordance with the respective constitutional requirements.  Arrangements are being put in place to have the Convention ratified although a deadline for ratification has not yet been set.</P>

    <P>An agreement on provisional application between certain member states of <Col N="330" /> the European Union of the Convention drawn up on the basis of Article K3 of the Treaty of the European Union on the use of Information Technology for customs purposes.  This Agreement, for which no international body is responsible, was opened for signature in Brussels on 26 July, 1995 and was signed on that date by Ireland.  The Agreement has not yet been ratified and no deadline for ratification has been set.</P>
    <P>The Istanbul Convention on Temporary Admission was adopted and opened for signature in Istanbul on 28 June, 1990 and signed by Ireland on 28 June, 1990.  The World Customs Organisation is the international body responsible for the Convention.  Lodgement of the instruments of ratification will be done by all member states of the European Union when the respective member states have completed their ratification procedures.  The Government approved ratification of the Convention on 27 July, 1993 and Ireland is therefore ready to ratify as soon as all the other member states signify their readiness to ratify.</P>

      <P>The joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters was opened for signature on 25 January, 1988 and entered into force on 15 December 1995 following its ratification by a 5th party.  The Secretaries-General of both organisations function as depositaries of the Convention. The purpose of the Convention is to <Col N="331" /> provide a new framework for multilateral co-operation between tax authorities.</P>
      <P>To date, many OECD and Council of Europe members have been reluctant to sign the Convention.  Whether or not Ireland will become a party to the Convention is still under consideration.  Provisions for mutual assistance are already provided for under existing networks of Double Taxation Agreements and under EU legislation.  Additionally, in order to implement the Convention it would be necessary to introduce specific legislation, for example to provide for assistance to be given in the recovery of tax debts of other countries.</P>

Given that these data were prepared only at the very end of the year, they were not available to me prior to or when the 1996 Book of Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Volume) was published on 18 December, 1995, i.e. nearly two weeks before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>I visited both Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir and I have seen at first hand the nature and extend of the damage caused by flooding in those towns.  I am conscious of the difficulties which the floods have caused for people affected and I wish to assure them of the sympathy and solidarity of the Government.</P>
      <P>I expect that many of the people who have suffered loss will be able to recoup most or all of that loss from their Insurance Companies.  I believe however that some humanitarian assistance will be required to help those who were uninsured through no fault of their own or who have suffered losses or hardship for which insurance cover could not have been secured.</P>
      <P>I met Mr. David Williamson, Secretary General of the EU Commission in Brussels yesterday.  I put the case forcibly for EU assistance, on humanitarian grounds, for the victims of flooding. I am pleased to say that Mr. Williamson responded positively to my request and indicated that he would propose that aid be provided to Ireland and Portugal, which had also suffered from flooding.  He expected that a proposal would be put to the EU Commission on 24 January 1996.  If approved by the Commission, the EU Council and Parliament would be requested to provide the necessary funding.  This process would take 40 to 60 days.</P>
      <P>Consideration will be given to further humanitarian assistance from the Exchequer in the light of the provision which is expected from the European Union.  However, I must emphasise that any assistance from the Exchequer will necessarily be limited and the cost will have to be met from existing budget provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Suir is included in the priority list of major rivers being considered for treatment under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. This Act envisaged the execution of drainage works on the basis of comprehensive schemes for entire catchment areas.  The Suir catchment was, in fact, surveyed some years ago in the context of a scheme under the 1945 Act and considerable progress was made on the design of a scheme.  However, much remains to be done and it would not be possible to say when this process might be completed particularly in the light of the demand on the limited resources available.</P>
      <P>Nor, in the absence of a completed design, would it be possible to put a reliable estimate on the cost of a scheme, though indications are that it could approach £100 million.  The catchment is 1375 square miles (880,000 acres) in extent and contains a total of 1,150 miles approximately of main and tributary channels with associated structures such as weirs, bridges and embankments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, the high cost of the works themselves, coupled with changing emphasis in land use as well as environmental and other considerations, have made it increasingly difficult to devise an economically acceptable scheme for large catchment areas. In July last the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995 was passed into law.  This Act extended the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to enable them to carry out schemes for localised flood relief in addition to their existing powers in relation to comprehensive catchment schemes.  A number of localised schemes are currently being <Col N="336" /> prepared and are expected to get under way this year.  Although this immediate programme does not include any areas within the Suir catchment, I would certainly envisage some such areas being included for priority consideration in the future.</P>

      <P>I am of the view that decentralisation has made a significant, positive contribution to economic growth and employment creation in the centres which have benefited from it.  While a great deal of progress has been made in implementing the current programme, it will take some time to complete.  Clonmel is not included in the current programme decentralisation.  Pending completion of the programme and a review of its effectiveness, the Government has no plans to extend decentralisation to any further centres.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.  A magnetic resonance imaging scanner was provided at Beaumont Hospital in February 1993 to meet the needs of the public hospital service.  This facility cost approximately £2 million and was met from the capital resources available to my Department.  Private magnetic resonance imaging facilities are also available at the following hospitals; the Mater Private Hospital, St. Vincent's Private Hospital, the Blackrock Clinic and Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>The MRI facility at Beaumont, which is the only public MRI, was provided on the basis that it would serve both public and private patients, with private patients paying a charge for the facility. Where health boards or other public hospitals refer public patients to Beaumont Hospital for this service, the charge is made on the agency making the referral not on the individual public patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual operating cost of the scanner in Beaumont Hospital is £0.485 million. Charges for MRI scans in the Dublin area range from £280 to £363 depending on the nature of the scan required.  A charge of between £252 and £269 is paid by the public hospital service in respect of scans carried out on <Col N="343" /> the privately owned MRI at Cork University Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any instance where community voluntary contributions have been used to fund the acquisition or operation of any of the MRI scanners currently in use.</P>

Another workshop is planned for March 1996.  It is expected that the reports of these workshops will be valuable in assisting with more effective service provision.</P>

      <Col N="345" /> Orthopaedic surgery is one of the specialities where additional resources have been provided under the Waiting List Initiative to reduce waiting lists and improve waiting times.  The Government has made an additional £7 million available in 1996 to allow work in reducing excessive waiting times to continue and orthopaedic surgery will continue to be a priority area in the allocation of waiting list funding.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  The income guidelines were increased with effect from 1 January on this basis.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves and their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied <Col N="346" /> that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that assessment procedures for medical card eligibility will continue to be reviewed and whatever improvements are necessary in the interest of equity will be implemented.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The number of people on the in-patient orthopaedic waiting list for Letterkenny General Hospital on 31 December 1995 was 63.  All of these people were waiting less than one year.  Admission is determined in accordance with medical need and a survey of the admissions by the North Western Health Board showed that 34 per cent of people were admitted within one month of being put on the waiting list.</P>
      <P>These waiting times clearly demonstrate the benefits which have accrued from the waiting list funding provided in recent years.  In 1996 a further £7 million has been committed and this will have an impact on the length of time people spend on waiting lists.  Discussions will shortly take place between my Department and the North Western Health Board on the Boards priorities in this area for 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that I have allocated the necessary development moneys in 1996 for the appointment of a second orthopaedic surgeon at Letterkenny General Hospital together with the necessary support services.  This will further <Col N="347" /> improve the waiting times for orthopaedic services in County Donegal.</P>

      <P>Since 1993, over 850 additional posts have been approved as part of the development of child care services.  A significant element in this regard has been the creation of the post of child care development officer in each health board area.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 47 (1) of the Health Act, 1970 regarding appeals were not brought formally into effect but procedures have been operating informally in all health boards.  I am at present considering proposals for an appeals mechanism.</P>
      <P>The Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981 has not been brought into force as its provisions have been overtaken by development in international law which require different safeguards against improper detention than those provided under the Act.  The general thrust of the Act has been superseded by developments in the psychiatric services.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the Green Paper on Mental Health in 1992 and the White Paper &mdash; a New Mental Health Act &mdash; in 1995 the drafting of heads of a Bill and a general scheme are at an advanced stage of preparation and will shortly be presented by me to Government for approval.</P>
      <P>A commencement order has yet to be made in respect of the following provisions of the Health Insurance Act, 1994:</P>
      <P>Section 12, subsections (1), (2), (3), (6) and (7) relating to the operation of a risk equalisation scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 17 relating to the introduction of a levy on registered health benefits undertakings.</P>
      <P>Sections 19 to 34 relating to the establishment of the health insurance authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The making of a commencement <Col N="355" /> order in relation to these provisions is related to developments in the health insurance market.</P>
    <P>The following provisions of the Irish Medicines Board Act (1995) are not yet in force: paragraphs (a), (b) and (e) of subsection 1 of section 4, and section 35 and the Schedule to the Act.  The commencement order bringing these into force will be made in the near future following the completion of the necessary transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>Sixty-one of the 79 sections of the Child Act, 1991 have been brought into operation to date.  The remaining provisions, which are contained in Parts VII and VIII, deal with the supervision of pre-school services and the registration of children's residential centres.  New regulations are required in order to give full effect to those two Parts.  In accordance with the timescale determined by the Government, it is intended that the Act in its entirely will be implemented by the end of the current year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 161, 162 and 163 together. There are no international agreements under the auspices of my Department which have been signed but not ratified.</P>
      <P>There is one international agreement under the aegis of my Department which has not been signed and which it is proposed to sign.  This is the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption which was completed on 29 May 1993 under the aegis of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, an organisation of which Ireland is a member.</P>
      <P>The primary objectives of the Convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries in order to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned.  The Convention complements the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which Ireland has ratified.  I am currently in the process of seeking Government approval to the signing of the Convention.</P>
      <P>In so far as international agreements currently being drafted or prepared are concerned, my Department is currently arranging a Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia for temporary visitors.  There is no international organisation involved in this arrangement.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with a mental handicap is, in the first instance, a matter for the health boards.  The provision of appropriate support services for persons with a mental handicap who also have disturbed behaviour and-or mental health needs would be an integral part of the overall planning and development of the services in each region.  The additional funding provided by my Department in 1995 for the development of new services to persons with a mental handicap included £400,000 for the enhancement of services for persons with mental handicap with disturbed behaviour.</P>
      <P>A discussion document on the mental health needs of persons with a mental handicap is to be circulated for comment to health boards, voluntary mental handicap agencies, professional bodies and other individuals or groups with an interest in this field within the next few days.  The purpose of this document is to assist in clarifying thinking on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap who also have mental health needs and the development of appropriate services to respond to those needs.  The response to the document will enable my Department to assess the extent to which these needs are currently being met and the initiatives required to further develop the services.</P>

    <P>The Dental Health Action Plan provides for the setting of oral health goals and the improvement of oral health promotion and preventive programmes including substantial capital investment in the national fluoridation programme. A significant enhancement of the public dental services through a more clearly defined role for health board dentists concentrating to a large extent on oral health care and services for children. The extension of eligibility to children under 16 years of age.  The improvement of secondary care orthodontic services through the recruitment of additional <Col N="363" /> consultant orthodontists and support staff.</P>
    <P>The expansion of hospital based oral surgery services through the appointment of additional consultant oral surgeons and support staff.  The introduction of new arrangements for the provision of adult dental services with the participation of private dental practitioners. Health board dentists are entitled to participate in these arrangements. The provision of services for adults will be phased in on the basis of age cohorts.  A programme to provide full dentures to edentulous medical card holders.  This programme will be phased in on the basis of age cohorts.  An emergency service will be available to all medical card holders on demand.  A new Dublin Dental Hospital and School.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As I have stated publicly on a number of previous occasions, I have no proposals to downgrade or close any hospitals.  I would like to assure the Deputy that my policy on this remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Louth County Hospital forms part of the Louth-Meath hospital group which was recently established by the North-Eastern Health Board, as part of its strategy to develop acute hospital services within its region.  As evidence of my commitment to the board's policy in this regard, substantial funds have been made available by my Department for the Louth-Meath group to facilitate the development of anaesthetic, paediatric, neonatology and geriatric services.  Last year, I approved six consultant posts in these specialities and I understand they will all be in post shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> The Deputy may be aware that I also recently approved a £1 million capital development for Louth County Hospital aimed at providing the necessary infrastructural support for the new consultant posts.  This substantial capital investment will facilitate the hospital to continue to play a pivotal role within the region and is further evidence of my commitment to that aim.</P>

The Eastern Health Board has indicated that, given that this individual is already on a maintenance programme at the Drug Treatment Centre, it is not disposed to transferring him to a programme at the city clinic.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The present position in relation to the provision of chiropody services is that health boards meet their chiropody manpower needs from an approved list of chiropodists.  The approved list is maintained by the Chiropody Assessment and Advisory Committee. This independent assessment committee is a non-statutory body which was established in 1975 with the agreement of the Department of Health.  Chiropodists whose names appear on the list have undertaken a three year, full-time, comprehensive course of training or were in practice prior to 1963.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the criteria for inclusion on the approved list have been a source of disagreement between different groups of chiropodists in recent years and my Department has been examining various ways of establishing an alternative assessment mechanism acceptable to all chiropodists to determine suitability to provide services to eligible health board patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and representatives of the interested health professions have been discussing extending statutory registration to those professions presently not regulated in this way.  The groups representing chiropodists are <Col N="366" /> participating in these discussions.  Statutory registration of chiropodists would have to provide for the recognition of courses and qualifications as well as an assessment mechanism for persons already in practice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The board inform me that it has adopted as policy the development of long-stay units close to major centres of population including Wexford, Kilkenny and Clonmel.  In November, 1993 the board agreed a policy to provide a long-stay geriatric unit on the site at St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel, in a <Col N="368" /> unit currently occupied by psychiatric patients and known as St. Anthony's unit.  It is envisaged that St. Anthony's unit will become available for the provision of long-stay care for the elderly when the proposed development of community hostels, which are part of the South Tipperary development package currently at the planning stage, come on stream.  These will provide places for persons with mental illness and mental handicap currently in St. Luke's and who are deemed appropriate for community placement.  This reorganisation will free the beds in St. Anthony's unit for elderly long-stay patients which will, of course, be totally refurbished to meet the needs of elderly people.  The board are satisfied that the provision of this unit will be a very suitable, cost-effective way of providing long-stay beds in Clonmel to meet the needs of the Clonmel catchment area.</P>
    <P>The planned reorganisation of services at Cashel and Tipperary arising out of the South Tipperary Hospitals agreement will obviously provide further additional services for the elderly of South Tipperary.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 194 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general policy in acute hospitals is that patients are accommodated in single-sex medical and surgical wards. Certain departments and units, however, are designed to function as mixed facilities &mdash; these are usually the intensive care units, coronary care units and some geriatric/elderly care units. <Col N="370" /> While policy is that the mixing of patients of different sexes in the same area should be avoided where possible, except in those special areas mentioned above, from time to time it can happen that the urgent demand for beds for one of the sexes exceeds the number available and it may become necessary to accommodate patients of both sexes in the one area for short periods.  This is more likely to occur in the smaller hospitals where there is less flexibility in relation to accommodating patients because of the small bed numbers. Hospitals endeavour to minimise this practice to ensure the dignity and privacy of patients are respected at all times.</P>
    <P>I am at present carrying out a review of mixed wards in each health board area.  If, however, the Deputies have specific incidents they wish to bring to my attention, I will, of course, be willing to have them investigated.</P>

People with AIDS or who are HIV positive generally receive a higher priority on the list because of the more serious nature of their medical condition.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse the Eastern Health Board continues to develop a comprehensive network of treatment services for drug misusers.  The objective in developing these services is to provide treatment for those who need them and thus eliminate the waiting lists which currently exist.  A major component of the plan to eliminate these waiting lists is the continued establishment of community drug centres in local areas where the need for these centres has been identified.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  In the period 1990-1995 additional funding amounting to £44.58 million has been invested in the services. New services provided include the development of the home support services and the provision of over 1,000 <Col N="373" /> new residential-respite places and 2,100 new day care places.</P>
    <P>Overall expenditure on services to persons with a mental handicap has increased from £162 million in 1990 to over £250 million in 1995.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that this injection of funds has made a substantial impact, I am aware that more needs to be done if we are to meet the needs of those awaiting services.  The Government is committed to the continued development of the services, as resources become available.  This commitment is outlined in both <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and the Health Strategy &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers of the health boards to assist in the determination of a person's medical card eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers.</P>
      <P>The following table sets out the income guidelines used by the eight health boards, in 1995 and at present, in the assessment of applications for medical cards.  Figures given relate to gross income per week less PRSI deduction.</P>

    <P>At present, farmers applying for a medical card are given the option of having their income assessed on a factual basis (in which case a full set of farm accounts must be supplied) or under the standard notional system based on the Teagasc guidelines.  In applying the latter guidelines health boards take account of the advice of Teagasc as to the allowance to be made for local variations in agricultural conditions. Regard may also be had to the land letting value prevailing in the area.</P>
    <P>A working group on medical card eligibility has been established and this meets regularly to ensure uniformity and consistency in all areas as regards assessment of the income of medical card applicants.  The method of assessing farmers is among the matters currently being considered by the group and any adjustments which may be considered necessary to this method, in the interest of equity, will be made.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am informed that the management of the health boards have taken steps to develop a more comprehensive policy in this area, having regard to the important ethical and legal considerations which arise.  I am asking the boards to extend their consideration to all situations similar to those which have arisen in relation to stoma care and to conclude their deliberations as quickly as possible.  I consider that there is a need to clarify policy quickly on the question of sponsorship, other than for properly authorised clinical research and to apply that policy to all public health agencies.  My primary concern is to ensure that there are no obstacles to the provision of the most appropriate patient care and the achievement of <Col N="387" /> optimum value for money in the procurement and delivery of goods and services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202, 209, 210, 211, 212 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>I can tell the House that, having reviewed the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Quinn McDonnell Pattison, I am satisfied that the tendering process leading to QMP's appointment was properly conducted, and that those involved in recommending the appointment acted entirely honestly and properly throughout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter referred to in Question No. 213 is a private and confidential letter of 16 May, 1995 from Conor Quinn, Joint Managing Director of QMP, to Fergus Finlay, special adviser to the Tánaiste, which first came to public notice in proceedings before the High Court on 11 January 1996 concerning the challenge to the outcome of the divorce referendum. The letter forms part of a huge number of documents which are before the court as part of the discovery process in the case.  I can confirm that I was not, and other members of the Cabinet sub-committees on divorce were not, aware of any such letter until the letter <Col N="389" /> was read out in court.  It was supplied to my Department by QMP as part of the High Court order for discovery of documents and supplied by my Department to the court.</P>
    <P>As to the question of whether or not I, or for that matter, any other member of Government, would consider it proper that the identities of the owners of a firm to be awarded the advertising contract in the divorce referendum should be buried in a press release the answer, clearly, must be no.  The public record shows that that advice was not followed.</P>
    <P>The appointment of QMP for the purposes of the Government's information campaign on the divorce referendum was announced by me on 13 September, 1995 on publication of the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. The Government Contracts Committee which is a committee of civil servants drawn from Departments concerned on an on-going basis with contracts had given its approval for the QMP contract on 11 September, 1995 &mdash; two days earlier. It was always my intention to state publicly the identity of those who got the divorce referendum advertising contract. Newspapers prominently reported on 14 September, 1995 my announcement that the contract was awarded to QMP &mdash; and also that Conor Quinn was a brother of the Minister for Finance. The formal contract detailing heads of expenditure, as approved by the Department of Finance, was made with QMP on 20 October, 1995.</P>
    <P>It will have occurred to many Members of the House, as I am sure it has occurred to discerning members of the public, that the identity of directors of a company such as QMP is, under the law, a matter of public record in the Companies Registration Office.  I should also add that Government policy as regards disclosure of interests by people holding public office or employment is enshrined in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 which became law on 22 July, 1995.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> It may assist the House further if I were to point out that the family connection which is, apparently, being touted by some as having influenced the appointment of QMP was not a connection with any member of the special committee which I established at the end of 1993 to advise me on the appointment of an advertising agency for the Government's advertising programme. I also do not have any such connection with QMP.  All proper procedures were followed in relation to the appointment.  The committee, which I established, comprised the following: John Foley (Government Information Service); Kate O'Toole (Government Information Service); Fergus Finlay (then Programme Manager, Department of Foreign Affairs); Paul Mulhern (then Programme Manager, Department of Equality and Law Reform); and Tom Lynch (Principal Officer, Department of Equality and Law Reform).  My purpose in appointing that special committee was to have recommendations made to me as to the merit of the different presentations to enable me to seek the approval of the Government Contracts Committee in relation to the award of the divorce referendum contract.</P>
    <P>The procedures in relation to the award of the QMP contract involved, therefore, the establishment of that special committee; the making by the committee of recommendations; the submission, under my approval, of that recommendation to the Government Contracts Committee; the approval of the contracts committee; and sanction by the Department of Finance for the expenditure involved in the contract.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, I propose now to set out the events which followed on the appointment of the special committee and which have become the subject of some debate.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Government contracts procedures, invitations were sent by the Government Information Service to a select number of advertising companies, six in number, to tender for the divorce referendum contract.  All six <Col N="391" /> companies made submissions to the Government Information Service.  The number of proposals was reduced to three, namely, those presented by QMP, McConnells, and Arks; and subsequently to the first-named two.  While the committee considered the QMP proposal to be the strongest, McConnells had strengths which the committee thought might also be availed of and the committee asked the two companies to explore the possibility of working together on the project.  That proposal did not, however, find agreement between the two companies.  On 4 May, 1994 I was informed by the committee that the process of selection had been completed and that the committee had agreed to recommend one agency.  That agency was QMP.  The decision of the committee was unanimous.</P>
    <P>Of the five companies which were not being recommended for the contract three were told of this on 12 April, 1994 by the Government Information Service. The Information now available to me is that the other companies were not so informed at any time and I regret that oversight.  I extend my apologies to the two companies concerned.</P>
    <P>A very long period ensued between May, 1994 and July, 1995 during which there was a challenge in the High Court and the Supreme Court to the constitutionality of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  It had the effect of seriously delaying the holding of the divorce referendum. Because the referendum was delayed, action on the advertising contract was also delayed.  No contract was drawn up, and none was offered to QMP.  Details of the advertising project, of course, were dependent on finalisation of the Government's proposals in relation to the constitutional amendment on divorce and associated legislation.  In late 1994 there was a change of Government. In April, 1995 I had announced that the Government was aiming at a divorce referendum date of 30 November, 1995 while at the same time indicating that much depended on a <Col N="392" /> decision being made by the Supreme Court in the case before it on the 1989 Act.  The Government in 1994 and the succeeding Government in 1995 were not involved in any decision-making process on who should be awarded the advertising contract.  However, the possibility of holding the referendum began to grow stronger by mid-1995 and I briefed Cabinet sub-committee colleagues in the new Government on the advertising aspects.  It was in that context that the two companies, QMP and McConnells, were asked to make presentations in June, 1995.  My colleagues in the Cabinet sub-committee were satisfied with the recommendations of the special committee.  I should like to point out that the Minister for Finance was not present at those presentations or at any discussions about them.</P>
    <P>In his letter of 16 May, 1995 to Fergus Finlay, Conor Quinn appears to assume that his company had the contract. There was no basis in fact for that assumption because the contract had yet to be awarded under procedures which were in operation in my Department and the Government Information Service. When QMP made its further presentation to the Cabinet sub-committee in June 1995, they did so in the knowledge that they had not been awarded any contract, and no-one had entered into any commitment to them.  On the other hand, in the course of discussions with the special committee on the possibility of both QMP and McConnells working together Conor Quinn would have been clearly of the understanding that this company was perceived by the committee to have made the strongest presentation.  He was aware of the sensitivity about any such appointment, given that he was a brother of the Minister for Finance.  Considerable interest in the whole matter of the referendum was current in the media about that time, among members of the public, interest groups and political parties.  My understanding is that Fergus Finlay, anticipating possible criticism of any appointment of QMP, discussed the matter with Conor Quinn on 2 May, <Col N="393" /> 1995 so that the issue could be addressed fairly in his company's interest and in the public interest.  I would not be human if I too did not have concern at the family connection in question.  I had queried that aspect in May, 1994 when it was made clear to me that QMP was the outstanding candidate for the contract.  I was informed by the special committee, unanimously and without equivocation, that if the proposal to award the contract to QMP were to be rejected by me on the basis that one member of QMP had a family connection with a Government Minister it would, because QMP had made the best presentation, be a complete injustice to that member of QMP and other members of his company.  That was a considerable assurance to me in the matter.  It satisfied me that merit on the day would indeed win out and that, inevitably, if questions were raised about the appointment they could be answered frankly and honestly.  The passage of time between May, 1994 and the announcement in September, 1995 of the appointment of QMP was exceptional. Had it been possible to proceed with the referendum in 1994 it would have avoided a situation in which QMP was left, for a period of over one year knowing they had made the best presentation but had to accept that no proper contract was possible until close to finalisation or publication of the Government's divorce proposals.  Fergus Finlay's discussions with Conor Quinn on 2 May, 1995 were based on Mr. Finlay's assumption, made in good faith, that QMP were likely to be awarded the contract in due course and his concern lest the known family connection be subject to misrepresentation.  I am sure that Members on all sides of the House who experienced the long wait for the referendum to be held will have some appreciation of the difficulties it presented for a company which had committed itself for so long to the advertising project associated with the referendum.</P>
    <P>There were a number of Government <Col N="394" /> committees involved in the divorce referendum. The proposals which led to the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill and details of the draft Family Law (Divorce) Bill were considered by the following Cabinet sub-committee for submission to the Government: Minister for Finance (Deputy Quinn); Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Taylor, Chairman); Minister for Health (Deputy Noonan <i>Limerick East</i>); Minister for the Environment (Deputy Howlin); Minister for Justice (Deputy Owen); Minister for Social Welfare (Deputy Proinsias De Rossa); Chief Whip/Minister for the Defence and the Marine (Deputy Barrett); Attorney General (Mr. Gleeson, SC).</P>
    <P>There was also a divorce campaign co-ordinating committee established as follows; Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Taylor); Minister for Health (Deputy Noonan, <i>Limerick East</i>); Minister for Education (Deputy Bhreathnach); Minister for Justice (Deputy Owen); Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Deputy Gilmore); Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Deputy McManus).</P>
    <P>A committee as follows was also established to liaise with the campaign co-ordinating committee: Deputy Hogan, TD; Senator Magner; Cllr. Catherine Murphy; Fergus Finlay (Special Adviser to the Tánaiste); Shane Kenny (Government Press Secretary); Ann Kinsella (Programme Manager, Department of Equality and Law Reform); Richard Humphreys (Special Adviser to Minister for Equality and Law Reform); Kathleen O'Meara (Special Adviser to Minister of State for Labour Affairs); Michael O'Reilly (Fine Gael); Jim Miley (Fine Gael); Fiachra O'Ceallachoir (Democratic Left); John Foley (Government Information Service); Tony Heffernan (Government Information Service); Kate O'Toole (Government Information Service).</P>
    <P>As designed in early 1994 and as reshaped in some respects in 1995 the information programme which was <Col N="395" /> finally engaged in the run-up to the referendum was informational while at the same time it asked for support of the Government's proposals.  In bringing forward that programme for the referendum the Government considered it had a duty and a responsibility to ensure, as best as possible, that the public, when it came to vote on 24 November, 1995 had basic information about the legal provisions, the social welfare provisions, and the support services (counselling, mediation and legal aid) which would apply in the event of divorce being introduced.  The purpose of the advertising information programme was to assist voters in the making of an informed decision on the matter. The Government is satisfied that public money spent on that information programme as it was conceived at the time was value for money.  It, of course, accepts the decision of the Supreme Court that expenditure on advertising which asked for a yes vote was wrongful. There are no proposals to recoup moneys spent on the advertising programme.</P>
    <P>A provision of £30,000 has been made in my Department's Estimates for 1996 for the divorce referendum.  This is a contingency provision in the event that any outstanding expenditure on the referendum remains to be paid in 1996. The total amount paid in 1995 was £485,072.  The amount to be paid in 1996 is likely to be very small.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205, 206 and 207 together.</P>
      <P>The proposed international agreements under the auspices of my Department which are currently being drafted or prepared are the EU draft convention on scope, jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters; the EU draft convention on the service in the member states of the European Union of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters; and the draft convention on the protection of children, prepared by the Hague Conference on Private International Law.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> Government approval is being sought for the signature of the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights, prepared by the Council of Europe and proposed to be signed on behalf of Ireland when the Convention is opened for signature at Strasbourg on 25 January 1996.</P>
    <P>Proposals are also being prepared for submission to Government in relation to the signature and ratification, on behalf of Ireland, of the following three conventions: Convention abolishing the requirement of legalisation for public documents, prepared by the Hague Conference on Private International Law and opened for signature at the Hague on 5 October 1961.  European Convention on the abolition of legalisation of documents executed by diplomatic or consular officers, prepared by the Council of Europe and opened for signature on 7 June 1968.  EC Convention abolishing the legalisation of documents in the member states of the European Communities, opened for signature at Brussels on 25 May 1987.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a signature to the Convention on the Accession of Spain and Portugal to the EC Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations. The convention was opened for signature on 18 May 1992 and signed, on behalf of Ireland, at Funchal on that date.  It is proposed to ratify the Accession Convention when the necessary enabling legislation has been enacted.</P>
    <P>Ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination must await the enactment of two pieces of anti-discrimination legislation currently being prepared &mdash; the Employment Equality Bill, which will deal with discrimination in the workplace and the Equal Status Bill, which will deal with discrimination outside the field of employment.  This convention was adopted by General Assembly Resolution of 21 December 1965, was opened for signature in New York on 7 March 1966 and signed by Ireland on 21 March 1968.</P>
    <P>There is one other international <Col N="399" /> agreement under the auspices of my Department which has not been ratified by the State.  This agreement is &ldquo;ILO Convention 111 concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation&rdquo;.  The Convention was adopted by the International Labour Conference of the International Labour Organisation at Geneva on 25 June 1958.  There is no formal signing of ILO instruments similar to procedures followed with, for example, UN instruments. When ILO Conventions are adopted at the organisation's Annual International Labour Conference they are submitted to the appropriate national authority for ratification. Members do not become a party to the Convention until they have ratified it.</P>
    <P>Present legislative provision do not facilitate ratification of this convention. The matter is, however, being examined in the context of the forthcoming employment equality legislation.</P>

      <Quest>the purpose for the allocation under Subhead H of Vote 10; the way in which the allocation was spent in 1995; and the way it is intended to spend the allocation in 1996.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose for the allocation under Subhead H of Vote 10 is to provide for the restoration, development and maintenance of inland waterways which are managed by the waterways service.  These waterways include the Grand and Royal Canals, the Barrow Navigation, the <Col N="401" /> Shannon Navigation and the ShannonErne Waterway.  Arrangements are in hand to extend the role of the service to include the Boyne Canal, part of the Corrib Navigation and the Tralee Ship Canal.</P>
      <P>The total Subhead H allocation for 1995 amounted to £8.066 million of which the non-capital provision amounted to £4.616 million and the capital provision £3.450 million.  Actual expenditure for the year was £7.24 million. A precise breakdown of the outturn between capital and non-capital expenditure is not yet available.  The shortfall in expenditure was accounted for mainly by much slower than anticipated progress on the projects to extend the Shannon Navigation to Ballinasloe and Boyle.  This was due to unexpected difficulties in securing planning permission. Expenditure on the non-capital provision related to the day-to-day maintenance and operation of the waterways.</P>
      <P>Capital expenditure, largely funded under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism was incurred on projects such as the Royal Canal restoration, Grand Canal and Barrow Navigation improvement works, the Fishery Development Programme, the completion of the Lough Allen Navigation Project and the provision of moorings on the River Erne at Belturbet.</P>
      <P>The Subhead H allocation for 1996 is £9.838 million, of which the non-capital allocation provision is £4.855 million and the capital provision £4.983 million. The capital works in 1996 will include further restoration works on the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal, the Barrow Navigation and the Shannon Navigation.</P>
      <P>Other works will include dredging at the Tralee Ship Canal, the provision of angling stands for the disabled on the Grand Canal at Ballyteague, County Kildare, and assisting with the restoration of several barges which are being restored under a community employment scheme being administered by FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> It is also intended to provide necessary additional moorings on the Shannon-Erne Waterway.  Mooring facilities in the Claddagh Basin will be extended and a scheme of environmental improvement of the Eglinton Canal will be undertaken.  An interpretative centre for the Galway Waterways will also be developed.</P>

      <P>The OECD figure quoted is out of date.  At present between national parks and State nature reserves, the National Parks and Wildlife Service owns 70,000 ha. of land approximating to 1 per cent of the national territory.

Areas totalling 175,000 ha.  have been designated as special protection areas for birds in accordance with the Birds Directive.</P>

Some of these lands will be given added protection as special areas of conservation under the Habitats Directive, which I propose to transpose into Irish law by regulations later this year.</P>

Local authorities have, however, been asked to give consideration to the sale of maisonettes particularly those which do not have common areas where satisfactory <Col N="416" /> arrangements which do not involve the difficulties that arise in the case of flats can be devised.</P>
      <P>Dwellings provided for, and occupied by, elderly persons, whether flats or houses, are excluded from the tenant purchase scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 and 244 together.</P>
      <P>The year on year percentage changes set out in the abridged version of the 1996 Estimates for Public Services are complied using 1995 and 1996 Estimates provisions.  The percentage change will, in many cases, be different in the revised Estimates for the public service which will compute the change using outturn figures in 1995.  Subhead A.3 is an administrative budget Subhead, and funds a range of services including cleaning and security for the Department's offices, advertising, environmental promotion and staff training. Ongoing efficiency and other measures should ensure that the 1996 Estimate provision will suffice to meet anticipated demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on miscellaneous roads related services (including recoupment of expenses incurred in vehicle and driver licensing, vehicle testing etc., costs associated with the development <Col N="417" /> of the national vehicle file, and a grant to the medical bureau of road safety) are accounted for under Subhead C.4. The reduction in the subhead provision is due almost entirely to the introduction of revised arrangements which will allow the expenses of licensing authorities in relation to the licensing of vehicles etc. to be met by way of reduction from the motor tax collected locally.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.3 funds a once-off scheme of grants to local authorities and other bodies for improving access for people with disabilities to public parks and other outdoor recreational facilities which lack such access at present. Expenditure on the scheme is declining as outstanding commitments are met.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.5 is used to pay subsidies to local authorities towards loan charges in respect of the provision of certain capital services including housing, water and sewerage services and fire services. The 1996 provision shall be sufficient to meet the anticipated demand for the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.13 is used to defray expenditure on a range of miscellaneous current and capital services.  The fact that two non-recurring items grants, to the Sherriff Street Youth Club and the North Wall Womens Centre, arose in 1995 accounts for the reduced provision required in the current year.</P>

      <P>When I initiated the restoration programme for non-national roads last July, I allocated an additional £20 million to fund the programme in <Col N="418" /> 1995.  The record provision of over £146 million made for improvement and maintenance works on non-national roads this year includes a further substantial provision for works connected with the restoration programme.  I will be announcing details in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>Detailed information on the extent of the backlog of deficiencies in the network, and on the cost of restoring it over a ten year period, is not available at this stage.  To overcome this problem, I am commissioning a professional study on the condition of road pavements on regional and county roads and this should be completed by the end of the year.  The overall funding requirements for the restoration programme will be determined at that stage.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he will take to reduce the spiralling number of road fatalities which occurred in 1995 which was a 5 per cent increase on 1994; and his views on whether the relaxation of the previous anti-drink drive measures is partly responsible for this road death increase.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned that, following a period of years in which there was a sustained reduction in road fatalities, the number of people who died as a result of road accidents in 1995 showed an increase on 1994.  I remain committed to a firm course of action to secure the maximum level of safety for road users and I have already indicated publicly and in the House that I am having a full assessment carried out into all aspects of policy which relate to road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no relaxation in the application and enforcement of measures relating to drink driving.  The Road Traffic Act, 1995, provides a link between the penalty imposed and the severity of the offence while retaining the blood alcohol limit of 80 milligrammes. I am satisfied that the 1994 Act, as amended in 1995, continues to <Col N="439" /> provide the basis for effective enforcement.</P>

      <P>No Minister has, since 1963, invoked the powers in section 22 in relation to the co-ordination or variation of development plans, as the adoption of a development plan has always been regarded as primarily the responsibility of the elected local councils.

      <P>Information on the unit cost of local authority housing in the form requested is not readily available.  Local authorities are, however, notified on an annual basis of indicative costs for houses constituting part of their housing programmes.  Where all-in costs do not exceed the relevant figures, an authority may proceed with the construction of the houses without having to obtain the prior approval of the Department. Where costs are greater, the Department's specific approval is required.  The indicative cost figures are revised annually and those for 1996 for one, two, three and four bedroomed non-rural houses and two, three and four bedroomed rural houses are set out in the following tables.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268, 269, and 270 inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the request of the Office of Public Works, reports on the recent flooding incidents in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, <Col N="446" /> and in other areas were sought and obtained by my Department from the local authorities concerned and have been forwarded to that office.  The Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works chairs an interdepartmental committee with responsibility for the co-ordination of a response to the effects of bad weather.</P>
    <P>It has not been the practice in recent years to make special grants to road authorities towards the cost of remedial works to non-national roads and bridges damaged by flooding.  Instead, local authorities have been free to meet such costs from the increased discretionary grants made available to them.  The estimates provision for non-national roads in 1996 will allow for further substantial increases in grant allocations generally. I expect to be in a position to announce the individual allocations in the near future.</P>

      <P>The amounts of rate support grant paid to each local authority in 1995 and notified for 1996, with details of additional grants paid to certain local authorities in 1995, are set out separately in the following tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate support grant replaces in part the income from rates formerly <Col N="448" /> applicable to domestic dwellings, agricultural land and Government property. The initial method of calculating the grant reflected that income &mdash; which varied from local authority to local authority because of differences in valuation levels and in the rate poundages determined by local authorities over the years.  Adjustments in rate support grant allocations to individual authorities over the last decade arose from the elimination of certain levies and statutory demands, the writing off of loans from the local loans fund, and, in 1994 and 1995, measures to reduce debt levels and to deal with other structural problems.</P>
    <P>The selection of those authorities who received an extra grant in 1995, and the determination of the amounts concerned took account of all relevant factors affecting the financial situation of individual authorities and their ability to raise funds locally.  In view of the limited funding available, it would not have been possible to make additional moneys available to all authorities without significantly diluting the impact in all areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 298 and 299 together.  Council Regulation (EC) No. 1164/94 of 16 May 1994 establishing the Cohesion Fund provides that projects to be financed by the Funds shall be adopted by the European Commission in agreement with the member state concerned.  Projects <Col N="466" /> financed by the Fund must meet various requirements set out in the Regulations.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for my Department, and the National Roads Authority in the case of national road projects, to satisfy themselves that projects the subject of applications for assistance from the Fund meet the requirements of the Regulations; a corresponding assessment is made by the Commission in considering applications from member states.  In many cases, discussions take place and/or correspondence is exchanged with the Commission prior to decisions on Cohesion Fund applications. To date, no application in respect of a project within the remit of my Department has been formally refused by the Commission.</P>

The outline sketch scheme submitted by the school authorities is currently being considered and my Department's observations will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible. When all the issues relating to the outline sketch scheme have been fully examined a planning briefing meeting will be arranged between my Department and the school authorities design team to initiate the architectural planning for the project.</P>
      <P>The question of providing capital funds for building will not arise until the planning process has been fully completed. Every effort is being made to have the planning of the extension completed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The position at primary level is that Irish is a compulsory subject except in the case of children who have been educated outside of the State up to the age of 11 years of age.  At second level there is provision, in certain circumstances, for exemption from Irish for children with specific learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>It will be open to the person concerned to seek such an exemption from studying Irish and attending Irish classes when he transfers to a second level school.</P>

Fifty-five remedial teacher posts were allocated to primary schools with effect from September 1995.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of data by my Department's Primary Inspectorate.  This allocation brings the total number of remedial teachers now in place in the primary sector to 1,188.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the schools referred to by the Deputies were not successful on this occasion.  I am keeping the question of further appointments in this area under regular review as resources become available.  I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools in question will be taken fully into account as part of this proces.</P>

      <P>A report carried out by Cooney Carey, business consultants, and submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books. The main recommendation of the report is that book rental schemes are the most practical way of curtailing the cost of school books to parents.  As part of an analysis of book rental schemes, the consultants outlined a number of options which were based on differing assumptions e.g. phasing in of subjects; rental costs; mix of new and second hand books.  Under these options, the cost to schools of purchasing books ranged from £72.06 to £160.00 per pupil <Col N="478" /> at junior cycle and from £54.24 to £185.22 per pupil at senior cycle.</P>
      <P>Seed capital is recognised as a major problem in the setting up of school book rental schemes.  Since the Cooney Carey report was submitted, there have been significant developments in this area. Seed capital was provided for the first time for primary and second level schools in 1994, and continued in 1995. It was targeted at schools which are categorised as disadvantaged.  At second level, £391,000 was allocated as seed capital to such schools in 1994 and £500,000 in 1995.</P>

      <P>In the organisation of school transport services, Bus Éireann plan routes in such a way to ensure that, as far as possible, every pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of timetable, while, at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the <Col N="482" /> most efficient manner.  In order to do this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to schools and, consequently, extended timetables often require some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and to wait for some time in the evenings.</P>
      <P>The arrangement which applies in this case is that a double trip is in operation. The standard of service available here is considered reasonable and in addition &ldquo;a first in to school, first home&rdquo; service is being operated.  In these circumstances it is not open to my Department to offer anything beyond the service available at present.</P>

      <P>The establishment of education boards will involve changing the administrative framework for education. This process will not result in a completely new area of expenditure in addition to the present expenditure levels, but rather will also involve the reallocation of funding and administrative responsibilities within the education system.  In this process, resources will be freed from some areas to help offset resource needs in other areas.</P>
      <P>The gradual transfer of functions to the boards will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs in the context of the Education Estimates for the year in question, within the overall context of the budgetary parameters approved by Government.  It is therefore not possible to be precise at this stage about the costs and savings arising from the establishment of the education boards, taking account of all the relevant factors, when the new arrangements become fully operational.</P>

      <P>On 17 June 1994, there was a decision by the Council of the European Communities authorising the conclusion and signature of a convention defining the Statute of the European Schools.  The revised statute was signed at an Intergovernmental Conference in Luxembourg on 21 June 1994 associated with Council of European Education Ministers.  It is proposed to have a motion in Dáil Éireann early this year to approve the terms of the convention without debate.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will then proceed with the ratification of the convention.</P>

      <P>The 13th assistant's post at St. Pius X girls' national school has been suppressed.  The teacher in question has been redeployed to another school.  The post was provisionally sanctioned for the school in the summer of 1995 because the managerial authorities of the school indicated that the enrolment was set to increase from 387 in September 1994 to 424 pupils in September 1995.  An increase of this magnitude would have qualified the school for developing school status, thus warranting the provisional appointment of an extra assistant.  Unfortunately, the enrolment of the school increased by only three pupils to 390.  In the circumstances, there was no basis for the continuation of the 13th assistant's post at the school.</P>

      <P>My Department does not provide a psychological service for primary schools in the County Meath area at present.  In general, the responsibility for the psychological assessment of children in primary schools, where such is deemed necessary, is a matter for the regional health boards through the appropriate director of community care. Parents may access this service through the school medical service or the family doctor.  My Department has begun to develop a psychological service for primary schools in a limited number of areas, giving priority to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  Parents may access this service, where available, through the school.  However, it will be some time before this service will be in a position to take on responsibility for psychological assessment for educational purposes from the health authorities.</P>

      <P>It would not be open to my Department to extend the service to accommodate the student to whom the Deputy refers, on the basis of the medical evidence submitted.  The pupil in question resides one mile from the existing pick-up point, and is considered to have a good level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme.  Furthermore, the extension of the service would involve substantial extra cost.  However, if more detailed medical evidence is furnished to my Department, the matter may be referred to the medical adviser, and the case re-examined.</P>

The school also applied for an <Col N="508" /> extension requiring major capital expenditure, as did the other post-primary school in the centre.  The combined enrolment of the two schools is around 670, which is an ideal size for a single school development.  In the circumstances, my Department is investigating the possibility of rationalisation in the centre before deciding on the individual building projects, including the provision of grant-aid for physical education facilities at the school in question.  My Department has written to both school managements in the matter seeking their observations regarding rationalisation.</P>

      <P>The criteria used in selecting projects for assistance under last month's allocations for the recreational <Col N="510" /> facilities scheme were the same as that which was publicly advertised for allocations under the scheme in 1994.  The criteria included the priority of the proposed improvement-facility in relation to the organisation's existing facilities; the ability of the organisation to undertake the project; the amount of local funds available; the availability of other facilities in the area and the need to achieve an equitable distribution of funds on a geographical basis and also between the various sporting and community organisations.</P>
      <P>In 1995 £805,000 was provided for the scheme from national lottery funds and £1.3 million from Exchequer funds.  In the 1996 Estimates £1 million has been provided for the scheme from national lottery funds and £1 million from Exchequer funds.  By December 1995 almost 2,000 applications seeking grant aid under the scheme had been received in my Department.  In view of the very large number of applications, the amount of work involved for my officials in listing those applications which did not receive a grant allocation would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>The present position is that all available funds are fully committed to existing projects where grants were allocated in 1995 and in previous years and where claims for payment are due to arise this year.  The assessment of applications in respect of the geographical distribution of funds is undertaken on a county basis with reference to population figures.  All records are filed on a county basis without sub-division within counties.  For this reason it would not be possible to specifically identify projects which are in the general south Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can, however, confirm to the Deputy that 225 applications were received in respect of projects in Dublin city and county and the total grant assistance sought in these applications amounted to £12 million approximately.  A total of 50 projects were selected for assistance and grants totalling £419,000 were allocated which represents 28 million of the available funds compared to 29 per cent of the population in Dublin city and <Col N="511" /> county.  If the Deputy requires information on any specific applications I will arrange to provide this as soon as possible.</P>

None of these sites is owned by the Department.  The provision of a national school in the area was deferred because housing developments were slower than expected and pupil places continued to be available in schools in surrounding areas.  The matter is kept under periodic review by my Department and has been the subject of consultation with the diocesan authorities.</P>
      <P>Schools operating with provisional recognition, such as Gaelscoil Thaobh na Coille, are not entitled to capital grant-aid from my Department for the purchase of sites or provision of accommodation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the covert nature of drug abuse, it is not possible to quantify the scale of this problem in Mountjoy Prison with any degree of certainty.  I have, however, readily acknowledged on several occasions since becoming Minister for Justice that a significant proportion, at least 40 per cent, of the committals to Mountjoy Prison from the courts have a background of drug abuse &mdash; in many cases a chronic heroin addiction.  In order to accurately quantify the extent of this problem and for a number of other reasons, I have recently decided to commission an in-depth study of the Mountjoy Prison population.  This will update the detailed 1986 survey in this connection, which is cited in the book <i>Crime and Punishment in Ireland</i>, published in 1993.  I intend to put the new study into the public domain, when it is to hand, as a Government publication. This study will, I hope, provide new insights into background and nature of the current prisoner population having regard to a wide range of factors including their criminal, socio-economic, health and other backgrounds.  This information will be of considerable assistance in the future management of the prisons and in the refinement and improvement of services for prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding more immediate steps to deal with the problem of drug abuse in the prisons, I have recently implemented a number of measures in Mountjoy and other prisons.  These include, in respect of Mountjoy Prison, the adaptation of the existing visiting arrangements, an improvement in the procedures for searching and the upgrading of video surveillance equipment at the prison.  I have, in addition, decided to expand and improve the visiting facilities at the prison.  All of these <Col N="516" /> measures will greatly assist staff in intercepting illegal drugs and associated contraband. Already, these new arrangements have resulted in a number of drug seizures and some prosecutions of visitors are pending.</P>
    <P>There is also in place, in all of the institutions since last year, a comprehensive integrated education programme aimed at discouraging drug abuse and educating prisoners as to the risks posed both to themselves and their families by the activity.  The programme is based on a multi-disciplinary approach utilising the most modern education aids available including the specially commissioned award winning video, &ldquo;HIV and Aids &mdash; The Facts&rdquo;. In order to be effective, treatment for addicts whether in prison or in the community must also include a therapeutic element in order to equip them with the mechanism to avoid becoming reinvolved with drug-abuse in the future.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I have already announced a range of measures which will, when fully implemented, meet this need.  These measures include the creation of a drug treatment facility in Mountjoy Prison.  This facility will provide prisoners who are suffering from acute drug addiction problems and who show the necessary commitment with an opportunity to avail of a humane detoxification programme on a par with what is available in the community.  A methadone maintenance programme for those prisoners assessed as medically suitable for it will also be provided in this facility which is likely to be located at the health care unit in Mountjoy Prison, which is currently being refurbished after a fire.</P>
    <P>I have also approved the opening of a drug-free facility in the Mountjoy Prison complex.  This will be located at the prison's training unit.  Prisoners with a background of drug addiction, including those who successfully complete the detoxification programme and who show the necessary commitment, will be able to benefit from a sympathetic yet closely monitored regime where a <Col N="517" /> specially designed and structured therapy programme will play a key role in their long-term recovery.  This facility will also enable the prison authorities to accommodate those prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse in a totally drug free and secure environment within the prison system.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious to put in place a more structured approach for drug abusers in the general prison population, such as the availability of methadone for those already on programmes when they enter prison.  However, it is hoped that such people will opt for either of the two new facilities &mdash; the treatment unit or the drug-free unit.</P>
    <P>These measures, which I am planning to have in place in the next few months, represent a comprehensive and realistic response to the extremely complex problem of drugs and drug abuse in the prisons which, it should be remembered, is unfortunately a direct reflection of what is happening in the community as a whole.</P>

      <Quest>if she will have investigations made into the procedure used to allocate the laundry contract at Loughan House which has led to loss of jobs in the private sector; the action, if any, she proposes to take to prevent a recurrence of the position where public bodies who have all equipment grant aided compete against private companies who receive no such assistance.</Quest>

      <P>In accordance with normal Government procurement practice, the contract for the provision of laundry and dry cleaning services to Loughan House is awarded annually, following competitive tendering.  In October 1995 all known contractors within a 40 mile radius and any others who had expressed an interest were invited to tender for the current contract.  Four responses were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the need to obtain <Col N="518" /> the best value for the prison service, and to the Department of Finance guidelines in these matters, the contract was awarded to the contractor which submitted the lowest tender.  It is the taxpayer's money which is used to finance any facility such as Loughan House and there is a responsibility to ensure that the lowest but, nonetheless, effective contractor gets the contract.  The Department of Finance's guidelines do not preclude public bodies from competing with private firms for the award of such contracts.</P>

      <P>The Government decided to defer the provision of Castlerea Prison and to defer beyond 1996 the new women's prison. This decision was taken in June 1995 in the context of a comprehensive review of budget proposals for 1996, conducted at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently reviewing the whole question of prison accomodation needs for both male and female offenders and I will, in due course, place any proposals I may have, arising from this review, before the Government for consideration. With respect to the interim report <Col N="519" /> which I received some weeks ago from the interdepartmental committee set up last June and which was due to report to me by December 1995, the contents of that report have been taken into consideration in the preparation of my proposals which I am finalising at the moment.</P>

      <P>Current legislation does not provide for the seizure of drugs by Naval Service personnel and, accordingly, no such seizures have been made.  Seizures of drugs at sea in operations in which the Garda and the Naval Service are involved are, in all circumstances, made by gardaí.</P>
      <P>The co-operation between the Navy and Garda has been excellent and has resulted in sizeable amounts of controlled drug seizures over the previous two years.  Since 1994 the following seizures had a Naval input:&mdash; (a)  Seizure of 700 Kgs of cannabis resin at Bally-conneely, County Galway on 9 July 1994; (b)  Seizure of 15,000 Kgs of cannabis resin at Urlingford, County Kilkenny on 8 November 1995.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has approved my proposal to designate certain Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers for the purpose of Part V of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in connection with drug trafficking offences at sea.  This will include a power to stop, board and search a ship, and anyone on it, to arrest without warrant anyone suspected of a drug trafficking offence and to seize and detain anything found on the ship which appears to an enforcement officer to be evidence of such an offence.</P>

      <P>Subhead C of Vote 19 caters for payments in respect of criminal legal aid.</P>
      <P>The cost of the criminal legal aid scheme is dependent on a number of factors including the fees payable under the scheme and that the two main determinants of expenditure in the scheme remain outside my control and cannot be easily anticipated.  These are the decisions to grant legal aid by the court and the actual cost arising in any particular case which depends on the number of counsel appointed by the courts, the fees paid by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the prosecution counsel and the length of the trial.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £6.5 million was made in the 1995 Estimates.  However, the provisional outturn for 1995 shows that the actual expenditure on the criminal legal aid scheme in 1995 was £7.988 million.  This is 13 per cent above the actual expenditure figure for 1994. These trends and the continuing increase in the number of claims being made &mdash; from 15,479 in 1990 to 28,564 in 1995 &mdash; were taken into account by my Department when framing the 1996 Estimates.  On this basis it is anticipated that £9.322 million will be required in 1996 to defray the cost of claims under the criminal legal aid scheme.  While this amount is 43 per cent greater than the provision made in the 1995 Estimate, it is 16 per cent above the provisional outturn of £7.988 million for 1995 and is in keeping with increases in actual expenditure on the scheme in the previous two years.</P>

    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Government Chief Whip last week published information relating to the Government's legislation programme. The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) <Col N="525" /> Bill is included in the list of Bills which the Government expects to publish prior to Easter.  The material published by the Government Chief Whip also contained an updated list of promised legislation which includes Bills which are being actively worked on and which will be published as soon as the necessary consultative, drafting and other procedures allow, some of which may become available before Easter.  In relation to proposals under preparation in my Department, that list included the Criminal Law Bill, the Offences against the Person Bill, the Juvenile Justice (Children) Bill, the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill, the Criminal Law (United Nations Convention against Torture) Bill, the Fundraising for Charitable and Other Purposes Bill, the Fraud Offences Bill, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, and the Garda Representative Association Bill.</P>
    <P>When legislative proposals are finalised in these &mdash; and other areas for which I have responsibility &mdash; they will, of course, be announced in the normal way.</P>

    <P>Rules of Court are initiated and drafted by the rules making committees of the various courts and are then submitted to the Minister for Justice for concurrence.  When the Rules are signed by the Minister, they are given statutory effect in Statutory Instruments.

    <P>(v)  Draft consolidated District Court Rules.</P>
    <P>2.  Coroners Fees and Expenses Regulations.</P>
    <P>3.  Courts (Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pensions) (Judiciary) Scheme.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of my Department is as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  Council Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 deals with the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.  The Directive is to be implemented by member states by October 1998.  It is considered that legislation will be necessary to enable Ireland to implement the Directive and it is the intention to introduce such legislation in good time to meet the implementation date required by the Directive.</P>
      <P>2.  Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 deals with the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.  The Directive has been implemented by the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and as regards Article 11 of the Directive, by administrative measures.  Article 11 deals with the establishment by credit and financial institutions of internal control procedures and employee training programmes. Consideration is being given to placing the requirements of Article 11 on a statutory basis.</P>

    <P>3.  Three EC Directives relating to Rights of Residence for Non-Economically Active Persons: Rights of Residence for students (93/96 EEC); retired persons (90/365/EEC) and other inactive persons (90/364 EEC)) were transposed into Irish law by Statutory <Col N="535" /> Instrument, namely, the European Communities (Rights of Residence for Non-Economically Active Persons) Regulations, 1993.  A further revision of these regulations is required as my Department has been advised that certain aspects were considered by the European Commission to be incompatible with European law. Revised draft regulations are at present being discussed with the other Departments concerned in this matter.</P>

      <P>The number of prisoners currently in Portlaoise is about 140.  The prison could technically accommodate 207 but, due to the use of part of the prison for paramilitary prisoners, it is organised somewhat differently to other closed prisons. There is a high degree of segregation, based on the different groupings in the prison.  Due to this segregation, a number of cells are required for purposes such as education, workshops, etc. and toilet facilities.  A number of cells are tied down in this way.  At present there are 107 prisoners in Portlaoise for crimes other than paramilitary offences, such as murder, burglary etc.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing the options that may be open to me in regard to all prison places at present.  I will bring my proposals to Government where decisions will be made in the near future.</P>

      <P>In the courts, when a judge hands down fines as penalties, the sanction of prison for periods of two days to three months approximately is always part of the judge's decision where the fines are not paid.  This sanction is only used where people refuse to pay fines or where the gardaí have made a number of attempts to collect the fines to no avail.  The number of persons committed for non-payment of fines in 1992, the latest year for which accurate figures are available, was 1,342 which represents 14 per cent of total committals for that year.  Indications are that in 1993 the percentage of committals which were for non-payment of fines rose slightly to about 17 per cent.  However, it should be noted that many of those committed under such warrants make payment either on, or shortly after, committal and are then released.  On any one day, persons actually imprisoned for non-payment of fines represent less than 1 per cent of the prison population, that is, 20 people. The total committals would form part of the statistical base but, in the event, most would not have actually served time in prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 399, 455 and 456 together.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge fully the concerns of residents in the area of Loughan House. Senior officials from my Department will be meeting with them later this week in this respect.  The long-standing extensive contact between the prison Governor and local residents on security issues will be maintained and indeed enhanced in the wake of this forthcoming meeting.  I have also asked for a full review of security at Loughan House.</P>
      <P>It is important, however, to keep those concerns in context.  Loughan House is an open prison.  This means, essentially, two things.  One, there is a relatively low level of physical security and, two, the regimes in the prison are such as to encourage trust and responsibility. The two things are related.</P>
      <P>As regards security, for example, there is no secure perimeter wall around the house, although it has been suggested by some commentators that a wall should be built there.  A wall would undoubtedly secure the perimeter but it would not secure the building which was never intended to provide secure lockup facilities.  If such secure measures were to be introduced, then Loughan House would no longer serve its purpose as an open prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The philosophy on which open prisons generally are based is that they provide a regime which encourages the building of trust between the authorities and the prisoner and also encourages the prisoner to accept normal personal responsibilities albeit in a controlled <Col N="539" /> environment.  A fundamental test of that trust and responsibility is whether the prisoner is prepared to voluntarily stay in an institution from which he could, if he was determined enough, abscond. The current regime in Loughan House is working well.  Recently quite inaccurate figures have been bandied about in the media and at local meetings about abscondings from the house.  For the record, in 1995 8 per cent absconded or, put another way, 92 per cent of the prisoners honoured the trust that was placed in them and discharged the responsibilities demanded of them, that is, of the 528 who spent time in Loughan House in 1995, 487 served out their time there.  The average number of abscondments is 6 per cent-8 per cent over the years 1993, 1994, 1995.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue of the staffing levels in Loughan House, they are high for an open prison regime.  I have instructed my Department to look at the Loughan House security situation not only in the context of the concerns expressed by local people about abscondings but also in the context of its contribution to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the prison system as a whole.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel to individual areas.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current strength of Laytown station is one sergeant and three gardaí.  There is a patrol car allocated to Laytown station and it is utilised in patrolling the sub-district, including the coastal area referred to by the Deputy.  Garda coverage in the area is augmented by the district patrol car from Drogheda station. In addition, the traffic corps and detective branch based at Drogheda also patrol the area.  I also understand that three additional gardaí were assigned to Drogheda station on 15 December 1995 <Col N="542" /> and this will improve the policing service being provided to the Laytown area.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the District Officer at Drogheda has assigned three gardaí to the full-time investigation of crime in the district, which includes the Laytown sub-district.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that local Garda management continually review the policing arrangements in place for Laytown sub-district with a view to ensuring that optimum use is made of all available resources to prevent and detect crime in the area.</P>

      <P>A competition was advertised by the Civil Service Commission in April 1994 for the recruitment of gardaí during the period 1995 to 1997.  Over 15,000 applications were received, of which 11,000 met the educational requirements. These underwent a written test conducted by the Civil Service Commission, of which 6,270 reached the minimum standard, and were placed into 21 groups of approximately 300.  Up to and including group eight have been interviewed at the present time.  The current indications are that there will be sufficiently qualified applicants from these eight groups to fill the recruitment quota.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say at this stage when the next recruitment competition to the Garda Síochána will be held, but it is unlikely to take place until the latter part of 1997.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for <Col N="546" /> the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources to different areas. They have informed me that the present strength at the stations concerned is as follows: Whitehall, 45; Santry, 83; Coolock, 95; Raheny, 71; Clontarf, 57; Fitzgibbon Street, 117; Store Street, 192.</P>
      <P>Whitehall, Santry, Coolock, Raheny and Clontarf form part of the Dublin north division while Fitzgibbon Street and Store Street form part of the Dublin north central division.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the Divisional Officers of both of these divisions are satisfied that the policing requirements of their respective divisions are being met with the present deployment of personnel and resources. They are also satisfied that the areas concerned are receiving adequate foot patrol by members of the Garda Síochána. They report that every effort is being made to ensure that foot patrols are maintained and that they are directed and prioritised in response to crime trends.  They have assured me that these arrangements are kept under continual review and any changes considered necessary are made.</P>
      <P>I have been assured that the neighbourhood watch schemes in the areas concerned are fully supported by the gardaí.  Members who are assigned to neighbourhood policing units patrol their respective areas on foot and keep in constant contact with area co-ordinators and they also attend neighbourhood watch meetings.  In addition, they regularly liaise with local residents and the business community.  The Garda authorities inform me that every effort is availed of by the Garda Síochána to actively encourage the setting up of neighbourhood watch schemes and every opportunity is pursued to build on existing schemes.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that my Department has recently carried out a review of the law as regards renewals of pub/dance hall licences, together with an examination of systems of control for unlicensed premises in situations where drug sale and, or abuse is suspected.  It is my intention to bring forward appropriate legislation to deal with the issues raised in this review as soon as possible. This legislation will include updating of the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, particularly in relation to the operation of so-called &ldquo;rave&rdquo; dance events.  The Garda already make submissions at the licensing courts in September each year if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of business in some premises.  It is then a matter for the judge to decide whether a licence should be renewed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 418, to 422, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General statutory authority for the release of sentenced prisoners rests with the Minister for Justice under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  While I personally make the decision in many <Col N="550" /> cases, for administrative reasons this is not always possible.  Where I personally do not authorise a release, the decision is taken by a senior official of my Department, and this is what occurred in the case referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am constrained from giving all the details of this case, as criminal proceedings are in train.  In all the circumstances, I can, however, provide some general background information about what transpired.</P>
    <P>In the course of 1995, a prisoner who had been serving a six-year sentence, with effect from 15 January 1994, and who was due for release, with normal remission, in August 1998, applied to the prison authorities for the grant of full temporary release to join his family who are now residing in Sydney, Australia.</P>
    <P>The prisoner made the case that this would afford him the opportunity to leave behind the criminal associations which had led him into his previous offences.  The response to the prisoner's request was that his application would be considered if he obtained the necessary travel documentation.  The air ticket was purchased from money sent by his family in Australia.  In all the circumstances, a decision was taken that the prisoner could be granted full temporary release on the condition, which he accepted, that he would reside henceforth with his family in Sydney. The prisoner knew that any deviation from this condition would invalidate his temporary release.  All these arrangements came to a conclusion in December 1995 and his release took place on 20 December 1995.</P>
    <P>The Australian authorities were not consulted or informed by the prison authorities about his proposed release as the condition of temporary release did not require such actions.</P>
    <P>On 20 December 1995 the prisoner was brought, under escort, to a local bank branch where he withdrew the money, forwarded by his family, to buy the ticket and thence to the travel agents and Dublin Airport where he <Col N="551" /> was put on board the airplane by prison staff, who remained there until the plane took off.</P>
    <P>The flight in question was to Amsterdam and the prisoner's ticket provided for the onward flight from Amsterdam to Sydney.  It has since been established that the prisoner did not travel onwards to Sydney, but in fact flew to London and subsequently returned from there to Ireland, where he was arrested by the Garda in Waterford on 4 January 1996. He is now back in custody in Limerick Prison.</P>

The information sought by the Deputy, which will involve the manual examination of up to 8,000 files, cannot be obtained in the time available.  As much of the information that can be obtained will be collated and forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  However, I can inform the Deputy that it is not the practice that prisoners serving sentences for rape, incest, indecent assault or indecent assault on a minor (Questions Nos. 427 to 430 and 435 to 438) are given temporary release, even for such things as funerals of close family members.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 447 and 448 together.</P>
      <P>Full temporary release which is sometimes referred to as early release, under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, is, in effect, our system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems in similar jurisdictions worldwide and has been used by all Ministers since 1960. In the case of offenders who are serving sentences for crimes involving violence or the threat of violence, the risk which a particular release might pose to the community is carefully assessed in consultation with the prison authorities and any other relevant agencies.  A person on early release is under condition until the sentence time is over and can be rearrested without warrant if, during that period, they are caught in the commission of a crime.  It is generally accepted that there are benefits attached to the community if an offender is re-integrated in a planned way.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="556" /> Under the Explosives Act, 1875, a licence is required to be issued by my Department for the importation of fireworks. It is long-standing policy that such licences are only issued for organised public fireworks displays, conducted by professional operators, which have been approved in advance by both the Garda Síochána and the local fire officer.</P>
      <P>It is clear, however, that despite these legal restrictions, fireworks continue to be imported and to be used illegally, especially at Hallowe'en.  Because of the dangers posed by the unlawful use of fireworks, the Garda Síochána have with a great deal of success, always taken strong measures, to cut off the supply of illegally imported fireworks and to prevent their use.  I am satisfied that the law does not need changing and that the best approach to the fireworks problem is to continue and, where possible, intensify Garda preventative measures.</P>

      <P>Five non-nationals were naturalised in 1995 in accordance with the procedures in place since July 1994 for processing investment based naturalisation applications. For the Deputy's information, these procedures require, <i>inter-alia</i>, that each application be subject to a rigorous assessment by an interdepartmental advisory group which makes a recommendation to me whether or not naturalisation should be granted, that each applicant invest a minimum of £1 million in an Irish company for the purpose of saving/creating jobs, that he or she be of good character, and so on.</P>

    <P>In addition to these five cases, another 11 persons were also naturalised in 1995 on foot of their investments <Col N="557" /> in the State.

      <P>Under section 171 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, people in full-time education are excluded from entitlement to assistance, including rent supplement, under the SWA scheme.  However, there are a number of exceptions to this exclusion. Persons participating in a vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS); a second level initiative scheme; a third level allowance scheme; and a part-time education initiative scheme may continue to receive their full weekly payment and may retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplement under the SWA scheme, which they may have been receiving prior to participating on one of these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for the vocational training opportunities scheme and the second level initiative scheme are that the applicant must be at least 21 years of age and must have been in receipt of an unemployment payment or lone parent allowance for at least six months.  Until recently, an applicant for the third level allowance scheme had to be at least 23 years of age and in receipt of an unemployment payment or lone parent allowance for at <Col N="561" /> least 12 months in order to be eligible for the scheme.  However, in 1995 I announced an improvement to the qualifying conditions for the third level allowance scheme.  The age requirement has been reduced to 21 years of age and an applicant need only be in receipt of an unemployment payment or lone parent allowances for six months in order to qualify for the scheme.  The cost of extending entitlement to supplementary welfare rent allowances to all lone parents in full-time education would have resources implications which I am unable to meet at present but I intend to keep this matter under review.</P>

Any reduction in the pension age of old age contributory or retirement pensions or the creation of an early retirement option would have major financial implications and I have no plans, at present either to lower the age generally or to bring in special early retirement provisions for the categories mentioned by the Deputy or for any other category of worker.</P>

      <P>The essence of the proposal <Col N="563" /> referred to by the Deputy is the setting up of a co-operative project involving 400 long-term unemployed people. Each person would have £10 per week deducted from his or her unemployment assistance payment and this money would be put into a central fund which would be used to provide participants with foodstuffs and winter fuel supplies. Each person would retain the remainder of their unemployment payment for the duration of the project.</P>
      <P>My Department first became aware of the project in July last and in October last received detailed proposals from the project organiser regarding the way it would operate.  My Department's response was to reply to the project organiser enclosing information on the back to work allowance scheme which allows unemployed people and lone parents to seek out job opportunities both in paid employment and selfemployment while retaining a percentage of their payments from my Department for up to three years.  Secondary benefits, such as the fuel allowance, are also retained.  Subsequently, the project organiser wrote a further letter to my Department expressing disappointment at the Department's response. However, it would be my Department's view that similarities do exist between what is being proposed and what is currently available under the back to work allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>When I met the promoters in Kilkenny I assured them that, the proposals will be borne in mind, in the context of the development of the employment support schemes operated by my Department and measures for the long-term unemployed generally.  On foot of the Deputy's inquiry I will have the regional staff discuss the project again with the promoters to assess whether or not the proposals are practicable.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 468 to 472, inclusive, together.  The information requested by the Deputy is as follows.  The increase <Col N="565" /> in Subhead D &mdash; child benefit, is due mainly to the carry over costs of the 1995 budget improvements &mdash; the monthly increase of £7 per child and the extension of the scheme to 18 year olds in full time education and on certain FÁS courses.  The increase in Subhead G &mdash; lone parent's allowance, is due mainly to provision for a projected increase of over 5,000 in the number of recipients.</P>
      <P>The increase in Subhead L &mdash; carer's allowance, is due mainly to provision for a projected increase of over 2,000 in the number of recipients.  Responsibility for funding disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) was transferred to the Department of Social Welfare from 1 August 1995.  The increase in Subhead N arises mainly from the provision for full year funding in 1996 in the Social Welfare Vote, compared to five months funding in 1995.</P>
      <P>The decrease in Subhead S &mdash; grants for community and voluntary service (Exchequer funded), is due to the fact that the 1995 outturn includes special grants to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Protestant Aid, which are not provided for in the 1996 Abridged Estimates. The Abridged Version of the Estimates for Public Expenditure does not include the costs of the 1996 budget improvements.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, which provide for the necessary changes in the social welfare code to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced, have not yet commenced.  One of these provisions, namely section 10 (3), contains regulatory powers to determine the circumstances in which a person is or is not to be regarded as wholly or mainly maintaining another person.  I intend to commence this subsection shortly and a draft of the relevant regulations is currently being prepared.  The commencement order to bring the remaining provisions into effect will be made to coincide with the proposed enactment of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill which is expected, subject to the <Col N="567" /> outcome of the referendum petition, to be introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform before Easter.</P>
      <P>Another provision which has not been brought into effect is section 22 of the Social Welfare Act, 1995, which deals with the question of payments for people who are absent from the State or imprisoned.  This provision, which contains regulatory powers, was designed to standardise the arrangements applying in the various social welfare schemes.  A draft of the relevant regulations is being prepared and I propose to commence this section as soon as these regulations are finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 479 and 480 together.  To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions <Col N="571" /> paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions (or 24 in the case of a retirement pension) registered since January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect), or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>The condition in relation to entry to insurance at least ten years before pension age has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961. The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to self-employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people. Accordingly, self-employed people, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They are, of course covered for survivors' and orphans pensions.</P>
      <P>Social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account in satisfying the first two conditions but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.  In this regard it is relevant to point out that prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable. These were national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions. These contributions gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid <Col N="572" /> prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of the satisfying of the yearly average test.  However, they are still reckonable for the other two conditions. Self-employed people who were over 56 in 1988 and who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could combine that insurance with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.  Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard, costings done in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50-year period. Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System&rdquo; puts forward, <i>inter alia,</i> a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over <Col N="573" /> an insured lifetime and also recommended that the arrangement regarding pre-1953 contributions should be abolished. It also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension be increased from 156 (three years) to 520 (ten years) contributions.  These proposals which relate to a wider range of <i>pro rata</i> pensions, require careful consideration before specific provisions are brought forward.  Furthermore, the additional resources required would have to be examined in the context of the overall future funding of pensions.  I am not yet, therefore, in a position to indicate precisely when these provisions are likely to be introduced.  While I, in principle, favour a <i>pro-rata</i> pension approach, I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions (or 24 in the case of a retirement pension) registered since January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect), or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The yearly average condition gives rise to particular problems for people with gaps in their insurance records.  A number of these problems have been addressed by my Department in recent years.  Measures taken include, <i>inter alia:</i> in 1988 when the self-employed were brought into insurance for the first time <Col N="574" /> those self-employed people who had previous insurance were allowed to use April 1988 as their date of entry into insurance if this was to their advantage; in 1991 <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for people with `mixed insurance' records were introduced, the rate of pension payable being in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age or retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>Regarding the petition referred to by the Deputy, the people involved have insurance paid at both the full and modified rates and, accordingly, are likely to qualify for a <i>pro-rata</i> pension under the provisions introduced in 1991. All persons applying for an old age contributory pension including self-employed contributors must satisfy the qualification conditions.  In certain circumstances any contributor may qualify with ten years' contributions or less but this would depend on the circumstances of each individual case.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board (NPB) report `Developing the National Pension System' recommended a <i>pro-rata</i> pension scheme, which, in its view, would resolve the problems arising from gaps in coverage in a more comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>The NPB report recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> a wider range of <i>pro rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime, where, for example an average of 45 or over (as against 48 at present) would qualify a person for the maximum rate of pension while a minimum 30 per cent of full rate pension would be payable for an average of ten to 14 contributions.  It also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for retirement and old age contributory pension be increased from 156 (three years) to 520 contributions (ten years).  As such proposals could lead to a reduction in entitlement for future pensioners, when compared with present arrangements, they have to be evaluated very carefully.</P>
    <P>The NPB report, which is both comprehensive and complex, is at present being studied in detail within my <Col N="575" /> Department.  I will bring forward proposals on the issues addressed in the report based on these detailed considerations taking account of the future financing of pensions provision.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 482 and 483 together.  The free schemes administered by my Department include free travel, free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence.  They are available, in the case of free telephone rental allowance and free electricity allowance, to persons who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.</P>
      <P>The free schemes have been improved and extended progressively in recent years.  In 1994, for example, a pensioner being cared for by a recipient of the carer's allowance was allowed to retain eligibility for the free telephone rental allowance.  Previously, this was discontinued because the living alone condition ceased to be satisfied.  Also, in 1994, the free electricity allowance scheme was extended to include night storage electricity schemes.  This extension allows unused daytime units to be offset against the cost of night time units.  The question of further extending the scope of the free telephone rental and electricity allowance schemes arises for consideration in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>In recent years there has been a noticeable shift in work patterns towards part-time working.  It would appear that work patterns are changing in this direction permanently, in line with the demand of industry and enterprise nationally and world-wide. The number of regular part-time jobs as a percentage of total jobs has risen from 4 per cent 20 years ago to nearly 10 per cent at present.  As the Deputy will be aware part-time workers who earn £30 or over per week pay class A contributions since April 1991 (it was £25 per week when introduced).  There are now about 27,000 part-time workers, mostly women, covered by PRSI.  They have the full protection of the social insurance system and will be entitled, among other things, to retirement and to old age contributory pensions &mdash; subject, of course, to the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> In recent speeches I have raised the issue of the importance of occupational pension cover for this group and in particular that they should be afforded the same access as their full-time counter-parts to such occupational pension schemes.  The demographic patterns indicate a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population over the first half of the next century.  This will have a significant impact on the future costs of social welfare pensions, which are set to increase by some 100 per cent by the year 2035.</P>
    <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo; raised and considered all the major issues in relation to pensions. In relation to social welfare it recommended a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions based on the average number of contributions over an insured life-time. This report is being considered within my Department at present and I intend to bring forward proposals based on the recommendations of the report. A major survey of occupational pension schemes, which was recommended by the National Pensions Board, has been commissioned jointly by my Department and the pensions board and a report will be available by the middle of this year.  The last major survey was carried out in 1985 and the results of this new survey will give essential up-to-date information on occupational cover, including cover for part-time and atypical workers which will be of considerable assistance when proposals in relation to pensions are being formu-lated. The whole issue of pensions in the future, including those relating to part-time and atypical workers, is one we cannot afford to ignore.  Provided we face up, over the next few years, to the needs which we know will arise because of the demographic changes and the changes in work patterns, we can plan to deal with them in an orderly and effective way.</P>

Free travel is available to all persons resident in the State aged 66 years or over and to certain disabled people under the age of 66.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 1994, employers' pay related social insurance (PRSI) was applied at a standard rate of 12.2 per cent, subject to an annual ceiling, on all wages regardless of the level of weekly earnings.  A lower, incentive, rate of employers' PRSI of 9 per cent was introduced in the 1994 budget to reduce the burden of PRSI in low wage employments only.  This reduction in PRSI was confined to low wage employments in order to make the best use of the available funds by maximising the relief given in respect of each job that qualifies. The maximum wage levels that qualify for the incentive rate of employers' PRSI in 1995-96 is £231 per week.  Jobs paying wages above that level attract employers' PRSI at the standard rate.</P>
      <P>The situation the Deputy refers to occurs when the wages offered by an employer are the maximum that qualifies for the incentive rate of employers' PRSI.  When wages are greater than £231 per week (1995-96), the standard rate of employers' PRSI (12.2 per cent in 1995-96) applies on all wages.  This is an inevitable consequence of a tiered rate structure of this nature.</P>
      <P>Modifications to the present employer PRSI would have budgetary implications.  These and other features of the system will be reviewed in 1996 in the light of the Report of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare.</P>

      <P>Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel as the recipients of social welfare type payments in respect of a disability and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.  The free travel companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.  The majority of companion pass holders are either blind or mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>At present the passes are available to the following: recipients of blind person's pension from my Department, people getting disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board who are medically certified that they are unfit to travel alone, recipients of invalidity pension from my Department who are medically certified that they are permanently wheelchair bound and free travel passholders who are being cared for by a recipient of the carer's allowance. It is a condition of the scheme that the passholder be accompanied by the able-bodied person.  Any extension of the scheme which would enable the companion to travel alone, even for short periods, would have cost implications which would have to be examined in the context of available resources.</P>

My Department is also involved in the negotiations on a multilateral agreement on investment which are taking place at the OECD.</P>

The results are subject to ratification in the period up to 30 June 1996 and would come into effect immediately thereafter.  The organisation responsible for the agreement is the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Schedules containing the commitments to be taken on by the European Communities and their member states were submitted to the WTO in Geneva, Switzerland, in July 1995.  The European Commission is expected to make a proposal to the EU Council of Ministers on ratification in the next few weeks.

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, is the primary vehicle for grant aiding tourism projects.  In the case of tourist accommodation, the programme does not, generally, provide support for new accommodation stock as the market would normally be expected to respond to commercial opportunities.  However, recognising that there are a number of market segments where the quality of existing accommodation is deficient, the operational programme does include provision to assist, on a selective basis, investment in, for example, caravan and camping sites and accommodation at recognised outdoor pursuit centres.  The programme also includes provision for assistance for the development of accommodation-related conference and leisure facilities.  While EU programmes operated by other Departments may provide support for smaller tourism accommodation initiatives, it is my understanding that, in line with the thrust of the Operational Programme for Tourism, the scope for assisting new accommodation projects is limited.</P>

The Company Law Review Group, which submitted its report to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, examined the recommendation of the Ryan Commission and other proposals and recommended that <Col N="589" /> legislation be introduced to require public limited companies to make, as a minimum requirement, the following disclosures: directors' remuneration comprising all fees, salaries, pension contributions and other benefits and emoluments paid to directors; aggregate figures for the performance element of the remuneration of executive directors stated separately and information on share option schemes including size of the scheme, number of options outstanding, number of options held by individual directors and the range of exercise prices and applicable dates.</P>

Subsequent developments, such as the publication of the Greenbury Report in the UK, will naturally be taken into account.  It should be noted that the Greenbury Report does not recommend legislation, but has proposed a code of best practice.</P>

      <P>I have recently received the Dublin Chamber of Commerce report entitled &ldquo;Small Enterprise &mdash; Clearing the Path for Growth&rdquo;.  The chamber of commerce in its report makes two proposals on ways to ease the bureaucracy on small business.  The chamber proposes, first, a simplified <Col N="591" /> form of corporate entity, the close corporation, and secondly, the adoption of a procedure to identify in advance the cost to business of complying with proposed legislation, compliance cost assessment.</P>
      <P>The close corporation proposal is based on a South African model which came into effect in 1984.  In Ireland, the Company Law Review Group looked at the question of a new category of limited liability company, but decided that this issue would require detailed consideration. It recommended that &ldquo;the application of company law to small companies be considered in a future phase of the Company Law Review Group's work or by some other specially constituted advisory group&rdquo;. Phase II of the review group's work will commence when current initiatives to implement the recommendations in phase I have been progressed.</P>
      <P>The proposal on &ldquo;compliance cost assessment&rdquo; is currently being considered by the small business and services division of my Department in its work to reduce the administrative burden on firms.  This Government is committed to a policy of assisting small business and I have arranged to meet with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce shortly to discuss its report in greater detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subhead L3 of Vote 34 of the 1996 Estimates provides for expenditures under the small business operational programme which was approved by the European Commission on 26 July 1995 and launched in September 1995.  The overall aim of this programme is to contribute to improving the operating environment for small business through the pursuit of five specific measures supported by standard technical assistance under measure six of the programme.</P>
      <P>Measure one of the operational programme is a priority measure aimed at providing access to finance to small business and service firms.  It responds to a need identified and given priority by the small business task force which reported in 1994.  Through this measure, funding from the European Union, the Exchequer and participating banks is used to subsidise the interest on long-term loans to small business and services firms.  The access to finance scheme, launched in September 1995 under the measure, provides £208 million in long-term loan finance at a subsidised rate of 6.5 per cent over seven years to small firms, i.e. those with less than 50 employees or with an annualturnover of less than £3 million.  The scheme is delivered through almost 1,000 branches of Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, National Irish Bank and Ulster Bank and drawndown of funds can take place up to 31 December, 1996.  The success of the scheme is evident from the interest shown by small business through applications to participate in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> Measure two is designed to improve the accessibility of public markets to small business by addressing the problems experienced by small business on both the supply side and the demand side of public procurement.  Small businesses will benefit from this measure through greater access to the target markets.  Details of specific actions under measure two will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Measure 3 seeks to improve the business organisation and strategic focus of services firms, particularly in higher technology sectors, and provides for a programme of actions for services firms which have growth/employment creation potential but do not currently qualify for assistance under Forbairt's international services programme.  This measure, to be delivered by Forbairt, will assist services firms through a coordinated and linked series of actions, which will identify those service sectors with most potential for business and job growth and determine the dynamics that drive these high potential sectors; promote new start-ups and develop existing service businesses-assistance will be provided to companies to help bridge the gap which often occurs between the feasibility study phase and the implementation of a business project; introduce networks of business alliances and partners to Irish service firms with particular emphasis paid to companies regarded as having high potential for growth and support a number of strategic initiatives which are aimed at companies offering electronic information services targeted at SMEs.</P>
    <P>Measure four reflects the difficulty experienced by small businesses in keeping fully abreast of developments in their business environment.  The small business and services division of my Department, in close consultation with the small business sector, is in the process of drawing up a programme of practical research designed to facilitate the production of a series of manuals of best practice for small firms in a userfriendly and accessible format.  The research work and preparation of these <Col N="594" /> manuals will be put to tender in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Measure five will support a number of pilot projects for small business designed to improve business know-how and the business environment.  A number of projects have been proposed under this measure which will be assessed on their individual merits and successful proposals will come on stream over the coming months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 511 to 514, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Advisory Group on Partnership and Change in the Workplace, which was established last March in my Department under the chairmanship of the Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs, has formally met on three occasions.  The Minister has also conferred with members of the group on an individual basis.  The group comprises the social partners, the industrial agencies and experts in the areas of industrial relations and manufacturing operations.  The organisations represented are Forfás, IDA Ireland, Forbairt, the Labour Relations Commission, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with the Unit for Partnership in Enterprise &mdash; also established in my Department last March &mdash; the advisory group is focusing on the identification of obstacles to the achievement of change in work organisation, the <Col N="596" /> formulation of models of partnership in the workplace which could be translated into individual firms and the consideration of initiatives to stimulate greater participation.</P>
    <P>In the context of these initiatives to encourage the development of partnership at the level of the enterprise, the Irish Productivity Centre secured approval in April 1995 for a £1.15 million project &mdash;&ldquo;New Forms of Work Organisation&rdquo;&mdash; under the European Social Fund.  The project, which is now under way, includes: development of an assessment model on the need and potential for change; application of new forms of work in at least ten enterprises and dissemination of the experience gained so that enterprises generally can learn and benefit from the project.</P>
    <P>The question of social and eco audits is not a matter for the advisory group. However, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, that the EU Environmental Management and Audit Scheme, EMAS, was established in Ireland during 1995.  EMAS is now being actively promoted with a key role being played by the national competent authority, the National Accreditation Board.  Any further questions in this regard should properly be addressed to the Minister for the Environment.  The unit is examining training needs as part of its ongoing work.</P>

      <P>The 1996 Estimates for my Department provide £19.736 million to cover the running costs of the county enterprise boards.  In total, almost £18.5 million has been provided in grants by the 35 CEBs since their establishment, resulting in the creation of over 4,000 full-time and 850 part-time jobs.  An additional sum of £1.389 million was provided to boards in 1995 to facilitate their soft support activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> I am satisfied that the funding currently being provided to the boards will enable them to achieve the broad targets set for this initiative in the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, LDP 1994-99, under which the boards are supported by EU funding.  Indeed, on the basis of their performance to date, I am confident that the targets originally set for the duration of the operational programme will be exceeded.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the county enterprise boards extended their range of activities beyond direct grant-giving to include the provision of advice, information, counselling, and management development training.  The CEBs will continue to play a key role in promoting small business growth at local level and may be expected to expand that role as they deepen their co-operation with other local actors and with State agencies in the delivery of a comprehensive range of support services in every area throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Where the case cited by the Deputy arose in 1995 &mdash; i.e. a Friesian cow was applied on and the animal was described as a Friesian on its cattle identity card &mdash; the only penalty applied was that the animal in question was not paid 1995 suckler cow premium as Friesian cows were not eligible for such premium and as the ineligible Friesian had been declared openly and innocently by the applicant.</P>
      <P>Where the converse happened &mdash; i.e. an animal declared as a Friesian in previous years when animals of that breed were eligible for premium was shown on the 1995 application as a beef breed instead by the farmer &mdash; the following was the procedure.  An on-farm inspection was arranged to see whether or not the animal was indeed a Friesian or belonging to a beef breed.  If the animal was found to belong to a beef breed it was accepted for payment.  If it was found to be a Friesian and to have been declared by the same farmer as a Friesian in previous years and there was no possibility of the animal being confused with that of a beef breed, the applicant concerned was ruled out of the scheme for two years as a result of the deliberate false declaration involved.  The EU Commission advised my Department that no lesser penalty could apply in such a case.  In case of dispute after an inspection a second inspection by a different officer was arranged.  If it was found to be a Friesian and the cattle identity card showed it to be of a beef breed before it came into the possession of the applicant then that animal was rejected for payment of the premium.</P>
      <P>I believe the above shows that my Department has taken a very reasonable line in cases such as these and has gone to the trouble of seeing the situation on the ground in each case so as to ensure that no farmer will be penalised incorrectly.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 530 and 536 together. Most fruit and vegetables, including tomatoes, are the subject of a common organisation of the market and member states of the European Union are precluded from providing assistance out of national resources.

    <P>Council Regulation (EC) 2611/95 of 25 October 1995 provides for the possibility of national aid being granted in compensation for losses of agricultural income caused by monetary movements in other member states, subject to approval by the European Commission. I understand that the question of monetary compensation under this regulation is being considered by the Belgian, German and French authorities but that no decisions have yet been made.  I would refer the Deputy to the Adjournment debate on 18 October 1995 in which the Minister for Finance stated that he had no plans to provide <Col N="618" /> for a market development fund to assist those affected by currency fluctuations.</P>

      <P>A number of arguments have been put forward to counter BSE related concerns.  First, it is emphasised that Ireland has an extremely low incidence of the disease, an annual average of 16 cases out of a cattle population of 7 million or an annual animal incidence of 0.0002 per cent.  It is also stressed that the disease occurs in older cows and that it has not occurred in steers from which our export trade is derived.</P>
      <P>The stringent and comprehensive nature of our controls are outlined in some detail to concerned parties.  It is pointed out that Ireland complies fully with the OIE &mdash; the international veterinary organisation &mdash; guidelines under which cattle and cattle products may be traded with safety and that our controls exceed these guidelines.  It is also stated that BSE has been the subject of considerable analysis by the EU scientific veterinary committee and that the European Union did not find it necessary to include Ireland in the scope of measures introduced for BSE.</P>

    <P>The controls highlighted include, <i>inter alia,</i> that our plants are subject to stringent veterinary control; that all animals presented for slaughter are subject to an ante-mortem examination by veterinary inspectors where clinical signs of the disease, if present, will be detected and that carcases are subject to post-mortem veterinary examination.  The practice of <Col N="619" /> depopulating the herd where an incidence of BSE occurs, a policy which goes beyond international guidelines and the scientific evidence, is also highlighted. The vast majority of purchasers accept that these controls ensure the safety of Irish beef and our products continue to be exported to in excess of 80 countries worldwide.</P>

      <P>The following are the statements issued:</P>
      <P>June 1995: &ldquo;Mycoplasma bovis is a respiratory pathogen and is frequently associated with outbreaks of pneumonia. It is not a notifiable disease and compensation is not payable in its case. The Department advises herdowners who suspect the presence of the disease in their livestock to contact their veterinary surgeon for advice.  The Department's veterinary laboratory service is also available to assist veterinary practitioners in dealing with the disease&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>September 1995: &ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Mr. Ivan Yates TD, today referred to the risk of Mycoplasma bovis occurring in cattle, of all ages, particularly calves and dairy cows.  Mycoplasma bovis is an important respiratory pathogen and is frequently associated with outbreaks of severe pneumonia in calves.  It also causes affected cows to develop a crippling arthritis affecting one, or more, joints in front and/or hind legs.  The joints become swollen and the cows become very lame.  The infections are resistant to treatment and the swelling and lameness persist.  In dairy herds, the disease may be associated with a marked fall in milk production and an acute rapidly spreading mastitis which is <Col N="620" /> resistant to treatment.  Major losses arise from lost production, purchase of veterinary medicines, culling of severely affected incurable cows and deaths in calves.</P>
    <P>Outbreaks of pneumonia, mastitis and arthritis in cattle have been associated with the importation of cattle in which Mycoplasma bovis has been isolated. Herdowners are therefore advised to check carefully the source of their imported cattle before taking the decision to import.  Adverting to the Protocol for safer importation of cattle, sheep and goats, which he launched recently, the Minister said that risks could be considerably reduced if individual animals to be imported are certified as being negative to the complement-fixation test (CFT) or an approved ELISA test for Mycoplasma bovis.</P>
    <P>Because the level of Mycoplasma bovis infection in this country is extremely low, Irish cattle have little immunity to the disease.  Consequently, farmers are strongly advised to delay integration of any imported animals into their herd for as long as possible: a minimum of 30 days is recommended.  This may allow animals which are incubating infection to show clinical signs. However, some `carrier' cattle remain a source of infection for months without developing any signs.  If any farmer suspects that cattle have the symptoms associated with Mycoplasma bovis he should contact his veterinary surgeon immediately for advice&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Random samples of the rate of disclosure of tuberculin reactor cattle have been carried out since 1989.  The objectives of these random samples are: to obtain an estimate of the rate of disclosure of reactors to the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test as conducted by veterinary inspectors and, using that estimate, to measure year to year changes in the rate of disclosure of reactors.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take for dairy farmers denied their usual annual leased quota from co-ops in 1995 due to the effect of private quota levying; if his attention has been drawn to the number of small and medium-sized dairy farmers who have exceeded their own quota and the superlevy payments being imposed on these farmers from now to April; the circumstances under which farmers may appeal under the milk quota appeals tribunal; and if he will make a statement outlining the scale and nature of this problem; the number of farmers affected; and the proposals, if any, he has to remedy this matter.</Quest>

      <P>Demand by producers for additional milk quota in 1995-96 was greater than in previous years because of the increased level of milk production since the beginning of the quota year in April and the fact that a superlevy liability had been incurred in the 1994-95 year.  This situation was reflected in the willingness of producers to pay a higher price for private landquota leasing arrangements, thereby reducing the amount of quota offered into the temporary leasing scheme.</P>
      <P>The 10 per cent clawback measure on leases of less than three years, which I introduced in October 1995, will encourage quota-holders who do not require all or part of their quota on a short-term basis to avail of the temporary leasing scheme.  This of itself will have contributed to the amount of quota offered under the third phase of the temporary leasing scheme which, in turn, will benefit small and medium-sized producers.</P>
      <P>The milk quota appeals tribunal deals on an ongoing basis with producers for whom the application of the milk quota system is causing hardship.  Since its establishment the tribunal has allocated 3.5 million gallons milk quota to over 3,000 applicants.  Application forms for the tribunal are available from the milk policy division of my Department.</P>

      <P>Meat from suspect BSE animals is not allowed into the food chain.  As BSE is not an infectious disease and has not been found in meat, there is no scientific reason the meat from other animals slaughtered under my Department's policy of depopulating herds in which a case of BSE occurs cannot enter the food chain.  However, in order to further reassure consumers, I recently announced that representative testing will be carried out on such animals, following slaughter, to confirm that BSE is not present.  There is no scientific evidence that BSE can be transmitted to humans.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 545 to 547, inclusive together.</P>
      <P>The International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants of 2 December 1961, as revised at Geneva on 10 November 1972 and 23 October 1978, was ratified by the Government in May 1981.  The convention was again revised at Geneva in March 1991.  That revised version was signed on behalf of Ireland, subject to ratification, on 27 February 1992.</P>
      <P>The international organisation responsible for the agreement is the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.  It is proposed to ratify the revised version when the necessary domestic legislation has been amended later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Cocoa Agreement, 1993, was opened for signature at New York on 16 August 1993.  Ireland signed the agreement, subject to ratification, on 16 February 1994.  The international organisation responsible for the agreement is the United Nations Conference <Col N="630" /> on Trade and Development.  It is proposed that Ireland will ratify the agreement when all EU member states are also in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>The Food Aid Convention, 1995, was opened for signature at New York on 1 May 1995.  Ireland signed the convention on 30 June 1995.  The convention is administered by a food aid committee established by the Food Aid Convention of the International Grains Agreement, 1967, and kept in being under the Food Aid Convention, 1995.  It is intended to ratify the convention in the near future.</P>
    <P>A proposal to sign the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994, opened for signature at New York in April 1994 under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, will shortly be made to the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any international agreements being drafted or prepared by international organisations with which my Department is associated.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of compensatory allowances &mdash; headage &mdash; in respect of forestry, the allowance due to eligible applicants is paid at the rate of £74.13 on each hectare of afforested land, where the afforestation took place between 1 October 1986 and 17 June 1989, both dates inclusive.  Three hundred and ten applicants were paid £163,658 under this scheme.</P>
      <P>A new forest premium scheme was introduced in February 1990 under which premium rates ranging from £50 per hectare to £300 per hectare, depending on categories of land and trees, are payable where afforestation was completed on or after 18 June 1989.

      <P>I have already put on record strong support for the proposal for a milk quota related initiative in the Border counties in the context of the peace process.  This matter has been the subject of discussions between my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture.  However, it should be stressed that the allocation of additional milk quota is a sensitive matter within the EU.  Any such request should, therefore, have the support of the, member states directly concerned and the various interested organisations and must be raised in a suitable negotiating context.</P>

      <P>The income situation of cattle producers has improved <Col N="637" /> considerably since the introduction of the Common Agricultural Policy reform measures in 1992.  Under those measures increased premium payments were introduced to compensate for the phased 15 per cent reduction in intervention prices over a three year period. In the meantime cattle prices have actually increased by 10 per cent over the same period while premium payments will amount to some £370 million in respect of applications submitted in 1995 compared with some £120 million in 1992.</P>
      <P>While these increases in payments and prices are a very welcome boost for drystock farmers I am, nevertheless, concerned that the average income in this sector remains relatively low in comparison with other mainstream farming activities.  In order to ascertain more precisely the income position of these producers, I have asked my Department to undertake a study of the sector.  I hope that the findings of this report will be available in the near future.</P>
      <P>However, of immediate concern to me is the current level of export refunds available for cattle and beef exports.  At the Council of Agriculture Ministers this week I impressed on the Commissioner and my colleagues in the Council the need for an immediate increase in export refunds in order to ensure adequate returns for our beef producers, and in particular our winter fatteners.  I will continue to seek a restoration of the refunds to adequate levels at this week's Beef Management Committee.</P>
      <P>Because most Irish traders still hold sufficient licences prefixed at the higher refund rates there should be no immediate effect on cattle prices.  In addition, the deseasonalisation slaughter premium worth up to £60 per steer slaughtered this spring will also assist in maintaining producers' incomes at this time.</P>

      <P>Controls on the commercial export of dogs to other EU member states, including the registration of exporters, will be introduced with effect from 1 February 1996 by virtue of regulations recently adopted under the European Communities Act, 1972.  The regulations implement an EU Directive which lays down animal health conditions for trade in certain animals, including dogs.  As far as national controls on the breeding of dogs are concerned, I indicated in the House on 19 October last that I had no plans to introduce such controls.</P>

      <P>Commencement of the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992 and the statutory abolition of the Land Commission for which it provides has had to be deferred pending the outcome of a High Court case.  I am not, therefore, in a position to say how soon the Act can be brought into operation.  In the interim, considerable progress has been made in winding up or completing the remaining work of the Land Commission.  The amount of agricultural and non-agricultural land on hands has been reduced by some 75 per cent and 50 per cent respectively and the number of allottees awaiting vesting by some 40 per cent.  I intend to ensure that this progress is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the EU Commission's management of the beef market since last autumn, which has led to a significant reduction in export refunds on live cattle and beef. I believe that it over-reacted to the slightly elevated levels of applications for export licences during the latter part of 1995 and that it has adopted the wrong approach in attempting to bring about a reduction in the level of licence <Col N="648" /> applications by cutting export refunds. The 14 per cent increase in export refunds on 1 December last was insuffient and I consider that the current level of refunds is still too low relative to cattle prices in the EU and prices in third countries.</P>
      <P>I discussed this issue last week directly with Commissioner Fischler and raised it again at this week's meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  I impressed on the Commissioner and my colleagues in the Council the need for an immediate increase in export refunds in order to ensure adequate returns for our beef producers and, in particular, our winter fatteners.  I will continue to press the Commission, both bilaterally and at the Beef Management Committee later this week, to restore refunds to adequate levels.</P>
      <P>However, I believe that the failure at this stage to have refunds restored to their previous levels should have no immediate effect on cattle prices because most Irish traders still hold sufficient licences prefixed at the higher refund rate that prevailed up to the end of October last year.  In addition, the deseasonalisation slaughter premium worth up to £60 per steer slaughtered this spring will also assist in maintaining producers incomes at this time.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is responsible for radon measurements.  The institute has advised me that 12 month radon measurements have been completed in 103 houses throughout County Louth, 23 of the houses being in the Cooley Peninsula. Fifteen of these 103 houses, 10 of which were in the Cooley Peninsula, were found to have radon levels above the 200 Bq/m³.  The highest level recorded in the county, 752 Bq/m³, was in a house in the Cooley Peninsula.</P>
      <P>The institute predicts that for most of County Louth the percentage of houses above the 200 Bq/m³ reference level is less than 10 per cent.  For the Cooley Peninsula and the area which surrounds Clogherhead, the predicted percentage is greater than 10 per cent, with the value in the Cooley Peninsula being closer to 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the National Survey, 57 householders requested three month radon measurements and 23 of these houses were found to have radon levels above the reference level, the highest level measured being 748 Bq/m³.  The institute has informed individual householders of their results and, where <Col N="678" /> appropriate, advised that remedial measures should be considered.</P>
    <P>The institute hopes to have the ongoing national radon survey completed by 1998 and in the meantime is continuing to publish the results as they are collated.</P>

    <P>The Government has decided that the transport strategy recommended in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative will provide the general policy framework for the future development of the transport system in <Col N="679" /> the greater Dublin area.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 588 and 591 together.</P>
      <P>Omnilink is the name given to an experimental wheelchair-accessible minibus service for the general public operated by Bus Átha Cliath on the basis of a contractual agreement with the Inter-Department Transport Accessibility Committee which is chaired by my Department.</P>
      <P>The project was originally intended to provide a service on Route 103 between Clontarf and Finglas over a two year period at a total estimated cost of £1.3 million.  It was supported by the committee solely on the basis of a notification that its application for grant assistance amounting to £592,000 in respect of the project under the EU Horizon Programme had been approved.  As the pilot scheme was expected to be uneconomic, this figure include a proposed contribution of approximately £200,000 per annum to meet anticipated operating losses over a two-year period.  Unfortunately, unavoidable delays in securing the specialised vehicles required for the service meant that it was not possible to introduce the facility during the currency of the Horizon Programme which closed at the end of 1994.  Furthermore, the committee was advised at a very late stage that, in any event, the operating costs of the project would not be eligible for EU assistance under the programme. Consequently the level of EU assistance actually received (£210,000) represented only 36 per cent of the amount originally envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, it was not possible to proceed with the experiment as originally planned.  However, Bus <Col N="682" /> Átha Cliath agreed to operate with effect from 28 May 1995 a six-month trial of the Omnilink concept in the city centre, linking the wheelchair-accessible DART system at Tara Street with the O'Connell Street and St. Stephen's Green areas (Route 222).  I understand that operating losses of approximately £100,000 on this route were absorbed by the company during the six-month experiment which came to an end on 31 December last.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee will quickly evaluate the Route 222 experiment and consider whether, and in what form, there is a future role for Omnilink as a means of serving the needs of mobility impaired people in the city.</P>

      <P>Applications were invited for a Prospecting Licence covering the gypsum deposits known to exist at Glangevlin, County Cavan with the stated objective of the successful applicant establishing the full character, extent and value of the deposit.  The notice inviting applications advised that the successful applicant would be committed to undertaking the necessary and extensive work programme designed to pave the way for development of the deposit as quickly as and effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>Two applications were received by the closing date and representatives of both applicant companies were interviewed by technical staff of my Department in order that certain aspects of their proposals could be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> On 13 December 1995 &mdash; six weeks after the closing date for the competition &mdash; I made a decision having regard to the recommendation made by my officials and awarded the Prospecting Licence to Gypsum Industries, PLC for an initial period of two years and renewable only subject to rigorous conditions attaching to the licence being fully complied with.  Both applicant companies were advised of the result of the competition on 14 December 1995.</P>
    <P>I should advise that the prospecting and exploration of this deposit will allow both the licence holder and my Department to assess the viability of the deposit being mined and give an insight into any safety and environmental issues which might arise in the event of it being mined and which are peculiar to this particular deposit.  A considerable amount of work will be needed in order to establish whether the deposit can be worked commercially and it will be some time before any final decisions can be made on the viability of the deposit. It would, therefore, be premature at this stage to take the issue of a prospecting licence as being indicative of the future development of a gypsum mine at Glangevlin.</P>

      <P>The helicopter based at Finner carries out aircrew continuation training, including night training, in or close to Donegal Bay.  Some 55 per cent of SAR training, mainly continuity training for proficiency purposes, is conducted out of Finner Camp.</P>
      <P>The training is not targeted for SAR operations in any particular part of the coast-line, but qualifies Air Corps personnel to carry out SAR operations in all areas with the range and operational profile of the aircraft.</P>

      <P>In July 1995 the Government announced its response to the report of the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG) on its review of the Defence Forces and published a document detailing the EAG report and setting out the Government's approach to the reorganisation.</P>
      <P>The Government indicated that they accepted the general thrust of the EAG report.  It was also stated that an implementation group would be established to draw up detailed and fully costed proposals to implement a first phase plan covering the next three years.  This plan would be based on the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Forces on the basis of a three brigade structure with a total manpower level of 11,500.  The strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 12,745 on 31 December 1995.</P>
      <P>The required reduction in the manpower level to 11,500 over the three years of the first phase plan will be achieved by means of a voluntary early retirement scheme combined with a programme of recruitment of young personnel.</P>
      <P>I expect that the implementation group's detailed proposals, including proposals for a recruitment programme, for the first phase of the plan will be submitted to me in the very near future.

      <P>An arrangement is in place between the Department of Defence and the Department of Health whereby the Air Corps operate an air ambulance service for the health boards for emergency <Col N="691" /> cases.  The service has been provided since the early 1960's.  Air ambulance missions normally involve the transfer of seriously ill patients from one hospital to another but occasionally involve the evacuation of seriously ill patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals.</P>
      <P>The average number of air ambulance missions carried out in the years 1992 to 1995 was 151.  One patient is normally carried on each mission.  The average direct cost of the missions was £230,000 per annum.</P>

    <P>There are a number of other international agreements which it is proposed that the State should sign or become party to.  In the field of the marine environment, the 1992 Protocols to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969 and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971, which were adopted in London on 27 November 1992, under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation, will be acceded to and ratified when preparations, including any necessary legislative action, have been completed. There are similar intentions in the case of the Convention on Oil Pollution Pre-paredness Response and Co-operation, also adopted under International Maritime Organisation auspices in London in November 1990.  In fisheries matters, the UN Agreement on Straddling <Col N="697" /> Stocks was adopted in New York in August 1995.  Issues relevant to signing it are currently under consideration within the EU.  It is intended also to accede to and ratify a number of conventions and Protocols, adopted under the auspices of the Brussels International Maritime Law Conventions and the International Maritime Organisation, relating to the liability of shipowners and others.  The proposed Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Bill, which is in preparation in my Department, will effect the necessary changes to domestic law to facilitate such a course of action.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 618 and 620 together.</P>
      <P>In response to the grounding of the vessel the <i>Scarlett Buccaneer</i> on 16 November, 1995 at the entrance to Howth Harbour all available search and rescue (SAR) resourses were tasked to the scene including the Howth all-weather lifeboat and Irish marine emergency coastal units.  The closest available helicopter with night time flying capability was also tasked from RAF Valley in Wales.  All four crew members on board the vessel were subsequently rescued. Unfortunately one of the crew later died from his injuries.</P>
      <P>As I announced in the House on 23 November, I have asked my Department to address the issue of east coast coverage in a review of the availability and deployment of SAR resources generally. I also asked the Air Corps to evaluate the feasibility of a 24 hour dedicated SAR helicopter being based at Baldonnel and I will keep the House informed of these initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must stress as previously stated in the House that I am satisfied that the <Col N="701" /> current deployment of search and rescue resources and particularly their state of readiness and their on the spot management by the marine emergency service is well up to international standards and will stand up to the closest scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Finally, I feel it is important to stress that we have dedicated men and women whose job it is to be available on a 24 hour basis to deal with marine emergencies in a professional manner.  Their lives are often at risk and this has to be constantly a matter for concern in the deployment and management of SAR resources.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that a Dauphin helicopter was available and was tasked to take part in two search and rescue operations in Dublin Bay on 6 January, 1996.  Since the end of December an enhanced night flying capability has been provided by the Air Corps for east coast coverage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 622 and 623 together.</P>
      <P>Authorisations to fish for eels are granted by my Department on foot of scientific advice received for the area concerned.  On receipt of the authorisation an applicant may then seek a licence to fish for eels from the relevant regional board.  Lough Corrib is in the Western Regional Fisheries Board region.</P>
      <P>The number of authorisations granted for individual river systems vary from year to year, depending on the number of applications received for the area and the level of fishing effort which each system may sustain.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy on the number of authorisations issued for Lough Corrib in the years 1990 to 1995 is set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981 the Minister may grant or refuse to grant a permit authorising dumping at sea operations.  The procedure is that an applicant requests permission to dump at sea giving details of the proposed disposal site; the quantity and constituents of the material to be dumped; the <Col N="707" /> dumping vessel; and why no suitable land-based alternatives exist.</P>
      <P>Each application is examined by the Department's marine licence vetting committee which is composed of a chemist, biologists and an oceanographer from the Marine Institute, a marine surveyor and an engineer from this Department and a biologist from the Central Fisheries Board.  Each application is examined to ensure that the disposal site is acceptable from a fisheries and navigational point of view; the quantity and constituents of the waste are such that they will cause no harm in the marine environment; there are no suitable land-based alternatives; and the vessel to be used in disposal of the waste is properly licensed and certified.</P>
      <P>The Oslo Commission guidelines for the management of dredged material are taken into consideration in the disposal of dredge spoil.  The Minister may require surveys of both the waste and the dump site to be undertaken at the expense of the prospective dumper.  If the proposed site is unsuitable for any reason alternative sites are investigated, and if the material itself is found to be unsuitable for dumping at sea, the application is refused.</P>
      <P>Drogheda Harbour Commissioners have applied to the Department to dispose of dredge spoil which will result from capital dredging works in Drogheda Harbour.  As there are extensive fishing grounds in the vicinity of Drogheda Harbour, problems have arisen in identifying a suitable dump site.  Officials from the Department have been actively seeking a site which will not impact on fisheries.  The investigation is at an advanced stage and it is expected that a site will be identified within the next two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drogheda Harbour Commissioners are preparing an environment impact study in respect of the proposed capital dredging works.  Once a suitable dump site has been identified the commissioners will be required to include in the EIS a study of both waste to be dumped at sea and the dump site to <Col N="708" /> ascertain the potential impact of the dumping on the marine environment. On receipt of this study a decision will be made as to whether a dumping at sea permit may issue.</P>

      <P>A fishery harbour development programme in respect of 1996 is being prepared by my Department at present. The proposals for Liscannor Harbour, County Clare, will be considered in that context.</P>
      <P>I should caution, however, that funding for fishery harbour development under the fisheries operational programme is very limited and that only projects which can demonstrate a significant potential return from the fishery perspective will be successful.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about the beaching of phosphorous devices on the Donegal coastline during November/December, 1995.  This followed the laying of a gas pipeline in the immediate vicinity of Beaufort's Dyke dump site.  These devices present a serious potential hazard and their arrival on Donegal and other coasts would suggest that the dumpsite is unstable.</P>
      <P>The procedures which are in place in my Department for dealing with such discoveries were fully and effectively operated with regard to the recent Donegal incidents.  These procedures include the issue of alert notices through coastal radio stations, informing the local authority and the Garda in the interests of public safety and the Defence Forces who made the devices safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> The discoveries of the devices emphasise the need to carry out comprehensive, physical, biological and chemical investigations of Beaufort's Dyke dump site and to put in place a system of monitoring and management of all munitions dump sites in waters around Ireland.  I can assure you that in recent times my colleague at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, and I have been using every possible means through bilateral contact with the UK authorities, who carried out the dumping in the first instance, and international fora, such as the OSPAR Commission, in order to get progress on our objectives as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Donegal discoveries together with the recent publication of the results of the marine survey carried out by the Scottish Office's research vessel around Beaufort's Dyke add further urgency to our case.  Accordingly, we have written to Earl Howe, UK Under-Secretary of State for Defence and Lord Lindsay of the Scottish Office seeking an urgent meeting to discuss the issue generally and to develop mechanisms for the review, monitoring and management of all dump sites.</P>

      <P>Following the Council agreement of December 1994 on Iberian intergration into the Common Fisheries Policy, detailed monitoring and control rules for implementation of the new regime were negotiated and agreed last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new arrangements which came into operation on 1 January, the total number of Spanish vessels allowed in Irish waters remains limited to 93, of which 40 named vessels only are permitted to fish inside the Irish Box.  the <Col N="711" /> entry/exit reporting system, which requires prior notification by all large fishing vessels entering and leaving Irish waters and the Irish Box, is now operating to ensure that our air and sea fisheries protection services can closely target illegal access or other illegal fishing activity in Irish waters generally and the Irish Box.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Department of the Marine are working intensively together to ensure that our sea and land based fisheries surveillance resources are deployed efficiently and effectively in implementing the new control and monitoring regime and ensuring that all vessels fishing in Irish waters comply with the rules.  Three vessels have been detained already this year for alleged fishing offences, demonstrating the high level of effectiveness of the fisheries protection services in detecting and apprehending vessels suspected of having committed fishing offences.</P>
    <P>Further enhancement of the protection capability is planned under the new EU five year financial aid package for fisheries surveillance.  I will be putting my proposals in this regard to Government shortly with a view to subsequently negotiating a programme for 1996 and future years with the Commission. My objective is to secure at minimum cost the necessary resources to further strengthen our existing surveillance capability.</P>
