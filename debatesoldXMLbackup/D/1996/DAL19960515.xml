    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: Nos. 5, 6 and 7 shall be decided without debate and any divisions demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith and, subject to the agreement of Nos. 6 and 7, the debate on the Supplementary Estimate [Vote 42], if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening speech of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in <Col N="886" /> each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; (iv) the Minister shall be called upon not later than 5.15 p.m. to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes; and (v) any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith.  Subject to the Order being made on No. 29, the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of the Powers of Attorney Bill, 1995 [Seanad], if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>It is not satisfactory. For 18 months the Whips and the party leaders have been attempting to reach agreement on organising the Order of Business in a more meaningful way and dealing with written questions during the summer recess.  Proposals to be discussed by the Whips later today and tomorrow indicate a rowing back on Fianna Fáil's proposals when in Government and the Government's <Col N="887" /> proposals produced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jim Higgins, in January 1995.  We are making no progress on ordering matters of urgent importance on the Order of Business or on what we believe was a reasonable request that written questions be taken on days when committees meet in the House in July and September.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach in a funny way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On current legislation, will the Taoiseach indicate when the convention on the transfer of prisoners will become operative and when the prisoners concerned will be transferred, especially in the light of the defective forensic tests?  Is he aware that the forensic test issue relates to almost 50 per cent of Irish prisoners in UK jails?</P>

      <P>The heritage services of the Office of Public Works have grown rapidly in recent years.  While the Office of Public Works had responsibility for national monuments, the Shannon Navigation, Phoenix Park and St. Stephen's Green from the last century, these were regarded as peripheral to its main functions until about 1970 when a unit with a distinct conservation role was established.  The unit was called the National Parks and Monuments Service.</P>
      <P>In 1986, with the enactment of the Canals Act and the transfer of the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Office of Public Works, a new waterways service was created to deal with the management of the canals and the Shannon Navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 the wildlife service was transferred from the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry to the Office of Public Works and shortly afterwards the National Parks and Wildlife Service was created.  We, therefore, now have three arms to the heritage service, the <Col N="900" /> National Parks and Wildlife Service dealing with the natural heritage, National Monuments and Historic Properties dealing with the built heritage and the waterways service dealing with inland waterways.</P>
    <P>These three services constitute a large administrative unit with a total staff of the order of 1,000 full-time and 250 seasonal personnel and a total gross budget of the order of £49,000,000 per annum. As Deputies are aware these services have produced magnificent practical work.  Deputies on all sides of the House have paid tribute to that work and I would like to pay tribute to the personnel involved.</P>
    <P>However, it was not until the establishment of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht at the beginning of 1993 that the question of ministerial responsibility for heritage policy was addressed.  The position at that stage was that statutory responsibility was divided in a most confusing manner between the Minister for Finance and the Commissioners of Public Works. For instance, in the cases of wildlife and the Botanic Gardens total responsibility was vested in the Minister for Finance. In other cases, particularly waterways and national monuments, responsibility rested in the main with the Commissioners with some responsibility being reserved to the Minister for Finance while in other cases, such as the Phoenix Park, the Commissioners had responsibilities but were subject to the general directions of the Minister for Finance.  To complete the picture of statutory confusion I must mention Páirc Náisiúnta An Bhlascaoid Mhóir for which the Commissioners of Public Works had general responsibility but who required the consent of the Minister for the Gaeltacht for certain actions.  The powers of the Minister for the Gaeltacht are now, of course, included in the statutory powers of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht agus ceapaim féin go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht aitheanta, mar sin, mar bhunchloch oidhreacht ár dtíre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> The establishment of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht provided the opportunity of addressing the confusion and integrating policies for the heritage with those for analogous functions which had been brought together in the new Department.  On 9 February 1993 the then Government agreed that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht be assigned responsibility for the formulation and development of future policy in relation to inland waterways, national parks and wildlife and national monuments and historic properties.  On foot of that decision, a heritage policy unit was established in my Department staffed by personnel transferred from the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Following discussion which I had with the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance on the process for determining how the Government decision could best be implemented, a joint proposal was submitted to Government who agreed it on 2 June 1993 and who also decided to set up a working group consisting of officials of my Department and of the Office of Public Works to identify the policy matters proper to the Department and to recommend working arrangements whereby the Government decision would be implemented in practice.</P>
    <P>The working group produced two alternative sets of arrangements, neither of which, unfortunately, was acceptable to all concerned.  In November 1993 the Government decided to appoint a larger interdepartmental group which included representatives of the Department of Finance and of the Attorney General but this too failed to come up with an acceptable solution.  The fundamental difficulty lay in the fact that the Commissioners were vested with certain statutory functions which were difficult to reconcile with my responsibility for policy which had no statutory base and while I was prepared to work within these constraints others saw serious practical difficulties in any such arrangement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> Against this background the policy agreement for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> provided in December 1994 that the Office of Public Works would be restructured on a phased basis, including, <i>inter alia,</i> the transfer of appropriate functions to my Department.  In particular, it provided for the transfer of the responsibilities of the Minister for Finance in relation to heritage to me and this was effected by means of statutory instruments on 20 December 1994 and 2 March 1995.  It also provided for the amendment of the Heritage Bill which was then before the Oireachtas by stating that the functions of the Commissioners under legislation relating to heritage should be performed by them subject to the general directions in writing of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht of the day.  The Heritage Bill with this amendment became law in April 1995.</P>
    <P>While the new arrangements which followed from these statutory changes were an improvement, there still remained a disjointed and complex division of responsibilities which produced practical difficulties despite the efforts of all concerned to make them work effectively.  In the circumstances the Minister for Finance and I agreed that it was necessary to remove the ambiguity which was inherent in the existing arrangements to establish an optimum structure for the management of the heritage.  On 19 September 1995 the Government decided to transfer to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht by Government order, in accordance with section 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, the statutory powers of the Commissioners of Public Works under specified heritage legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the policy agreement A Government of Renewal also provided that consideration be given to the creation of an inland waterways authority which would have responsibility for effective North-South arrangements for the management of all navigable waterways on the island.  The Government, accordingly, set up a high <Col N="903" /> level interdepartmental steering group to prepare the implementation of the transfer of functions from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and to consider the question of an inland waterways authority.</P>
    <P>The group's report has been received and presented to Government.  Two Statutory Instruments were made on 12 March 1996.  The principal order, S.I. No. 61 of 1996, transferred the statutory functions of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the heritage to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The other order, S.I. No. 62 of 1996, transferred from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht certain powers under the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, which had been omitted from the earlier transfer order of 2 March 1995.</P>
    <P>With regard to inland waterways, the group recommended that any organisational arrangements adopted for the management of inland waterways should facilitate the conversion of such organisation into a statutory waterways authority with minimal disruption and drafted a scheme of a Bill to give effect to its recommendations.  I hope to introduce such a Bill in the House in due course.</P>
    <P>The North-South dimension will have to be a matter for discussion between the political heads of the relevant Departments, North and South.  In the meantime the group recommended that, pending such developments, the precursor waterways organisation should form part of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate, which I am placing before the House for its approval, is to enable funds to be transferred from the Vote for the Office of Public Works to my Department's Vote for the new heritage service being established within the Department as recommended by the steering group.  I am satisfied these arrangements will not only remove the ambiguity to which I referred, but will give a clearer sense of <Col N="904" /> identity and sharper focus to the Heritage Service staff and provide an integrated framework for the formulation of heritage policy and its implementation. Nil aon amhras orm go mbeidh na struchtúir nua a ndearna mé tagairt dóibh cúpla nóiméad ó shin éifeachtach, soiléir agus solúbtha chomh maith amach anseo.</P>
    <P>This is the final stage in the reorganisation of the administrative arrangements for the heritage.  The first step was the setting up of a Heritage Policy Unit in my Department; the second was the appointment of a statutory Heritage Council following the enactment of the Heritage Act, 1995, and the third is the establishment of the Heritage Service within my Department.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council has the task of providing independent advice and assistance to voluntary organisations, local authorities and private individuals on heritage issues and will prepare, for my consideration, policies and priorities on the heritage.  It also has a role in regard to the protection of heritage buildings in public ownership.</P>
    <P>It is useful to reflect on the elements of a heritage strategy and where they fit in.  I have described the Heritage Council with its much stronger role as statutory, but it will be able to liaise with the groups mentioned.  The Heritage Policy Unit formulates and develops policy and legislation, whether on the basis of recommendations from the council or any other source or as necessity and European Union requirements demand. The Heritage Service will be responsible for the management of heritage properties in State care and, generally, for the implementation of legislation and policy on the heritage, apart from those areas within the executive function of the council.  These three units will provide a co-ordinated approach to the heritage which will ensure there is a structured system of policy formulation and a clear identity and focus to the implementation of heritage policy.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate I am presenting for the approval of the House is for a net total of £40,459,000 <Col N="905" /> in respect of the Heritage Service being transferred to my Department following the Government Order of 12 March 1996.  It is, in effect, the <i>pro rata</i> amount for the period 13 March to 31 December 1996 of the provision in Vote 10, Office of Public Works, for heritage services in the current year.</P>
    <P>A total of £5,613,000 is required for the administration budget, that is, subheads A1 to A7.  This represents the salaries and associated costs of approximately 250 staff for the period in question.</P>
    <P>Subhead Q &mdash; miscellaneous services at visitor centres &mdash; for which £130,000 is sought is the cost of providing certain services at visitor centres for which charges are made.  There is a contra provision in Appropriations-in-Aid of £157,000.  Subhead R1 &mdash; maintenance and supplies &mdash; for which £130,000 is sought is for the maintenance of various visitor centres.  Subhead R2 &mdash; Heritage Service publications &mdash; for which £186,000 is sought is for the cost of producing various guide books, published inventories, etc.  I compliment the Heritage Service on the great quality and diversity of its publications.  Several new site booklets will be published this year, including guides for Glenveagh National Park, Céide Fields, Corlea Bog, the Boyne Valley, Dublin Castle, Phoenix Park, Glendalough and Ormond Castle.  In addition, new information leaflets, posters and post cards are planned.</P>
    <P>A guide or information service will be provided this year at 54 heritage sites throughout the country where approximately two million visitors are expected. This operation provides full-time employment for 26 staff and seasonal employment for about 250.</P>
    <P>A sum of £6,933,000 is required for subhead S &mdash; National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This includes £3,678,000 for capital services and £3,315,000 for current services.</P>
    <P>The ongoing work of the National Parks and Wildlife Service includes the conservation of five national parks and 76 nature reserves.  Management plans <Col N="906" /> for four national parks are being prepared i.e. Burren, Wicklow Mountains, Connemara and Glenveagh and seven nature reserves.  The draft management plan for the Burren has been completed and I have sought the views of the public on its proposals.</P>
    <P>A study has been carried out on a proposed national park in north-west Mayo which I hope to launch very shortly.  A study is also being conducted on a future strategy for Doneraile Park. I hope that this, too, will be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>More than £2,000,000 is being provided for the acquisition of lands of special ecological importance and £500,000 for the midlands raised bog restoration programme.</P>
    <P>A sum of £8,941,000 is required for subhead T &mdash; inland waterways &mdash; of which £4,740,000 is capital and £4,201,000 is current.</P>
    <P>There are a number of projects being undertaken on the Shannon Navigation, including the extension of navigation on the River Suck to Ballinsaloe, on the Boyle River to the town of Boyle and to Sarsfield Lock in Limerick.  I recently opened the extension of the navigation to Lough Allen.  On the Shannon-Erne waterway, which has been a great success additional moorings are proposed for Keshkerrigan.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding on the Grand Canal where the new sealock gates at Ringsend were recently completed.  The corridor study task force under the chairmanship of Senator Pat Magner is working hard at revitalising the Dublin stretch of the canal.  It is receiving great co-operation from the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland which recently held a very successful rally in Dublin.  This partnership between the State, voluntary and community groups has blossomed.  This is welcome.</P>
    <P>A sum of £886,000 is being provided for works on the Royal Canal in the current year as part of the project for the complete restoration of the navigation from Dublin to the Shannon.  I expect that work will commence this year on <Col N="907" /> the Tralee Ship Canal and the marina in the Claddagh Basin in Galway.</P>
    <P>A sum of £771,000 is required under subhead U for conservation works funded from the national lottery.  Of this, £271,000 is for the final payments on the new museum which I recently opened at Kilmainham Gaol.  I congratulate the curator, Pat Cooke, and the team who assisted him in this magnificent project.  The remaining £500,000 is to meet the commitment made to contribute towards the cost of restoring the telescope and associated works at Birr Castle.</P>
    <P>In subhead V, £20,361,000 is sought for national monuments and historic properties of which £10,701,000 is capital and £9,660,000 is current expenditure.  Capital works are being undertaken at almost 40 sites throughout the country.  Many of these are EU aided projects.  The largest project is the Boyne Visitor Centre due to be opened next year.  Extensive works are also being done at Trim Castle, Rathfarnham Castle and at Castletown, County Kildare.  Conservation work will continue at various national monuments and historic parks, most of it done by the direct labour staff who have, over the years, built up an enviable reputation for the quality of their work.  I paid tribute to it when I first became a Member of the Seanad more than 25 years ago and I do so again today.  It is admired by everybody.</P>
    <P>Work will continue on the archaeological and architectural inventories. This is an essential prerequisite to the process of providing protection to our built heritage.  Very good progress has been made in recent years on the archaeological inventory and there is a sites and monuments record now for every county.  It is important however that fieldwork should continue to provide definitive descriptions and records of all visible monuments.  These records form the basis for the system of protection which is provided under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> The architectural inventory is being reviewed by the interdepartmental committee which the Minister for the Environment and I established last year to look at this issue and the question of providing statutory protection to listed buildings.  I hope to receive the report of that committee in the next month or so.</P>
    <P>These various subheads come to a gross total of £43,125,000.  There are offsetting Appropriations-in-Aid of £2,666,000 which is made up for the most part of receipts at various heritage centres.</P>
    <P>This brings to an end a very long process in the arrangement and strengthening of the heritage services.  Legislation is one matter but administrative structures are another.  Much depends on the co-operation of the public whose heritage it is.  I hope the arrangements will be seen to be successful.  What we are doing today is almost <i>pro forma</i>, transferring moneys voted to the Office of Public Works to the Department which will be in charge of providing the services.</P>
    <P>Dá réir sin, molaim an Meastachán Forlíontach seo d'oll-shuim £40,459,000 don Teach agus tá súil agam go nglacfaidh an Teach leis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate this issue today.  There was an attempt to transfer some of the powers of the Office of Public Works to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht without debate and it is only due to the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party that this debate is taking place.  The Office of Public Works is the State manager of heritage and the debate on the funding of heritage is the first opportunity to discuss heritage policy.  We in this House have been starved of the opportunity to discuss the issue of heritage. Since the Minister took office he has attempted to control heritage in such a way that the Office of Public Works had to fight to retain its management function.  When Fianna Fáil was in power the Minister had control over policy but not <Col N="909" /> management.  It was during this Government the battle lines were drawn and the Minister resolved to bring the Office of Public Works to its knees.  Some view his treatment of the Office of Public Works as a vendetta against those who had the audacity to oppose his view.</P>
      <P>Morale in the Office of Public Works is at an all time low.  Those interested and committed to heritage look on in dismay as the Minister is interested in any acquisition to soothe his empire-building mentality.  The Minister insists on dragging the Office of Public Works into the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht without forward planning or vision for the future.  The proposal to bring the Office of Public Works under the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht would be fine if it was in the context of a well researched, thought-out plan.  Instead what we are faced with today is the worst of all worlds, where the heritage divisions of State are being separated from their natural partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is proposing is a fractured heritage service.  Most heritage functions are now with the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, but some core services such as engineering, arterial drainage, property management and archaeological services remain within the Office of Public Works under the Department of Finance.  These specialist elements, which are so necessary for the promotion of our heritage, will no longer be available to provide an integrated approach to heritage management as heretofore.  If we take the example of our inland waterways, the engineering and arterial drainage sections, which are vital, will no longer come under the same Department.  There will be the ludicrous position where the Office of Public Works will be under the same roof as the sections which have been transferred to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, but they will no longer be able to consult each other.  That will <Col N="910" /> lead to the employment of consultants, creating further financial burdens.</P>

      <P>In regard to inland waterways there is a need for a co-ordinated strategy.  A number of studies have been carried out on the Grand Canal, Royal Canal and Ulster Canal, but there is not an overall plan.  Funding is offered on a piecemeal basis to various projects.  Although there is a plethora of local authority and tourism organisations, an overall strategy is needed for the Shannon as there is no authority with responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>We have not been told the terms of reference of the interdepartmental committee.  The only reference to it this morning was to its failure to come up with an overall approach that would appease the Minister with regard to the transfer of further powers to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  We need a full and proper debate on State management of heritage as the Minister has no overall strategy and seems to act only on the spur of the moment.  There is much confusion and lack of cohesion in the Government's approach to heritage.  The Minister seems to have no overall grasp of what is possible and what he can deliver on.</P>
      <P>This morning the Minister took the opportunity to outline the tremendous work the Office of Public Works has done in the past and is continuing to do. I will refer to some of the projects that deserve mention in a debate such as this.  We are all aware of the refurbishment in Dublin Castle, of which the nation can be proud.  That project was instigated under Mr. Haughey as Taoiseach.  We also welcome the major project for the National Museum which commenced in Collins Barracks, again with the support of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charlie Haughey, and the Minister for Finance of the day, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Delays are now evident with regard to staffing and are threatening that project.</P>

      <P>It is important to note some of the other proposals that have been put forward.  The Royal Hospital in Kilmainham is a wonderful asset to this nation.  Many conferences have been held there and our European partners have had an opportunity &mdash; no doubt they will have a similar opportunity during our Presidency &mdash; to hold meetings in that palatial building.  The restoration of the Royal Hospital was instigated under a Fianna Fáil Administration by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.</P>
      <P>We all rejoice in the work that has been carried out by the Office of Public Works in the Botanic Gardens. Although the Minister will try to claim credit for this also, it is important to note that it was the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who sanctioned the improvement works there.  The Minister will acknowledge it is no accident that the Botanic Gardens are of great interest to Deputy Bertie Ahern; they are not too far from his political base.  The Office of Public Works has also carried out great work on Kilkenny Castle.</P>
      <P>I made reference earlier to the importance of the canals.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal is a great success and provides an opportunity for people from the North and the South to get together.  Again, it was Deputy Bertie Ahern who commissioned the study on the canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In comparing the work carried out by the Office of Public Works over the years to the Minister's achievements, one is first reminded of his goal in attempting to make the grand gesture in regard to the artefacts from the Armada.  The Minister would also like <Col N="913" /> to claim credit for the setting up of the Heritage Council but it is well known that former Taoisigh, Charles Haughey and Deputy Albert Reynolds, always intended that council to have a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The Monuments Act, 1995 was used by the Minister to transfer power to himself without doing any real homework or having a strategy for the overall approach to the question of monuments.  The problems of the National Library, for example, are well documented.  I took the opportunity of raising the serious issues with regard to lack of funding for the National Library in a recent debate in this House.</P>
    <P>Despite the importance of legislation in this area, none has been forthcoming. Where is the legislation promised for some time by the Minister on national parks and heritage areas?  Where is the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill which was promised on many occasions?  We have been told it will be published this autumn and I encourage the Minister to ensure it is, if not beforehand.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister complied with EU directives pertaining to his Department?  The proposed National Cultural Institutions (Indemnities and Miscellanous Provisions) Bill has caused great disquiet among the professional staff of the National Museum and the National Library who do not view it as helpful to the heritage.  We were promised that legislation this session and I hope we will have an opportunity to debate it and pass it before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Where is the Government's response to the Green Paper on Broadcasting?  I realise this matter is not for debate now but I raise it to highlight the fact that while the Minister has responsibility for the whole area of broadcasting, he does not have any strategy.  We were promised broadcasting legislation and we are told a White Paper will be published in the autumn.  I welcome that as it is long overdue.  We were told the Minister wanted to examine the submissions following the publication of the Green Paper.  I agree with that procedure.  The whole purpose of publishing a Green <Col N="914" /> Paper is to allow for discussion and proposals to emanate from that discussion. We have had sufficient time for that discussion and yet there has been no movement on a broadcasting policy from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister likes to regard the film industry as his own special interest.  He has presided over and agreed to changes undermining section 35.  Regardless of what the Minister might say in public about section 35, it is obvious he recognises that confusion and uncertainty abound because of the recent changes in that section.  This has been demonstrated by his recent absence due to his foray into Hollywood.  Such behaviour reminds me of the phrase, &ldquo;rescuing defeat from victory&rdquo;.  The Minister eagerly jumped on the bandwagon of section 35, which was put in motion by Fianna Fáil, but due to the actions of his Government he is desperately trying to cling on as that bandwagon careers at great speed downhill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair bit of revisionism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I make these points to highlight the fact that the Minister seems incapable of drawing up a plan and following it through calmly and decisively.  That applies to all areas within his remit, including broadcasting. That plan has not emerged from the Minister's office although, to be fair to the Minister, he introduced the arts plan.  The Minister will readily acknowledge that the publication of this plan was due to the excellent work and commitment of the Arts Council.  The arts plan was announced by the Minister with great fanfare but, unfortunately, he did not keep his side of the bargain with regard to funding.  As a result, the three year arts plan has become a five year arts plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is small with approximately 70 employees compared to almost 800 employees in the Office of Public Works which includes the National Parks and Wildlife Service, <Col N="915" /> national monuments, historic properties, inland waterways, arterial drainage, etc.  Is this a case of David trying to tame Goliath?  If so, Goliath seems to be the good guy.</P>
    <P>The piecemeal transfer of part of the Office of Public Works to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, which we are witnessing today, is the worst of both worlds.  Fianna Fáil believes that all sections of the Office of Public Works should be under one umbrella in one Department and that the Minister should have secured this for the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  In the view of the party I represent it is not sufficient to say that this may well be on the way in future years.  What we need is a co-ordinated policy to help the whole area of heritage which, as the Minister stated, &ldquo;will not only remove the ambiguity to which I referred, but give a clearer sense of identity and sharper focus to the Heritage Service staff and provide an integrated framework for the formulation of heritage policy and its implementation&rdquo;. I agree with the Minister but, unfortunately, that has not been seen through. What has been expressed here is an aspiration but we need more than well meaning aspirations.  The entire Office of Public Works should have been incorporated under one umbrella which would not only have been for the betterment of the delivery of a heritage service but would have helped to rebuild the flagging morale within the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In voting on this Estimate, Fianna Fáil wishes to underline the fact that we are not against the allocation of funds for heritage within the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  We are protesting at what the Minister is doing regarding the State management of our heritage.  Unfortunately, the action we are witnessing today is not a brave new dawn, as the Minister would like to portray, but a sad and messy end to a private battle he began on assuming office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate on heritage matters and support the Estimate.  In matters of public policy and procedures in respect of heritage what has happened to date does not reflect on any side of the House.  In matters of conserving and preserving our heritage we lag far behind other European countries.  A journey along the Irish coastline, beginning in the west, continuing along the coast of Donegal and on to the coast of north Antrim illustrates the difference between the two jurisdictions on this island and the attitude of the two jurisdictions to matters of heritage. Travelling along the Donegal coast one's eyes are offended by the unregulated use of caravan and camping sites, abandoned cars and <i>ad hoc</i> and haphazard developments of every kind.  When one crosses the Border into Northern Ireland and tours the spectacularly beautiful Antrim coast, at different parts of the journey one will see signs stating: &ldquo;This is a designated area protected on your behalf by the National Trust&rdquo;.  On that coast one will not find development of any kind on the sea side of the road, no unplanned or haphazard development and no unregulated caravan parks.  I make that point because it is useful at the start of any debate on heritage matters to take our debate from where we now are and where we would like to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much emphasis these days on cross-Border development and there is much the Republic could learn from Northern Ireland.  I am sure there is much Northern Ireland could also learn from the Republic but in terms of heritage there is much we could learn from the way Northern Ireland and our neighbouring island manage and maintain their heritage and how the National Trust operates successfully on behalf of the citizens in protecting and preserving the heritage for this and future generations.  We have a long way to go in this country.  If we acknowledge that with a certain amount of honesty and humility at the beginning of this debate, we might begin to put legislation, procedures and practices in place.  There is <Col N="917" /> no doubt we need better legislation. This country is crying out for proper conservation legislation which seeks to preserve and protect our built environment.</P>
    <P>I have drafted a conservation Bill on behalf of my party which I will present in the Dáil at the first available opportunity.  I will ask the Minister for his co-operation in taking what I believe to be the correct and proper principles of conservation and bringing it into law.  We need to bring together all the different agencies and groups, State and voluntary, charged with looking after the environment and our heritage here.  In the Republic we need an independent body, the equivalent of the National Trust in Northern Ireland, to act on behalf of the State and its citizens as a custodian of our heritage to protect and promote better management and better procedures in the protection and preservation of our heritage.  As Deputy de Valera said &mdash; and I agree &mdash; too many groupings are charged with looking after what is essentially the same thing on a very small island.</P>
    <P>Just a week ago, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, the spokesperson on the Environment and I completed the Waste Management Bill. One of the items which is being addressed under the terms of that Bill is the question of abandoned cars and the damage inflicted on some of the most scenic parts by unauthorised dumping of every kind.  I ask the Minister to take on board the fact that too many different groups and agencies are involved when what we need is strong legislation to be enforced and implemented regionally. As the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, is present I will address part of my contribution to his area of responsibility.  In respect of the built environment and the manner in which public housing is maintained, some of the worst custodians are the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would put his energy behind the implementation of my suggestion.  Some of the bodies which have inflicted the greatest destruction on our built environment are local authorities.  Temple Bar Properties &mdash; a modern concept &mdash; is a recently appointed State agency.  Its main aim was conservation, preservation and urban renewal which would not result in destructive demolition.  Let us look at what it did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Chair will ensure that the procedures of the House are upheld.  If the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications wishes to comment, the procedure is that he can do so at the end of the debate.  Many demolitions and gutting of good buildings, elements of which ought to have been preserved and conserved, took place under the auspices of Temple Bar Properties Limited.  I am deeply disappointed that this was done by a body so recently appointed which was charged specifically with conservation.  Nothing better illustrates my point than the attitude of Temple Bar Properties to the Temple Bar pub &mdash; the company wanted to pull it down to put up a modern office block.</P>
      <P>In the past week, Dublin Corporation gave permission to build a hotel in College Green.  If there is one place which should be a &ldquo;Grade 1&rdquo;, three star conservation area it is College Green, because of its magnificence, beauty, ambience and integrity, the architectural merits of its buildings and their historical associations; yet we have no law which would designate and protect it as a conservation area.  The local authority decision was reduced to two options for the site, building either an hotel or an office block.  Nothing better illustrates the lack of proper conservation law than this recent decision.  I have finalised the drafting of a conservation Bill and will look for Government support to enact it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> We are only nibbling at the edges today.  We are discussing an Estimate of £40 million for heritage business and I freely acknowledge that fine heritage projects have been planned and executed in the last few years, which is to the credit of those who designed, promoted and now manage them.  Glenveagh Park, the Céide Fields and a number of other sites are gems but they have been developed on an <i>ad hoc,</i> once-off basis.  We do not have an overall integrated approach to the preservation and protection of our heritage.  That will only come when legislation is in place and local authorities and all those charged with preserving and protecting our environment, built and otherwise, enforce the legislation in their areas.</P>
    <P>At present, matters are far too haphazard.  If the built environment is a priority for a county manager, it is well maintained.  The way Kilkenny city is managed is a credit to the manager and the priority of the elected members. That is a case where heritage matters are well safeguarded; I will not mention other local authorities for which these issues are not priorities.  There must be a national policy, a national body and a national trust.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has returned to the House because I have a question for him, although he may tell me to put it down for Question Time next month.  One topical story today is that the ownership of the <i>Lusitania</i> has been determined finally and beyond doubt in the law courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The ownership of the vessel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the ownership of the vessel was awarded to Mr. Bemis yesterday by court order.  It was decreed that he was the sole and exclusive owner of the rights, title and interest of the <i>Lusitania</i> and of the hull, tackle, appurtenances, engines and apparel, so that has been determined beyond &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo;.  What action does the Minister now propose the Government should <Col N="920" /> take to assert Ireland's claim to some of the contents of the wreck, particularly the exclusive right to the paintings alleged to be on board?</P>
      <P>I mentioned the built environment. There is legislation to protect canals and waterways, which is welcome; however, as I said in a previous debate, I am not happy that there is any procedure to protect our railways.  What steps has the Minister taken in relation to the points I previously made?  Railways are major heritage items and an important part of our social history.  The artefacts and architecture of railways, such as lovely bridges and embankments, are fine examples of Irish craftsmanship from the last century.  Will the Minister consider railways, when putting in place a more integrated and comprehensive approach to the items which make up our precious heritage?</P>
      <P>Young people must be educated in the importance of our heritage.  If they intellectually or emotionally believed this heritage was theirs, they would insist that adults should put better procedures in place to protect it and they would play a stronger part in protecting it.  Any attempt to downgrade the teaching of history in our formal education system or to reduce the quality and nature of the history taught would, apart from many other implications, diminish what we in this House want to do in propagating a better understanding and awareness of and appreciation for heritage.  It is important that we be prepared to make any sacrifice, monetary or otherwise, to preserve our heritage and pass it on as our most important asset, apart from our young people; and we cannot possibly have a debate on heritage without stressing the need to educate young people about the fundamental importance of their heritage.  This cannot be done in a serious or sustained manner if history is to be downgraded in our education system.  Will the Minister make that point to the Government so that history remains a priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the good deeds of the Board of Works down the years.  Many projects it has brought to fruition are <Col N="921" /> the jewels in our crown.  The time has now come to streamline and co-ordinate the agencies whose remit is to protect, preserve and promote our heritage.  We must have a much more co-ordinated national approach.</P>
    <P>In the recent past, anybody who had a good idea in the middle of the night to boost the fortunes of an underdeveloped locality decided to build a heritage centre for the area.  A number of heritage centres were built around the country, some of which are extremely good because they are well designed and well stocked and have added greatly to our heritage library.  However, others are mediocre.  We need a stronger, national overall policy.  We need fewer heritage centres and the ones which exist should be better planned, executed, staffed and managed.  I have visited a number of them because I am interested in these matters and the material they stock might be equally well stocked in the local branch library.  We should plan future heritage centres with a broader perspective to ensure they are worthwhile and will stand the test of time for the next generation.</P>
    <P>Preservation of our heritage is very important from the point of view of our national identity and self-respect, and the spirit of the nation.  Our greatest wealth is our people, particularly our young people.  I would be happy to hand over the country to the next generation if they were imbued with a sense of national pride and self-respect.  People must be anchored to something and must be rooted in their heritage and past if they are to live in this complex, consumer society where all sorts of demands are made on their hearts and minds, particularly through the media, every day.  It is important for young people to be rooted in their past and anchored in their traditions, from which they can then move on.  It is essential for the well-being of the people of a nation that they know who they are, where they are going and how to shape a <Col N="922" /> decent, human environment for themselves and their children in this technological age where human values are often devalued.</P>
    <P>I place great importance on this debate and this Estimate, which I support.  More time and attention needs to be given to this drive to conserve, promote, protect and propagate our heritage.  The environment shapes our young people's attitudes, values and sense of personal dignity and self-respect when they leave the womb.  We have taken it for granted for far too long.  This should be the subject of strong all-party conviction and we must unite all our resources to protect and promote our heritage.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it was a matter of shame and embarrassment for me last summer and the previous summer to drive from the coast of the Irish Republic &mdash; with its carelessness about unauthorised dumping, abandoned cars, unregulated caravan and camping sites, and houses scattered all over the place &mdash; to Northern Ireland where I saw how they regulate these matters and the great work done by the National Trust. I would give my eyes to have a similar approach taken at every level in this country.  If I had the resources, I would take busloads of young people to see how beautifully the Antrim coast is preserved and protected and what a gem it is, and to see what can be done when people have their priorities in order. When the State has its priorities in order, it can demand and command respect from its citizens.  With due respect to Members, we have a long way to go before we bring the Republic up to that standard.  However, I suggest we begin and then accelerate the journey.  I support this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to see that the Minister has quite a bit of money to spend on the arts and culture.  However, I wish we had more money to spend on the matters to which Deputy Quill referred, as well as many other activities which need attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly asked questions in <Col N="923" /> the House, as the Minister is aware, about the wildlife aspect of his Department and the scandalous understaffing of that section.  We probably take our environment, wildlife and heritage for granted because there is so much of it. As a result, we are making some drastic mistakes.  Every day we lose part of our heritage because we do not have sufficient gardeners to look after it.  Species of wildlife are disappearing &mdash; being obliterated &mdash; because there are not sufficient staff to protect endangered species.  In Britain and Northern Ireland they keep guard over the nests of endangered bird species to ensure they can breed and are not destroyed.  A classic example of this is the golden eagle in Scotland where people have been imprisoned and heavily fined for interfering with the nests of such birds or shooting them.</P>
    <P>We seem to assume we can destroy everything around us with impunity, which is a disgrace.  I read yesterday in a national newspaper that the remains of an historic castle outside Ennis. County Clare, which is in Deputy de Valera's constituency, disappeared overnight.  People do that because they know they can get away with it.  If there is any possibility of a conservation order being placed on a building such as an old castle, they rush in and destroy it before the order can be placed upon it. I do not wish to be argumentative or abuse the Minister.  However, he does not have, or is not providing, the resources to stop that type of activity. I have never seen anybody brought to justice for destroying our heritage or endangered species of wildlife.  Our indifference is alarming and dreadful.  It was brought home forcibly to me three months ago when a deputation from the game councils of Ireland attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and pleaded for something to be done to stop continental visitors from shooting the remaining woodcock and snipe before they are eliminated.  I understand they took a High Court action against the Minister recently on <Col N="924" /> this issue.  They have been driven to this by despair because nothing is happening.</P>
    <P>Approximately 50 per cent of County Waterford is mountainous.  It has two major mountain ranges, the Comeragh Mountains, which stretch approximately 25 miles from Dungarvan to Clonmel, and the Knockmealdown Mountains, which border County Tipperary on the western end of the county.  In addition, there are many hilly regions, such as the Drumhills.  However, there is only one wildlife ranger to cover the county.  It would be a joke if it were not so serious. The ranger does an excellent job but he cannot possibly be expected to oversee, guard and preserve the wildlife within the county.  It would probably take a couple of dozen people to do it effectively.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not got the money or the resources to do what is necessary to protect our heritage and wildlife.  In addition, we do not have the will to address this issue.  For example, the law enforcement agencies do not have the will to prosecute people who destroy our heritage, culture and wildlife because it is considered a way of life to shoot birds and animals regardless of whether they are endangered.  This lack of will must be addressed.  The wildlife rangers have an impossible job.  Even with the best will in the world they cannot do anything like what is needed to protect our culture, heritage and wildlife.</P>
    <P>As we keep a census of people a census of every species of bird and animal is kept in Britain and Northern Ireland. They know how many robins and swans there are, while we have no records &mdash; only educated or uneducated guesses.</P>
    <P>Some species are not only endangered but have disappeared.  We know about the corncrake because he makes a din like a soccer fan with a rattler.  However, the birds or animals which do not make such a noise disappear, with nobody knowing anything about it.  Weed warblers, crested wrens, the many lovely birds which were so plentiful years ago are rarely, if ever, <Col N="925" /> seen.  There are huge areas of the country where common birds such as skylarks no longer exist.</P>
    <P>In view of the noise of the corncrake &mdash; he practically creates a political lobby because of the cracking sound he makes &mdash; and the emotions the bird has caused, efforts have been made at preservation in the Shannon valley, where they now exist because of natural reserves.  They also exist in north County Donegal, where I heard them in recent times &mdash; by-elections educate one in many ways. Indeed, north County Donegal and north County Mayo are the only two places where they still naturally exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his report that there are 76 nature reserves throughout the country.  This is a step in the right direction.  However, they are needed everywhere.  I appeal to him to get more money for more staff.  I know many young people who have a love of our way of life and the country scene who would be delighted to work in the wildlife service and to help protect and save our heritage.  We are not giving them an opportunity to help.  Perhaps some FÁS schemes could be directed to this area.  Is it not worth trying?  It has not been done because we do not care sufficiently.</P>
    <P>There are many species which are in danger of extinction.  Approximately 100 years ago the mountains and lands of this country carried a huge quantity of wildlife.  Yet in 1996, with all our modern devices, with EU Structural Funds and funding from the Exchequer, we have much less wildlife and we are busily trying to extinguish what we have left.</P>
    <P>One hundred years ago the mountain ranges teemed with birds such as woodcock, woodhens, partridges, grouse and widgeons.  However, today one could walk a mountain range for hours on end without seeing one such species.  Their natural habitat and feeding places have been destroyed by the over population of such mountain ranges with sheep. They depended for their feeding on the heather, buds and flowers available at this time of the year and through the <Col N="926" /> summer, but their food is now being devoured by sheep.  People recognise that areas of mountain have been grazed to the earth.  Wildlife cannot exist in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Under the REP scheme people are being paid to stop intensive farming.  I ask the Minister to consult the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for the Environment.  The name of the Department of the Environment is an abuse of the English language.  It is, rather, the Department of the destruction of the environment.  The word &ldquo;environment&rdquo; is misused and abused.  We must put life back into our hills and mountains.  The Minister should initiate a programme to reintroduce the species that have become extinct here.  They probably still exist in Scotland where they have been protected.  We should not be concerned merely with preserving the small number of endangered species that are here. Most people believe the pheasant is a native Irish bird.  It was brought here from China, I think, at the beginning of the century.  Therefore, we could reintroduce the species that have been eliminated.  People trap-snare and put birdlime on branches to cage goldfinch, yellowhammer or any sweet singing bird, but nobody is prosecuted.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is concerned about this matter.  I would not bother talking to any of the other Ministers about this because I know they do not give a damn about wildlife or heritage. The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has a major streak of humanity which I am sure everyone recognises.  I am not buttering him up to get a concession, this is a reality.  If he does not do something about this matter, who will?  While his tenure of office lasts &mdash; he is worth at least another year &mdash; I plead with him to introduce a programme to protect wildlife species, to appoint more wildlife rangers to protect the endangered species, to reintroduce those that have become extinct and stop tourists from shooting swans, songbirds and other wildlife species.  Pine martens, which exist in only small sections of the <Col N="927" /> country, should be reintroduced all over the country.  Priceless species, that are on the verge of extinction, should be protected and, if necessary, reintroduced.</P>
    <P>We adhere to extraordinary double standards in terms of habitats.  The European Union pays people large sums of money not to cultivate the best land in the country, it is called setaside. On the other hand, we allow people to destroy the natural habitats of a large quantity of wildlife.  There is no control over the draining of wetlands.  The habitats of duck, snipe, quail and so on are being destroyed and, consequently, they become extinct.  Glens which are full of shrubs, blackberry bushes and so on are being reclaimed even though they are the natural habitats of dozens of birds and animals.  We pay people not to cultivate the best land but allow them &mdash; even give them grants &mdash; to reclaim bad land which is the natural habitat of large numbers of wildlife species.  That is ridiculous, duplicity and contradictory and I ask the Minister to refer to this in his reply.  Why do we allow the destruction of marshes, slobs, boggy lands, glens and undergrowth?  Could European money not be put to better use?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in the middle of the bird nesting season.  The public was not informed that it was one month late this year.  There is not a proper information service on those matters, but the birds know it has been cold and wet for the past six months and we are only beginning to see them now.  However, that means nothing to county councils and individuals who are cutting fences and hedges all over the country.  Irrespective <Col N="928" /> of their rarity, nobody is concerned about protecting nesting birds or breeding animals.</P>
    <P>It is time we adopted a caring attitude towards wildlife and a will to protect it. While I have considerable confidence in the present Minister that will is not present in high places.  If he does not do something about the matter, nothing will be done about it in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sad day.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht may have a commitment to heritage but it is regrettable that we are witnessing the total destruction and demise of the oldest State agency in the nation. No office has consistently served us with greater distinction or made a greater contribution to development than the Office of Public Works.  I speak as one who understood the work of that office long before I became a Member of the House 14 years ago and as the State's first Minister of State with responsibility for heritage affairs who served two terms in the Office of Public Works. The quality of the administration and the professionals and the complexity of the operations of the Office of Public Works have not been equalled by any other Department.  Having served for eight years as a Minister of State in six different Departments, I can say without doubt that I never experienced the commitment, co-operation or quality of people I met in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great respect for the Minister but he destroyed the Office of Public Works by sleight of hand.  Members will recall that when dealing with a Bill here last year he put through a composite motion which was not included in the initial legislation.  He and his officials were advised by the administration of the House that the motion had to be put through to remove the powers of the Office of Public Works.  Were it not for the alertness of our spokesperson, Deputy Síle de Valera, it would have gone through without notice.  As matters stood, we had little opportunity to <Col N="929" /> debate it; we did our best in the few minutes available and voted on it, but the Government succeeded in taking more powers from the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution every State agency with commissioners has explicit powers.  These agencies include the Revenue Commissioners, the Commissioners of Public Works the Commissioners of Charitable Bequests, etc. If this legislation, which the Minister has brought forward to destroy the Office of Public Works, was tested in the courts it would be found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary to make such drastic changes?  It is because this Government, in putting together a hastily prepared programme, felt that creating a new Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht would signal to the nation that the Labour Party was the be all and end all of modern Irish politics and would write a new chapter in the history of Irish political life.  A very intelligent man from the west of Ireland, a Clareman by birth, a Galwayman by election, was appointed Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. When he went into office he found himself in a big room, with a big chair, a big desk, a small number of staff and a very vague brief.  He was advised by his new staff, many of whom were pilfered from the Office of Public Works, that it was time he built an empire around himself. As a partner in that Government Fianna Fáil was anxious to ensure we would not see the demise of the Office of Public Works.  Our party leader was Minister for Finance and the Public Service.  He and our Chief Whip, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and I were involved in negotiations to find a formula that would keep the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and their cohorts in the Labour Party happy.  The Labour Party had another agenda which I will not dwell on today but, when political history has been analysed, that agenda will be exposed for what it was, short-term political expediency at the expense of the national interest, not just <Col N="930" /> in this situation but in others.  Slowly but surely the Office of Public Works, which served Governments, Taoisigh, Ministers for Finance and Cabinets, has been denuded of its powers and deprived of the opportunity to serve this country as it traditionally did.</P>
    <P>All that is left to the Office of Public Works, now that all the powers encoded in the document before us have been taken away, is to manage the State property portfolio which it did with great distinction for many years despite difficulties caused by the indecision of Departments and other State agencies. For example, Government Departments and State agencies often told the Office of Public Works, 12 months in advance, they wanted so many square feet of office space in a particular place at a particular time to deliver a service and, a month before they were due to occupy the premises, indicated either that they did not need it or they did not need so much.  In those circumstances the Office of Public Works had to carry the can when the Comptroller and Auditor General exposed a shortfall, and it was the Office of Public Works that was left with egg on its face, not those who were responsible for making the decisions, often at huge cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to outline clearly why he brought forward this motion transferring certain powers from the Office of Public Works to himself, and why a Government that is supposed to be transparent, open and accountable failed to respond positively to a question put by Deputy Bertie Ahern and me asking if a Government decision had been taken.  We were denied the information that the Government took a decision some months ago on this issue, even though it was well known.  I want to know when the decision was taken, what submission the Minister made at Cabinet to get that decision, the basis for the decision and why this House was not informed at that time.</P>
    <P>I admire the work at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I admire the work of the Minister in many facets of his job.  We have shared <Col N="931" /> many interests in the past.  We were members of the same union where his contributions were intelligent and colourful &mdash; we did not always agree, but we agreed to differ.  The Government's inconsistency and that of the Minister, and the negative attitude towards the Office of Public Works have never before been seen in parliamentary or political history.  The Office of Public Works has been the guardian of our heritage for a century and a half. It has done tremendous work and brought us into modern times with massive investment in difficult times, and has restored some of our finest heritage sites to an internationally recognised standard.  Why do we have to destroy the ability of the Office of Public Works to manage these areas as they were managed in the past?  Why can the responsibility for such matters not be left where it was?  What is the Government's agenda?  There are three powerful commissioners with a constitutional, legal and administrative role to play. What will be their future role?  This House is entitled to know today before this decision is taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the first Minister in the history of the State to hold that position, should concentrate on developing arts, culture and the Gaeltacht and let the Office of Public Works get on with its job.  Those who succeeded Deputy Dempsey and me in the Office of Public Works have not been fortunate.  They have been sacked, dismissed, shafted or moved sideways, transferred or demoted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what relevance Deputy Reynolds's record has to anything we are discussing today.  My point is that the Minister has an Ghaeltacht in a choinne.  Tá dualgas air an Ghaeltacht a leathnú agus a láidriú, airgead agus áiseanna a chur ar fáil agus saothrú ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá scóip iontach aige an cultúr agus an ealaín a chur ar aghaidh.  Níl aon ghá le bheith ag obair in aghaidh oidhreacht ár dtíre in Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí.</P>
      <P>Why must the national parks, wildlife and inland waterways services be transferred since, as the record will show, the power and investment already exist? In 1987 the Government in which my party participated, in co-operation with the Office of Public Works, published a national heritage development plan which included all waterways and heritage properties.  We co-operated with Bord Fáilte and the then Department of Tourism and Trade in devising that major plan, incorporated in the National Development plan, agreed by Brussels, which included massive investment in heritage tourism.</P>
      <P>Finding himself in a Department bereft of ideas and commitments &mdash; having observed the very successful operations of the Office of Public Works to date, the Minister wants to pretend that, within his term of office, he did this, that and the other, endeavouring unfairly to pull them under his departmental umbrella.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need only look at the circumstances surrounding the proposed interpretative centres in Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley to perceive the hypocrisy and inconsistency of the Cabinet's decisions.  Because the Taoiseach comes from County Meath and the Boyne Valley is located in his constituency, the interpretative centre there is saved.  It is all right to proceed <Col N="933" /> with that development despite the objections of Lord Henry Mountcharles and others.</P>
    <P>When responsible for the Office of Public Works, I was deeply involved in all those decisions and had the finest professional advice nationwide available to me.  I examined them all in great detail.  The wine connoisseurs of this country were not able to inveigle me into changing my decision to proceed with such investment; international stars flown in were unable to influence me in denying the people of Wicklow their rightful investment entitlement.  There was nothing wrong with our proposal to locate an interpretative centre in Luggala in the middle of a commercial forest, acquired from Coillte Teo, the State forestry organisation.  It was to be developed in the heart of Wicklow, with investment in tourism facilities there, not only for locals but for one-third of our population living in the capital, who could make daily evening visits in summer time and at weekends all year round in addition to visits by tourists to that and other centres in County Wicklow.  Because it did not suit certain influential people, a disgraceful decision was taken not to proceed with that development.</P>
    <P>Again, in the case of the proposed interpretative centre at Mullaghmore, several agendas were being played.  I cannot understand how the Minister, a Clareman, could have denied the people of the county of his birth the proposed investment there.  I met all the objectors on numerous occasions, once for four hours in a location close to the Minister's own city.  I outlined our proposals, gave a firm commitment on the additional investment and a third option, all of which was agreed.  Yet the following day I read a headline in <i>The Irish Times:</i>&ldquo;Minister admits major mistake&rdquo;.  I did not admit a mistake. What happened was that, although I had been prepared to meet those objectors face to face for four hours, our discussion was manipulated and leaked to the press in an effort to convey a different story.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> In addition there was the recent report of Brady, Shipman and Martin confirming that the Office of Public Works had been right, that the funds were being invested in the right place, which should have ensured that the development went ahead.  The tragedy is that taxpayer's money has been wasted on a site in the heart of the Burren, when investment was badly needed.  Purists, lefties and commercial interests objected, and others were brought in to object, which resulted in the professionals in the Office of Public Works and the people of Clare, who wanted the centre, all being reneged on by a democratically-elected Government, particularly by a Clareman, the Minister who took that decision.  It was indeed a sad day; something that should never have happened.  I hope the Minister will review his decision and give the go-ahead for the centre because he has let down his countymen and wasted taxpayer's money.  All reports show conclusive evidence that the centre should have been built.</P>
    <P>The Boyne Valley is another beautiful region.  One need only compare any of the centres built by the Office of Public Works &mdash; an example is Glenveagh Park &mdash; to realise the professionalism of its personnel.  If that development was proposed today and given the go-ahead, would there be the same objectors? Would development of the Connemara National Park have gone ahead today if we had heeded all those objectors? There is a beautiful one in Kerry &mdash; Ionad na Blaisceidí, one of the most beautiful developments nationwide, in a region of great natural beauty, with tremendous heritage, cultural and tourism potential without any facilities or amenities.  While we invested in facilities there a part of Clare and its people that did not have such facilities was denied them.  Since the west Clare region had commercial facilities and opportunities, it was important that we did not overkill through encouraging mass tourism to that area.  It was important to strike a balance, providing appropriate facilities to attract tourists to other regions of <Col N="935" /> that county.  If not in the lifetime of this Government, I hope that development at Mullaghmore will go ahead.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Commissioners of Public Works with whom I worked.  I understand that, for the first time in the history of the State, a former chairman of the Office of Public Works, a young man with tremendous leadership ability, was transferred to another public service office and was the first such chairman of a State agency not to receive a letter of commendation on his work from the Minister in office.</P>

      <P>Perhaps but we had only one, which was to preserve our national heritage.  I note that Deputy Bradford is present &mdash; indeed it is not the first time that a Government whose members comprised members of the Fine Gael Party took such a silly decision <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Office of Public Works.  On one occasion the Government led by Dr. Garrett FitzGerald took a decision about a section of the Office of Public Works on a Friday and confirmed it should remain under the aegis of that office as pressure had been exerted over the weekend.  The Cabinet changed its decision the following Tuesday and decided to leave the section, which must deliver a nationwide service, <Col N="936" /> within the Office of Public Works but is accountable to another Government Department.  I am talking of experts involved in school buildings, originally the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, still based in the Office of Public Works, acting for that office, but accountable to the Department of Education.</P>

It was a silly decision, leaving personnel in the Office of Public Works in a vacuum, working for one Department and accountable to another.  They are still endeavouring to deliver that nationwide service.  They should have been transferred directly to another State agency.</P>
      <P>The Minister has no comprehension of the contribution of the Office of Public Works to this nation over the past 150 years.  He is now attempting to take kudos for that expertise and success created and delivered over very many years by a team of experts, under tremendous political leadership.  He is attempting to do so, finding himself in a Department with a very narrow agenda that could not deliver to the satisfaction of the Minister and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the future role of the three Commissioners of the Office of Public Works and their staff?  Is the Minister aware of their low morale nationwide? <Col N="937" /> Public service personnel generally are very agitated, not only within the Office of Public Works but in many other Departments, because of the attitude of the Government to them.  I want the Minister to reassure the House and the electorate that the role of the Office of Public Works over very many years will continue.</P>

      <P>This welcome debate on heritage is very relevant.  However, I am disturbed that after 18 months in Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party is still in such a negative mood and has failed to come to grips with the fact that a different party is in Government.  Anything done by this Government seems to them to be totally wrong.  I was interested to hear Deputy Noel Treacy putting the blame for the fall of the previous Government on the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The then Opposition were in awe of what was happening on the Government benches &mdash; the confusion, things changing by the hour.</P>
      <P>We have a proud heritage and must ensure it is maintained in a way that will not damage business or interfere with jobs and prosperity.  The tremendous work on the Ballinamore canal from west Cavan to Leitrim has been of immense benefit to tourism and is a tribute to those involved with the project for years.</P>
      <P>Some of the people involved in that project want to promote the restoration of the Ulster canal.  I have no problem with that, and it will certainly be of benefit to Clones and towns across the Border.  However, progress on that project is being blamed for the failure to go ahead with the Monaghan by-pass. People approaching the town from the Donegal-Armagh end have to wait for up to half an hour because there is no by-pass.  Whereas heritage is important, common sense must come into play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand approximately £750,000 <Col N="938" /> has been allocated for a study of the Ulster canal.  Will the Minister give serious consideration to running the canal at the outer edges of Monaghan town starting for the Clones side of the town and heading left as it approaches the town?  If this does not happen this vibrant business town will be left in total chaos.  I understand it would cost £2 million to construct the bypass without allowing the passage of the canal through the St. Davnet's complex to impinge on it, but it would cost at least £4.5 million to reroute the canal in the future.  The National Roads Authority is clearly not prepared to do that and wants to bring the by-pass a few miles outside the town.  If at all possible I want the canal to be reopened but that must not interfere with the needs of the town and the people who use the M2 motorway from Donegal to Dublin.</P>
    <P>At the time the national plan was formulated the M2 motorway stopped at the Border.  Money was allocated to the Broomfield stretch outside Castleblayney.  Very few of those who travel from Monaghan to Donegal or Derry use the route proposed to the EU, that is via Longford, Sligo, Bundoran.  We want to ensure that the proposals for the canal go ahead without hampering progress.</P>
    <P>Tremendous efforts have been made in recent years to preserve important buildings.  Local groups with the assistance of FÁS and local authorities have undertaken preservation work on important local buildings.  The restoration of the market house in Bailieborough is an example of how old structures can be utilised for the benefit of the area.  In my village of Newbliss, a local group worked with FÁS and did tremendous work on the market house. In one section of the county council the market house was a listed building whereas another section sent out a letter to the FÁS group seeking to have it demolished because it was in poor structural order.  Thankfully, the group were able to preserve it.</P>
    <P>Annaghmakerrig House was left to the nation by the late Sir John Guthrie. <Col N="939" /> The Office of Public Works and the Heritage Council are very much involved and it plays a major role in our promotion of the arts in County Monaghan.  A former Member for Cavan-Monaghan, Mr. John Wilson, serves on the board.  Annaghmakerrig House has a major role to play in bringing people from all over the world to our area.  I want to ensure it is financed and looked after in the future.  The old Lesley estate of Glasslough and Rossmore Park are local amenities.  The Senator Billy Fox Memorial Park in Shercock is very dear to me and to my party.  It commemorates the late Senator Billy Fox who died in the troubles.  This was under the control of Coillte before Coillte became a commercial State body.  I would like to see somebody take full responsibility for the park so that responsibility for it does not rest with a small number of local people.  Coillte has been very helpful in the past 12 months but prior to its involvement the park was left almost derelict.  It has now been brought back to life and is a very useful tourism amenity.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council has the task of providing independent advice and assistance to voluntary organisations, local authorities and private individuals on heritage issues.  That is important. The allocation of a small amount of money would assist groups in helping to preserve church buildings.  Those groups do not have access to central funds. They care for beautiful and expensive buildings.  In Monaghan town the Church of Ireland building is of great importance from a heritage point of view.  The small group of people who preserve it make efforts to keep the spire and building in good condition. Such groups should be given an allocation, no necessarily a large amount, but a small amount on an ongoing basis, perhaps once every five or ten years, to assist them in the upkeep of such buildings.  Such money would not only assist church groups involved but the local areas concerned.</P>
    <P>Why is there such a major reaction to <Col N="940" /> change?  If this Government did not make changes to improve some areas, I am sure the Opposition would be critical, and that would be right.  We should not object to change for the sake of it. Old bodies worked well.  I have worked closely with the Office of Public Works. It was suggested it should restore old schools.  It does restore them and I pay tribute to its efforts to restore buildings that have been neglected for many years.  It did excellent work on restoring the local agricultural office in Ballybay. However, it does not mean that some areas cannot and should not be changed if there is a good reason for making changes.  The Minister has good reason to ensure that our heritage is preserved in the best possible way.  I have no problem supporting this Estimate in the knowledge that the Minister will take account of what we are saying and will do his best to ensure our heritage is perceived.</P>
    <P>REPS is of great benefit to rural areas.  When farmers are under severe pressure as a result of the beef crisis, it is important that funds under that scheme flow into rural Ireland.  That scheme will help to address some of the issues raised by Deputy Deasy, but that must be done properly.  REPS constitutes a sizeable amount of funding and assists farmers in rural areas.  It is not merely a handout, such funds must be used in a properly structured fashion.  If farmers are asked under a farm plan to make changes to assist in preserving our heritage for the future, they should do so.  Those who suggest that REPS represents £5,000 of easy money and that nothing needs to be done are not being helpful.  Almost as many applications to participate in that scheme are being received on a monthly basis as were received altogether in 1994.  That scheme has a major role to play in protecting our heritage, but it must be well administered and adhered to.  That scheme together with the heritage council and the areas for which the Minister <Col N="941" /> has responsibility can do much to preserve our national heritage structure, improve the quality of life of our people and the appearance of the countryside.</P>

      <P>We welcome the opportunity to discuss the Minister's stewardship of the areas for which he has responsibility.  When introducing the Supplementary Estimate and endeavouring to convey to the House the perceived progress that has been made, the Minister said that the working group had produced two alternative sets of arrangements, neither of which was acceptable to all concerned.  The Government then decided in November 1993 to appoint a larger interdepartmental group which included representatives of the Department of Finance and the Attorney General, but this also failed to come up with an acceptable solution.  There have been three attempts to achieve what the Minister has dressed up in a rather confused presentation of what he is endeavouring to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the concept of attention to detail and co-ordination of work is most desirable, particularly in addressing the waterways issue. The former ownership of the canals by CIÉ was a dated issue that needed to be addressed.  The Minister has been given additional responsibilities.  Power has been taken from the various Departments, scrambled and given to the Minister.  Two working groups and an interdepartmental group could not come up with an intelligent and acceptable solution.  It follows that a political attempt is being made to put a structure together that was studied three times and not considered to be effective or workable.  The Office of Public Works should have been given extra powers. The grouping of arts, heritage and culture makes sense, but upgrading the <Col N="942" /> waterways requires engineering expertise.  The Office of Public Works had such expertise and granting it additional powers to co-ordinate work would have made a good deal more sense.</P>
    <P>What has been decided is before the House, it will be passed and will come into effect.  We must consider how it will improve the present position.  The two canals and the river Liffey run through my constituency.  All three waterways are in urgent need of attention and investment.  They are excellent amenities, very much underutilised and close to large urban areas.  I was at the Grand Canal when the Minister launched a co-operation project with his counterpart running the inland waterways in the United Kingdom.  Having heard the presentations we learned of the work approved by Governments and appropriate agencies in the UK and mainland Europe to convert waterways from their traditional role as a commercial route into amenities.  I welcome any changes that will upgrade our network of waterways.</P>
    <P>The first major recognition of the potential of our waterways was highlighted when the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, launched the opening of the Ballyconnell link achieved through the co-operation of the ESB. Everybody recognises it is an excellent facility.</P>

      <P>The 150th anniversaries of the Young Ireland Movement and the Rising of 1848 will be among the events to be considered by the Government in the context of framing the 1998 postage stamp programme.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Transfer pricing is a hidden internal practice within a multinational organisation and cannot as such be measured directly.  It is not possible, therefore, to assess the impact, if any, of transfer pricing either on the merchandise trade balance or on the services trade balance presented in the CSO's balance of payments statistics.  However, there are a number of factors which suggest that the <Col N="945" /> practice of transfer pricing, to the extent that it exists, is declining in Ireland. First, the move from export sales relief to a 10 per cent rate of tax reduced the attraction of engaging in the practice and, second, most of the capital exporting countries have in recent years become more vigorous in their policing and detection of transfer pricing.</P>
      <P>To the extent that transfer pricing may exist and impact on Ireland's international trade balance, its effect is essentially removed in the current account of the balance of payments through the repatriation of profits, as well as royalty, dividend and interest outflows.</P>
      <P>Indications from the annual Census of Industrial Production are that 70 per cent-80 per cent of manufactured exports are accounted for by foreign-owned companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, the level of transfer pricing has been reduced considerably through policing, vigilance and international co-operation.  The move from export sales relief to a 10 per cent rate of tax is a further deterrent. In recent years most capital exporting countries have tightened up their policing arrangements, are more vigilant and have put more punitive sanctions in place.  There is a considerable level of vigilance in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures but all the indications are that the level of transfer pricing has diminished considerably.  Two of the deterrents are increased vigilance and the 10 per cent tax rate.  There is less likelihood of transfer pricing now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to conceal the complexity of the issue.  The objective of people engaged in this activity is to maximise the global distribution of their profits to minimise the overall company tax bill.  This was the practice but all the evidence is that it no longer exists to any great extent.  There are deterrents.  In addition, the authorities both here and on the international stage are rigorously policing their respective domestic arrangements to ensure it is kept to the minimum.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point about the multinationals, but we have to acknowledge the contribution they have made to the economy.  There is not a solitary county in the country which does not have a multinational.  I can list seven or eight in my own county.  One should not begrudge them the grant aid they have been given in view of the substantial number of jobs created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If export values are overstated, profits should be inflated by an equal amount, which would increase the value of GDP.  Since the companies that may engage in transfer pricing tend to be foreign owned most of the higher profits would be remitted abroad and netted out in arriving at the figure for GNP, in other words, the income accruing to residents.  Thus, any impact of transfer pricing would be removed in the calculation of GNP.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is <Col N="950" /> aware, we are not talking about the capital cost of a house which is seen as an investment, but the interest element, the changes in which are minimal.  Overall, housing accounts for 7.16 per cent of the CPI basket of goods and services.  At 3.39 per cent, mortgage interest is the largest item within the housing commodity group.  The other items are: rents, 1.52 per cent; local authority charges, 0.18 per cent; housing insurance, 0.65 per cent and repairs and decorations, 1.43 per cent.</P>
      <P>I have read the newspaper reports to which the Deputy referred and know that on previous occasions the Central Bank intervened, but there is no evidence on this occasion that the bank sees any need to do so because there is no anxiety.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by the Tánaiste and Ministers for Social Welfare and Finance, I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions last Wednesday.  I expressed the Government's concern at recent industrial relations developments in the public service, including the teaching, nursing and CPSU areas.  In particular, I expressed concern at current and threatened industrial action which is contrary to the peace clauses of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against the background of the achievements of social partnership since 1987, we agreed to work in partnership to meet the changes facing the public <Col N="951" /> service and achieve necessary restructuring in a positive and constructive way.  We also agreed that urgent discussions would take place to find a means of resolving and bringing to finality the current problems, including the teaching, nursing and CPSU areas, within the parameters of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>In that context, I am pleased to say that these discussions, between the Government and Congress, have developed a framework to allow current issues to be resolved.  The details of this framework are set down in a joint Government-ICTU statement which I am circulating to Deputies.</P>
    <P>Separate discussions have taken place with the Civil and Public Service Union and a satisfactory arrangement to progress the outstanding issues within the framework has been identified.  As a result, I am pleased to say that action affecting animal testing and uprating of social welfare benefits is being terminated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health today met the Alliance of Nursing Unions.  The Minister outlined the framework to the unions and asked them to consider working through the framework to resolve the concerns of nurses in a positive way.</P>
    <P>Discussions are continuing with the teaching unions which are examining how this framework, or a similar framework, might enable outstanding issues for teachers to be brought to an acceptable conclusion.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the arrangements developed in the discussions with the ICTU provide a sound basis for the resolution of current difficulties and significantly enhance the prospects for continuing and developing social partnership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the best way to effect an increase in take home pay for workers is through changes in taxation rather than nominal wage increases?</P>

    <Col N="952" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of equal value whichever way the money comes into the pay packet in terms of the people who receive it, but, plainly, from a national point of view it is important that we maintain our competitiveness, industrial peace and respect for agreements.</P>
      <P>I am glad that following the meeting I had with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, together we have been able to find a way of overcoming a number of difficulties that were building up on the industrial relations front.  That will achieve the objectives of maintaining competitiveness and industrial peace and providing ultimately for sharing equitably the benefits of economic growth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for referring to the framework in his reply.  Needless to say, I cannot examine it until later.  Will the framework address the difficulties within the Army and the grave concern among soldiers about a number of outstanding issues? Will it address teachers' and nurses' issues and the issue of staff in the Civil Service?  Without going into the details, how does the Taoiseach believe the current industrial disputes will be resolved without breaching the guidelines of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The framework to which I referred, which has been agreed between the Congress of Trade Unions and the Government, represents an extension of what is entirely consistent with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The framework will provide for overcoming disagreements about the appropriate level of compensation for structural change and changes in work practices that should be made in individual work areas.  We have provided for a framework for resolving individual disputes, which will differ from one profession or work area to another.  The form of restructuring to be undertaken and the appropriate level of compensation for same will vary <Col N="953" /> depending on the area of work in question at a given time.  The framework is capable of being used across the board. That is why the Government's decision to engage directly with Congress on this matter was the appropriate approach rather than adopting a wider approach. We have achieved the right result from the way we approached this matter with Congress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the agricultural issue and the difficulty with certificates, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that the backlog that resulted from the dispute, which has lasted several weeks and created major difficulties in the agricultural sector, particularly the beef sector, will be dealt with without delay? Will he ensure that the age old practice of putting additional resources into a section where a huge delay has built up will be employed immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the industrial action in the agriculture area has stopped, normal working will resume. There is a backlog, however, and I have no doubt the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will make the appropriate arrangements to deal with that as quickly as possible.  I ask people to understand that we have overcome the difficulty that existed but everything cannot be dealt with in a day or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the new Framework Document to which the Taoiseach referred have uniform application throughout all Departments as distinct from the arrangement entered into earlier, whereby each separate arrangement <Col N="954" /> would rest within the parameters of the Department involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I follow the Deputy's question.  The framework is designed to deal with the type of matter that was provided for in clause 2.3 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> We have provided an agreed framework for resolving arguments about the appropriate level of payment for appropriate level of productivity improvement in particular areas.  While the framework applies across the board, consideration in each individual case will differ because circumstances will differ.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> provides for productivity increases and allows people with special claims to negotiate them. Since that provision exists why is it necessary to have another framework?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with special claims.  As the Deputy should remember, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> does not provide for a mechanism to deal with what are known as special claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to special increases.  This is not a provision for special increases, it is a provision for dealing with extra payments in the public service for improvements in productivity.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> does not contain a great deal of detail about the appropriate level of increase for an appropriate level of productivity for a given grade or about how productivity in one grade would relate to productivity in other grades in a co-operative organisation.  Those issues were not elaborated to any great degree in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and that lack of a system contributed in some measure at least to the difficulties that arose.  I am glad following <Col N="955" /> my meeting with the Congress of Trade Unions last Wednesday we have worked out a mechanism or framework for dealing with these problems.  That is very welcome and is a considerable achievement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the trade unions are aware, in the past three years there has been a well run practice of dealing with productivity claims, but programmes covering the last nine years have not dealt with the fact that where a Government wants to pay up, outside a programme, it finds a way of doing so.  At last week's meeting did the trade union movement express the real reason for the difficulties, as articulated at union meetings for the last three months, that there is grave disappointment at the absence of significant income tax relief in the budget, as promised in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>? It was pointed out that the Government has broken its promise in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to undertake in the 1995 and 1996 budgets to reduce income tax as a portion of total revenue and that is the real reason for the difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> all workers have experienced a significant improvement in living standards.  If we look at the position that applied under successive programmes of this kind, since 1987 there has been a 17.5 per cent increase in take home pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>the number of murders committed in 1995 and to date in 1996; the number of arrests made in each case; the number charged in each case; the number convicted or acquitted in each case; the plans, if any, she has to deter further such offence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there were 43 murders, including two cases of murder of persons aged under one year, in 1995.  Twenty-nine persons were charged in respect of 24 of these murders.  The situation in the cases where persons have been charged is as follows: pending before the courts &mdash; 24; convicted &mdash; 4; and charge dismissed &mdash; 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of investigations into all of these murders, many people would have been questioned by the gardaí and arrests made as appropriate.  Investigations into the remaining 19 cases are ongoing and arrests have been made in 15 of these cases, but the persons concerned were released without charge &mdash;<Col N="960" /> it should be noted that in three other cases suspects are deceased.</P>
    <P>As regards 1996, I am informed by the Garda authorities that there were 20 murders as per the date of compilation of these figures.  Thirteen persons were charged in respect of 12 of these murders.  All of these cases are currently pending before the courts.  Investigations into the remaining eight cases are ongoing and arrests have been made in five of these cases, but the persons concerned were released without charge &mdash; it should be noted that in one other case the suspect is deceased.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the murder figures supplied are provisional and, subject to the outcome of Garda investigations and/or directions from the law officers, a number of these cases may be subsequently reclassified as manslaughter or some other crime.</P>
    <P>All murders are fully investigated by the gardaí and every possible effort is made to bring the perpetrators to justice.  In this regard, the gardaí allocate optimum resources to the investigation of all murders.  The primary task, of course, is to identify those responsible and to assemble evidence to support the institution of legal proceedings.  In addition, special attention is also directed to the motivation involved.</P>
    <P>Crimes of this nature are investigated by divisional investigation teams, the membership of which includes detective gardaí who have been trained in the investigation of serious crime.  The gardaí involved in these investigations know the local community and they work in close proximity to sources of intelligence.  The divisional investigation teams are assisted by gardaí from the Garda Technical Bureau who provide specialised services such as ballistics, photography and fingerprints.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing assistance to the divisional units, the Serious Crime Squad at the Central Detective Unit has the task of gathering intelligence and information on all serious crime.  Every effort is made in the examination and collation of this material to establish if the crimes are linked in any way.  This <Col N="961" /> includes, in the case of murder, trying to establish if there is a common perpetrator for two or more offences.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that maximum resources are deployed to solve all murder cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the appalling number of murders in the State over the past 18 months, does the Minister for Justice consider that the expertise available to the Garda for the investigation of these offences is adequate; if she believes there is a need for the reinstatement of the murder squad and whether she is concerned about the increase in murder of and attacks on women?  What action does the Minister intend to take on these very serious matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Garda authorities are satisfied that the maximum resources are deployed in the solving of all murder cases.  They have informed me they have adequate resources to investigate all murders thoroughly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised the issue of the restoration of the murder squad. This has earned some notoriety in the media as if, somehow or other, the absence of a murder squad means there are no resources or facilities for the Garda to investigate murders.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It might be appropriate for me to remind the Deputies of what the Commissioner said yesterday to the members of the Garda Síochána.  He stated:</P>
      <P>I would like to repeat again that the Murder Squad (which investigated all serious crime as well as murder) was not disbanded in the late 1980's.  It was reduced substantially in numbers in the belief that Detectives would operate more effectively if based nearer to the location of serious crime and nearer to sources of information. I agree totally with the decision which was taken then and I feel that I am in a far better position to judge the situation than most others, given that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> I worked for 16 years in the Murder Squad in three different ranks.</P>
    <P>There are two Detective Superintendents and a number of Detective Sergeants in the Serious Crime Unit at H.Q. available to provide advice and expertise in major and complex investigations.  The personnel who were deployed to other Detective duties from the Murder Squad are made available when needed for the investigation of serious crime, from their new locations, such as the Central Detective Unit at Harcourt Square.  Forensic/technical support continues to be provided from H.Q. as it has always been.  Training courses for Detectives and Scene of Crime Examiners are ongoing and members are allocated periodically to the Serious Crime Unit at H.Q. to gain first-hand experience in investigation techniques.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting the words of the Commissioner which seem to express a type of frustration at the perception that there did not seem to be a murder investigation capability in the Garda.</P>
    <P>He said: &ldquo;The incongruity of headlines which call for the restoration of the murder squad while reporting on the successful investigation of murder, or maybe double murders, by the present methods is not recognised by all&rdquo;.  I am satisfied from what the Garda Commissioner told me, and from what he said as recently as yesterday, that he does not believe there is a need for a unit called the murder squad to be reestablished.  We have a serious crime investigations service and there are all sorts of expertise available for the investigation of murder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has selectively quoted from the Garda Representative Association conference yesterday.  The President of the Garda Representative Association said yesterday it was clear that the Government had no interest in crime.  Is the Minister satisfied with the detection rate in <Col N="963" /> respect of so called &ldquo;gangland&rdquo; or &ldquo;contract&rdquo; killings and how does she intend to tackle it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted from the Garda Commissioner's statement, not from the GRA conference.  The Deputy also chose a selective piece from that conference.  I quoted from the Garda Commissioner's statement because the Deputy asked me about the murder squad.  If the Deputy had been present at the GRA conference he would have heard my rebuttal of the allegation by the President of the GRA who said this Government had no interest in crime. With regard to what the Deputy referred to as &ldquo;contract&rdquo; killings all murders are murder.  In our law there is no such thing as &ldquo;contract&rdquo; killing.  I know what the Deputy is referring to &mdash; a killing that takes place where somebody walks into somebody's house, assassinates them and disappears.  It is particularly difficult to investigate those killings and to find the culprit because there is seldom any connection with the person they have killed.  The Garda authorities inform me that all such killings are investigated rigorously and that they will continue to do so and try to bring the perpetrators to justice.  In those killings the information the public can give to the Garda is particularly important because the Garda can make no connection between the perpetrator, who comes in, kills somebody and disappears, and the person who is killed.</P>

      <P>The laws relating to firearms are set down as to how people can get legalised weapons.  Many weapons <Col N="964" /> are held illegally in the State.  I have not given any consideration to a weapons amnesty.  If the Deputy tables a separate question I will give consideration to some of the issues that might be discussed with regard to an amnesty on firearms.  The last time there was a hand in of weapons the number was minimal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 18, 66, 150 and 151 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this matter is that <Col N="965" /> the Mountjoy visiting committee submitted its 1995 report, by hand, to my Department on the afternoon of Monday, 29 April 1996.  The report was examined by my officials the following morning and submitted to the Attorney General for advice on Wednesday, 1 May 1996, as it was considered that some of the comments in the report may have been libellous of clearly identifiable people who are on contract to the prison service.  I have since received the Attorney's advice and written to the visiting committee chairman on foot of same.  My letter issued on Monday, 13 May.</P>
    <P>In my letter I made it clear to the visiting committee that I have been advised by the Attorney General that in making this report public I must assume that the visiting committee has behaved in an appropriately respectful way of the constitutional rights of the personnel it criticises.  The advice also indicated that I, as Minister, have the power to seek to satisfy myself whether the statements made about the people in question are true.  In the light of the above I have asked the visiting committee to review the report, particularly the relevant sections and to let me have their comments.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that only the visiting committee has power to alter or amend its report.  I do not have any editorial role.  However, it is I, as Minister, who is obliged to make the report public, not the visiting committee, and hence my responsibility to ensure that I do not publish anything which might be defamatory or libellous. I have also advised the visiting committee that I await its response and that, upon its receipt, it is my intention to make the report public immediately, assuming that the terms of the visiting committee's reply do not create any impediment in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have already taken a number of initiatives to deal with many of the issues raised in the 1995 report and propose to continue tackling other issues which are ongoing problems in the prison.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> It should be noted that in 1995, I published the 1994 report within four days of receipt of the final report from the visiting committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the committee comprises a responsible group of people who would not set out to defame or libel anybody? Too many reports in the lifetime of this Government have been suppressed on the basis that somebody might be libelled or defamed.  Will the Minister accept the bona fides of the members of the committee who arrived at certain conclusions and does she not regard it as unusual that she, as Minister for Justice, should go back to a committee which had published a report uncoerced and ask it to review it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the members of the visiting committee are a responsible group.  I also accept that I have responsibilities.  I have to balance my dual responsibilities under the 1925 Act of making the report available on request to anybody who wishes to look at it.  It does not call on me to publish it in the way most people understand the word &ldquo;publishing&rdquo;.  I also have a responsibility to ensure I do not publish anything that is libellous or defamatory. If I was on the Deputy's side of the House I would be slow to criticise the delay in publishing this report.  Last year I published the report within four days and had intended to do the same this year but for the advice of the Attorney General.  When the Deputy's party was in office the 1992 report took two years to publish and the 1993 report took one year.  The 1992 report and the 1993 report were both published together on 29 April 1994.  Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.  I showed by bona fides last year by publishing the report within four days &mdash; just about enough time for me to read it and have it photocopied.  It was my intention to do the same this year but for the fact that some element of it might have been libellous. I understand the committee will meet on Thursday.  This is an indication of its <Col N="967" /> concern about the report and I await its response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In this era of openness and transparency it was open to the Minister to publish the report and to delete anything she considered might be libellous or defamatory &mdash; that of itself is a criticism of the committee by the Minister.  It was open to the Minister to publish the vast bulk of the report but she did not because she was hoping it would go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense. Obviously Deputy O'Donoghue does not listen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said in my reply that the report is the property of the visiting committee.  May be other Ministers before me tampered with the reports and their contents but I do not. The report is the property of the visiting committee.  Until I had received the advice of the Attorney General it was not open to me to decide to take this or that bit out of the report.  Nor is it open to me even now.</P>
      <P>I have asked the visiting committee to satisfy itself it can stand over everything in the report without fear that any of it is libellous.  I understand it will meet tomorrow morning and when I receive its response, I will take immediate action to publish the report provided the committee can stand over it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that I must be careful in what I say in responding to this question as the person in respect of whom the application was made is now before the courts as a result of proceedings in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>A warrant and supporting documents in this case, other than the documents required by the Attorney General for the purpose of the functions he is required to exercise under section 2 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, were forwarded directly by the requesting police force to the Garda authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Extradition Acts 1965 to 1994 and established practice.  Copies of the warrant and supporting documents were forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General and to my Department.  The procedure in this case took place at short notice and within a tight time-frame.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the extradition proceedings failed in this instance because the warrant produced in court was not the original warrant.  Following consultation with the law officers it was decided not to proceed with the case.  My Department immediately sought a report following the collapse of the extradition case.  A final report has not been received, however.  The Garda authorities have informed me that a review of the steps taken in dealing with this matter has to date failed to establish the reason the original warrant was not available to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the facts which resulted in the original warrant not being presented at the court hearing have not been established at this stage. I am not satisfied with the delay in establishing them and have requested <Col N="969" /> the Garda authorities to conclude their inquiries within a matter of days.  I will make the facts available as soon as they have been determined subject to advice on any legal constraints that may exist.</P>
    <P>As regards the efficacy of current extradition arrangements generally, I am satisfied that those procedures work well in the vast majority of cases.  It is also true that cases arise from time to time &mdash; this was clearly one &mdash; where procedural or legal difficulties give rise to problems.  It is only right that where such difficulties do arise, the existing arrangements are examined in the light of that experience and any necessary adjustments are made.  I can assure the House that the necessary steps are being taken in this regard in the context of this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response is extraordinary.  Is she telling the House that, one month after the failed extradition of this person, she is still in the dark about what went wrong? The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities.  Has she had consultations with the Office of the Attorney General on this point?  Was the original warrant lost in this jurisdiction?  Despite the recently updated and elaborate procedures on the processing of extradition warrants in the Office of the Attorney General &mdash; computer tracking, monitoring and alert systems &mdash; were the British authorities told at any time that the documents had to be originals, not copies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a month since this happened and I am not satisfied that I cannot outline what happened in this case.  The Garda have not yet outlined to me what happened.  I asked the very questions Deputy O'Donnell raises but the Garda advise me they have been unable to conclude their discussions on these matters with the relevant authorities in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That this extradition did not proceed has nothing to do with the Office of the Attorney General, it concerns the originality of the document put to the <Col N="970" /> courts.  Both the Attorney General and I cleared these documents for execution but when the matter went to court the documents were found not to be originals.  There in lies the kernel of the case and I have not yet been told whether an original document came here.  I am sorry I cannot give that answer.  I have asked for the information and have not been given it.  I am just as frustrated as the Deputy appears to be at not being able to answer her but the Garda have not answered me either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister has not been briefed properly by the Garda authorities in this matter.  Why was the Taoiseach also unable to answer questions on this matter put by Deputy Harney and others on 24 April?  Why was a parliamentary question on this matter, submitted on 17 April, transferred to the Minister for Justice when it is the Taoiseach who is accountable to this House for the Office of the Attorney General?  It is bad enough that he was unable to answer questions about this on 24 April but now the Minister for Justice is similarly unable to do so.  Who will be able to account to the House for the failure of this extradition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation will be necessary to give effect to the recommendations in the report of the international body made to the Irish and British Governments on <Col N="973" /> 22 January last.  Work on the preparation of legislative proposals on decommissioning of arms, including the question of an arms amnesty, consistent with the terms of the recommendations contained in the body's report, is under way in my Department.  Those proposals are being prepared in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  My Department is also liaising with the Northern Ireland Office, which has responsibility for this matter within the British system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>Will the Minister comment on reports that under the proposed legislation security forces on both sides of the Border will be permitted to conduct forensic examinations of weapons and explosives handed over by paramilitary groups?  Does she accept that such a proposal would not be conducive to either ensuring decommissioning takes place or a lasting settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative proposals are being prepared on the basis of, and will be consistent with, the terms of the recommendations in the Mitchell report.  The international body recommended that armaments made available for decommissioning, whether directly or indirectly, should be exempt under law from forensic examination.  The legislation will provide accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that indications to the contrary emanated from Government sources less than two weeks ago?  When does the Minister envisage this legislation being published?  Can she see any realistic prospect of decommissioning, however desirable it might be, in advance of a settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>No indications of that sort emanated from the Government. The Taoiseach clarified that a number of times in the Dáil.  He indicated that legislation on matters of this kind inevitably raises very complex issues in a legal system such as ours which requires all <Col N="974" /> legislation to be consistent with constitutional requirements.  I am not responsible, nor is the Taoiseach, for comments in newspapers, whether they are true or false.  Issues which may not be immediately apparent inevitably arise as we investigate the means of bringing in legislation.  With regard to the timing of the legislation, I can assure the Deputy the legislation will be available as soon as it is required in the process which is now going forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Criminal Records Office already maintains indexed records of all persons convicted of criminal offences, including persons convicted of sexual offences. These records are confidential Garda records.  It is not the practice to disclose the information contained in them except in certain limited and exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>The exceptional circumstances in question include the provision by the Garda Síochána of information to employers, including those in children's residential centres, on the criminal convictions, if any, recorded in respect of applicants for posts which involve substantial access to children.  The release of such information is, having regard to the provisions of the Data Protection Act, 1988, subject to the prior written consent of each applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that, more often than not, employers, even those engaged in child care services, are unaware of the possible criminal records of potential employees?  In this context, it is most desirable that everybody in the State be <Col N="975" /> made aware that a register of sexual offenders is available for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out that we have a Data Protection Act which provides that the release of such information is subject to the prior written consent of the job applicant.  I will answer the question with reference to other hats I wear, particularly my positions in the Department of Health and the Department of Education.  For example, I recently made a regulation whereby anyone applying for a job with a health board has to receive clearance from the Garda authorities.  No one can now be employed in a position relating to children without clearance from the Garda, at the request of the health board.</P>
      <P>The Garda Criminal Records Office maintains a nominal index of all persons convicted of an indictable offence or other reportable offence &mdash; that is, non indictable convictions of a criminal nature, for example, convictions for assault, malicious damage and certain road traffic offences.  This information is maintained on a computer file at Garda headquarters and includes other pertinent information concerning the convicted person &mdash; the normal information one would expect &mdash; such as date and place of birth, address, alias, marital status.  The only difference is that the Garda authorities do not maintain a register of persons exclusively convicted of sex related offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely desirable in the light of the increasing number of child sex offences in the State for a separate register to be kept in respect of child sex offenders.  Does the Minister of State accept that those convicted of such offences should be obliged to notify their victims, through the authorities, of their pending release?  Such a victim alert scheme was very sensibly suggested at yesterday's Garda Representative Association conference and has, as such, the backing of the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently a number of matters were suggested at yesterday's conference but we do not necessarily have to accept them.  Wearing my Department of Health hat again, I add for the Deputy's information that lists of suspected or confirmed cases of child abuse are kept by the health boards.  I have already said in the House and elsewhere that I am looking towards a more uniform approach in relation to that.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that, as far as I am concerned, anything we can do to minimise or stamp out child abuse will be done.  I have, for example, recently issued a discussion paper on mandatory reporting, to which we are receiving a large number of responses.  We have received over 60 to date and I have extended the time limit to the end of this month, by which time I expect to have received 100 responses.  One of the questions posed in that discussion paper relates to the matter which the Deputy raised, in terms of what reporting should be done to a third person.  I will look very carefully at that.  I assure the Deputy that if I come to the conclusion that what he is requesting here will help towards the prevention or minimisation of child abuse, it will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said anybody seeking to work with children in a health board has to receive clearance from the Garda authorities. Does this mean that sporting organisations, voluntary groups, religious orders, schools and any other organisation which has cause to recruit or employ such a person can also avail of this clearance facility?  Does the Minister of State accept that a criminal conviction for any degree of child sexual abuse is a very serious matter of public concern?  The person was tried in public and received a sentence which was in the public domain, and the conviction should also be a matter of public property.  There should not be reservations about the release of that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> Given also that paedophiles tailor their lives and careers around access to children, all the facilities of the State should be available to guard against allowing access to children by such convicted paedophiles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>A basic civil rights question arises here as to what should happen to those who have paid their debt to society.  We cannot ignore the fact that if they are convicted and serve their sentence they have paid for the offence they have committed, nor can we ignore that this is a civil right.</P>
      <P>The question of sporting and other organisations where suspected paedophiles or people with convictions may wish to have access to children is covered by my regulations.  Where there is substantial contact with children clearance is required and the Garda can provide it.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen, will shortly introduce guidelines on sporting organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity.  Is he aware of a recent case where a supervisor employed by FÁS and working where a children's summer project was being conducted was sentenced recently to four terms of imprisonment of three years to run concurrently for four offences of child sex abuse in and around the area in question?  Is the Minister also aware that this person had two previous convictions in England?  The man in question is only 50 years of age.  He will probably be released sooner than the expiry of the three year sentence in respect of the four crimes he committed and will reoffend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister agree that this is an especially heinous crime?  I agree with his comments on civil rights, but these also apply to the public and especially the younger generation.  Will he also agree that younger people, especially, need the protection of society and that in cases of paedophilia involving a person's second, third or even fourth conviction &mdash; where it is apparent that the <Col N="978" /> person will reoffend &mdash; the person's photograph should be in Garda stations?  The gardaí could then spot them and if, for example, they found one of them working as a janitor in a school they could warn the principal.</P>
    <P>We must protect our young people. The view of the public is that society does not care, that everything is forgivable, whether it be excessive drinking or sexual problems.  Will the Minister agree that, where sentencing appears to be lenient, as in the case I outlined, section 2 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, should be amended to give the DPP greater scope of appeal against such sentences?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to refer to the last aspect of the Deputy's question. Whether we like it or not, the Judiciary is independent and the issue of sentencing is a matter for it.  I always repeat that the interest of the child is the paramount consideration in these matters.  If we remember this we will not depart too far from the straight and narrow although this does not mean that the civil rights of other people and the rights of others under the law can be ignored.</P>
      <P>I would like to think that, as a result of the recent regulations which I made, what happened in the case referred to by the Deputy could not happen again. I would be confident that if that person or somebody like him applied for a job involving children he would have to apply for clearance which would not be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister's concern for the civil libertarian difficulties he mentioned regarding the right to a good name of the person convicted.  What protection can he offer to society against a person who has completed a sentence for serious sexual offences against children, who has not undertaken any therapy and who is, therefore, unreformed bearing in mind that the person can avail of the remission of 25 per cent of his sentence in the usual way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I marvel at the way the Deputy can use a word like &ldquo;concern&rdquo; in describing my concern and make it appear like a dirty word.  We cannot prejudge whether a person is reformed upon release from prison.  In my original replies I stated that lists were kept by the Garda of all convicted people, including those in the category to which the Deputy refers, and that lists are also kept by the health boards.  Bearing in mind my remarks about the rights of people under the law, if I consider that this aspect should be strengthened I will do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the Minister's speech this morning but I read his script.  The contribution of Deputy Treacy, a former Minister of State at that Department, was full of fire and passion and, while it may have came from the heart, he went overboard in describing what he claims is the Minister's negative impact in this area. Deputy Crawford said change is not necessarily bad and that institutions, such as the Office of Public Works, which have served us in an effective manner for many years are not beyond the need for change and restructuring.</P>
      <P>When account is taken of the complex system of management in the Office of Public Works, one must agree there is a need to review its policies and structures.  The Minister should be complimented on pulling together the different strands of heritage management.  Until now three units dealt with such matters, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which had responsibility for heritage matters, the National Monuments and Historic Properties and the waterways service.  The personnel in those sections did important tasks.  We all know that duplication and too many agencies with responsibility for similar matters can slow up responses to urgent matters.  I hope when the buck stops firmly with the Minister there will be a more immediate response to some of the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a wide-ranging <Col N="1093" /> area of public life, a section of the Department with expenditure of approximately £50 million per annum and a large number of personnel.  It is important that we get value for money and that responsibility rests firmly with one Minister.  I welcome the pulling together of all the strands.  I need not dwell on what other speakers said about the outstanding service provided by the staff of the Office of Public Works, the majority of whom will continue to give a dedicated level of service, even if they must answer to new masters in the next few years.</P>
    <P>The new structures put in place by the Minister to deal with heritage matters will work well.  The Heritage Council can advise and seek consultation with local authority groups.  Local authorities must play a greater part in heritage management and development.  The national monuments committee of Cork County Council has produced plans for works which they would like to carry out throughout the county, but there is simply no money for this.  Up to now national monuments committees have had to deal with many Government agencies and Ministers.  I hope when they are making representations to just one Minister they will be more successful in getting a response to their requests for funding.  Heritage matters can be successfully dealt with by local authorities.  The vast majority of local authority members, particularly in rural areas, are anxious to see the maximum possible expenditure on heritage in their own areas.  This indicates strong support for heritage development within the local authorities.  I hope that, with the help of the new Heritage Council, we will be able to make some progress.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment in passing on what is happening in local authorities. Recently we received correspondence, presumably from the Office of Public Works, concerning council efforts to clean up graveyards throughout the county.  Public representatives are often asked by their constituents to request the local authority to carry out work on <Col N="1094" /> graveyards, and generally we try to meet the requirements of our constituents.  However, in recent weeks we have been told by the Office of Public Works to be cautious in cleaning up or redeveloping graveyards, particularly older ones.  I agree that we should not tear up our heritage, but this is an area where we should tread with caution, given that we are requested by the relatives of people buried in old, often overgrown graveyards to have them cleaned up while at the same time local authorities are being told by Office of Public Works officials not to move in that direction.  I would like to see a compromise in that area because it is necessary to carry out work on some of the old graveyards.</P>
    <P>A heritage policy unit and the heritage service section will manage heritage properties and will have a key role to play.  I hope sufficient funding will be available from the £50 million budget over the next few years to maintain our many valuable heritage properties in a proper and fit condition.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave an outline of ongoing work and plans being prepared within the Department.  He mentioned the study being conducted on a future strategy for Doneraile Park.  That study is needed and it should be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  As late as this morning I received correspondence from the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Hugh Coveney, to whom representations were made about Doneraile Park.  The Minister of State kindly informed me that the matter is now with his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, and he has forwarded my representations to him.  I hope the Minister will ensure that a quick decision is made on the strategy for Doneraile Park, a fine asset not just for Doneraile and north Cork but the entire County Cork region.  It is a park which is currently drawing record numbers of visitors.  Those numbers can be expanded upon and, with proper development over the next few years, it could be turned into a mini industry for <Col N="1095" /> north Cork.  There is a local plea for a quick decision on strategy.  We are not expecting all the money or work in 1996 or 1997.  We would like the Minister's views on the strategy as soon as possible.  The local community has issued an invitation to the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, to visit Doneraile National Park, but as the responsibility for the park has now been passed on to the Minister, let me pass on the invitation to him and say he would be welcome at the earliest possible date to see for himself what is on offer in Doneraile.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is trying to do is to bring together many strands, all of which worked well individually within their own limited budgets.  We now need a more centralised structure.  I do not believe all the decisions will be taken in Dublin because it is at local level, particularly local authority level, that much of the work will be done.  Having one Minister and one office responsible nationally for heritage matters will be no disadvantage and will allow us to work more progressively on developing our heritage and our culture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular interest in this measure because I come from Sligo which is extraordinarily rich in archaeological heritage.  Recent surveys have highlighted the richness of monuments and sites in the county &mdash; a total of 4,500 sites were listed.  In certain areas it is difficult to dig a foundation for a house without coming across something of archaeological importance.  It is regrettable, therefore, that there has been almost total neglect of my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A primary example of this neglect is Knocknashee hill fort in south County Sligo.  This is the third largest hill fort in the country with 40 hut dwellings dating back to 1000 BC and one megalithic passage tomb dating to 3000 BC.  It has been described as a prehistoric prototown, possibly a major socio-economic political and tribal centre of its day in the province, but there is total neglect <Col N="1096" /> of this area with no signpost or plaque indicating its location.  There is not even an access route nor does it even have the protection of being designated a national monument.</P>
    <P>In this area there is an extraordinarily enthusiastic development group.  The owners of the hill are extremely co-operative and are only too willing to give access to the Office of Public Works to do anything it wishes there, but there has been no action.  I accept that in the past the Office of Public Works did an extremely good job and has a good record.  I commend its officials on what has been done, but they have fallen down in the context of my area.  I hope the Minister will apply himself to the needs of Knocknashee hill fort and will speedily undertake necessary works.  I have the utmost confidence that he will.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which the Minister might apply his energy and talents.  What is happening to the Armada wrecks found a short distance only off Streedagh strand in the early 1980s, comprising the most important collection of Armada artefacts from that great disaster found around any islands? There had been serious legal problems surrounding their retrieval and I commend the Minister and his predecessor on their efforts to ensure that those artefacts remained the property of the State.  It is now more than ten years since their discovery.  It should be possible to reach some agreement to enable work to commence on recovering the 59 cannons from the sea to form the basis for an Armada museum, together with the regional folk museum.  This is Yeats country.  A short distance down the strand from Lissadel House, beside Drumcliff in the shadow of Benbulben, a museum would be a major attraction.</P>
    <P>There were some malicious reports circulating to the effect that the Minister wanted to take possession of these Spanish Armada artefacts with a view to placing them in a seafaring museum in Galway.  I assured everybody that the rumour could not be true, that it was <Col N="1097" /> malicious.  Lest there be any grain of truth in it, I remind the Minister of the fate that befell some of the survivors of the Armada fleet at the hands of natives.  The same kinds of noises were being made when it was thought those artefacts might be removed to Galway. I do not believe they will but I want the Minister to ascertain precisely what is happening with regard to them.  I understand that the legal complexities have now been sorted out.  There is no point in behaving like the Chinese, saying that we will extract these in a thousand years' time, it will be marvellous for archaeologists of that period.  Why not take action and extract them now, creating a major tourist attraction in Sligo?</P>
    <P>I am very pleased the Minister has acquired Collins Barracks as additional exhibition space for the National Museum.  One great difficulty encountered in the artistic and cultural heritage area was the lack of exhibition space. With the availability of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham, the Royal Hibernian Academy Gallery and the acquisition of Collins Barracks, that problem has been eliminated in Dublin and elsewhere around the country where some excellent centres have been made available for museums and galleries.</P>
    <P>We should concentrate now on the objects displayed in those museums and galleries.  The Minister should ensure that all artefacts under the control of the National Museum are properly displayed, with the aid of modern technology, in the many centres nationwide. I am thinking in particular of the folk collection, which may not be germane to this discussion.  While it has been widely accepted that the Minister should not fragment the great national collection, that should not prohibit the establishment of museums in Galway, Sligo, Donegal, Monaghan and elsewhere. With his additional powers the Minister's energies should be directed at the establishment of museums throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the tremendous work done by the Office of Public Works on <Col N="1098" /> interpretative centres which have added an entirely new dimension to the display of artefacts, thus further enhancing areas of great interest.  I am thinking in particular of the Céide Fields in County Mayo, the tremendous discoveries there and the insight they afford into earlier farming methods and traditions in that area.  Without its interpretative centre, the area would not be nearly as interesting for the vast majority of people.</P>
    <P>The Minister should concentrate on such exhibition centres, in particular at Knocknashee and for the Armada wrecks which contain great potential for all of us.  Although I have some reservations about the transfer of powers from the Office of Public Works &mdash; whose personnel did such a magnificent job in the past &mdash; we are making progress, co-ordinating many activities and providing the general public with a better service while enhancing the earlier work of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Despite a few dissenting voices, I am glad this Supplementary Estimate is being accepted as a measure of progress to fulfilling Government obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>On 14 February last I tabled Parliamentary Question No. 39 to the Minister asking the plans, if any, he has to have a full feasibility study of the Ulster Canal carried out as recommended in the County Monaghan tourism plan.  The Minister replied as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of restoring the Ulster Canal has been the subject of talks for some time now between the waterways service and its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the watercourse management division of the Department of Agriculture.  In 1994, a scoping study of the canal was <Col N="1099" /> undertaken and this identified the main engineering and other difficulties which will have to be overcome should it be decided to proceed with restoration.</P>
    <P>Consideration is now being given to the undertaking of a fullscale feasibility study which would endeavour to identify solutions to these difficulties and would include also a cost benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment of the project.  The availability of the necessary funding for the study is of course a prime consideration and this matter is currently being examined.</P>
    <P>Since then the waterways service personnel visited the county and spoke to people there.  Perhaps they gave them the wrong impression but I have since been told that £500,000 has been allocated for that study.  At a meeting I attended last Monday evening the restoration of the Ulster Canal was raised. When I said there was no funding provided for this study, a person from the back of the hall said they were told a few months ago that £500,000 had been allocated for that purpose.  Today a Member from my constituency on the opposite benches indicated that £250,000 had been allocated, half the amount mentioned previously.  Perhaps the Minister will state clearly whether such funding is available.  He will readily appreciate that any public representative feels a fool when somebody contends £500,000 is available while others claim it is merely £250,000.  The Minister himself has informed me he is merely seeking funding for this purpose.</P>
    <P>While there had been an indication that grants would be given for heritage housing I have been told the Minister's Department and the Department of the Environment will examine the possibility.  I should like to know the up-to-date position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I lament the lost opportunity the establishment of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht <Col N="1100" /> presented, particularly in the heritage area.  While there are other areas for which the Minister is responsible and in respect of which I am supportive of his efforts, as I have said publicly here and elsewhere, today's discussion demonstrates that we are engaging in an exercise in empire-building or, more specifically, the transfer of funding for such purpose.  If it were a matter of ordinary empire-building, frequently observed in ministerial jockeying for power and position, it would be negative but would be less damaging than what is taking place here.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Noel Treacy earlier and must agree with him that, at least in part, this exercise smacks of a vendetta by the Minister against the Office of Public Works, perhaps arising from that office having had the temerity to question his views on the Burren, Luggala and Boyne Valley interpretative centres.  The Minister cleary will not brook opposition in this area, which is a great pity because it is important and the Office of Public Works has played a constructive and valuable role in it.  Even if the Minister was operating from the best possible intentions, it is generally perceived as an attempt to put the people in the Office of Public Works in their places.  The Minister has made the case for changes, on the grounds that they make the operation more manageable but, as Deputy de Valera said earlier, in inland waterways the facts do not bear that out.  The Minister's Department will have responsibility but some will remain as previously with the Office of Public Works.  That seems a ridiculous and unhelpful division which, undoubtedly, will lead to confusion and a lack of co-operation and ultimately waste of taxpayers' money.  That is very much regretted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If changes were necessary, an overall review should have been carefully carried out and the situation should have been examined more carefully than has been the case.  This is illustrated by the fact that changes were made some time ago and the financial arrangements to deal with them are being put in place <Col N="1101" /> now.  It is obvious that this matter has not been thought through in the way it should have been.  There is a perception that the excellent work of the Office of Public Works down through the years is being devalued in petty circumstances. That damages the incentive for public servants to show initiative and it is unfortunate that it is set against the background of public sector pay disputes.  That will pose very serious problems for this Government in a number of areas.  Nurses, teachers, lower paid civil servants and environmental health officers are in dispute with the Government which is about to face grave difficulty with its public servants.  This will be viewed as an attack on employees in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see the Minister take a different approach and perhaps it would be better if he were to seek in co-operation with the staff of the Office of Public Works &mdash; with some of whom he might disagree but it is nothing new to him to disagree with any number of people &mdash; to address the very serious problems arising throughout the country.  Deputies Leonard and Nealon referred to some that apply in this area. I read a newspaper report last week of the disappearance of a castle near Ennis.  It is well known that there have been attempts to remove an important stone near the old church of Kilnaboy and that important stone artefacts have been removed in a great many places.  I am not saying it is possible for the Minister or Minister of State to ensure that it does not happen but if there were a greater sense of co-operation and the energy which appears to be dissipated in the present transfer of power were to be directed constructively into the areas I mentioned, we would be doing a better day's work.  We should be channelling our energy constructively into a policy that would ensure the preservation of these items.</P>
    <P>People who are seeking planning permission, particularly in parts of north Clare, face the additional expense of having to have an archaeological dig <Col N="1102" /> carried out on their property if it happens to be near something that is located on certain maps.  I have no argument with the necessity of carrying out an examination but the individual is required to bear the entire cost of the study which, in some cases if they are fortunate, is as little as £300 but in other cases it might be as much as £3,000 which is seen as a major difficulty.  It is not beyond the Minister's power to find a way for the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht or the Office of Public Works to pick up the tab for these studies and subsequently own the information which comes to light because of them.  This is important in the context of encouraging co-operation between local communities, the Office of Public Works or the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, whoever is charged with this particular responsibility.</P>
    <P>My experience is that rather than progress being made in my area things are getting dramatically worse in so far as aspiring to such co-operation is concerned.  I will have an opportunity at a later stage to express my views on the draft plans for the Burren which the Minister commissioned and I await the opportunity to do so.  Those in local authorities who have successfully held the line on development have got very little credit for doing so from the Minister and others and are finding it more difficult in the context of the type of inevitable confrontation in the way these things are being developed.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well bask in glory for achievements in some of his areas of responsibility.  He will want to be able to do the same in the heritage area but he is not going about it in a way that is likely to be successful.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to identify the positives that will emerge from the changes in the Bill.  To take the example of Quin Abbey, very important archaeological remains, is there any prospect that development will take place and progress made under the Minister's proposals?  I am not confident that will be the case.  There is no evidence from the <Col N="1103" /> Minister's speech, or from what has happened in recent years, that it will happen.  I would be very supportive of the Minister if he was in a position to make progress in that area.  There is room for greater co-operation but the onus in the first instance is on the Minister to ensure that it is possible and to make the moves that facilitate it rather than taking what is perceived as very negative action, which is unlikely to lead to any improvement.</P>
    <P>If the proposed changes go ahead, effectively we are talking about financing them, I ask the Minister to ensure that staff in the Office of Public Works who previously showed a great deal of initiative and with whom he has his disagreements will not be excluded and that their talents and strengths will be utilised.  If the Minister is prepared to do that, it will strengthen his position and lead to more constructive developments than would otherwise be the case.  These people have a role to play and have shown they are constructive. The Minister can accommodate them and even if I fundamentally disagree with the manner in which he is doing it under the present arrangements I also ask him to try to ensure that henceforth these talents will be used for the benefit of the State.</P>
    <P>Some important items of heritage may be under threat.  I believe these areas should be pinpointed and action should be taken but a personal agenda should not be pursued on foot of spurious concerns about landscape, items or artefacts.  Where there are genuine difficulties, it is important they are addressed, but equally it is important they are not used as an excuse.  While I am very concerned about what is proposed, I urge the Minister to ensure as far as he can that the negatives are addressed and there is a constructive outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating, among other things, the transfer of some functions from the Office of <Col N="1104" /> Public Works, for which I, as Minister of State, am privileged to have responsibility, to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  In doing that, I wish to refer to some aspects of the past as well as the future, about which I am more concerned.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is the oldest department of State and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is the newest.  We are dealing with a department of State that has a long and proud history and a new Department under the responsibility of an exciting Minister.  He has given the arts a high profile on the national agenda which it did not have previously.  While officials in the Office of Public Works regret losing part of their previous responsibilities, they are being transferred to a Department over which the Minister responsible has established a proud record in the arts.</P>
      <P>The argument that our heritage is separate from our culture is the reason for confusion surrounding this area for the past five or six years which has spanned a number of Governments. Arts and culture cannot be separated from heritage.  Historic properties and monuments cannot be separated from the culture of the nation because they are an intrinsic part of it.  There is a compelling logic in what is proposed.</P>
      <P>Through the years the Office of Public Works was given a number of unrelated functions by Governments.  Its role increased dramatically in the area of heritage in the past ten to 15 years as the country began to appreciate its heritage and gave it a higher priority. Expertise has built up in the Office of Public Works and some people there regret the loss of responsibility for heritage, an important and interesting area of our lives.  It is nonsense to suggest that the people who have been involved in that work will be excluded from it as many of them will transfer to a Department which has a greater focus on culture, which includes heritage.  While people will always be nostalgic about the past, there is a clear logic and rationale in what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> It has taken too long to effect this transfer of responsibility.  It has been progressing in a painful way since 1992 or 1993.  When I became Minister of State responsible for the Office of Public Works, that transfer of responsibility was not completed.  My relationship with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on this matter has been extremely civilised and has led to a fall in temperature over this issue and to greater clarity.  Henceforth both Departments can move forward with respect for one another while performing their respective important duties.</P>
    <P>The recommendations under discussion today did not arise easily.  An interdepartmental group was set up with representatives from the various interested Departments.  Some issues gave rise to argument, but that group undertook the work it was assigned and put forward a set of recommendations that were accepted by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and myself.  We are progressing on the basis of an agreed interdepartmental committee's recommendation to the two Ministers involved.  The previous speaker raised a concern about the job security of some employees, but it goes without saying that this transfer of responsibility will not affect their job security.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I wish to comment on its future role.  The Office of Public Works is going through a period of refocusing.  It has moved from one era into another.  It has a new chairman and a new commissioner.  Before commenting on them I wish to refer to the previous chairman, Mr. John Mahony, who spent all of his working life in the public service in the Office of Public Works.  Deputy Treacy mentioned that Mr. Mahony left without even a thank you, but I dispute that as it would have been improper.  I wrote to him in well deserved glowing terms to pay tribute to the work he did for the country in his leadership of the Office of Public Works.  He was a most dedicated civil servant.  The new chairman, Mr. Barry <Col N="1106" /> Murphy, and the new commissioner, Mr. Sean Benton, who transferred from the Department of Health are both distinguished civil servants and are utterly committed to the future of the Office of Public Works and to concentrating its future on its core business, which is to manage the property of the State, a major job.</P>
    <P>It is untrue to suggest that the Office of Public Works has been decimated by this transfer of responsibility.  The transfer of functions involves the transfer of responsibilities and the staff involved. About two thirds of the previous staff will remain in the Office of Public Works.  A total of 600 full-time civil servants are working in the Office of Public Works in addition to approximately 1,000 people who work in various maintenance jobs in workshops around the country.  It is still a large department employing approximately 1,600 people. It has a large budget and is responsible for spending approximately £200 million per annum directly and indirectly as, in many cases, it acts as an agent for other Departments.</P>
    <P>In some respects the Office of Public Works is refocusing.  Like every Department it must consider its structures, which it is doing.  The new chairman is setting up the architectural service as if it were a private practice.  It must meet norms to demonstrate it is as competitive as the private sector.  It is the largest architectural practice in the land with responsibility for more work than practically half the private practices in Dublin put together.  Therefore, it is important that its performance is set against the benchmark of competitiveness.  It is preparing for ISO 9001, an international mark of excellence.</P>
    <P>In no sense is the Office of Public Works a demoralised, dismembered organisation.  It is far from that, it is looking to the future with confidence and the expectation that the Government will not continue only to entrust it with its present core business but, in time, will see merit in conferring further duties on it in the area of public procurement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> The Office of Public Works has been asked to review the accommodation in State and semi-State bodies to ensure that requirements are met in the most cost effective way possible.  It is also involved in a huge programme of construction work in every constituency and practically every town.  Decentralisation programmes are nearing completion or about to commence in Waterford, Kilkenny, Wexford, Dundalk, Roscommon and Portlaoise.  It is also involved with the Department of Justice, the Department of Social Welfare and other Departments in the construction and maintenance of Garda stations, social welfare offices, employment exchanges, prisons and other State buildings.</P>
    <P>Under the 1995 legislation the Office of Public Works is charged with responsibility for a series of flood relief measures.  Nine programmes are currently in place, a major study is being carried out in south Galway and measures are being taken to prevent a recurrence of the difficulties caused by the severe flooding in the south east last winter.  I was happy to learn today that the EU is prepared to allocate 300,000 ecu to alleviate the hardship caused by this flooding.  The Office of Public Works is preparing a priority list for flood relief measures and consultants have been appointed to advise us on this matter.  The priority list for the next two years will shortly be announced and this will have a significant impact on a number of areas.</P>
    <P>It is not widely understood that the Office of Public Works and the Minister for Finance are the direct funding agencies for Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park.  The Hunt Museum, Limerick, and Birr Castle projects are managed by the Office of Public Works, while the procurement of a veterinary building in Grange is currently in hands.  The Office of Public Works also has a major role to play in our Presidency of the EU in terms of the preparation and provision of facilities for meetings and it will not be found wanting in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> While the Office of Public Works, which I am privileged to lead, has lost some of its functions, there is a realisation that the past is behind us and that we must look to the future.  We are anxious to ensure that we have the capability to carry out the challenging job facing us in the future and to serve the Government and the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  On the question of arterial drainage priority lists, during Question Time and the debate on the 1995 Act which amended the 1946 Arterial Drainage Act, I requested the Minister to give favourable consideration to the inclusion of a large area of County Cavan along the River Erne basin which is subjected to heavy flooding.  Every year severe flooding practically deprives farmers in the Ballinagh, Loughduff, Lackan, Milltown and Butlersbridge areas of their livelihoods.  There is drumlin soil and poor drainage in this area and I appeal to the Minister to give favourable consideration to it in drawing up the priority list and to ensure that the necessary remedial works are carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers, I regret the decision to transfer responsibility for the waterways service from the Office of Public Works to the Department. While the duties of the Office of Public Works since its foundation were diverse, they were also complementary. Many tourist attractions, restored castles etc., are the products of the expertise of the Office of Public Works over many years and are an integral part of the tourism product.  The 1987 Fianna Fáil Government emphasised the need to develop the tourism industry.  I am very glad that my party in Government decided to restore the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal.  I have paid tribute in this House and elsewhere to the Office of Public Works officials who carried out the work on this project.  I spoke to officials in the Office of Public Works before the project was given the go-ahead and they were very committed to <Col N="1109" /> the restoration of the canal.  They took a personal interest in the project because they realised its value from the point of view of the economy and cross-Border development.</P>
    <P>The restored Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal, which is now known as the Erne-Shannon waterway, has been a marvellous success since it was opened in 1994.  However, additional mooring facilities are required in Ballyconnell. This is good in the sense that a huge volume of cruiser traffic uses the restored waterway.  I appeal to the Minister to give favourable and urgent consideration to the provision of additional mooring facilities.  Even at this early stage in the season the volume of traffic traversing the Shannon and Erne systems has led to overcrowding.  The economy of Border counties needs to be regenerated and substantial funding has been allocated for this purpose.  The tourism industry has cross-Border potential and I appeal to the Minister to provide funding for the additional facilities in Ballyconnell.</P>
    <P>At the Select Committee on Social Affairs and during Question Time I have pointed out to the Minister the importance of making the Erne River navigable from Belturbet south to Killykeen and Killeshandra and on to Lough Gowna.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht have agreed with the points made by me about the potential of this project.  In response to a question put by me on 2 March the Minister stated: &ldquo;I share the Deputy's view of the potential of this project&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At a time when funding is available under the INTERREG programme and to finance the work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, one could not have a better project for inclusion in a programme to regenerate the Border economy than the extension of the Erne navigation &mdash; a waterway system of vital importance to the economic life of Fermanagh and Cavan &mdash; southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra.  If this project proceeds, Belturbet <Col N="1110" /> will become an important hub in our inland waterways system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan and I are fully aware of the difficulties and hardship imposed on the people of the Border counties. Unfortunately, when the bombs went off and lives were lost the industrial and economic life of Belturbet was devastated.  Its natural hinterland was cut off by the political troubles on its doorstep. It should, therefore, receive priority at a time when funding is available to regenerate the Border economy.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister's officials have been working on this project for some time and that a preliminary engineering report was carried out some years ago which showed that there would be no major engineering obstacles in making that part of the waterway navigable.  I implore the Minister, on behalf of the people of Fermanagh and Cavan, to seek the necessary tenders for the environmental impact assessment as a matter of urgency to allow the project commence at the earliest possible date. The Exchequer will receive a return on its investment many times over.</P>
    <P>When restored, I predict that projected cruiser traffic on that stretch of waterway will be exceeded in the same way as projected cruiser traffic on the restored Erne-Shannon waterway has been exceeded.  As the report of Bord Fáilte Éireann and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board shows, it has been marvellously successful to date.  Every credit is due to the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and the former Minister, John Wilson, for providing the necessary funding.  Credit is also due to their officials who were convinced of the merits of the project from the word go when many others were much more sceptical.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Office of Public Works on providing additional mooring facilities at Belturbet in respect of which the former Minister of State, Deputy Noel Dempsey, provided £400,000 under the INTERREG programme in 1994.  I appeal to the Minister to speed up the provision of additional mooring facilities at Ballyconnell and invite tenders for the environmental impact <Col N="1111" /> assessment in respect of the extension of the Erne navigation southwards from Belturbet to allow construction commence on these two necessary and worthwhile projects without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important discussion and compliment the Minister on doing an excellent job in what would not be considered a popular Ministry.  At a time when there are many competing demands, the arts would be seen as the icing on the cake, but if we were to wait until everything else is done before supporting them, nothing would ever be done with the result that much of our fine talent, culture and history would be lost.</P>
      <P>This was brought home to me last weekend when I saw a notice in my home town which read &ldquo;Young artists starvation sale&rdquo; held in a local hotel.  It was an excellent exhibition at which various paintings, woodwork, craftwork and mouldings were on display.  They were beautiful and of good quality. Having spoken to the young people concerned, it is clear that it is difficult to succeed in the arts because of the lack of promotion.  Their talent, however, needs to be nurtured.</P>
      <P>In Cavan vocational school, which my children attend, there is an excellent arts teacher &mdash; I am sure there are many like her throughout the country.  She has nurtured the artistic talents of the pupils in her class, who have surprised even themselves.</P>
      <P>Because the economy is doing well &mdash; this is part of the agenda which I fully support &mdash; people are building excellent new homes for which they want quality furniture and original paintings depicting a local scene or church.  If our young artists can establish themselves, they may be able to make it their livelihood, but it is a matter of getting through college and making a start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> On the restoration of our heritage, much work remains to be done.  I compliment the Office of Public Works on the work it is doing, in which the Minister has taken a keen interest.  I can only speak about what is happening in my own county, but I am sure much work is being done in every other county.</P>
    <P>The restoration work being carried out at Kilmore Church of Ireland Cathedral, and on Bishop Bedell's grave in particular, is of the highest quality.  I thought that the talent required to carry out this work had long since disappeared out of the country.  I am amazed to see so many young people involved in rebuilding walls which had crumbled and were covered in ivy.  I did not think it was possible to restore them.</P>
    <P>Their talent is being nurtured through FÁS schemes.  This is an excellent development which will allow them progress to the building trade in which traditional stone arch fireplaces and walls are once again becoming a feature of all good houses.  This marks a move away from the bungalow bliss of the 1960s and early 1970s.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Killyclugin Stone to show what could happen in relation to our heritage.  This prehistoric worshipping stone with Celtic designs was uncovered in Ballyconnell during land excavation work about 20 years ago and removed by the Office of Public Works, without the permission of the landowner or local people, to the National Museum where it literally disappeared.  Using ropes and a tripod system, it was placed in a lorry and taken away.</P>
    <P>The local branch of Foroige, a marvellous organisation celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, decided to research the history of the stone, how it came to be unearthed, and to discover its whereabouts.  Having visited its annual exhibition, as a new Deputy, I put a question to the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who had a flair for promoting the arts.  To make a long story short, he took a personal interest in the matter and discovered that the stone, which weighs about ten tonnes, <Col N="1113" /> was hidden behind a wall in the National Museum.  Through his good offices, a replica was made, funded by his Department, which is to be found in Killyclugin.</P>
    <P>The original stone is now on display in the National Museum, although the last time I visited the museum, it seemed to have been moved again.  We have been promised it will be brought back to Ballyjamesduff once the museum is set up there.  I thank the Minister for his support in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of goodwill among people as regards important items which should be in safekeeping.  They know that if they are not properly protected, they will be subject to wear and tear. We must compliment landowners and farmers because it is not easy to let someone on to one's land when something of importance is discovered.  This happened recently in Bailieboro when an old tomb, dating back 1,500 or 2,000 years, was discovered during land reclamation.  Officials from the Minister's Department carried out an investigation and the farmer was proud to do any work which needed to be done to restore it as a tourist attraction.  Many people are talented at restoring old buildings which are part of our history.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brendan Smith referred to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, which has been an outstanding success. It is a tribute to the Office of Public Works because people thought it was not feasible to restore it.  Ballyconnell, Belturbet and Ballinamore are thriving towns as people travel the canal in their boats and cruisers.  I advise the Minister's officials to enjoy this pleasurable holiday this summer and to see the work which has been done.</P>
    <P>This task must be completed by opening up the section of water from Belturbet to Lough Oughter in Killykeen.  I have mentioned this on numerous occasions to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jim Higgins, to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, and now to the Minister for <Col N="1114" /> Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  He told me he was interested in projects which could be completed rather than in ongoing projects.  This project will not cost a lot of money because the only problem is a small portion of rock which prevents cruisers from passing.  Equipment is available for such work.  There should not be any red tape, although environmental impact studies are important.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take this issue on board.  He knows about the success of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, so why does he not extend it to central Cavan, Lough Gowna and the Longford border?  This is an opportunity to promote tourism and to open up a waterway which is unequalled anywhere in Europe.  It would complete the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell development and it would be able to avail of Border funding which may not be available in four or five years' time.  I ask for a positive response from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on attempting to clarify the confusion relating to his responsibilities in this area.  I ask for further clarification on the Phoenix Park about which it is stated that the Commissioners have responsibility, subject to the general directions of the Minister for Finance. At what point does the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht enter the picture as regards this important and historic park?</P>
      <P>Another matter which has not been mentioned is the legal title to the various properties for which responsibility now lies with this Department.  There is considerable confusion in this regard with some titles untraced and some resting with the Commissioners and the Minister for Finance.  Have any titles been vested in the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this because there must be clear lines of responsibility if we want effective decision-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works always stood outside the line of responsibility as far as the public service <Col N="1115" /> was concerned.  Perhaps that is why the Minister has some difficulties in this area.  It is important that responsibility is clearly demarcated.  Many years ago the Devlin report recommended that there should be a Department of national culture, which the Minister now wishes to create.  It is important to have clear legal definitions of responsibility.  It is unclear where responsibility lies as regards the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>A commitment was given in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to establish a Liffey Valley authority.  However, little has been heard about it since the formation of the Government.  This area could be usefully associated with the Phoenix Park since they are physically related.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the promised legislation for an inland waterways authority, but when will it be introduced?  We all welcomed the North-South link established by the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, which was a great development.  Legislation should be introduced to provide a comprehensive, integrated approach to our waterways.  The Minister said he would commit some funds this year to the Royal Canal.  How far will these funds extend? The restoration of the Royal Canal is important.  I could not find any reference to the Barrow.  I am not sure if it falls within the Minister's remit, but it is an important part of the inland waterways which should be developed.  It is a marvellous resource for tourism and for the adjacent towns.</P>
    <P>A number of possible locations for a national park were mentioned by the Minister.  The development of a national park in the Wicklow area should be examined because it is adjacent to our largest centre of population.  There are conflicts between agricultural, recreational and other economic uses of this area, apart from the considerable pressure of visitors from the Dublin metropolitan area at weekends.  A statutory framework is needed in this regard.</P>

      <P>Táim an <Col N="1116" /> buíoch do na Teachtaí go léir a labhair ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh seans agam freagra a thabhairt ar chuid de na pointí ar a laghad a tháinig suas.</P>
      <P>I hope I will have an opportunity of replying to some of the interesting points made by Deputies.  I pay tribute to Deputy Lenihan for his positive speech, which was constructive and full of ideas.  I will try to answer some of his questions as briefly as possible.  The statutory instruments I referred to this morning transferred ownership of relevant properties from the Minister for Finance and the Office of Public Works, as appropriate, to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Since these instruments were made, properties were gifted to the people of Ireland in the name of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I want to be as positive as I can in dealing with some points which are important to me.  As Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, with responsibility for heritage, broadcasting and films, I have paid tribute to those who have gone before me.  I have never failed to pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, for his extraordinary interest in heritage matters, and to others.  I am not interested in going down the road as to whether I am, through vanity, trying to claim credit for other people's achievements.</P>
      <P>The purchase of Collins Barracks was suggested to me by somebody who is not in politics and is not now in the service of any politician.  Mr. James Wren, who was then an adviser to the Minister for Education, suggested that the barracks would be a good location for the National Museum.  In the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, there was strong support from the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, and all members of the Government, for giving a proper home at last to the National Museum.  That this is happening is important for the Irish people and it is irrelevant to look at it from the point of view of who put stamps on letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> This morning I gave a summary of what has happened since the decision to give responsibility for heritage to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I could have given another version but I gave the factual one.  I described how the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the monuments service and the waterways service came into existence.  I also said that combining and integrating these services and having a strong Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is doing nothing but acknowledging the quality of the work at all levels of the Office of Public Works in the service of the people.  In 1975 I was a Member of Seanad Éireann and during the debate on the Wildlife Bill of that year I paid tribute to the Office of Public Works.  My views have not changed since then and my admiration for that body continues.</P>
    <P>Deputies Brendan Smith and Boylan raised questions about navigation on the Erne and Lough Oughter.  I have allocated funds for the environmental impact study to which they referred.  A number of design options are being considered and design is virtually finalised. I expect it will be possible to seek tenders for the part of the work to which they referred in a matter of weeks.  With regard to developing waterways in the context of the INTERREG funds, I am aware of the pressure on mooring spaces on the Shannon and it is my intention to expand them.  Some of the points made by Deputy Brendan Smith are matters for which the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, is responsible.  I thank the Minister of State for his generous co-operation in bringing these matters to a conclusion and for the spirit in which he dealt with them this evening.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Killeen, I am from County Clare.  He spoke about the dissipation rather than the co-operation which existed between me and the Office of Public Works.  It is not my nature to go back over past events or to be interested in the dissipation of my energies or those of anybody else.  I know the vigour with which the debate in <Col N="1118" /> north Clare was conducted.  Tomorrow the public consultation will end.  I introduced consultation in the widest sense and had studies carried out.  There was an attempt to resolve this conflict and there is still hope.  It is important that we move on to that point rather than rehearse old bitterness.  It is not my concern to continue any conflict.</P>
    <P>We must build on the controversial decisions made with regard to Luggala and Clare.  It is difficult for people to move back from the positions they hold but there has been consultation and this is the way the situation will move forward.  In future every other project will be developed with genuinely inclusive consultation.  I was glad the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, established that a letter has been written to the former chairman of the Commissioners of Public Works, Mr. John Mahony, who gave dedicated service to the State.  When he and I had vigorous disagreements, my admiration for his integrity and contribution was second to none.</P>
    <P>The habitats directive will be transposed into law in the next few months. The National Monuments Act, 1994, and the Heritage Act, 1995, are in place. With regard to the former, we were in a slightly better position than Northern Ireland, which discussed the Act with us and used it as a model.  A wildlife Bill will be introduced in the autumn.  If it is enacted, it, together with the two Acts I mentioned and the cultural institutions Bill, will form a heritage package. Deputy Quill was correct to say the absence of a wildlife Act is a deficiency. The cultural institutions Bill and the wildlife Bill are with the parliamentary draftsman.  The parks and heritage areas Bill and the inland waterways Bill are at the heads of Bill stage.  These two Bills and the package I mentioned will provide a comprehensive heritage package.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest things about the Heritage Act is its emphasis on education.  When I first became a Deputy I would not have been able to listen to as informed a debate as I heard today in terms of the consciousness of Deputies with regard to the priceless nature of <Col N="1119" /> heritage and the need for responsible actions by children and others.  Evidence suggests that younger members of the population are more responsible in this regard than those who are older.</P>
    <P>To anybody who suggests that vindictiveness exists, the Boyne Valley project, which was mentioned by Deputy Noel Treacy, went ahead because it went through the planning process without challenge.  The Luggala project was turned down by An Bord Pleanála. When the Deputy looks again at the Brady, Shipman and Martin report, he will find it does not agree with the original proposals.  He is not correct in assuming there is some dark intent with regard to the construction of empires. Heritage services form about one third of the Office of Public Work's responsibilities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, spoke in terms of £200 million.  Heritage services cost about £40 million.  The Office of Public Works has a wonderful future.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has revised history. I did not suggest that section 35 was not part of the Finance Act, 1987.  It was, because that was the year the Irish Film Board lost its funding.  Between 1987 and 1993 it raised £11.5 million for films. Between 14 July 1994 and 29 March 1996 the amount raised under section 35 was £145,183,336.  I acknowledge section 35 and the assistance I received from the previous Government and this one.  The Deputy will excuse me if I sometimes say to myself that something must have been done right.</P>
    <P>We will have other opportunities to discuss broadcasting and the arts plan.  I find the point interesting in relation to the Shannon authority but this goes beyond our discussions.  In response to Deputy Quill, railways are specifically mentioned very much in the same way as we discussed and I accepted amendments on the Heritage Act.  I agree about the history, context and importance.  Deputy Quill will find that we will be addressing the areas she mentioned in the wildlife legislation and directives <Col N="1120" /> in relation to NHAs and special areas of conservation.</P>
    <P>I was moved by Deputy Deasy's speech.  His criticisms of me were minor and all constructive, but that is an irrelevance compared to the passion with which he spoke, as he often does, about the irresponsible burning of bogs and heather and of hedge cutting at inappropriate times.  I am looking at new arrangements.  Instead of there being a fixed date, I may make a change in the Wildlife Act to enable it to be more flexible.  There will be a realistic date that will take account of weather, climatic conditions etc. so the legislation achieves the purpose of the original protection.  Deputy Deasy also asked about the NARGC.  Those matters are ongoing and I made my views known on that at the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</P>
    <P>While there is a court decision on the salvage ownership of the <i>Lusitania</i> and some of its equipment, there is an outstanding case which we have taken, in the name of the Irish people, on its contents and any paintings that may be there, as the protectors of the National Gallery of Ireland.  That case is stated and is waiting to be heard.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy about the paradox between European Union agricultural policy on draining sensitive wetlands and taking good land out of use.  I do not want to go back over who said what.</P>
    <P>It would have been a good idea if policy and administration had been split in the first Government.  It did not happen in practice and therefore it was necessary to have the arrangement which Deputy Lenihan mentioned, to clarify who is responsible for what.  What are being entrusted to my Department are clearly expressed heritage functions but I look forward to co-operating with the professional skills and the resources of the Office of Public Works and other State agencies in the same way as we always did.</P>
    <P>Members from the waterways staff will soon visit County Monaghan again <Col N="1121" /> to discuss with people there the issues Deputy Crawford raised about the Ulster Canal.  I thank Deputy Lawlor in welcoming our actions in relation to the canal.  In regard to the temptation to say who failed to agree the two working groups' reports, I have decided to exercise restraint and leave it to history for the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon can be assured that I never had any intention of lifting Spanish Armada wrecks or property from the shores of County Sligo and move them to County Galway, making myself both ridiculous and absurd in the process. However, it was a great story for a while.</P>
    <P>We made an underwater heritage order in the case of the <i>Lusitania</i> but this raised other important issues.  I hope, in co-operation with other European Union countries, to establish training programmes.  We could train people as underwater divers, for example, with the help of countries like Greece, which has great experience of this area. Through tripartite participation of European countries we can devise programmes to assess, see, preserve and make safe sunken vessels in our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>On the matter of monuments and historic properties, it is not just a matter of asking people to take care in graveyards.  There is a good booklet, widely distributed through schools and other offices, which tells us how this should be done.  It is not to serve as an impediment to good work, which is what local communities want, but set guidelines so one does not have to choose between clean graveyards and a responsible heritage.</P>
    <P>References were made to REPS. There was good co-operation and discussion in north Clare between farmers, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and this Department in trying to establish a model whereby one can respect traditional methods and have good ecological practice at the same time.</P>
    <P>Of course we need more rangers and I will fight for more money to get them. I am working on different ways and <Col N="1122" /> strategies of trying to do something in the short-term.  They are crucial in being vigilant with our legislation.  I am not happy with the present number and I am trying to see how I can resource the ranger service in the short-term, even if I cannot deal with it by way of permanent appointments for the long-term.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked about a census of birds.  From the start of 1997, there is a proposal to carry out an annual survey of common birds on a sample basis.  It will be done alongside bird counts in special protected areas and special areas of conservation.  We have a census but we will move to the quality of which the Deputy spoke.</P>
    <P>I was also asked about prosecutions and there has been a small number of successful ones.  The House can be assured that I intend to continue with a firm policy of prosecutions because it is the only way of securing respect for the heritage.  I have already dealt with the consultations which will take place in regard to education.</P>
    <P>The final question concerns a place close to where I was reared &mdash; Quin Abbey.  This matter is currently being investigated but it would be inappropriate for me to give a more definite indication as it might prejudice negotiations which are currently ongoing.</P>
    <P>I very much appreciate the interest and spirit of Deputies and assure them it is a great privilege to be the Minister who is taking over responsibility for heritage from where it has been so well looked after and where I look forward to further co-operation.  There should be no reason for any absence of morale. We will all find that when the term &ldquo;culture&rdquo; is used in the future, it will include not only the Irish language, broadcasting and film but the physical and natural heritage as well.  They will be stronger by being together.  I hope that future Deputies will take as great an interest in this matter as the current ones.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;affairs&rsquo;, in relation to a donor of an enduring power, means business or financial affairs of the donor,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods urged on Committee Stage that personal care and health decisions be provided for in the Bill.  He has retabled amendment No. 20 to that effect.  I said then the extension of the powers of an attorney to such matters would involve issues of the greatest sensitivity and that it would be wrong to amend the Bill before the matter had been researched thoroughly and there had been extensive consultations.  Even if there was agreement that such an extension would be desirable, major amendments to the present text would be necessary to deal with various situations which could arise, particularly in the area of health care.  I remain of the opinion that an amendment to the Bill to include health care decisions should not be made until the matter has been thoroughly researched.</P>
      <P>We all want the Bill to be enacted and brought into operation at the earliest date possible.  However, I am impressed by the case made for enabling donors, if they so wish, to authorise their attorneys to act on their behalf in some personal care matters to be specified in the enduring power.  The amendments I have tabled will enable this to be done. The amendments specify a list of personal care decisions and require the donor to choose which ones to delegate to the attorney.  The list is given in amendment No. 3 and it contains the kinds of important personal care matters which arise in practice when a donor becomes mentally incapable, such as where the donor should live and applications for housing, social welfare and other benefits for the donor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> The amendments provide specific safeguards relating to the exercise by an attorney of the authority to make personal care decisions.  Under amendment No. 19, any personal care decisions must be taken in the donor's best interests and guidance is given as to how those interests are to be determined.  For this purpose regard must be had, for example, to the past and present wishes of the donor, so far as these are ascertainable, and to the factors which the donor would consider if he or she were able to so do.  Also, other specified persons would have to be consulted, so far as practicable and appropriate, on their views as to what the donor's wishes and feelings might be, and on what would be in the donor's best interests.  Those persons are anyone named by the donor as someone to be consulted on such matters and any other person engaged in caring for the donor or interested in the donor's welfare.</P>
    <P>The exercise by the attorney of the authority to take personal care decisions will be subject to supervision by the court in the same way as decisions in relation to business and financial affairs. Amendment No. 28 enables the court to give direction about a personal care decision which is contemplated by an attorney or which is being put into effect.  Applications to the court for such directions can be made in a summary manner by, or on behalf of the donor, the attorney or any interested person.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 is based on the view that a donor should be left as free as possible to appoint whomsoever he or she wishes to carry out personal care decisions.  The enduring power should only be invalidated if the designated attorney is subsequently convicted of an offence against the person of the donor, or becomes the owner of a nursing home in which the donor resides.  In other words, the attorney's bankruptcy, conviction for fraud or dishonesty or disqualification as a director should not automatically invalidate the enduring power, as it would in the case of an enduring power relating to the donor's <Col N="1128" /> business or financial affairs.  I stress &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; because it is always open to those notified of the execution of the power to object to its registration on grounds of unsuitability when the attorney seeks to have it registered and brought into force.</P>
    <P>A consequential amendment, No. 23, is necessary to section 7 to enable an attorney who has applied for registration of a power to make a personal care decision which cannot reasonably be delayed until the application has been determined.  That situation, which would undoubtedly occur in practice, has to be provided for because the attorney has to give five weeks notice of intention to make an application to persons such as relatives who may wish to object to the registration.</P>
    <P>That leaves amendment No. 1 which is a technical amendment to make it clear that the word &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; in this context is confined to business and financial affairs so that the authority for personal care matters, which an attorney may be given under an enduring power, will extend only to those matters specified in amendment No. 3.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I said that I cannot go along with amendment No. 20 in the name of Deputy Woods in so far as it would allow an attorney to exercise health care decisions if only because to do so would delay unduly the enactment of this legislation.  I hope, however, he will accept that I have gone a fair bit of the way with him.  My amendments will make a substantial improvement to the Bill and will strengthen the position of those attorneys who have to care for those who become mentally incapable.  I commend the amendments to the House on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept these amendments and thank the Minister for giving so much attention to the issue and taking so much care.  He has gone a good way to meet the points we raised.  I welcome his decision to look at the other issues in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> Amendment No. 1 to the interpretation section states:</P>
    <P>In page 4, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;affairs&rsquo;, in relation to a donor of an enduring power, means business or financial affairs of the donor',&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this definition is somewhat narrow.  Should it include a reference to any transaction concerning the donor's real or personal property?  I appreciate what the Minister is doing, but I am concerned that the amendment he proposes might be better if it were not as narrow and were somewhat broader along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 defines the term, &ldquo;personal care decision&rdquo;.  It meets our proposal as set out in amendment No. 20 and limits what is meant by a personal care decision.  Amendment No. 19 sets out how a personal care decision is to be exercised by an attorney.  Our definition is, as the Minister said, much more open.  However, we accept the Minister's amendment as a major step towards what we sought in our amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's definition does not include any provision for taking decisions about medical care.  For example, who decides whether there should be an operation?  Is it the next of kin?  In effect, the donor, in appointing the attorney, has given precedence to the attorney.  The Minister referred to this and I know he is aware of the problem and will look at it further.</P>
    <P>We accept the Minister's amendments, and consequential amendments Nos. 19, 20, 22 and 23, some of which are technical.  Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 deal with personal care; amendment No. 21 provides for various steps to be taken; amendment No. 22 is a technical amendment; amendment No. 23 is acceptable and amendment No. 28 allows the court to give directions on a personal care decision and is, therefore, linked with amendment No. 3.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> We had anticipated many of these links and are happy with what the Minister is doing.  The Bill is considerably improved and I thank him for the steps he has taken in this regard.  We support the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Minister who has gone a substantial way to meeting our suggestions.  Everybody will agree the Bill is better following the acceptance of the amendments he has introduced after listening to the persuasive arguments made on Second and Committee Stages.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides for the right of somebody, called a donor, to give somebody else, called a donee, the power to manage his or her affairs.  In accordance with the terms of the legislation, that power will survive the future incapacity of the person who gives it.  It will be found in practice that the vast majority of people who create an enduring power of attorney will be those who anticipate that, at some future time, they will be unable to manage their own affairs.</P>
      <P>The point we made to the Minister on Second and Committee Stages, which he has now substantially accepted, is that if a person is to be allowed give somebody else the power to manage his or her affairs in the event of future incapacity, it should not be confined to their business or financial affairs or matters dealing with property or money.  Rather, the person who anticipates that at some stage they may become incapacitated in the future should also have the right to create provision for future housing needs and other matters such as rehabilitation and welfare.  The Minister has provided that this can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister advised that he could not include the provision about health care because it would delay the Bill unnecessarily.  This aspect is vitally important and may be the major factor in the mind of the person creating the enduring power of attorney.  I must accept the Minister's word on this, but, perhaps, he will explain why it should be the case.  He indicated that he was <Col N="1131" /> sympathetic to our proposal and that he would do something in the future, if possible, when whatever problem exists at present disappears.  This would include a provision along the lines that the power of attorney should also give the person who gets it &mdash; the donee &mdash; the right to provide for future medical care and take medical decisions affecting the donor of the power of attorney after that person has become incapacitated and when the power of attorney comes into operation.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the substantial improvements he has made to the Bill as originally drafted.  It is necessary that those who will be creating enduring powers of attorney are people who anticipate that, at some stage in the future, they will become incapacitated and, therefore, unable to manage their own affairs.  These improvements give much wider flexibility and powers to the person created attorney on their behalf. Will the Minister explain how a provision to enable such people look after medical needs and take medical decisions with regard to the donor of the power of attorney is going to unduly delay the legislation?  What is his attitude to including a provision along these lines in the future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Woods and O'Dea for their kind comments which I appreciate.  It has always been my policy to accept worthwhile suggestions, irrespective of where they originate.  In this respect I am grateful to Deputies Woods and O'Dea for the suggestions they made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point about the definition of the word &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; is reasonably adequate. &ldquo;Financial affairs&rdquo; covers a pretty wide spectrum.  All the financial affairs of the donor are included there, specifically his business or financial affairs.  Again, section 6 (1) gives authority over all the property of the donor, which of course would include all real or personal property, but the entirety of the financial <Col N="1132" /> affairs of the donor are included in that definition.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that these are optional provisions, and it may well be that the person who is given the power over the property and financial affairs of the donor may be a person totally disconnected from the family.  It could be the person's solicitor, accountant or a business colleague.</P>
    <P>The question of including health care is a different matter.  I do not say that it might not be appropriate to have some provision there to deal with it, but it does and would require more careful examination and consultation than we have had time to give it within the time available since Committee Stage.  It would require consultation with medical authorities and a number of organisations before one could decide on what the pitch ought to be in that regard.  It is not something which I rule out for a future date, but we have made very substantial progress as we are providing for the first time for enduring powers to deal with business affairs.</P>
    <P>I have taken on board the very worthwhile suggestion about personal care provisions, which are set out in items (a) to (g) of amendment No. 3 and cover quite a wide range of activities.  Health care is tricky.  It can involve difficult operations, such as putting people on and taking them off life-support machines.  There may be a role for it.  I do not say there is not, but it would have to be approached with a good deal of care and research.</P>
    <P>The other option was to hold up the enactment of this measure until that research had been completed and carried out but that would have taken an undue length of time, and I know Deputies on all sides of the House were most anxious to get this Bill into law as quickly as possible.  For that reason the amendment comes in this form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 18, to delete &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Over the past 15 to 20 years there has been a policy, in so far as possible, to give jurisdiction to the District Court and the Circuit Court which are located in the regions and easily accessible. From the point of view of families, the practical benefit of giving jurisdiction to the Circuit Court is that it avoids the legal costs which arise in the High Court.  It is particularly important in this Bill where the assets of a donor are unlikely to increase when the enduring power of attorney becomes effective, and any litigation will reduce the overall fund available to care for the donor.</P>
      <P>We do not accept the Minister's argument that it is necessary to give this jurisdiction to the High Court because of its experience with mental incapacity. The Circuit Court has jurisdiction over a vast area of Irish law and the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, has given increased powers to the county registrars of the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the vast majority of ordinary applications under this Bill will be purely administrative and dealt with by the Registrar of the Wards of Court.  This may well be the case, but one only has to look at section 12 of the Bill, which deals with the functions of the court, to see the wide range of situations in which an application may have to go before a court &mdash; there are at least 20 separate instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made this proposal because we were concerned about lowering the costs to the donor and family, and providing reasonable access on a regional basis.  We are anxious that people who make these arrangements will have access to the Bill's provisions and to the <Col N="1134" /> courts on a relatively simple and inexpensive basis where that is necessary.  It is part of the general thinking on decentralisation and making services available to people locally.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not accepted our proposals to date in this regard.  I know they may be regarded at present as radical, but we should look ahead and make court access as simple, easy and near to people as possible.  We put down this amendment for these reasons and I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says and I am glad that is the case. However, under section 12, if a difficulty of any sort arises, the matter must be referred to court and the appropriate court is the High Court</P>
      <P>Incidentally, the people who can make an application under section 12 would be the attorney, the donor if he is mentally capable of doing so or any other interested party.  I do not think the Minister has defined the term &ldquo;interested party&rdquo; so I do not know what the term means here, whether it is somebody who happens to be a good friend of the relative or the donor or whether it must be somebody who is financially interested.  Will the Minister clarify that matter?</P>
      <P>The range of problems on which a person must make application to the High Court is quite staggering.  For example, anybody who is concerned and wants to raise a matter relating to the management or disposal by the attorney of any of the property &mdash; perhaps even a relatively small amount of property &mdash; must go to the High Court.  If somebody is worried, for example, that the accounts are not in proper form and a more professional and comprehensive set of accounts are needed, he or she must take that matter to the High Court.  In many cases it will not be financially worthwhile.  The section also states that the court may &ldquo;require the attorney to furnish information or produce documents or things in his or her possession as attorney&rdquo;.  There is also some provision in the Schedule whereby if the attorney wants to dispense with giving notice to some party about the creation of the power, that matter also has to be referred to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no argument to say this should be so, simply because the High Court has traditionally held jurisdiction in matters relating to mental incapacity.  I <Col N="1136" /> recall having made this point <i>ad nauseam</i> when we debated the Companies Bill, 1990.  All these references to the High Court made matters prohibitively expensive.  I have since come across many cases in practice where matters would have been referred to the Circuit Court if possible, but they had gone beyond the point of diminishing returns and so it was not financially worthwhile to refer them to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bear in mind that in many cases the estate can be relatively small and it would not make financial sense to consistently refer such cases to the High Court.  I have every confidence in the members of the Circuit Court bench who could deal more than adequately with this.  In fact, the County Registrar could adequately deal with many minor matters that arise, but which have to be referred to the High Court.  To put it in context, the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is now quite extensive, and the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Court covers everything except murder, treason and piracy which rarely arises.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I used the analogy that if Mr. Nick Leeson, the culprit in the Barings Bank case, was charged here with the offence of breaking Barings Bank, he would have his case tried in the Circuit Court.  It is extraordinary that somebody who commits a crime of that magnitude can be dealt with by the Circuit Court, whereas if somebody is worried that an attorney is producing an insufficiently comprehensive set of accounts, he must take his case to the High Court.  In many cases the matter will falter and procedures will be unworkable.</P>
    <P>The costs incurred in going to the High Court would be prohibitive.  It is a powerful disincentive.  In many cases, especially when the estate is relatively small, if people have doubts, qualms or difficulties they will ask a solicitor how to sort the matter out.  The solicitor will say the matter must be referred to the High Court under the legislation, and the people concerned will then say &ldquo;forget it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> There is a need for section 12 or a similar section in the legislation as no doubt difficulties of this sort will arise. We can all imagine how they will arise in practice, but the vast majority of difficulties will be of a relatively minor nature, fairly small queries, about matters such as accounts or where a certain document will be produced.  It is unreal to require someone to refer it to the High Court.  In many cases when people feel an injustice is being done, or something is being done that should not be the thought of going to the High Court will create such a disincentive that they will not go.</P>
    <P>The requirement in section 12 to refer a case to the High Court will render it inoperable and useless for many people who will not avail of it.  Even though our amendment states these matters should be referred to the Circuit Court, some effort should have been made in drafting the legislation to distinguish between the different matters about which people can raise queries.  Some of them might be appropriate to the Circuit Court at most, but many of them will be appropriate to the County Registrar who can deal with such matters without any cost being incurred by the person raising the query.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that at this late stage.</P>

      <P>The case made by Deputies Woods and O'Dea is one to which I would be sympathetic in principle.  I have always been in favour of giving as much jurisdiction as possible to the lower courts.  However, I can only reiterate what I said on Committee Stage, that in the present case the procedure set out in the Bill for the registration of enduring powers of attorney by the registrar of wards of court is the right one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with an entirely new jurisdiction.  It would be prudent to entrust it to the High Court and its officers who have wide experience in the related area of mental incapacity. That will ensure that a consistent approach is adopted to all applications <Col N="1138" /> for registration and to questions arising from them.  It will also mean there will be a centralised register of all enduring powers.  The ordinary straightforward application for registration will be a purely administrative procedure to be carried out by the registrar of wards of court with no involvement by the court.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we should not take chances when conferring this new jurisdiction so that the Act can be relied upon to operate smoothly and consistently in fairness to the donors concerned and in the interests of ensuring as far as possible the proper management of their property while they are mentally incapable.  Deputy O'Dea said he thought the costs would be staggering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with that.  I want to draw the attention of Deputies Woods and O'Dea to a provision concerning applications which was inserted at my instigation in section 4 (2) which states: &ldquo;an application or reference to the court under this Part shall be made in a summary manner.&rdquo;  That is there for a purpose.  It means, in effect, that the normal panoply and expense involved in High Court actions does not apply.</P>
      <P>A summary procedure is to be used which means that one simple notice of motion application document is all that is used, and a response mirroring the procedure that would apply in the Circuit Court.  I am not saying there would not be a difference between such a notice of application in the High Court and one in the Circuit Court.  There would, but it would not be enormous because it is the most simplified procedure one could have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have specifically provided that any applications that arise &mdash; and I do not envisage there would be that many &mdash; would not be dealt with in the normal extensive pleading procedures that apply in the High Court, but in a summary procedure.  For practical purposes that means one application document, a simple notice of motion in the High <Col N="1139" /> Court.  It would be exactly the same form one would use in the Circuit Court.  In the normal case a junior counsel would draw it up.  The solicitor would draw it up in the same way as would the junior counsel, but it would say High Court on the form instead of Circuit Court.  The differential in costs between the two would be marginal. The overwhelming bulk of cases will not involve a court application.</P>
    <P>As I envisage it, the whole procedure would mirror probate procedures.  As Deputies know, when applications are made to probate a will, the papers are addressed to and lodged with the registrar of the probate office of the High Court to be dealt with there.  My guess is that 98 per cent of will applications are dealt with and grants of probate are issued through the office.  It is an exceptional case that has to go before the court.  I envisage these applications would be mirrored there and that only a small proportion of cases would actually go before the court.</P>
    <P>Consequently applications may be made by interested parties.  That would arise out of the administration of the powers of attorney.  Applications could be made on a variety of bases.  I have covered that as best I can by providing that all these applications are not to be made in the normal costly procedures of the High Court, comprising a plenary summons and a statement of claim, but in a simple summary procedure.  It will involve one document of application, a response and going into court straight away on the return date given.  This mirrors pretty much the procedure in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea asked what is the definition of &ldquo;interested party&rdquo;.  We have not put in a specific definition, but it means what it says &mdash; any person who has an interest is an interested party. Any person who has a connection, concern or interest may bring the application.  It is cast wide and is intended to be so.</P>

I approach this from the view point of subsidiarity.  When this debate finishes the Minister for Finance will come into the House to tell us how to be more efficient in terms of our administration and talk about implementing the principles of subsidiarity in the Civil Service and elsewhere. From that view point, our amendment is right and &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;High Court&rdquo;.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> If this amendment were accepted, section 5 (2) should read: &ldquo;The Minister shall make provision by regulations in relation to any or all of the following matters&rdquo;.  There is no reason the Minister should not delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and, therefore, make a commitment.  The amendment does not state when he should do so.  I have no doubt the Minister intends to make provision by regulations in relation to matters concerning enduring powers of attorney, including their form and execution, documents to be included and so on.  We look forward to that.  I am sure he will proceed expeditiously in making these regulations.  There is no reason he cannot accept the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister said on Committee Stage that the regulations would be ready to coincide with the introduction of the legislation.  At what stage are these regulations?  The regulations go right to the heart of these new proposals.  They deal with the form and execution of enduring powers of attorney and ensure a statement by the donor that he has all the information and understands what he is doing and one by a solicitor that he or she is satisfied that the donor understands the effect of creating the power.  There is also provision for a statement by a registered medical practitioner.  If the Minister is to include in regulations these things which he knows are necessary, what will happen if this legislation comes into force without these regulations being in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why these provisions are not included in the Bill.  The Minister, for his own reasons, wants to do this by way of regulation, which is fine.  However, I would like his assurance that these regulations will be in place before the Bill comes into operation.  In view of the fact that this legislative proposal is the culmination of a long campaign &mdash; many people have waited patiently for a long time to see this provision in force &mdash; will the Minister assure us that the regulations are <Col N="1142" /> ready and that the Bill will be in operation at an early date together with the regulations?</P>

      <P>I am advised that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is correct in this context. The Minister is being given the power coupled with a duty to make regulations without which this part of the Bill cannot function.  As a practical matter, whether we say &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, the regulations will be made.  Deputy O'Dea asked about the present position as regards the preparation of the regulations.  I sent the draft heads of the regulations to the Law Society and the Dublin Solicitors Bar Association.  My Department is now considering their comments.  I have no doubt that the regulations will be finalised shortly so that they can be made and the Act brought into operation soon after it becomes law.</P>

He should remain in the House after this debate to hear the Minister for Finance discuss customer driven relationships.  When finalising the form of these regulations, I ask him to bear in mind users and make sure the regulations are simple enough for them.  Legal people will probably understand them.

      <P>In page 5, line 32, after &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the presence of two independent witnesses&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the attestation of the signatures of the donor and the attorney.  The amendment proposes that it be done in the presence of two independent witnesses in the same way as a will.  The donor will not be able to give evidence as to whether the document is valid or to explain the intentions by the time the power of attorney comes into operation.  When we discussed this question earlier, the Minister said it would be made clear in the regulations. It is a question of providing the same kind of witnessing as that provided in the case of a will.  Although the Minister said he was not in favour of this change, I would like to hear his views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods proposes that the regulations should provide that the donor's signature and that of each attorney should be witnessed by two independent persons.  I understand the case the Deputy is making, but I am not convinced it is necessary to insist on having two witnesses to those signatures.  I also foresee some difficulty in defining which witnesses would be independent.  One witness should be sufficient and this is what I propose to provide in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> The regulations will require a statement by a solicitor to be included in the document that, after making any necessary inquiries, he or she has no reason to believe the document is being executed by the donor as a result of fraud or under undue pressure.  There will also be a statement by a doctor that the donor had the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power and a statement by the attorney that he or she understands the duties and obligations involved.</P>
    <P>The operation will thus be a great deal more formal than the execution of a will and one witness to each signature is sufficient.  An attorney will not be permitted to witness the donor's signature but subject to that, it can be left to the solicitor involved to ensure there is nothing untoward in the signing of the enduring power or the witnessing of the signatures.  For these reasons, I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has, to a large extent, met our requirements in amendment No. 10. He omitted the proposals to exclude a person of unsound mind and people who have committed serious criminal offences.

      <P>Under the Bill as drafted, people judged to be bankrupt or to have been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty were precluded. The Minister has improved it to include people who are convicted of an offence against the person or property of the donor.  However, it still leaves open the possibility that a range of undesirable individuals, such as murderers, child molesters and rapists, can be given enduring power of attorney provided <Col N="1146" /> they did not commit the offence against the donor.  This is undesirable and our proposal is infinitely preferable. Although we will not make a meal of this by pressing the amendment, our suggestion would ensure much more sensible legislation.  The possibility is left wide open in the Bill, even with the Minister's undoubted improvement in amendment No. 10, that some undesirable people can be given power of attorney and nobody can do anything about it if the donor is willing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods's amendment proposes to make two changes to the current text.  First, it disqualifies from acting as an attorney a person who is of unsound mind at the time of the execution of the power.  I am not sure that practically it is necessary to make specific provision for such an eventuality.  It is difficult to understand how any donor would appoint such a person as attorney or that the solicitor concerned would allow it to happen.</P>
      <P>The other change proposed by the Deputy would disqualify persons convicted on indictment of an offence.  On Committee Stage, Deputy O'Dea made the point, rightly in my view, that the indictable nature of an offence does not necessarily mean it was serious.  For this reason, a better criterion would be the maximum penalty which could be imposed for the offence in question.  I tabled an amendment proposing that a person convicted of an offence carrying a maximum penalty of at least two years imprisonment would be disqualified from acting as an attorney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing so, I bore in mind that the court could register an instrument as an enduring power even if it did not comply with any of the provisions of section 5, including the disqualification provisions.  However, the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association pointed out that the amendment could result in the disqualification of a person who had been convicted of a serious driving offence, but who would nevertheless be suitable as an attorney.  The association suggested it would be better not to put such <Col N="1147" /> attorneys in the position of having to seek leave from the court.</P>
    <P>The formula in my amendment reflects a fair and reasonable balance.  It will disqualify a person from acting as an attorney if he or she is convicted of an offence against the person or property of the donor.  This is additional to the category of offences involving fraud or dishonesty which is already included in the text as meriting disqualification for this purpose.  In these circumstances I commend my amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The point of the amendment is to a large extent met in section 5 (4) (b) and I will not press it.  It does not go as far as we would wish, but the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting our proposals.  The Minister's amendment No. 16 is agreed as it meets the points we raised.  That amendment states:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4) (b) `owner' includes a person managing a nursing home or a director (including a shadow director within the meaning of section 27 of the Companies Act, 1990) of, or a shareholder in, a company which owns or manages such a home&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, his amendment is unnecessary.  The section already disqualifies an employee or agent of the owner.  My amendment arises from comments made on Committee Stage that the definition of owner in section 5 (1) does not include a person managing a nursing home in which the donor resides or a director or shareholder of the company which manages such a nursing home.  It closes that possible loophole and, for good measure, it also includes shadow directors in the definition as suggested by the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 22, before &ldquo;An&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Subject to subsection (8) and sections 14 (3) and 14 (4),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are tabled to make better provision for a situation where a donor has appointed joint attorneys or joint and several attorneys under the enduring power and where one or more of them dies or ceases to be suitable to act as attorneys, say by becoming bankrupt or being convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill as it stands such an occurrence would invalidate the whole enduring power in the case of joint attorneys.  In the case of joint and several attorneys, only the attorney concerned is being disqualified and the <Col N="1149" /> enduring power is not otherwise affected.</P>
    <P>As regards joint attorneys, I do not think the whole instrument should be invalidated in such cases.  If one of the joint donees under an ordinary power of attorney becomes bankrupt the power of attorney lapses but the donor, if he or she wishes, can grant a fresh power of attorney to the remaining donee or donees.  The position is different with an enduring power which has come into force because the donor will not be mentally capable by then of granting a fresh power.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I propose that, unless the donor provides otherwise, bankruptcy or the other events will disqualify the joint attorney concerned.  That is being provided by the insertion of a new subsection in amendment No. 34, which will be section 14 (3).</P>
    <P>A further reason for making this change is to meet a point made by the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association that a power creating joint attorneys could lapse on the death of one of the joint attorneys.  The authority for that proposition is said to be Friend <i>v</i> Young &mdash; 1987, 2 Chancery 421 &mdash; a case where a partnership acted as agents.  One partner died and the surviving partner did not account to the principal for moneys received in respect of deliveries that took place after the partner's death.  In an action against that partner's estate it was held that the contract or agency was determined by his death.</P>
    <P>Although the case was not specifically related to powers of attorney, these powers are governed by the law of agency and it would seem better to put the matter beyond doubt in the context of enduring powers where the donors are mentally incapable of creating another enduring power after the original power has come into force.</P>
    <P>As regards joint and several attorneys, section 14 (4) provides that a failure by one attorney to meet the requirements of section 5 for creating an enduring power will invalidate the power only as regards that attorney.  It does not cover the situation covered by <Col N="1150" /> section 5 (6) where after the creation of the power one of the joint and several attorneys becomes bankrupt and so on. Under that provision the enduring power would then be invalidated or cease to be in force as the case may be.</P>
    <P>To avoid this happening section 14 (4) is being amended to make it apply to a failure by a joint and several attorneys to comply with the provisions of section 5, including subsection (6).  That is amendment No. 35.  Amendments Nos. 12, 13, 33 and 44 to 46, inclusive, are consequential.  I trust the amendments will be accepted as improvements to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his co-operation.  This is important legislation which will be particularly valuable to elderly people.  The Alzheimer's Society was anxious to have this Bill passed and I am glad the Minister has given an undertaking that the regulations will come into effect shortly after the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <Col N="1151" /> The result has been a substantial improvement in the Bill.  It now extends to a range of personal care decisions and will cover most of those that arise in practice when the donor of an enduring power has become mentally incapable. Several changes have been made to ensure that the wishes of the donor to create a valid enduring power are not frustrated by non-compliance with the requirements of the Bill.  The first is the provision to enable enduring powers to be registered even when there are nonmaterial defects in their form or in the mode of expression.  That will facilitate the registration of powers by the registrar and alleviate unnecessary references to the courts.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies for their helpful approach.  The draft regulations have been circulated and I will undertake to bring them and the Bill into force with all possible speed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to open today's debate on Delivering Better Government &mdash; the Government's programme of change for the Civil Service.  As Members are aware, this Government is fully committed to modernising the Civil Service, thus enabling it to meet better the many challenges it faces in today's more turbulent and demanding environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Service is one we can be proud of; it has served this House well and made a very significant contribution to the development of the country in the past 75 years of nationhood.  We have <Col N="1152" /> grown accustomed to, and taken for granted, its integrity, impartiality and equity of treatment for all.  These core values have been major assets on which successive Governments have been able to confidently rely.</P>
    <P>However, society evolves and changes; economies grow and become more diverse and complex and both become more demanding on Government and the services it offers.  Government must respond to these changes if it is to govern effectively and meet the reasonable expectations of those it represents.  Ireland is no exception in this regard.  At present, Governments everywhere face similar problems and unprecedented challenges.  The result is that Governments throughout the world are reconsidering how they relate to citizens and businesses, how best to ensure provision of public services, and how to maintain the capacity to govern in the face of great uncertainty and calls for change.</P>
    <P>Given the central, pivotal role of the Civil Service in advising and supporting Government and in delivering services, we must, in the first instance, consider the changes it must make if it is to maintain its proud tradition and record, and if it is to continue to serve the country and future Governments to the best of its ability.</P>
    <P>There is also the very significant influence the civil and public service exert on the economy.  This involves the array of organisations which interact in a variety of ways with one another, with businesses, and with the public at large.  The public service employs some 190,000 people, with a current pay and pensions bill of some £4.8 billion per annum. Within the public service, the Civil Service, at which Delivering Better Government is targeted, consists of some 29,500 people costing £713 million in pay and pensions per annum.  By any standards, these are large industries making up a very sizeable chunk of the economy and accounting for just over 50 per cent of current public expenditure. We owe it to the taxpayers to see to it that the civil and public services are well <Col N="1153" /> managed, operate to their full potential, deliver quality services that meet the needs of their customers and are value for the money spent on them.  The Government, as the employer of the civil and public services, has a major responsibility in this regard.  In turn, all Members of this House have to share in that responsibility and ensure &mdash; on behalf of taxpayers, the customers of public services and civil and public servants themselves &mdash; that there is an efficient and effective system of public administration.</P>
    <P>In considering the changes necessary to meet more effectively the challenges ahead, the Government has taken this triangle of shareholders &mdash; the taxpayer, the customer and State employees &mdash; and comprehensively examined how the Civil Service currently operates and how it might work better in the interests of all three.</P>
    <P>The odyssey on which we have embarked commenced with the launch of the strategic management initiative in 1994 by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  That initiative, or SMI as it is commonly called, set each Government Department and Office the task of more clearly defining its role through identifying its objectives and devising strategies to achieve those objectives.  In short, the SMI requires management in each Department and Office to ask itself constantly a number of key questions: What business are we in?  Are we doing what we should be doing?  Who are our customers?  Are we meeting their needs?  What changes should we be making?</P>
    <P>The result is a better understanding and a more explicit articulation of what each Department and Office should do rather than what it does.  A great deal was learned through this process resulting in a sharper focus on objectives and results.  The exercise also highlighted a number of constraints commonly perceived as hindering the better use of resources.  Accordingly, in 1995, the Government asked the group of departmental secretaries, the co-ordinating group established to oversee the <Col N="1154" /> development of the SMI across the Civil Service, to come up with proposals to address these and other constraints. Drawing on the departmental SMI exercises, a number of specifically prepared reports on a variety of aspects of Civil Service management, and on their own experiences, the group prepared a comprehensive set of proposals for Government to consider.  The Government, having given detailed consideration to these proposals, endorsed them.  The result is Delivering Better Government, a programme of change for the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I stress that this is a framework and is not a fully articulated programme of change.  It will take time to develop.  The framework sets out a clear basis on which consistent and ongoing change can be achieved.  It also establishes a clear overall direction for change, a set of principles and parameters which will inform and direct the overall process.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is excellence. Delivering Better Government thus constitutes a blueprint for change across the machinery of State, a means of steadily enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the civil and public service over time.  How much time? Change of this magnitude could not be achieved within the lifetime of a single Government.  All-party co-operation will be essential.  I am glad such commitment is assured.  A broad consensus exists in this House on the need for change and the general areas where change is required.  Some improvements will become apparent almost immediately, while others will take time to develop.  Many of the expected benefits will be cumulative and dependent on changes in other areas for their successful implementation.  It is for this reason the Government is taking a holistic approach, placing the required changes within an integrated programme, rather than a series of loosely related initiatives.</P>
    <P>Widening the SMI to include the public service is also high on the agenda. The SMI reinforces and complements work already under way on the better <Col N="1155" /> provision of public services and, in particular, the devolution of functions from central to local government.  The Government has already stated its commitment to the renewal of local government on the basis of the principles of subsidiarity, accountability, integration, effectiveness and participation.  It has established the Devolution Commission to make recommendations which include: that significant additional functions are devolved to the local government system, on the basis of a phased programme, and local authorities are meaningfully involved in policy and administration regarding functions not directly devolved to them.</P>
    <P>The critical assessment of Departments' activities and the principles of inter-disciplinary partnership and subsidiarity inherent in the commission's task are a key aspect of the approach underpinning the SMI.  The Minister for the Environment has recently extended the strategic management initiative to local authorities.  Responsibility for the devolution programme has been placed under the aegis of the Taoiseach to highlight the priority being given to the task.  The commission has been asked to report in phases and, I understand, is finalising its first statement at present.  The extension of the SMI to the wider public service will take place during the course of this year.</P>
    <P>I have already alluded to the external pressures for change.  To these may be added the pressures coming from within the Civil Service, where there is a recognition that some radical changes are needed if it is to perform to its full potential.  Such pressures, both external and internal, are not in themselves sufficient to produce the needed changes. We must be able to articulate a better and viable alternative and a meaningful series of steps that will lead logically to that chosen alternative.  It is essential that any such alternative meets the needs of customers, including Government.  It must also be sufficiently inspiring to enthuse and energise those most affected by the envisaged changes.  In <Col N="1156" /> short, when people believe in what they are doing, they will put time and energy into making it work.</P>
    <P>Delivering Better Government set out such an alternative or vision of the Civil Service of the future.  Based on the Government's vision for Ireland contained in A Government of Renewal, the Civil Service of the future will be open and flexible, operating to the highest standards of integrity, equality, impartiality and accountability, with a mission and culture of quality service to the Government and the public at every level.  It will be a Civil Service that will make the maximum contribution to national, social and economic development, while making the best use of the talents and skills of its staff.  In short, the aim is a Civil Service that retains its core values, while becoming a high performance, efficient, effective and value-for-money organisation delivering quality services to all its customers.  As I stated earlier, the bottom line is excellence in everything it does.</P>
    <P>I will now address in detail the main elements of Delivering Better Government.  Excellence in performance is the central tenet of the Government's programme.  However, for excellence in performance, we must have clear lines of responsibility and accountability. Thus the issue of accountability must be addressed as a priority.  When the State was founded, the core Civil Service was already in existence.  In order to give statutory validity to its activities, it became necessary to introduce the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924. This crucial statute was primarily designed to underpin already existing structures and bring order to bear on what was then a somewhat chaotic system of public administration.  To that extent, the 1924 Act was very successful and it has many strengths that have served the governance of this country extremely well.  However, a somewhat conservative interpretation of its provisions in the succeeding decades since the 1920s has tended to reinforce a rather static model of Government.  As <Col N="1157" /> a result we have today a system of governance which, while strong and robust, needs to be updated to meet the demands of governing in the late 20th century.</P>
    <P>This is not surprising.  Those who framed the 1924 Act based their model on an administration shaped in, and suited to, the 19th century, not one gearing up for the complexities facing us as we approach the 21st century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Last night a number of Deputies mentioned the lack of public representation on these new boards.  The political parties on all sides of the House regard it as a major issue. Over the last two days a number of Deputies expressed serious concern as to whether there will be adequate and appropriate representation on the boards.  It is an issue which needs to be addressed seriously.</P>
      <P>There has been some strong criticism of the role of public representatives on vocational education committees down through the years.  I was a member of a vocational education committee in Wexford for many years.  I always found that the public representatives on the board made a valuable contribution to the educational structures in the county, as I am sure they have done on every vocational education committee around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regional boards do not work.  If one looks at the health board structures one finds that many counties are not benefiting much from the regional structures.  I am concerned that the same thing will happen under the educational regional boards.  The number of counties tied to <Col N="1159" /> each board is too large and it will remove the localised role whereby the parent, the teacher and the members of the vocational education committees can meet, discuss and talk frankly about problems they may envisage in education in their county.  A regional board will be based in some central point and it will be very difficult to gain access or to make direct contact with the people involved.</P>
    <P>The vocational education structures at present are more than adequate to meet the needs of the changing structures in education.  It is important that parents, teachers, FÁS and others are represented on the vocational education committees, a number of vocational education committees have moved in that direction already.  In Wexford there are both parent and teacher representatives on the vocational education committee.  Education can progress only if all the areas of education are represented on the vocational education committee.  They should be allowed to continue to play the valuable role they played in the past.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion in the Minister's speech that some of the vocational education committee structures may be abolished and the town of Wexford vocational education committee is often mentioned.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is very much aware of the important role the town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee plays in the education system in Wexford town.  They have had some magnificent results with students.  A new school was built there last year because of the strong representations made by the town of Wexford vocational education committee and by the county's public representative.  It would be a major blunder to see that vocational education committee structure abolished in any rationalisation or change envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The town of Wexford vocational education committee, which has been in place for 60 years, has made a magnificent contribution to educational <Col N="1160" /> development in Wexford town.  The late Dick Corish and the late Dr. Jim Ryan were to the forefront in ensuring that when the vocational education committees were established the town of Wexford had its own vocational education committee structure.  We all know the valuable contribution made by the late Dick Corish and the late Dr. Jim Ryan to Wexford generally.  It would be ironic if a Labour Minister was to introduce proposals to abolish the town of Wexford vocational education committee which provides many different types of education beyond the junior or leaving certificate studies.  It provides outreach courses from Waterford regional technical college and is involved in adult education and evening courses.  Great credit is due to the principal of that school and to the committee for the many different facets of education being provided for the people of Wexford town.  It is very important that the present structure of the town of Wexford vocational education committee is maintained, maybe with the addition of some parents, teachers or people from FÁS.  It would not be right to abolish it.  I ask Deputies Howlin, Yates and Doyle, who I know have a keen interest in the town of Wexford vocational education committee, to use their influence to ensure that this vocational education committee is maintained for the betterment of the students, teachers and the parents of Wexford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody must laud the role the vocational education committees have played in the progression of education.  They were adaptable by virtue of their local nature and could change with the demands of time. I refer to the emergence of the regional colleges.  Having lectured in a regional college I can say that the development of regional colleges was a natural progression from the vocational education committees.  The result is that we have one of the best technological education institutes, which is recognised abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational education committees were structured on a county or a city <Col N="1161" /> basis and, therefore, knew the demands of their areas.  The members were enlightened people who knew exactly what the demands of education were as well as the demands of pupils and parents.  What do we have today?  I cannot understand the Minister and her proposals.</P>
    <P>I could understand if the Minister said she was doing away with vocational education committees and bringing in regional boards but she is effectively proposing to abort the vocational education committees and put them in a nice little corner with no powers.  A bureaucracy in a corner is going nowhere.  I ask the Minister to think back to the establishment of regional health boards.  Somebody came up to me recently at a meeting having been asked who was on their health board. People working within the health service itself could not name the people on that board.  Small is beautiful and an integrated group like the vocational education committees are the ideal entity to transmit the demands of education for the future.</P>
    <P>No costing has been done on these regional boards.  Again, we should look back to the regional health boards.  How recently did we have to get Exchequer finance to get them out of difficulty? Some £13 million had to be taken from the Exchequer to deal with the difficulties that arose.  This Minister is bringing in regional boards without having thought out the difficulties which will arise as a result.  She does not know the cost involved or the role they will play, yet she is leaving one level of bureaucracy intact and is establishing another layer.  That does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Anybody who looks at this proposal from the point of view of the cost structure must be conscious that under this system we will achieve nothing but the escalation of the cost of educating pupils.  The Minister will agree that our basic interest is in getting resources into schools and ensuring that our children get the best possible education and the best possible educational facilities.  Is <Col N="1162" /> the Minister saying that having a vocational education committee in one place and a regional board somewhere else will not consume many scarce resources?  That is tantamount to lunacy.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is conducting a value for money audit of all State services.  Now he will see this Minister establishing two bureaucracies and wasting a scarce resource that could be ploughed into the welfare of our young people.  The proposal cannot stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I have often spoken in the past about the multiplicity of certification bodies.  It is daft.  The NCEA is internationally recognised.  There is also FÁS and CERT.  Now there is Teastas.  We are repeating the practice of establishing a multiplicity of groupings to look after education but it will not deliver.  I am familiar with Cork City Vocational Education Committee and County Cork Vocational Education Committee and there are many more vocational education committees scattered throughout the country.  Change was a necessity.  We had too many vocational education committees and the number had to be reduced.  By reducing the number of vocational education committees we could have achieved what the Minister had hoped to achieve but will not now achieve.</P>
    <P>Regional education boards will not secure the interests of parents and pupils and will not deliver an education system that is proper and progressive in a technological age.  They will be costly. A cost value analysis of the universities and the regional technical colleges showed that universities were costing £1,000 per student per year in excess of what the regional technical colleges were costing.  Under this proposed structure I guarantee that within two years the cost of delivering education will rise dramatically.  The Minister has no costings included in the programme for the regional education boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not had the guts to deliver what should be delivered. Instead of cutting it neatly and opting for regional boards she decided on a <Col N="1163" /> mishmash that will leave us much worse off and has aborted excellent vocational education committees which know exactly where they are going and what they are delivering to the local communities.  The time is right to pull back. Many Deputies on the Government benches are glad that the Minister has permitted the continued existence of the vocational education committees. However, in what form will they exist? They have no reason for existence under what is proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our education spokesman, Deputy Martin, has made clear the Fianna Fáil position with regard to regional education boards.  As a former Minister for Education, however, I wish to comment on the proposal.</P>
      <P>The regional education boards are a formula for chaos, bureaucracy and interference.  I deliberately omitted the proposal from the Green Paper on education when I was in office.  I could see that they were unnecessary.  I am disappointed that the Minister included the proposal in the White Paper and that it has been adopted by the Cabinet as Government policy.  That was an expensive mistake.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin has asked many times about the cost of the regional boards. From my memory of my time in the Department and from initial costings I have calculated informally, I estimate the costs to be at least £20 million per annum.  How was the Government able to approve the proposal without first telling the Dáil what it would cost, information which Deputy Martin has consistently sought from the Minister?  My calculation of a minimum of £20 million per annum could reach £30 million.  It is a serious matter that the Cabinet has approved that expenditure when the House has not been informed of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boards are unnecessary and a recipe for meddling in schools because, as the boards grow fat, they will seek to justify their existence.  The proposal will lead to a new, glossy brochure brigade <Col N="1164" /> whose executives will be hell-bent on career path building.  The money should be invested directly in our schools, in teaching, equipment and computers and in special education for disability and disadvantage, not in establishing a new layer of super boards with consequent executive perks all round.  The boards will cause stress between themselves and the Department of Education and cause substantial stress beneath them as they seek to exercise their muscle and make decisions in time for their annual reports.</P>
    <P>Only a Minister with no organisational experience would have the naivete to propose uncosted structures which are a recipe for chaos, bureaucracy and interference and will confer no educational benefit on children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is timely.  It sets out the Fianna Fáil position regarding the establishment of regional education boards.  I wish to focus on the work of the vocational education committees since their establishment in 1930.</P>
      <P>Our experience of regional boards does not inspire great confidence and the regional health boards offer a good example.  Services to the community are cut back on a regular basis.  I can speak from my experience on both the South-Eastern Health Board and County Carlow vocational education committee. We regularly hear about reductions in the number of hospital beds and shortages of doctors, nurses, specialists and consultants.  We also hear of long delays in admitting patients for serious and urgent treatment and operations.  The one area in which no cutbacks take place is administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By regionalising what is now a county structure we will fall into the trap of increased administration costs.  Far from cutting costs and making savings, the opposite will be the case.  While cutbacks and retrenchment occur in many services, in the regionalisation of the health services we witnessed increases in administrative personnel on an annual basis.  Administration costs in <Col N="1165" /> the existing vocational education committee system are under 5 per cent of total costs.  If the cost of administration in the head office of a vocational education committee is determined in isolation, it is 2.3 per cent of total expenditure.  That is a credit to the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The argument in favour of regional boards does not stand up if one takes into consideration the vast programme of activities being undertaken and adequately served at present under the vocational education committee system. No one suggests that the vocational education committee system, which has existed since 1930, does not need to be reviewed.  However, such a review should have as its core the elimination of restrictions on progress and the expansion of its brief to meet the requirements of the next century.</P>
    <P>There is little by way of improvement in education, as envisaged in the White Paper, which could not be achieved by the establishment of a county board as distinct from a regional board.  The strengths of the vocational education committee system could be retained and its role expanded and improved by the absorption of the vocational education committee into a new county education board.  This would have many advantages, including the fact that schools would be close to the centre of administration, public representatives and parents would be from the locality as distinct from the regional area and representatives would be sensitive to local problems and requirements.  It is important to have local input to local problems.  Parents would have access to local representatives and be confident their concerns would be dealt with.  We need a body which reflects local democracy and which has close contact with those whom it represents.  It must also be publicly accountable.  Why should we exclude the expertise available at vocational education committee level?  I ask the Minister to include this in a county education board.</P>
    <P>False statements about savings are all <Col N="1166" /> we hear about in relation to the establishment of regional boards.  There has been no reliable assessment of the costs. To suggest that savings can be achieved by the transfer of administrative staff is to ignore that staff will have to be compensated for such a move.  This is standard practice in the public service.  Some staff may not accept a transfer and will have to be compensated.  Salaries of higher officials will be in excess of those enjoyed by vocational education committee administrative staff, having regard to the regional status of the employer, for example, the health board.</P>
    <P>The Government should be careful when formulating proposals in this regard.  The regional education boards will try to work from the top down.  The present vocational education committee structure works from the bottom up and that is the way it should continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on this subject on previous occasions and I pointed out this proposal is not well founded.  The support I have received across the education spectrum confirms my original objections to the plan and places an obligation on me to add my voice to those of my colleagues who oppose this proposal.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on education published last year acknowledged the role played by the vocational educational committees in the development of the system which operates to the benefit of the partners in education.  Many Members on all sides of the political divide know the valuable work carried out by the vocational education committees in their respective counties.  Many Deputies and Senators still serve on the county committees and have gone on record to state their belief in the vocational education committee system. I find it difficult to understand how those Deputies in the Government parties can support the dissolution of the vocational education committees on which they serve, or may have served in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that Fianna Fáil <Col N="1167" /> has made a political football of this issue.  I make it clear to the Members of the Dáil and the people we represent that this is not true.  Reform of our education system always found support in the ranks of my party.  Reform usually means a change which improves the system rather than changing it for the sake of change.  The Minister appears to have taken little notice of this important fact in most of the proposals she has brought before us during her term of office.</P>
    <P>The proposal before us is that we should reject the planned regional boards and retain a system which we all know has served us well.  I do not suggest &mdash; and I have never claimed &mdash; that improvement in every sphere is not possible.  There are ways in which the vocational education committee system can be expanded and improved which would be welcome by all the partners in education.  Fianna Fáil, in common with most responsible groups inside and outside this House, would give broad support to a range of measures designed to improve the efficiency of our vocational education committees.  We cannot, however, support the abolition of the committees in favour of new, unwieldy structures such as those proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The present vocational education committee system provides for the management of certain second and third level institutions on a county by county basis.  A brief examination of the mandate of each separate committee will show what the number of institutions and the range of services provided by each vocational education committee is considerable.  The Minister now wishes to reduce the number of authorities in the country to ten.  This will place an intolerable burden on the proposed new regional authority.  I pointed out on previous occasions that the geographical areas allocated to the proposed boards will, in some cases, cover as many as five separate counties.  If the Minister is so insistent that the management of education within county boundaries is <Col N="1168" /> beyond the capability of a county committee supported by her Department, then she must realise that the management of education with a larger area will not be approved under the rationalisation scheme.  The energy and resources needed to create the new regional boards would be better expended in the expansion of the present committees and in the provision of additional funding to enable them to improve the quality of service.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes wide-ranging powers for the regional boards.  It places new obligations on schools at every level which would be overseen by these boards.  We are given to understand that the proposed statutory powers to be conferred on each board are designed to reassure the public that the guiding principles of quality, equality, pluralism, partnership and accountability have priority.  This is not only acceptable but desirable.  The statutory powers provided for in the White Paper could be conferred on county committees with reasonable ease and would have exactly the same effect on education.  The mandate of the county committee can be expanded to cover areas currently outside its remit just as easily as new authorities can be appointed. The fact that all this can be achieved while retaining the principle of the county committee is of great benefit to education.</P>
    <P>The Minister made much in recent years of her desire to empower people. She claims she wishes to see the future of education in the hands of the people in general and the partners in education in particular.  This can hardly be achieved by centralising the authorities which are charged with such great responsibility.  Centralisation in any field goes against all the progress in society over the past quarter of a century.  It is a retrograde step and cannot bring real reform to our education system.</P>
    <P>We have long recognised that centralisation of power leads to increased marginalisation among certain sectors of <Col N="1169" /> our society.  The weak, the underprivileged and the isolated are particularly vulnerable.  This is true of every type of human activity, whether social, cultural or commercial.  It is equally true that the varied strands which combine to form the network of education in Ireland today contain those which are stronger than others, those with better resources and those which need support.  It took us years as a developing nation to realise that those who had access to the centres of power could benefit to a greater extent than those who did not. For this reason successive Governments took measures to devolve power through a policy of decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, comes from a privileged urban background.  She displays little or no understanding of the reality of life for many rural communities.  Given the sad state of employment, we must acknowledge that the most important assets many of our rural communities possess are their schools and ancillary education facilities.</P>
    <P>Depending on the level of education offered in an area, the number of people with a vested interest in the type and quality of that education may vary. What rarely differs, however, is the commitment of the community to the development of its schools.  A wide range of talents in every part of this island is drawn on on a daily basis to the benefit of all.  The people who give so freely of their time, energy and talents to their communities deserve to have more and not less say in the planning and management of education.  This can only be done in an effective way by concentrating on what has proved effective to date.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to abandon her proposals for regional boards and I ask Members to accept that the most effective way to manage our educational resources is on a county by county basis. I request the House to support the call for an audit of resources in each county with a view to discovering exactly what is necessary to establish and support a proper forum in all counties to foster a <Col N="1170" /> co-ordinated approach to education. These fora, working in co-operation with the Department, would produce a system of education from pre-school onwards, which might have some chance of maximising the advantages at local level and they could target the conditions which lead to disadvantage.  I hope commonsense will prevail on this occasion and Members will put aside party political considerations and support this initiative which has implications for future generations of students as well as those in the field of education today.</P>

      <P>We have a unitary education system where not only policy is centralised in the Department of Education but also the detailed administration of issues which surely are better dealt with at local level, down to licks of paint for school doors, the replacement of school windows and tiles missing from school roofs.  As a result of this excessive centralisation, the Department has been more concerned with administration than with issues of educational policy.</P>
      <P>Education is a service which, of its nature, is delivered locally.  The school is an important part of the local community.  However, in many communities there are multiplicities of different schools reporting under different systems, not co-operating with each other. Children in these communities fall between a number of schools because our separate structures for pre-schools, primary schools, secondary schools and vocational schools do not knit together to provide a unified and integrated services for the communities they serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At two levels it is important that we set up a system or regional education boards.  First, we should devolve from <Col N="1171" /> the Department issues which should not be centralised in a national administration.  A Department cannot be efficient if it deals with nuts and bolts issues for 4,000 schools throughout the country.  The Department, whether in Marlborough Street in Dublin or in offices in Athlone, cannot know the details of the needs of individual communities.  It is in these communities these details can best be handled. Second, it is extremely important in terms of co-ordination, co-operation and rationalisation of facilities that scarce resources be used for the benefit of the whole community.  The services of a specialist teacher of a particular subject should be used by a number of schools.  A specialist laboratory should be shared between adjoining schools. We must develop co-operation.  This exists in some but not all communities. Too often adjacent schools compete with each other rather than co-operate.</P>
    <P>One of the most important references in the White Paper with regard to education boards was to the importance of an education plan.  Each regional board should draw up a plan for education in its area, which would identify and address local needs.  In a number of areas, we would nearly need a CAO system to get children into primary schools. Children must bypass primary schools at the end of their streets because these schools recruit children from suburbs and communities three, four or five miles away.  Schools turn away local children and are not accountable to anybody in their local communities.</P>
    <P>There is a need, given the overlap of school catchment areas, to ensure there are structured ways of achieving co-operation between schools under different managements which serve the same community.  This is not to take from the ethos or individuality of each school but to acknowledge that the community, which pays for education through the tax system, is entitled to ensure that educational resources are used to the maximum effect for its children.</P>
    <P>The White Paper deals with early <Col N="1172" /> school leaving.  This is of supreme importance, and co-operation between schools, under a board with a comprehensive plan, is absolutely essential.  I am a member of the National Economic and Social Forum, which is preparing a report on this issue and its links to long-term unemployment.  At the moment, if a school suspends a difficult child or if a child does not come back to school in September, there is no structure for tracking what has happened to him.  Yet, we know that youngsters who drop out of school at 13 or 14 years of age are likely to sign on the dole for the rest of their days once they become entitled to do so at 18 years.  Young people who leave school without qualifications, who drop out or are pushed out of school are at a high risk of becoming tomorrow's long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The school attendance system belongs to the Stone Age.  It operates in Dublin City and a number of other areas.  In some places, it is the responsibility of the Garda Síochána to enforce school attendance.  There is effectively no school attendance policy in areas of County Dublin, which have the greatest pockets of poverty.  In areas classified as county areas the Garda has too much to do with regard to crime and does not have the facilities or expertise required in the area of school attendance problems.  We have poor structures for addressing early school leaving and for tracking youngsters who drop out of school early.  The establishment of school boards and the possibility they offer of a co-ordinated and locally based approach will enable us to address this serious problem much more effectively.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised concerns about the accountability of education boards.  All parties with an interest in primary and post primary education &mdash; teachers, parents, school owners, elected representatives and local communities &mdash; will be represented on these boards.  None of them had a voice in the established statutory administrative structures.  The boards will be accountable to this House and through the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Committee of Public <Col N="1173" /> Accounts for value for money.  Each board will be required to take measures on proper planning, reporting, inspection and budgeting and will prepare a five year educational plan.  Boards will also prepare annual operating programmes and budgets, which will be approved by the Minister.  They will be obliged to make annual reports on their performance, which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As Accounting Officer, the director of each board will be subject to annual scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>It is time we moved on from the assumption, dating from the time of the establishment of the rudiments of the educational system in Ireland with the setting up of national schools in the 1840s, that a single Department can deliver everything at national level.  The proposal for boards, which emerged from a most democratic an unprecedental process of consultation on the White Paper, will lead to greater democracy, accountability, rationalisation and co-operation.  It will result in better value for money and, most importantly, better educational outcomes for young people.</P>

      <P>It has become a national pastime, particularly for politicians, to pay lip service to local government reform and to devolution of powers from central authority to the communities where they are best delivered and understood.  However, this has reached a new low with the motion before the House.  Almost every day on the Order of Business Opposition Deputies inquire about Government proposals for local government reform or devolution, yet in this motion the same party seeks to destroy a Government proposal which would bring about meaningful reform of the education system and allow for local input by parents, teachers and those who know how the service can best be delivered at a local level.  This should come as no great surprise because the motion is put down by the same party which, in one fell swoop in 1977, undermined the financing of <Col N="1174" /> local government.  We have not yet recovered from this and it is proving extremely difficult politically to do so.</P>
      <P>The motion implies that local communities, parents, teachers and public representatives are not the best people to decide how their local education system should be structured or delivered. In fact, we need more proposals such as the one from the Government &mdash; more services should be delivered, policed and implemented at local level than is the case at present.  The next such move should be in the Department of Justice. Many of its services which are currently delivered nationally could best be delivered at a local level.</P>
      <P>Before we look at implementing new structures we should take account of the present situation.  The Department of Education has a budget in excess of £2 billion; leaving out third level facilities, it runs over 4,000 schools at primary and secondary level; and it employs thousands of teachers and other support staff.  Its system is entirely bureaucratic and unsuitable to delivering an efficient, accountable service.  Every Deputy knows only too well the frustration of getting involved with the Department, whether about special education services, pupil teacher ratios, or primary or second level schools.  I have recently been in contact with the Department about necessary improvements in Inchigeela, Dromleigh and Aghanigh national schools.  One always receives vague replies to the effect that the matter is not in this year's order of priorities or is under consideration, but one knows what is taken into account when determining that.  The regional education boards would clean the window and allow some transparency about educational policy.  Local people would know what is necessary within a fixed budget and what services to prioritise. To date that does not happen and for that reason alone the boards are a welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said that people did not know who the members of their local health boards were.  Like <Col N="1175" /> the Deputy, I am a health board member and when an issue arises I have never found that the public has difficulty identifying who should be contacted and where best to articulate its views.  Compare that to trying to articulate one's views in the present education system, which is wholly unsatisfactory. If this Government had proposed to abolish the health boards and set up county tiers &mdash; which is the direct implication of the Fianna Fáil motion if applied to the health sector &mdash; the Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, would put down a Private Members' motion to attack it. The Government is proposing meaningful reform and the Opposition has felt obliged to find a spurious reason to oppose it.</P>
    <P>The composition of the regional education boards mirrors the structures already in place in the health services. Primary and secondary teachers and parents of primary and secondary pupils will be included, as will local public representatives, which lends the scheme the hallmark of true accountability.  Ministerial nominees will also be included and I welcome the decision to allow appointees from Gaeltachtaí on to regional boards for those areas.</P>
    <P>If there is one way in which the proposals are slightly disappointing it is in the relationship between the new boards and the vocational education committees.  This is a personal opinion because I am not a vocational education committee member and many colleagues on this side of the House would not share my view.  In the context of establishing regional education boards, we should consider whether vocational education committees have a meaningful role to play in the future.  In response to these changes vocational education committees have run an effective and vocal campaign to guard their territories.  Many Members do not have an open mind on this issue, having served on vocational education committees.  I am the first to acknowledge that the <Col N="1176" /> committees have provided a good service but they have become outdated and it is time to look afresh at all the issues.</P>
    <P>The proposed relationship between the new boards and the vocational education committees is similar to that which exists between the health boards and the voluntary hospitals.  Efforts are now being made to change that arrangement &mdash; in the future health boards will receive money from which they will fund those hospitals.  The current relationship was a mistake from the first day although questions of propriety and ownership had to be considered, as may also be the case with the vocational education committees.  We should clear the decks and establish true and meaningful regional education boards, subsume the vocational education committees into them and do away with the current structure.  There is no great validity in the argument that they should be maintained.</P>
    <P>Another area where similar issues arise is the debate about whether there should be a specific board to deal with Irish language education, encompassing Gaeltacht areas and Gaelscoileanna.  I am not convinced of that argument &mdash; such a board would only serve to pig-eon-hole and isolate the language rather than integrate it and cultivate a climate of bilingualism.  This has similarities with the vocational education committee debate.  Vocational education committees became stigmatised as the vocational and technical sector and some people took the attitude that their son or daugther would not be seen dead in the &ldquo;tech&rdquo;.  The danger of similarly stigmatising Irish is one reason that a board specifically dealing with Gaeltacht areas would not be a good idea.</P>
    <P>I also remain unconvinced for practical reasons.  Part of my constituency, around Ballyvourney and Ballymakeery, is a Gaeltacht area and at present it contains two excellent second level schools run by the vocational education committee.  Would a regional education board specifically for Gaeltacht areas or Gaelscoileanna have dealt with the problems of those schools over the last <Col N="1177" /> few years in as sympathetic and understanding a fashion as the vocational education committee has?  Tribute is due to the vocational education committee in that context.  The Gaelscoileanna will have problems in terms of the funding and pupil-teacher ratio advantages they have enjoyed.  The Minister has left us hanging on this issue because we are not sure what protections can be built in to facilitate those schools.</P>
    <P>I am convinced of the need for a special board.  The types of soft supports which have been missing, such as the area of text book production and so on, for the last 50 years from the Department of Education can be dealt with quite well under a regional board, rather than a board which is geographically far removed from the territories it administers.  I support the establishment of the boards because it is a step in the right direction.  It is democratic and involves parents, teachers, local communities and local public representatives.</P>

      <P>I hope to have the opportunity to respond to a number of the issues which have been raised during the course of this debate. In doing this, I wish to clarify a number of misunderstandings which Deputies on the Opposition benches appear to hold concerning the education boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> Some Members of this House appear not to understand fully and clearly the rationale behind the Education Bill, 1996.  Some profess not to see the necessity for the proposed education boards.  Other are blind to the significant opportunity presented by the establishment of the boards.  To all of them I say that education boards represent a most important opportunity for this House to endorse and build on the success of the education system and, in so doing, to put in place a new modernised structure which will be capable of leading the education system into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>During the debate I have been astonished and bemused to hear a number of Deputies accuse the Minister of failing to keep this House informed of the progress in developing the proposals for educational boards.  These accusations are completely without foundation.  The proposals represent the culmination of a long and painstaking process of consultation with all of the relevant interests &mdash; teachers, parents, school managements and many others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only has a long consultative process been undertaken with all concerned in formulating these proposals, but also this consultative process represents a new and historic departure in the formulation of Irish education policy.  Never before has such an extensive process of consultation been undertaken with the partners in education. Never before have all the partners been given so many opportunities, over such a long period, to make a significant input into the formulation of policy.  The Minister for Education has consulted the partners in regard to the present proposals in a way never even dreamt of under previous administrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is precisely because we have engaged in such a long and fruitful process of consultation that I know with certainty the proposals which the Minister for Education is now making have <Col N="1179" /> widespred support.  It is precisely because they have such widespread support that the proposals which the Minister is now making represent the only way forward in Irish education.  To review the full consultation process, which took over four years and represented the most extensive process of consultation ever undertaken in the education area, would take up all of the very short time available to me tonight.</P>
    <P>Having listened most carefully to the contributions of Members, I feel it is vital to reiterate the rationale behind the establishment of the education boards.  These boards have been portrayed by some ill-informed Opposition Deputies as a meaningless layer of bureaucracy &mdash; a waste of taxpayers' money at a time when there are so many other calls on the public purse.  I strongly reject such views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>On what grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The rationale behind the education boards is quite simple.  Education boards will devolve authority from the centre to the regions, and I thought we would all be in favour of devolution.  Education boards will bring the administration of education and the provision of support services closer to the people who use them, giving a real sense of ownership to all those who have rights and responsibilities in education.</P>
      <P>The boards will mean that the education service will respond more flexibly and more sensitively than ever before to the needs of local people.  Important decisions on education services will rest with the people most affected.  Education boards will mean that education resources will be used more efficiently and effectively than before.  The Department of Education will be able to focus its attention on the development of national education policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies have alleged that the establishment of the education boards will carry with them very substantial costs.  All sorts of quite <Col N="1180" /> extraordinary cost estimates have been plucked out of the air.  It is a priority of this Government to ensure the best possible educational service is available to all the children of Ireland.  We will not compromise on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The education system which we currently provide &mdash; one to which we can look with some considerable pride &mdash; costs money.  The Department of Education provides more than £2 billion every year for education.</P>
      <P>Some Opposition Deputies have alleged during this debate that the education boards will, in some way, compete with the vocational education committees.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I remind Deputies that all those concerned with the education system in Ireland have but one single aim &mdash; the welfare of students.  We are all on the same side, or at least we should be. I wonder if we are.  We are all working to the same end.  There is no question of competition between us.</P>
      <P>The education system cannot afford duplication.  We have neither the human nor the financial resources to support such duplication.  The proposals set out in the White Paper are clear and unambiguous in this regard.  They are open to only one interpretation.  I am mystified as to how any other interpretation is possible.</P>
      <P>Misgivings have been expressed by some Opposition Deputies over the geographical remit of the education boards as set out in the White Paper. Some Deputies have suggested that, if there is to be a regional structure it should be established along county lines.  There have been suggestions that any geographical remit larger than the county areas will result in the education boards being unable to manage effectively the needs of their regions.  I reject this argument completely and would like to take the opportunity to put the matter to rest for good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said here last week, the main criterion used to decide on the <Col N="1181" /> geographical remit of the education boards is how best to meet the education needs of local areas.  The aim is to strike a balance between, on the one hand, introducing realistic devolution, regional planning and co-ordination in the delivery of educational provision, while, on the other, avoiding excessive fragmentation of service delivery.  The merits of a county-based system of education boards were carefully analysed at a number of levels.  It quickly became clear that an intermediate education tier at county level could not operate either effectively or economically.</P>
    <P>The achievement of major educational change is a very difficult process in any society.  The degree of change now being proposed for education is very extensive.  Education touches closely on values, loyalties, allegiances and attachments.  It is understandable that people are very sensitive and concerned when significant educational change is on the agenda.</P>
    <P>There is a place at times of change for defending positions and setting down organisational aspirations.  I believe there is a greater priority for self-examination, self-criticism, innovation and creative thinking.  There has been a marked absence of innovative and creative thinking from the Opposition benches during this debate.</P>

      <P>A society which hopes to develop and improve the qualify of life of its citizens needs to plan for the future of its education system in a sophisticated and sustained way.  A society which is not prepared to plan intelligently and with courage to shape and change its educational system in line with new and emerging needs of its citizens and of society as a whole is doomed to decay.  It is, therefore, vital that we face the need for change with wisdom, vision, courage and commitment.  The responsibility is ours, in our generation, and should not be shirked. <Col N="1182" /> Undoubtedly the challenge is significant.  The opportunity is also great.  We should set our sights high so that we are worthy of those who went before us, worthy of the issues which face us and worthy of our current and future citizenry, whose interests we are called upon to serve.</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire freisin cén míniú atá ar an scéal go naithnítear an Ghaeltacht mar cheantar faoi leith ó thaobh reachtaíochta na tíre seo de.  Tá Roinn na Gaeltachta ann agus tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ann.  Aithnítear an Ghaeltacht mar cheantar agus mar limistéar náisiúnta ó thaobh na scéimeanna Leader de.  Ach nuair a thagann sé go dtí cúrsaí oideachais níl an tAire sásta fiú a aithint go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ann ar chor ar bith.  Mar sin creidim, bíodh na Boird ann nó ná bíodh, tá gá le structúr éigin le freastal ar riachtanais oideachais tré Ghaeilge sa tír seo.  Ach tá amhras an-mhór ann an bhfuil sé de láidreacht ag an Rialtas na Boird a chur ann mar is dóigh liom go dtuigeann siad anois gur dearmad iad.</P>

      <P>That is not a new issue for Ireland.  There have been proposals with the Department for some time and we have been talking about them since the early 1980s.  The White Paper on Education suggests that there should be ten educational boards throughout the 26 counties.  Much anger and bewilderment has been evident among those in education circles since the Minister first mooted her proposals concerning the regional boards.  There have been many objections on financial, administrative, educational and practical grounds.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear the comments of a Deputy from the Fine Gael Party regarding the position of the health boards.  If education was to follow developments on the health boards the same concerns may arise that we in County Clare, who are members of the Mid-Western Health Board, hold.  It is our view, for example, that, because of their numbers on the board, other counties have greater opportunity to voice their concerns rather than looking after the health concerns of County Clare.  I would, therefore, be delighted to consider any proposals the Fine Gael Deputy may have which offer alternatives, whether it be in regard to health or education.</P>
      <P>The cost of establishing the ten regional boards would be better spent on providing more funds for other areas within our education system.  The Minister of State said we should be prepared to spend our money on our young people; of course we should but we must make the distinction between spending money or administration and on services.  I would much prefer to see money spent on services, such as remedial teachers, psychological and other services to look after children with special needs, for example, the provision of speech therapists, the refurbishment of schools and a more effective school transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a genuine fear that, in <Col N="1185" /> setting up these regional boards, the unique focus on vocational education, which the vocational education committees provide, would be lost.  Indeed, the vocational education committees have responded well and quickly to the specific needs of their areas and have set up many courses which deal with the difficulties facing people in their local areas, such as long-term unemployment, the establishment of adult literacy courses, PLC courses and now the development of European programmes and initiatives.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Minister would like to see the role of public representatives in regard to education diminished.  This approach is abhorrent as it does not acknowledge the excellent work done by our public representatives through the years.  It would also divest education of its democratically elected and, therefore, directly accountable representation.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank my colleagues, Deputies Martin and Coughlan, for attending a meeting I arranged for members of County Clare vocational education committee some months ago. At that meeting the members took the opportunity to present their document compiled following a meeting in November 1992 and attended by 32 people representing primary and secondary managements, parents, the three teacher unions and the community services sector.  Much was discussed at the meeting and there was unanimous agreement on the necessity for a management tier, on the lines of the County Clare forum, in every county.</P>
    <P>The County Clare forum referred to a number of issues such as the curriculum and certification, the PLC courses, home school liaison, the need for a forum for parents and teachers to share ideas, the rationalisation of certain services, building maintenance, the establishment of a resource centre for educational aids, the co-ordination of adult education services and the achievement <Col N="1186" /> of equality.  It was generally felt that such a body should encompass both the primary and second level system.  Its use for representations in addition to co-ordination was also highlighted.</P>
    <P>The County Clare vocational education committee members took the opportunity to present the report to Deputies Martin and Coughlan who suggested that this approach be used as a model on how to proceed in regard to local education.  Rather than having education structures imposed from the top down, locally based concerns should form the basis for an education process similar to the County Clare forum.  It is an appropriate model in this regard.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I welcome the commitment of Deputy Martin. Fianna Fáil will oppose the Government's legislation to establish regional educational boards and will abolish any such boards established on return to office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>When we refer to the White Paper and the need for change, the inference is that those who object to any aspect of it are against any change. That is not correct, there is much that is good in the White Paper and there is much that is good in Irish education. There have been education systems for approximately 1,500 years at national, continental and global level, we must know a fair bit about the subject at this stage.</P>
      <P>The town which gives my native county its name, Cill Dara, was a famous seat of learning in the time of Naomh Brid, a millennium before Columbus discovered America.  Why must we then look for educational inspiration in the USA, Great Britain or anywhere else?  I am not saying that Irish education is perfect but it is not so badly flawed that a greater injection of resources and qualified personnel could not cure it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the original White Paper vocational committees were to be abolished and regional boards were to <Col N="1187" /> supervise all primary and post primary schools in a region.  Pressure from the Government's county councillor colleagues changed this to a promise to retain vocational education committees and the regional boards are to be called education boards.  We now have an extra tier imposed between the Department, education boards, vocational education committees and schools and someone says that this is to bring it nearer to the people.  This cannot be true but I suppose if one is making up a story, why not make up a good one? The Minister is getting used to it at this stage.</P>
    <P>I have a copy of the submission made by Kildare vocational education committee to the commission on school accommodation needs and I will quote a few instances of the vocational education committee relating to the distinctive needs of its own area.  It has helped the racing apprentice school of education.  A scheme has evolved with a capacity to turn out 30 trainees each year and it has a 100 per cent job placement record.  This is a great scheme in County Kildare &mdash; the home of the thoroughbred &mdash; and if one is doubtful about the qualifications of the trainees, ask Michael Kinane or any of the others involved in that successful scheme.</P>
    <P>It has also helped the Army Apprentice School in Naas and has supplied teachers to this prestigious establishment since 1956.  The Minister for Defence may feel that the future of the Army Apprentice School is in doubt, but there is no doubt as to the quality of the apprentices.  The annual national awards gained bear adequate testimony to its expertise.</P>
    <P>These two disciplines are at the heart of County Kildare's economy and part of what we are.  Vocational training has helped them to attain the pinnacle of perfection.  Will we forfeit this in a remote region as distinct from a caring county?  It is bad enough to buy a pig in <Col N="1188" /> a poke but at least one deserves to know the price even if one is not sure of the pig.</P>
    <P>Of all the measures in the White Paper, the first action to be taken was to set up a commission and have it report at the end of the month on the rationalisation of vocational education committees.  The commission is now meeting vocational education committees all over the country and for many of its members, it is a revelation &mdash;<i>On first looking into Chapman's Homer</i> revisited.  To say one is rationalising any body is an indication that they are not too rational as matters stand.  From my experience, Kildare vocational education committee is a rational unit.  It is big enough with its ten schools to be a distinct unit and close enough to be responsive to the needs of the area, to be in close touch with its staff and students and capable of meeting their demands.</P>
    <P>Every county will be different.  Even in Kildare there will be great variations between Confey in Leixlip, a huge new town which is almost a suburb of Dublin, and Castledermot in south Kildare, a rural area where the local vocational school has been successfully amalgamated with a girls' boarding school in Colaiste Lorcháin.  I cannot see a regional board comprising Wicklow, Bray and Kildare being as effective as the present county system.  The promised retention of the vocational education committees will be a politically placating exercise which will emasculate the vocational education committees and they will emerge as glorified trustees.</P>
    <P>While the Eastern Health Board improved some services in the area, it was found wanting and desperately slow to respond to a serious case of child abuse.  The time lapse from the initial alarm bells and helpful action is not acceptable.  Nobody can be sure that education regional boards will work, yet they are to be enforced on a national <Col N="1189" /> scale.  Is it fair to ask that one area should be first chosen as a pilot scheme to enable the Department of Education and the Minister to look before they leap.</P>
    <P>Mr. Eamon Stack from the Department of Education recently spoke to teachers about whole school inspectors, a new concept that is important but minor compared to the idea of education boards to replace a form of vocational education and training that has stood the test of time for over 60 years.  The whole school inspection will be first tried in an area on a pilot basis before it is imposed nationwide and the Department is prepared to modify or even change it if necessary.  Why is the same principle not being applied regarding the major change to education boards?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion and I compliment Deputy Martin for putting it down.</P>
      <P>This crazy and unnecessary proposal to put in place regional education boards is the first step in a crude attempt to abolish vocational education committees, proposed by Department officials and taken on board by a weak Minister.  We are tired hearing about bottom up schemes, subsidiarity and local democracy while it is being taken from under our feet.  The original proposal was to abolish vocational education committees but because of pressures applied it was decided to leave them alone for the time being and to abolish them at a later stage.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.</P>
      <P>I am a member of County Wexford vocational education committee.  On many occasions we had debates and votes on this issue.  The unanimous decision of its members, including many members of the Government parties, was to oppose this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a great believer, as I hope the Minister is, in the old adage &ldquo;If it works, <Col N="1190" /> don't fix it&rdquo;.  The vocational education committee system is working well.  It is working in County Wexford and I am sure it is representative of all vocational education committees.  We have increased our enrolment despite competition, which is a clear vote of confidence in a system that works.  We have good schools in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>An earlier speaker said it was time to change.  He was suggesting change for change's sake, which is nonsense.  We are putting an extra tier in place, which is the last thing we should consider, especially when we are not aware how much it will cost.  There is no reason to replace a system that works.  We are told by a person who has never been a member of a vocational education committee that it is outdated.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to bore Members with a list of services offered by County Wexford vocational education committee, on account of what has been said I must do so.  This vocational education committee provides ownership and management of vocational colleges; appointment of sub-committees for specific and specialist areas; vocational education training; adult, continuing and community education and literacy programmes; provision of religious education programmes; arts in education; operation of outdoor education centres; administration of third level grants and schemes; youth and sport programmes; leadership training; scholarship schemes; provision of a co-ordinator and programmes for local partnership; operation of an efficient school transport system; young travellers' education and training centre; networking of schools; community centre projects; health and safety projects; audits, remedial programmes and seminars; stock control; centralised purchasing; a teachers' substitute panel; attendance and absenteeism records; home school liaison; remedial guidance; psychological services; integrated provision of sports facilities; discipline; counselling <Col N="1191" /> programmes; payroll, superannuation and teacher exchange programmes.</P>
    <P>Is that a system that should be abolished or replaced?  I say no.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Martin for giving me at least two minutes of his time.  The White Paper plays down the contribution of the vocational education committees to education and wishes they had never been set up.  It makes unfounded statements which have no basis in fact, and then proceeds to build policies on unfounded assumptions.</P>
      <P>What are the facets about the vocational education committees' contribution to education and training young people?  Under the vocational education committees, the numbers of students in regional technical colleges and in the Dublin Institute of Technology grew from 11,500 in 1981 to 35,000 in 1993 and the number of full-time second level students grew from 85,000 in 1981 to 95,000 in 1993.  Post-leaving certificate courses were started by the vocational education committees and the number of students in such courses grew from 8,300 in 1981 to 18,700 in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational education committees are the byword for adult education. Their programme operates not only in schools but where the need arises: in people's homes, community halls, training workshops and prisons.  Wherever the need is identified, the vocational education committees are prepared.  For example, vocational training opportunity schemes were conceived and developed by the vocational education committees and given the go-ahead by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, and the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, in 1989.  I have heard of these and many other vocational education committee <Col N="1192" /> initiatives from other Deputies last night and this evening.</P>
    <P>In my county, the vocational education committee co-operates with local people and organisations.  In providing for educational needs, it co-operates with over 50 different local organisations and groups.  Apart from assistance to the different organisations and sports clubs, the vocational education committee co-operates with over 40 State, semi-State and private organisations.  The extent and depth of the vocational education committee programme and involvement at local level came as a surprise to the Minister's committee when it toured Ireland.  It was no surprise to the people up and down the country who rely on vocational education committees, because of the local knowledge of vocational education committees and the involvement of elected local representatives in them.  The Minister should not go ahead with this programme as the system we had is serving the country well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on our motion.  Many Deputies from all parties in the House have made valuable and worthwhile contributions.  To be specific for a moment, it is a pity that the Minister and, indeed, her Minister of State, Deputy Bernard Allen, did not avail of the opportunity to provide specific details of the proposals on regional education boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister deliberately sidestepped the issue of cost in her contribution to this debate.  The cost implication of the Minister's proposals are crucial to any consideration of them.  In this respect, it is worth examining the costs of the Northern Ireland equivalent.  There are five education and library boards in Northern Ireland.  The cost of one of these, the South-Eastern Education and Library Board for 1995 <Col N="1193" /> is worth analysing.  If one excludes the entire cost of teachers' pay, school meals, library service and student grants from these figures, the total 1995 expenditure for that board was £36 million. The White Paper on Education states that the proposed regional education boards will &ldquo;supply library and media services&rdquo;.  If the cost of this service was added, an additional £4.3 million would be required.  Therefore, the additional cost of the White Paper's proposals for regional education boards would be £40 million per board per annum based on the cost to the Northern Ireland service of its south-eastern board and the policy statements contained in the White Paper which details and outlines the type of services which these new regional education boards would be expected to provide.  We could even add to these figures the cost of renting or building offices for the administrative headquarters of the ten regional education boards.</P>
    <P>If the money is not available, the boards will not be in a position to provide the services which the Minister says they will offer to schools, parents, pupils and teachers.  If the boards will not provide these services, the entire process will have been a sham.  In other words, we want the name of being reformers but we are really not interested in meaningful reform and concrete reality.  That is why the word &ldquo;phased&rdquo; is used time and time again in the Minister's speeches.  Everything is to be phased in over five or ten years, that is, let us put it in legislation and let somebody else worry about it afterwards.</P>
    <P>I do not think those services will be provided by these boards in the short-term because of the cost implications. The Minister had an opportunity to give details about costings in this House but she refused to do so.  She also refused to do so in Question Time in this House.</P>
    <Col N="1194" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Department of Finance which refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance has refused to do so.  This most transparent Government, which preaches accountability and transparency until we are all nauseated, has failed to give basic figures on costings in the context of this debate, so she cannot cry or complain if we make some attempt to try to cost this particular proposal.  We will be left with ten administrative outposts of the Department of Education. It is worth nothing that the administrative element of the Minister's proposal alone will cost at least about £65 million.  That estimate is based, again, on the Northern Ireland equivalent of a headquarters administration, that is, the South-Eastern Education and Library Board, the annual bill for which is about £6.5 million.</P>
      <P>Clearly, therefore, the cost implications of these proposals cast doubt on whether they will ever be implemented. I wonder if the Department of Finance is prepared to publish the cost framework and analysis which it undertook on the White Paper costs in general so that we can have a more informed debate on the resources issue.  The Fianna Fáil Party has been quite clear and definitive about this.  If there are available resources in the education budget, they must be allocated and directed to the children in the schools in the first instance and to funding the provision of education in the schools in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was somewhat taken aback by the arrogance of the Minister's approach to this debate and speech of the Minister of State who endeavoured simply to rubbish the contributions of Members from my side of the House.  Deputy Creed, for example, argued that the vocational education committee system is outdated.  I respectfully suggest that it is not but that Deputy Creed's view of it is outdated.  He spoke about the tech <Col N="1195" /> and the schools.  The vocational education committees have actually been more radical than the Department of Education will ever be, because the VTOS scheme or the PLC revolution, the development of further education in which 20,000 students now participate, were led from the bottom up.  Such innovations were developed by the teachers, the vocational education committee and the staff on the ground, and the Department is only belatedly responding to that initiative so it is a little much to have Government representatives and Deputies attempting to undermine in their contributions the effective and innovative contribution which vocational education committees have made to the development of modern education.</P>
    <P>This side of the House acknowledges and recognises the need for co-ordination and co-operation in the provision <Col N="1196" /> of education at local level.  We have suggested a viable alternative way forward: the creation and establishment of fora of education in each county which could begin initially on a consultative basis, such as the example we illustrated in County Clare, which should be taken on a step to step approach.  County loyalties are extremely strong in this country. The notion of having two intermediate tiers is a nonsense which should not be entertained.  We have made a commitment, conscious of what it implies, that on return to office, we will abolish any regional education boards established and we will turn the clock back on this particular proposal.  It is not a runner as far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, it will not be a runner as far as any future Fianna Fáil administration is concerned and that day is not far away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise the question of the threatened industrial dispute by nurses in the health services.  I have said to the Minister for Health that Fianna Fáil wishes to see justice done to nurses because of the key role they play in our health services.  I have also said that the level of frustration among nurses is not to be underestimated.  I remain of that view and of the view that the aspirations of nurses in relation to pay and conditions can be met.  Meeting those aspirations would yield tangible and measurable improvements in health service delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that this evening the Government has announced that a framework has been agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I also acknowledge that the Minister met the Alliance of Nursing Unions this evening.  I hope it is a positive measure taken in a spirit of generosity by the Government and the <Col N="1199" /> Minister and that he will be successful in convincing his Labour colleague, the Minister for Finance, to deliver the financial requirements to resolve the dispute.</P>
    <P>Three specific issues need to be addressed if a resolution is to be found. There must be an examination of the retirement provisions for nurses and a rethink on the proposed entry pay for nurses and the pay phasing provisions in the deal.  There must also be an examination of the role of ward sisters and provisions for nurses who work in specific units.</P>
    <P>The failure to address the situation of ward sisters in the proposed deal was a clear weakness.  I hope the Minister will agree that ward sisters are effectively managers of what could be described as small enterprises and, in some instances, medium enterprises.  In a small surgical unit with 30 beds, a ward sister's responsibilities are vast.  In one month, for example, she would have to cope with 125 admissions, while every day there would be 40 attendees for dressings.  Answering telephones is a huge responsibility in any ward.  A ward sister I know has worked out that in a 24-hour period her unit would take as many as 196 telephone calls.  As well as those responsibilities, a ward sister manages, delegates and co-ordinates large numbers of staff each day, including nurses, hospital consultants and their large teams of doctors, operates all sorts of technology, interfaces with visitors and maintenance staff and deals with deliveries, ordering and social work.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the ballot result, I said to the Minister that it was not wise to make it appear that the Government was going over the heads of nurses to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It sent a wrong message to nurses and I am delighted the Minister has reversed that by meeting the alliance today.  Engaging in dialogue with nurses is very important and I hope it proves fruitful.  If not, the fallout will be immense.</P>
    <P>The threatened industrial action has <Col N="1200" /> major implications for the services delivered by health boards and hospitals because, for the first time in 16 years, we are facing a wholesale dispute by nurses.  In addition the immediate disruption of services, a strike by nurses will have major implications for the hospital waiting list initiative.  Already the number on the list is rising.  In a reply I received to a parliamentary question on 23 April, the Minister for Health said the waiting list for a range of surgical procedures stood at 28,004 in December 1995, the latest date for which figures were available.  He went on to make a comparison with 1993, when the waiting list stood at 40,130. However, in December 1994, the waiting list total stood at 23,835 so the number increased by over 4,000 to the end of December 1995.  This rise appears to be attributable in part at least to the limited industrial action so far by nurses, which has led to the cancellation of operations and other admissions.</P>
    <P>Nurses are dedicated to their work in hospitals.  They do not want to be involved in an industrail dispute with the Minister and are anxious to settle it. They have a strong case and if the three specific issues on which the recent deal was voted down by members of the nursing unions were resolved, the industrial dispute could be avoided.  I urge the Minister in that regard.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> I thank Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for giving me the opportunity to respond to the issues she raised on the industrial action being threatened by the nursing unions.  The Deputy will be aware the Government met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in recent days to consider the public service pay negotiations and the continued failure of a number of groups to reach agreement on restructuring under clause 2 (iii) (a) of the public service agreement on pay incorporated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> This meeting was held in the <Col N="1201" /> hope of reaching some agreement on a possible framework for the continuation and successful completion of a number of outstanding sets of discussions.</P>
      <P>In this context I met the nursing unions this morning and asked them to consider their position on the proposed new framework.  Given the sensitive nature of the discussions taking place with this and other groups it would be inappropriate to comment further on the nature or scope of the framework at this time.  The text of a joint statement from the Government and ICTU, issued this afternoon, is probably of interest to the House.  It reads:</P>
      <P>The Government and the ICTU agreed last week to work in partnership to meet the substantial changes in the public service and achieve the necessary restructuring in a positive and constructive way.  The two sides also agreed to hold further urgent discussions to find the means of resolving and bringing to finality the current problems including the teaching, nursing and CPSU areas within the parameters of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These discussions between the Government and ICTU have developed a framework in that context to allow: (1) direct discussions with the assistance, if relevant, of a facilitator; (2) independent adjudication of issues relevant to option A of clause 2 (iii) of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> and (3) in the light of the unprecedented changes which have to be dealt with in the public service in the years ahead, the bringing forward of the provision in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> for reviews of the evolution of public service pay and conditions relative to other sectors of the economy.  Provision will now be made for this review process in the period following on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and <Col N="1202" /> Work</i> given the reality of the scale of change required.</P>
    <P>Separate discussions will now take place with each relevant public service union group to examine how the framework can be applied in their case.  Discussions have taken place with the Civil and Public Service Union and a satisfactory arrangement to progress the outstanding issue within the framework has been identified.</P>
    <P>The statement continues:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health today met with the alliance of nursing unions. The Minister outlined the framework to the unions and asked them to consider working through the framework to resolve the concerns of nurses in a positive way.  Discussions are continuing with the teaching unions who are examining how this framework, or a similar framework, might enable outstanding issues for teachers to be brought to an acceptable conclusion.</P>
    <P>The House is now fully informed of the most recent position, not only on the nurses dispute but also on the other two current disputes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night's brutal mob killing of a suspected drug dealer by a vigilante group provides an imperative for the Government and the Garda to put in place measures which will respond effectively and relevantly to the noted growth of vigilantism, particularly anti-drug vigilantism.  People looking to such groups for assistance or protection in the face of a drugs crisis just change one tyranny for another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important there is no ambivalence on the State's part regarding this type of activity.  All democrats must unequivocally condemn people taking the law into their own hands.  Concerned communities need leadership from their elected representatives on <Col N="1203" /> this issue.  However, condemnation alone is not sufficient.  Such activities are born from a well known collapse of confidence in many communities which feel the authorities do not respond with any urgency or relevance to the criminality related to drugs which is destroying the fabric of their lives and those of their children.  Unfortunately, this type of uncivilised barbaric behaviour has taken hold in Northern Ireland. Such barbarism has been wrongly justified by paramilitaries in their claim that the RUC does not have the confidence of the community.</P>
    <P>Any ambivalence by the authorities in the face of such vigilantism is extremely dangerous.  The emergence of vigilante groups is a fact of life which demands a positive response from the Minister and the Garda.  The Government has shown a persistent failure to inject any real sense of urgency to the drugs crisis at community level.  Legislation alone is not sufficient; it is clear a change in policing is needed in areas most devastated by drugs.  These areas are well known to the Garda and yet community or preventative policing is still largely undeveloped and unfocused.</P>
    <P>The justice system needs to be turned around to meet the critical nature of the drugs problem in all our cities.  This includes the provision of treatment facilities to meet the needs of addicts; a person who seeks treatment for drug addiction should not be put on a waiting list.  It is reckless of the State, for example, to continue to allow bail to drug addicts when they have no visible means of supporting their habit, without an offer of treatment for their addiction.</P>
    <P>A real debate on how, and where, we police is required.  This is not possible at present because of the democratic deficit which means that the deployment of gardaí and resources are constantly deferred to the Garda Commissioner as an operational matter for which there is no accountability to Dáil Éireann.  Due to the BSE crisis up to 300 gardaí have been deployed to the Border areas, while 400 gardaí are permanently desk <Col N="1204" /> bound, doing clerical and administrative duties which could more probably be done by civilians.</P>
    <P>We must heed the warning signs of a breakdown in law and order represented by last night's murder by vigilantes.  This involves a major refocusing of resources towards specialist community policing.  At present, the number of gardaí allocated to community or preventative policing constitutes a mere token gesture, a genuflection towards any real response to the growing demands for community policing.  It is right and vital that the justice system and policing includes communities, but the authorities alone must bring people to justice.</P>
    <P>Spending on the Garda in 1996 will rise by £13 million, while spending on prisons has risen by 50 per cent in the past five years.  Yet, there is a chaotic prison service, reports on which are unpublishable.  The total spend on the security forces, Garda, prisons and courts, is £600 million a year; the figure has increased by almost £200 million in the past five years.  Given this massive amount of expenditure, citizens have a right to expect minimum levels of protection from the Garda and the authorities generally.</P>
    <P>Despite tinkering at the edges, the Government has failed to introduce any change to the law of bail or inject any confidence among citizens that the State can and will provide effective law and order.  Many contract killings, an issue raised in the House recently, are unsolved and this sends a dangerous signal that thieves falling out warrant no real investigation.</P>
    <P>Such a dangerous acquiescence or ambivalence is not acceptable.  Neither is silence from the Minister and other democrats on the repugnant attack by a 20 strong mob armed with baseball bats and iron bars on a person whom they suspected of being a drug dealer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record my abhorrence at what happened last <Col N="1205" /> night in Dublin.  I understand that last night's killing is being attributed to so-called anti-drug vigilantes.  If that is the case &mdash; we will have to await the outcome of a Garda investigation before we know for certain &mdash; we must be clear in stating that no person or group has the right &ldquo;as they would see it&rdquo; to take the law into their own hands.  Mob violence can never be justified.  Without exception, everyone is entitled to the full protection of the law.  The rule of law and the concept of due process are fundamental principles of a democratic society.  We depart from these principles at our peril.  I can vouch for that from personal experience.</P>
      <P>The death of Joseph Dywer is now the subject of a Garda investigation.  I know that the gardaí are making every effort to bring the perpetrators to justice and the House will appreciate if I make no further comment on this point.</P>
      <P>Many communities throughout the country are concerned about the drugs problem and in some areas in Dublin the problem is acute.  The Government recognises the seriousness of the problem and has developed a response on the basis that the drugs problem is multi-faceted, requiring a response from a number of Departments and agencies. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that last year the Government approved a series of organisational financial, legislative and operational measures to deal with the drugs problem.  A further series of measures concerning education, prevention and treatment issues were approved by the Government in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital, in these efforts to deal with the drugs problem, that we harness the goodwill, energy and enthusiasm of local communities in their desire to be involved.  There must be a partnership between the agencies of the State and the local community.  In the north inner city, for instance, the Garda and the Department of Justice, together with other Departments and State agencies, are involved with the local community <Col N="1206" /> in the Inter-Agency Drugs Project.  This project is proposing to develop a range of immediate, short-term and long-term measures necessary to deal with the problem in the north inner city.  The gardaí are also participating in community initiatives on treatment services in the south inner city and Kilbarrack areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department is funding a number of youth diversion projects run by the Garda.  The Probation and Welfare Service has set up a number of community-based projects &mdash; hostels, workshops and day centres &mdash; to work with offenders in addressing their drug problems.  These are just a few examples of the Department of Justice and the Garda working with local communities in specifically tackling the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is committed to the development and expansion of community based initiatives and recognises the vital and appropriate part that the community can play within the law. Last night's events will not deflect us from that objective.  I repeat that mob violence is anathema to the concept of democracy and only democratic methods of the kind I outlined can and must prevail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point at issue in this matter is why the Government has placed a contract for the supply of an executive jet with a British company for the duration of the EU Presidency when an Irish company has tendered and is suitable and cost effective.  The EU Presidency is the attraction holding the Government together &mdash; the political super glue for the three parties who have more interest in perks than the welfare of Irish companies.  Every effort should be made to ensure that Irish companies derive maximum benefit and exposure from the prestigious EU Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is a direct insult to Wester Aviation to have been treated in such a <Col N="1207" /> cavalier fashion, it also illustrates grave insensitivity to the needs of Irish companies that the Government chooses to be ferried around Europe under the flag of another State while jobs which could be created in an Irish company based at Shannon are spurned.  Wester fears a threat to its existing business by this signal from Government.  Prospective customers will wonder what is the problem. I have taken the trouble to check with some of its customers and they have no complaints.  However, the Minister must also clarify the issue.</P>
    <P>It is strange that tenders were sought as the service is only to be used on an &ldquo;if and as required&rdquo; basis.  The Government could have shopped around and made use of available services as the UK company will do.</P>
    <P>The second point at issue relates to the specification which accompanied the Department of Defence tender documents.  Item 7 required full details of the proposed crews and item 12 sought the date when the aircraft would be in the tenderer's possession.  My information is that the successful UK company, Hunting Aviation, does not own or operate any executive jets.  How will it comply with these conditions?  It will have to sublease whatever aircraft may be available and whatever crew can be obtained.</P>
    <P>During the last Irish EU Presidency a US jet was chartered and crewed by the Air Corps.  Other States when leasing jets for Government work get over the difficulty posed by EU competition laws by inserting a security clause which effectively subjects crew members to a state security check and, generally, favours their own nationals.  Was it too much to ask that the Government do likewise?  Does the national interest mean anything anymore?</P>
    <P>On the specifications, the main question is whether changes were made when the process of tendering was completed.  Were concessions made to a UK company which were not granted to Wester?  I hope the Minister will clarify <Col N="1208" /> the matter and withdraw any perceived slight on Wester.</P>
    <P>The third point at issue is the reasons offered for rejecting Wester.  First, it was indicated that its executive jet was unsuitable as it was restricted at some airports from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. and, second, it was stated that no back-up was available.  Neither requirement was mentioned in the tender specifications nor raised in discussions with Wester. Neither posed an insurmountable difficulty and if other contract conditions could be breached to accommodate a UK company, Wester should have been given the same opportunity.  One wonders about the likelihood of flights during the restricted hours and on the rare occasions they might have occurred, Wester could have provided a suitable jet.  The fact that back-up was available was known to the Department.</P>
    <P>When these two reasons for awarding the contract outside the State began to run aground, a new one surfaced &mdash; that the contract was awarded to the company which could provide the best value for money.  I have established that the cost differential in favour of Wester, as opposed to a major UK company, for a flight to Heathrow, comparing like with like, is approximately 60 per cent &mdash; £3,100 for Wester as against £8,000 for the UK company.  This arises mainly because of extra costs due to positioning aircraft from a UK base.</P>
    <P>Would the leader of any other EU state use an Irish registered jet to fly his Ministers around Europe?  Is it too late in this case for the Government to support the Irish company?  The Minister should examine the matter thoroughly and ensure this does not recur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify this matter. The main obligation on any Presidency is to ensure an efficient and effective approach to the discharge of the business of the European Union.  The issues which will be priorities for the European Union and for Ireland during our <Col N="1209" /> Presidency are set out in the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  Dealing with these issues will necessitate the attendance of Government Ministers at a range of meetings in various countries during the course of the Presidency.  In this context, it is expected that there will be a substantial increase in the level of air transport to be undertaken by Ministers this year.</P>
      <P>In 1990, when Ireland last held the Presidency of the EU, the Air Corps operated three aircraft for ministerial air transport.  These aircraft were a HS 125, a Beechcraft and a leased Gulfstream III with transatlantic capabilities. Following the purchase of the Gulfstream IV aircraft, the HS 125 was disposed of and the Gulfstream III was returned to its owners.  Since then, the Air Corps has provided the ministerial air transport service using the Gulfstream IV and the Beechcraft.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the experience of the EU Presidency in 1990 and the expansion of the Union since then, it is clear that these aircraft will not be able to meet all the ministerial air transport demands which will arise in the build up to, during and immediately following the period of the Presidency.  Having considered a range of options, including the possible lease of an aircraft to be flown by the Air Corps, it was decided that the use of an air taxi service would be the most suitable way of meeting all additional requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tender competition was held by the Department of Defence in accordance with EU competition regulations for the provision of an air taxi service capable of carrying up to eight people to all major cities within the European Union. The competition was advertised in the European Journal in February 1996 with a closing date for the receipt of tenders of 11 April 1996.  In accordance with EU requirements, the award criteria were set out as being the most economically advantageous offer in terms of price, quality of service offered <Col N="1210" /> and ability to meet the specification.  A total of 18 sets of tender documents were issued to interested parties by the Department of Defence and seven tenders were received.  Does the Deputy seriously suggest that we should not or must not put such a service out to tender?  His expression that we should have &ldquo;shopped around&rdquo; smacks of a typical Fianna Fáil attitude to something like this.  Definite procedures are in place which must be complied with and followed.  That is what occurred in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenders were fully evaluated on financial and technical grounds by the Department of Defence. The Deputy referred to value for money which was the sole criterion which governed the decision to put this service out to tender.  This evaluation involved consultation with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Corps.  Following the evaluation, the contract was awarded on the basis of the award criteria to which I have already referred.  It is not the practice to disclose details of any particular tender received.  The overall cost of the air taxi service will be dependent on the number of flying hours involved.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the use of Air Corps aircraft for the transport of Ministers have been set down by successive Governments.  The use of Air Corps aircraft for ministerial transport takes into account many factors such as the priority of the Ministers' engagements, the demands of Ministers' schedules and the availability and suitability of other travel arrangements.  These factors will also be taken into account when a request for use of the air taxi service by the Ministers is received.  The air taxi service will mainly be used when the Gulfstream IV and the Beechcraft are already in use or when they cannot fulfil the requirements of a particular mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> The subject of the air taxi service was raised during consideration of the 1996 Defence Estimates at yesterday's meeting of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  On behalf of the Minister for Defence I will take this opportunity to correct certain erroneous reporting of his reply to a question raised by a member of the Committee. Specifically, when dealing with the question as to whether consideration was given to leasing an aircraft to be operated by the Air Corps, the Minister indicated that this had been considered and that the cost of this option could be some 30 per cent dearer than the air taxi option.  It has been reported that the Minister made a statement regarding the relative cost of tenders received for the provision of the air taxi service.  This is not the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> There are considerable demands and pressures placed on any Government dealing with the Presidency of the EU. I am confident that the provision of an air taxi service will prove a valuable and most cost-effective asset in assisting Ministers to deal with the many tasks which will arise during what we hope will be a very successful Presidency from Ireland's point of view.</P>

      <P>I have recently received a copy of the Garda evaluation report on the pilot CCTV scheme which has been operating in the Temple Bar area of Dublin since 26 October 1995.  The report is a detailed review of all aspects of the system and of its effectiveness during its initial period of operation.  It concludes that, in the appropriate locations and under correct conditions, urban CCTV systems can deliver benefits.  Certainly CCTV has had a beneficial effect on crime prevention and detection in the Temple Bar area and has led to a number of arrests arising from incidents recorded by the cameras.</P>
      <P>Having considered the evaluation report I am satisfied that further CCTV systems will be of benefit to the Garda Síochána in combating crime.  The installation of future systems will have to be considered on a priority basis and the O'Connell Street area of Dublin needs to be considered as a first priority. I have asked that a number of other areas, including Finglas, be examined also to establish the feasibility of installing CCTV systems in these areas as an aid to policing.</P>
      <P>Before any such schemes can receive public funding they will be subject to specific technical and procedural standards set by the Garda and will be subject to open tendering procedures.  The Temple Bar scheme cost in the region of £120,000 and was funded jointly by the Department of Justice and Temple Bar Properties.</P>

It is anticipated that the scheme of performance development and review will result in an increase in efficiency and effectiveness in the Force and an improvement in the quality of service provided by the Force to the general public.</P>
    <P>The scheme was implemented for commissioner ranks initially and is being introduced for other ranks in order.  The scheme is currently in operation for all ranks from Deputy Commissioner down to Inspector, inclusive. Performance development and review for the garda and sergeant ranks is at present the subject of discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council.  The proceedings of the council are confidential and, consequently, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>

      <P>One of my priorities as Minister for Justice is to ensure that adequate and suitable accommodation is provided for the Garda Síochána throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A very considerable investment has been made in improving Garda accommodation in recent years.  Since 1992 over £24 million has been spent between maintenance and new works.  In the two years 1995-1996 in which I have been involved as Minister in the provision of money for the Garda building programme some £17 million has been allocated.  This year alone there is an allocation of nearly £9 million.  This is an indication of my commitment to eliminating accommodation problems throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The drug-free unit which commenced operation at the training unit recently is, in itself, a radical development which will need evaluation over time to properly assess its effectiveness.  Early indications are very positive and suggest that we are on the right track.  I intend to consult the management of the other institutions, including Cork Prison, with a view to the possible extension of the model where appropriate throughout the prison system.</P>
      <P>While I have not excluded the option of opening a drug-free unit at Cork Prison, I have already implemented a number of other measures at the prison.  To date, these measures have been mainly focused on curbing the supply of illegal drugs to inmates and have proved particularly effective.  I am informed by the management of the prison that while there are some drug related incidents from time to time the overall level of drug abuse within the institution is now negligible.</P>
      <P>My overall aim is to achieve effective drug-free status, or at least to get as close as possible to that situation, throughout all of the institutions under my jurisdiction.  The utilisation of drug-free units is but one of the strategies I am employing to this end.</P>

      <P>I received the Garda Commissioner's most recent report on the <i>Corporate Strategy Policy Document 1993-1997</i> in February this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note the commissioner's observations that there have been many positive developments and successes during this period.  In particular, the commissioner notes that developments such as the establishment of the Garda National Bureau of Fraud <Col N="986" /> Investigation and the National Drugs Unit should be of immense value in tackling these areas of crime and I fully support his views in this regard.  In addition, I welcome his observations on the introduction of modern technology to assist in the investigation of crime such as the acquisition of an automated fingerprints identification system and the provision of a closed circuit TV system in the Temple Bar area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The commissioner has expressed concern about the lack of progress in certain areas of the plan such as civilianisation, the mileage ceiling of the Garda fleet and the standard of official accommodation.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 700 civilians employed in the Force.  Further civilianisation has been slowed down because of restrictions on increasing staff numbers in the Civil Service.  There has been a significant increase in expenditure over the period of the plan to date on the purchase of vehicles for the Garda fleet and on improving the standard of Garda accommodation.</P>
    <P>On the issue of Garda accommodation, a very considerable investment has been made in carrying out improvements in recent years.  In the two years 1995-96 in which I had an involvement as Minister in the provision of money for the Garda building programme some £17 million has been allocated. This year alone there is an allocation of nearly £9 million.  This is an indication of my commitment to eliminating accommodation problems throughout the country.  I look forward to further progress on the targets set in the corporate strategy policy document during its remaining lifespan.</P>

      <P>While I share the Deputy's concern about crimes of violence against women and children, I have no plans at present to bring forward legislative proposals for minimum sentences of imprisonment in relation to such offences.</P>
      <P>The law already provides for severe penalties in relation to the offences concerned.  For instance life sentences may be imposed on persons convicted of wounding with intent to maim, rape or aggravated sexual assault.  Where it appears that an unduly lenient sentence is imposed, there is provision under section 2 of the 1993 Criminal Justice Act for the Director of Public Prosecutions to make an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal for a review of the sentence.  Particulars of such applications are given in my reply to Question No. 40 on today's Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Whether there should be greater provision for minimum sentences is an issue which ought to be considered in the wider context of sentencing policy as a whole rather than in relation to a particular category of offences.  In this regard the Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission is currently preparing a report on sentencing and it is likely that minimum sentences will be among the issues addressed in that report.  It would be better to defer consideration of the issue until the Law Reform Commission's recommendations are available.</P>
      <P>Without wishing to prejudge what the Law Reform Commission may recommend I would inform the Deputy that the weight of legal opinion has always been very much against minimum sentences.</P>

      <P>Details of investment-based naturalisation applications in the period prior to 1992 are not available as no arrangements were in place at that time which would distinguish these type applications from non-investment applications.</P>
      <P>In 1992, 20 persons were naturalised on foot of their investments in the State, in 1993 the number was 14 and in 1994, 17.  In 1995, the number was 16. However, ten of those were cases which had been approved in early 1994 before the then Government decided that all investment-based applications should be assessed by an Interdepartmental Advisory Group operating within terms of reference.  The other six cases in 1995 were subject to those procedures and following recommendations by the advisory group, the investors in question were naturalised by me.  To date in 1996, four persons have been naturalised on foot of their investments in the State, and their applications were also processed in accordance with the advisory group, etc., procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has never been the practice to identify companies in receipt of naturalisation-based investment and neither has <Col N="990" /> it been the practice to disclose the precise amount invested by the naturalised applicants.</P>
    <P>I am, however, prepared to say that in the years 1992 to 1994, amounts ranging from £500,000 upwards were invested by naturalisation applicants.  Since late 1994, when the new procedures referred to above for assessing these cases came into force, the minimum investment required is £1 million.  All applications approved by me have invested at least this amount.  As regards the areas of industry where investments have been made, these include shipping, forestry, mining, medical research, engineering, timber processing, food processing, computer software, electronics, medical equipment and so on.</P>

      <P>On <Col N="992" /> 11 April 1995 the Government approved the establishment of a new Garda National Bureau of Fraud Investigation as recommended by the report of the Government Advisory Committee on Fraud.  The bureau replaced the old Fraud Squad and its functions are to investigate cases of fraud which (i) involve large sums of money or (ii) are complex in law or fact or (iii) are of significant public concern.</P>
      <P>A chief superintendent was appointed on 25 April 1995 to head the new Fraud Bureau.  The current strength, all ranks, of the bureau is 47.  In addition there are five members attached to the Cork Fraud Squad, under the supervision of the detective superintendent in Cork city division.</P>
      <P>A professional accountant was recently appointed, in line with the recommendations of the report of the advisory committee, to augment the expertise of the Fraud Bureau.  The question of appointing further civilian accountants is the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>New accommodation located at the DMA Headquarters in Harcourt Square was provided and officially opened on 26 April 1996.  Funding has been made available to provide bureau with the appropriate information technology and the latest data extraction analytical equipment has just been introduced to assist in the investigation and detection of fraud.</P>
      <P>In addition, proposals to reform the law on fraud are currently being addressed and, if implemented, will result in a fundamental reform of the law in this area.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the resources currently available to the Garda National Bureau of Fraud investigation are adequate to meet their present requirements.  Their needs will, of course, be monitored on an ongoing basis and the question of providing additional resources will be addressed as required.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="994" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 46, 67, 70 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>Work has been going on for some time now in my Department on the preparation of legislation to amend the law on criminal insanity.  The legislation raised complex issues which have required careful consideration but the work is now virtually complete and I will publish a Bill on the matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill will take account of the relevant recommendations of the Henchy Committee and of the decision in the case of Doyle <i>v.</i> Wicklow County Council and it will set out a definition of insanity for the purposes of the criminal law.</P>
      <P>As regards the amendment of prior statutes, I do not understand the reference to the Criminal Justice Act, 1924 in Deputy Flood's question &mdash; I can find no such statue &mdash; but the other statues mentioned in his and Deputy O'Donoghue's questions will be amended or repealed as necessary, as well as any other existing Acts affected by the new legislation.  The Bill will also deal with such issues as fitness to plead, diminished responsibility and the procedures governing the detention and release of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity.</P>
      <P>As for the balance of Deputy O'Donoghue's question the information requested in the first two sentences could only be compiled in the Central and Circuit Criminal Courts by an examination of individual files relating to indictable criminal offences since 1938 &mdash; many of the files dated before 1970 are now part of the National Archives.  The information requested in regard to periods of detention is not available from 1 January 1938. However, statistics received from the Central Mental Hospital indicate that a total of 436 patients were admitted to the hospital under guilty but insane criteria between 1850 and 1995.</P>
      <P>The overall mean length of stay available in 408 cases was 12.1 years, including those who died in custody and those currently detained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> The offence type recorded in 425 cases shows 230 involved homicide and 121 were assault.</P>

      <P>Approximately 6,400 were committed on sentence in 1995.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out in mid-1995 indicated that approximately 5 per cent of offenders in custody at that time were serving sentences for &ldquo;drug offences&rdquo; such as the possession or importation of controlled drugs.  A further 25 per cent, however, were serving sentences for offences which were thought to be related to the offender's drug addiction e.g. robberies or burglaries to finance the purchase of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> Individual prisoners' medical files are confidential in the context of the doctor/patient relationship and it is not possible, therefore, to give the proportion of offenders who received specific treatment for drug-related problems.</P>
    <P>All prisoners, however, including those who are suffering from drug addiction, have daily access to the prison medical officer who may arrange for appropriate treatment in each case, either within the institution or as required at outside hospitals.  There are a range of services in place for drug addicted prisoners including a comprehensive education programme and a high degree of involvement with community-based agencies active in this field, who visit the prisons on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Further developments include the commissioning, in the near future, at Mountjoy prison's health care unit of a self-contained integrated treatment facility for prisoners suffering from drug addiction.  This facility which will operate on a strictly voluntary basis will provide a humane detoxification programme backed up by a course of therapy specially designed to enable prisoners to come to terms with their addiction and to provide them with the means to become, and more importantly, to stay, drug-free both during their remaining time in prison and following release into the community.</P>
    <P>The facility will operate to the highest medical standards and will draw on the experience and expertise of those with a proven track record in dealing with drug abuse in the community.  The staffing of the unit will comprise of medical, GP, psychiatric, pharmacy and nursing services.  A comprehensive urine testing service will also be provided.  The treatment facility will also provide the setting for the delivery of methadone maintenance programmes to those prisoners assessed as suitable, subject to medical and other criteria such as sentence length.  Other recent positive developments in this area include the opening, at the training unit, of the State's <Col N="997" /> first custodial drug-free unit where all inmates have formally committed themselves to a drug-free existence &mdash; this aspect is closely monitored by means of regular and random urine testing.</P>
    <P>In addition, committals to Mountjoy prison found to be suffering from drug addiction are now able to avail of a detoxification programme of up to 14 days duration &mdash; subject to medical assessment.  This treatment approach is in line with medical developments in this field in the community.</P>

The Deputy may be assured, however, that gangs referred to are being targeted by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>On a general note, I should record that the gardaí have made a number of significant seizures of heroin in recent months and a number of persons are awaiting trial as a result.  Incidentally, the number of persons charged in relation to drugs offences involving heroin in 1994 &mdash; the last year for which figures are available &mdash; was more than the combined totals for the two previous years.  In 1994, 230 persons were charged in relation to offences involving heroin while the figures for 1992 and 1993 were 91 and 81 respectively.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>Following the robbery at the Brink's-Allied depot in January 1995, gardaí evaluated the escourt duty role they provide and various changes were introduced as a result.  For security reasons it would not be possible for me to detail such changes.</P>
      <P>I also requested officials in my Department to carry out a review of the issues involved in the possible statutory regulation of the private security industry.  I have asked for a report as to whether regulation might be reasonably expected to reduce the possibility of further such robberies at commercial premises and, in general, result in an improved service to the public.</P>
      <P>This review is nearing completion and includes an examination of the position regarding the regulation of the security industry in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that the security industry covers a large area of commercial activity, i.e. providing security for the storage and transit of cash; commercial security; the supply and installation of intruder-fire alarms; sales of other security equipment; the provision of a 24 hour monitoring and answering service for alarm-call and emergency call-out facilities; providing security for individuals and their homes; private investigations.  The difficulties in regulating such a wide range of activity will be various.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Government approved a series of measures on 19 July 1995 to improve law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem and related matters.  One of the measures required that a joint review be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda authorities of certain recommendations of the Law Reform Commission as regards co-operation between the two bodies which were contained in their report on the Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime, 1991.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the Law Reform Commission's report were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  `That the existing tax laws should be enforced with vigour against drug dealers, handlers of stolen goods, or others obtaining a living from crime.  The power given in various Finance Acts particularly in sections 18 and 19 of the Finance Act, <Col N="1000" /> 1983 (which extends Revenue powers to the chargeability of profits or gains arising from unlawful sources or activities) should be employed as extensively as possible', and</P>
    <P>(ii)  `there should be greater mutual transfer of information between Revenue and the gardaí to assist the gardaí in confiscating the proceeds of crime, and to assist Revenue in recovering arrears of tax from the criminals concerned or to penalise them for non compliance with the Revenue's lawful requirements'.</P>
    <P>The review has now been concluded and a report will be submitted to Government shortly.  The Deputies will appreciate I can make no further comment pending the Government's consideration of the report.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare may also have a role to play in this matter and, I understand, are considering the scope for action open to them.  That Department is already participating in consultations taking place under the auspices of the National Drug Co-ordinating Committee.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to comment publicly on individual applications for refugee status having regard to the fact that applications by their nature are made in confidence, with an expectation by applicants that such confidence will be preserved.</P>
      <P>However, in this instance, due to the fact that the individuals in question have already revealed certain details in the media, I can confirm some aspects of their case.  They arrived in Galway on 12 April 1996 and applied for political asylum.  They had, however, already entered the State on 2 April 1996, having travelled here from the United Kingdom where they had arrived on 23 March 1996 and where they had been granted visitors' conditions.  They applied on that first visit for political asylum at my Department, using names and nationalities different to those published.  They were informed by officials of my Department that their application for political asylum would not be processed in this country in line with the internationally accepted practice that asylum seekers should apply in the first safe country reached and that they had the opportunity to make such an application in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were refused leave to land in this State on 3 April 1996 as they were not in possession of valid Irish visas. Prior to taking this action, the United Kingdom authorities had been consulted and had agreed to accept both individuals back and to process their applications for political asylum.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had also been contacted and <Col N="1002" /> agreed that this was the appropriate course.  They returned to the United Kingdom on 3 April 1996 at a cost of £208 to the State.</P>
    <P>The present whereabouts of the two individuals is unknown and the matter has been referred to the Garda authorities for their attention.</P>
    <P>The publicity accorded to the two men in this case highlights the need for great caution on the part of the media and of agencies dealing with asylum seekers.  The level of attention accorded to these two could, in the case of genuine fugitives from prosecution, run the risk of endangering family or other connections in the home countries.  I might add that I understand that the publicity in this case was sought by the individuals concerned against the advice of the local Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Bill, 1995, which is before the Seanad at the moment, having passed all Stages in this House, contains provisions to protect the identity of asylum seekers.  Pending the enactment of these provisions into law, there is, I believe, merit in encouraging persons who may be disposed to make public comment to voluntarily observe the principles underlying these identity protection provisions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 55 and 85 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All crimes are fully investigated by the Garda and every possible effort is made to bring the perpetrators to justice.  As regards crimes committed by criminal gangs in particular, I know that there is public concern about the number of murders which have been attributed to such gangs by the media.  In <Col N="1004" /> this regard, I can assure you that the Garda allocate optimum resources to the investigation of all murders.  The primary task, of course, is to identify those responsible and to assemble evidence to support the institution of legal proceedings.  In addition, special attention is also directed to the motivation involved.</P>
    <P>Crimes of this nature are investigated by divisional investigation teams, the membership of which includes detective gardaí who have been trained in the investigation of serious crime.  The gardaí involved in these investigations know the local community and they work in close proximity to sources of intelligence.  The divisional investigation teams are assisted by gardaí from the Garda Technical Bureau who provide specialised services such as ballistics, photography and fingerprints.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing assistance to the divisional units, the Serious Crime Squad at the Central Detective Unit has the task of gathering intelligence and information on all serious crime.  Every effort is made in the examination and collation of this material to establish if the crimes are linked in any way.  This includes, in the case of murder, trying to establish if there is a common perpetrator for two or more offences.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that maximum resources are deployed to solve all murder cases including the identification of possible so-called contract killers.  A focus of activity of many criminal gangs is, of course, the drugs trade, and I have made the fight against drugs a matter of the highest priority for both my Department and the Garda. Last year, I obtained the approval of Government for a series of organisational, financial, legislative and operational measures to deal with the drugs problem.  A number of these measures have been implemented and others are in the process of being implemented.  In particular, the Garda National Drugs Unit has been established and this unit is currently engaged in tackling the menace posed by drug trafficking gangs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> It is also important to target the proceeds of crime.  Last year, I made a commencement order that brought sections 32 and 57 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, into operation.  These sections require banks and other financial bodies to carry out identification checks to prevent money laundering and to report to the Garda Síochána where they suspect that laundering is taking place relation to their business.  They supplement other provisions of the Act, in particular, the money laundering offence and the power to confiscate criminal proceeds and to obtain restraint orders to seize and freeze suspected criminal assets which came into force on 14 November 1994.</P>

    <P>Figures for appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal for years ending 31 July 1994 and 31 July 1995 are being compiled at present.  When the figures become available I will forward them to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>All appeals are handled on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions by the Chief State Solicitor's Office. Appeals from District Court orders are heard in the Circuit Court and a solicitor from the Chief State Solicitor's office represents the DPP in court.  Barristers instructed by the Chief State Solicitor's office represent the DPP in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The decision to grant or refuse an appeal is a matter for the courts which are subject only to the Constitution and the law independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</P>

      <P>Mountjoy prison currently has a capacity of 556 male and 40 female prisoners.  It constantly operates at maximum capacity and this is exceeded from time to time.  The prisoner population there has gone as high as 643.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the provision of additional prison places is as I announced at the end of January last.  I am proceeding with planning and construction works for the provision of the 278 additional places I promised earlier this year.  Already, 33 additional places were brought into use at St. Patrick's Institution in February and a further 38 places, which were out of use arising from extensive fire damage at the health care unit, Mountjoy, in December 1995, will be ready for re-occupation in the near future following major repair and fire safety works at the Unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Construction works for the conversion of the military detention unit at the Curragh to a civil prison to accommodates 68 offenders, which is a somewhat higher figure than I announced in January, were commenced within the past week and are due for completion in the autumn of this year.  Works for the construction of a prison unit at Castlerea to <Col N="1009" /> accommodate 25 offenders have commenced and these places are expected to come on stream around August-September this year.</P>
    <P>At Portlaoise prison, a series of works necessary for the recovery of up to 80 cell spaces now vacant due to operational requirements or used to accommodate a range of necessary offender facilities have been commenced and are due for completion within the current year.</P>
    <P>In the slightly longer term, I am pushing forward with plans for the provision of a replacement for the closed down and near-derelict D-Wing at Limerick prison.  The new wing will accommodate 55 offenders.  Construction is planned to commence towards the end of this year and to be completed in 1997.</P>
    <P>I am also progressing works for the planning and design of the new women's prison at Cowley Place beside Mountjoy prison to accommodate 60 offenders and for the main prison development at Castlerea for male offenders.</P>
    <P>All of these developments will help to alleviate the situation in Mountjoy and, indeed, the other institutions under my jurisdiction.</P>

On foot of the undertakings referred to in Question No. 58, I informed the relatives of the victims &mdash; as well as Deputy Harney and other Members of this House &mdash; by way of letters dated 29 February 1996 that the Garda authorities were satisfied from their assessment of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast of May 1995 that no new evidence or witness had been identified which would provide a basis for further Garda investigation.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that the Garda investigation file on the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings will continue to remain open and that any new leads will be actively pursued.</P>

Development work is also being undertaken in relation to digital mapping, training, strategic management and the installation in the registries of modern financial and accounting systems.</P>

      <P>An application tracking system which is designed to enable the Land Registry to trace and manage its ever increasing caseload of applications has been installed in the Kildare-Wicklow regional group and in the Cork regional group to date.

      <P>The Garda authorities have been endeavouring since the establishment in March 1993 of the domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit at DMA Headquarters in Harcourt Square, Dublin 2 to deal more effectively with domestic violence.  The unit is staffed by gardaí who are trained and experienced in dealing with domestic violence and sexual assaults.</P>
      <P>The functions of the unit include overseeing the investigation of offences of domestic violence, child sexual abuse and other violent and sexual offences committed against women and children and enforcement practices in respect of protection and barring orders.  The unit works in close contact with the Garda community relations section and liaises with organisations, both statutory and voluntary, which deal with violent or sexual crime against women and children.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the Garda Commissioner issued a pro-arrest policy document on the procedures to be followed by the gardaí in incidents of domestic violence. The primary concern of the gardaí in such circumstances is for the protection of the victims of domestic violence through law enforcement.  The policy document sets out the manner in which investigations should be conducted and reported.</P>
      <P>Outside of the Dublin metropolitan area, the Garda authorities have designated an inspector in each Garda division to have overall responsibility for this area and to ensure a uniform and consistent approach.  This plan of action was implemented in April 1994 and is the subject of ongoing review by the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>Statistical information on the incidence of domestic violence is now being generated and published in the annual report on crime.</P>

I am committed to the development of community sanctions and measures, together with planned and programmed release of offencers under the supervision of the probation and welfare service.  In this context, I am having the matter of electronic tagging examined by my Department and I am closely monitoring the progress of a number of European schemes which have been set up on a pilot basis.  When this examination is carried out I will then decide how best to progress our interests.  I can tell the House, however, that the initial response which I am getting from some jurisdictions to electronic tagging is less than enthusiastic, not least on cost grounds.  There would also be some additional problems for us.  For example, it is essential that the offender has a telephone which would not always be the case here.  However, as I have indicated, I will make a decision on this matter as soon as my Department has concluded its examination.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 77 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>As I announced earlier this year, the development of the Castlerea prison project will take place in phases.  The first phase was the completion of the perimeter wall.  As a second phase I propose to construct a special secure unit to accommodate 25 offenders.  A contract has been place for initial works and tenders for the provision of the new buildings for this unit have recently been received and are being examined at present.  I expect to be a position to place a contract for these works very shortly and to have them completed by August-September.</P>
      <P>The original proposals for the main prison development at Castlerea, Phase 3, while incorporating the use of the existing hospital buildings, envisaged a significant amount of new, purpose-designed buildings in the overall plan.  I have directed that a comprehensive review of the original plans be undertaken with a view to maximising the use of the existing hospital buildings and confining new buildings largely to cellular accommodation.  My Department, with the assistance of the Office of Public Works, is proceeding with planning and design works for this proposed facility.  Normally, projects of this size and nature could be expected to be completed in a period of 20 to 27 months.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position, at this stage, to indicate when this new prison facility will be completed or to confirm the number of places to be provided other than to say that the overall number to be accommodated at Castlerea will be of the order envisaged in the original plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the new women's prison, with the approval of Government, I had work on the planning and design of this facility to accommodate 60 offenders and located on the Cowley Place site, <Col N="1020" /> beside Mountjoy Prison, recommenced earlier this year and it is being progressed at present.  Planning and related matters are being progressed and until these matters are completed it is not yet possible to give a definite date for the completion of the project.</P>

      <P>A total of 295 applications for naturalisation were received in my Department in 1995 and 355 certificates of naturalisation were issued in 1995 &mdash; this higher figure is accounted for by the fact that no valid comparisons can be made between applications received and certificates issued in any given year.  For example, in 1995 significant inroads were made into a backlog of applications which had accumulated over the <Col N="1021" /> previous years and thence a comparatively larger number of cases were finalised during the year.</P>
      <P>A total of 242 declarations of post nuptial citizenship were also lodged in my Department in 1995 and 133 post nuptial declarations were accepted during the year.  Valid comparisons cannot be made between these figures over a given year.</P>
      <P>In addition to these cases, a total of 415 declarations of post nuptial citizenship were accepted in Irish embassies throughout the world in 1995.</P>
      <P>As regards visas, the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is the visa-issuing authority of the State, has not yet finalised the figures for 1995.  However, it is estimated that the number of visa applications received was in the region of 30,000.  This compares with 23,545 applications in 1994, of which over 21,000, or 95 per cent, were granted. The indications for the figures for 1995 are that the number of applications granted was also in the region of 95 per cent of all applications.</P>

These operations are subject to constant review and may change at any time depending on operational requirements.  I understand that Operation Shannon was reviewed on an ongoing basis and on 9 April 1996, based on Garda assessment, it was further extended to take in adjoining areas.

      <P>The Martin committee report made two main recommendations.  The first, concerning procedures for reviewing the cases of alleged miscarriages of justice, was dealt with in the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993.  The second, on the audio-video recording of interviews <Col N="1024" /> with suspects in Garda Síochána stations, is at present the subject of pilot schemes at four selected stations.  A steering committee under the chairmanship of Judge Esmond Smyth is overseeing those pilot schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Martin committee recommended two less pressing changes to the Treatment of Persons in Garda Síochána Stations Regulations, 1987. These can be incorporated in any future revision of the regulations.</P>

      <P>I do not know the basis of the Deputy's claim that crime is up by 14 per cent in parts of Dublin.  This may or may not be the case but I do know that official Garda statistics for 1996 so far suggest that crime is actually decreasing in the Dublin metropolitan area as a whole compared with the same period last year.  I am sure that the Deputy will welcome this encouraging trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made the tackling of crime in all its forms my number one priority and I recently announced a series of measures, both immediate and long-term, to help deal with it.  These measures include the provision of a significant number of prison places over <Col N="1026" /> the next 18 months, the implementation of the Garda restructuring plan, which provides for the creation of a regional command structure designed to improve the response to mobile crime, approval for the appointment of 15 new judges, steps to address the problem of drugs in prison and the management of addicted offenders, the early introduction of legislation in the criminal justice area and a new Garda information technology system.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in 1995, I established the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Garda National Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 will improve the efficiency of the courts and speed up trials.  In addition, at community level, I have funded many youth diversion projects and other schemes to engage youth and steer them away from crime.</P>
    <P>I believe that these measures will make a major impact in tackling crime, not just in Dublin but throughout the country.</P>

      <P>They have informed me that there are 246 members of the Force who are deployed full-time on community policing duties mainly in the urban areas of our larger towns and cities.  In addition there are over 1,300 liaison gardaí servicing over 2,000 neighbourhood watch schemes in urban areas and over 800 community alert schemes in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am convinced that the gardaí need to maintain the closest possible links with the communities which they serve, it should also be recognised that <Col N="1027" /> there is a limit to the number of gardaí that can be dedicated solely to this type of duty, given the overall demands on the Force.  However, it is inherent in the function of all members of the Garda Síochána to provide a quality service to the public and the individual citizen through their interaction with the communities in which they serve.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the deployment of gardaí is under continual review by Garda management so as to provide a flexible policing service capable of responding to needs as they arise.</P>

      <P>The issue of crime against tourists is one which receives the highest priority from my Department and the Garda authorities.  Close co-operation is maintained with Bord Fáilte to ensure that crimes of this nature are minimised to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures taken by the Garda to deal with this problem include the deployment of additional Garda patrols, <Col N="1028" /> both uniformed and plainclothes, in areas of high tourist interest.  It has been noted that a limited number of locations feature in many instances of crime against tourists and these, of course, are targeted especially by the Garda.  Other measures include the provision and distribution of an information leaflet by the Garda which is written in three European languages and which gives advice to tourists on how to protect their property and personal belongings. These leaflets are available at all sea ports and airports.</P>
    <P>The presence of a Garda office, which opened in March 1990, in O'Connell Street, Dublin is also helpful.  It serves as a central location for advising tourists on preventive measures.  Another initiative has been the launch by the Garda community relations unit of a street map for tourists in Dublin, listing places of historical and current interest and also including crime prevention advice.  Supervised car parks are shown on the maps.  I understand that it is intended to extend this project to other areas frequented by tourists.</P>
    <P>The Garda have carried out security surveys of all youth hostel accommodation.  Advice has been given on securing entry and exit points to these buildings and providing facilities to allow tourists to store luggage securely.</P>
    <P>For those tourists unfortunate enough to end up as victims of crime, there is the Dublin tourist victim support service which was launched on 14 April 1994 and which is being operated by the Irish Association for Victim Support (IAVS). The service, which is modelled on the Amsterdam Tourist Assistance Service, provides tourists who have been the victims of crime with help in overcoming the initial trauma of their experiences. The Garda Síochána have been involved in setting up this service and have provided premises for its operation at the Garda Dublin metropolitan area headquarters at Harcourt Square.  A grant is provided to it by the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  A co-ordinator with a victim support background has <Col N="1029" /> been appointed to head the team of volunteers who provide the service.  They have a wide range of foreign languages and have received extensive training.</P>

Torture as defined in this Convention includes a category of mental torture for which an offence is not at present prescribed under the existing criminal law.  2.  Legislation is required to expand the jurisdiction of our courts to cover alleged offenders who would not already be covered by the existing criminal law.</P>
      <P>A review of existing extradition legislation may also be required to ensure compliance with article 3 of the Convention which states that &ldquo;No State Party shall expel, return (refouler) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>My response to this question is confined to the Civil Service, as my responsibility in this matter does not extend to the wider public service.  In so far as the Civil Service is concerned, a person who has more than 56 days' sick leave in the preceding period of four years is considered unsuitable for promotion.  This rule is applied in a flexible fashion.  Absences for minor curative or &ldquo;repair&rdquo; operations, or absences due to non-recurring illnesses, may be discounted.  If the candidate's sick leave record shows an improvement in the latter part of the four-year period, there is discretion to give him or her the benefit of the doubt.</P>

The Government has made an additional £7 million available in 1996 to allow work in reducing excessive waiting times to continue and orthopaedic surgery will continue to be a priority area in the allocation of waiting list funding.</P>

    <P>The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 June 1995 is in the range of £199.88 - £211.62 per week. This is the same rate as applies in the health services to group 1 non-officer grades.  This scale applies throughout the country and is increased from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel.  With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In particular in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups which accounts for the wide variation within the area.  In all boards the rates are <Col N="1037" /> determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that payments made to part-time home helps do not come within the scope of the PAYE system.  Neither is such income taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a part-time home help &mdash; or the spouse of a part-time home help &mdash; is in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment.</P>

    <P>Many of these day care centres are run by voluntary organisations and are grant-aided by the health boards.  These voluntary organisations employ competent persons who arrange and implement the services to be provided at the centres and, as the level of nursing duties to be performed, other than those which can be provided by the public health nursing service, is quite limited, the voluntary organisations seldom have a need to employ qualified nurses.</P>
    <P>With regard to those day centres administered directly by the boards, the staffing of these is a function of the relevant health board.  I will have the particular case raised by the Deputy investigated and I will respond to him in due course.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the determination of eligibility for medical cards rests with the chief executive officers of the health boards.  I understand the procedure in the Western Health Board is that a review form is sent to the medical card holder at the beginning of the month in which the card falls due for review.  The holder has 28 days in which to return the completed review form to the local community welfare officer.  The community welfare officer then examines the documentation and may seek further information from the individual.  Following receipt of the completed review form together with the recommendations and or observations of the community welfare officer, the chief executive officer then makes a decision to either review or cancel the existing medical card.  The length of time this takes depends on the speed with which the card holder completes the review form and supplies any additional information requested by the community welfare officer.</P>
      <P>A person's medical card remains valid and may be used until such time as the decision on renewal or cancellation is made.  Those individuals who complete and return the form and also are deemed to be eligible are issued with new medical cards while those who fail to complete the review form are notified that their medical card is being cancelled and of the need to reapply.</P>
      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that I issued instructions to all health boards in March of last year that review forms should not issue to persons aged 70 years and over.  This was done to alleviate undue stress on persons in this age group whose circumstances are unlikely to have changed since their last review.</P>

      <P>Under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970 and regulations made thereunder, health boards, in assessing eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, are obliged to have regard to the means of both the applicant and his/her spouse.</P>
      <P>Recently I advised all health boards that all couples who in their own individual right are eligible for disabled person's maintenance allowance should in future receive two personal rates.  Such couples, up to now, have been receiving a personal rate plus an adult dependant rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of differences between the assessment of means for disabled person's maintenance allowance and for social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare.  The <Col N="1041" /> spouse of a social welfare recipient on unemployment assistance is entitled to earn up to £60 per week, including travelling expenses, without affecting entitlement to this allowance.  There is no similar provision under the disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme is in the process of being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department of Social Welfare took over responsibility for the payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance on 1 August 1995.  It is expected that responsibility for the administration of disabled person's maintenance allowance will transfer to the Department of Social Welfare in October 1996.  I have no plans to change the existing disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations pending this transfer but this and other anomalies have been brought to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, for consideration in any future changes to the scheme.</P>

    <P>The strategy document <i>Recycling for Ireland</i> sets out the general approach being adopted by the Government to promote recycling to end 1999.

Both documents are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in relation to the recycling of paper are being experienced at present in Ireland and many other countries arising from a significant reduction in the demand and price for waste paper.

    <P>Increased demand for recycled paper will be supported in Ireland by guidelines being finalised in my Department for environmental management by Government Departments.

These and other appropriate national measures to support waste recycling will be pursued by my Department in the context of the further implementation of the national strategy and of the Waste Management Bill, 1995.</P>

      <P>In preparing the water and sewerage services capital works programme for 1996, my Department sought information from local authorities on their proposals for possible development of reed bed and other natural disposal methods.  Subsequently, I announced the initiation of a `natural <Col N="1049" /> wetlands' subprogramme, and I approved individual schemes for Williamstown, County Galway, Boherbue and Cloyne in County Cork, and Ferns in County Wexford.  In addition, a number of other schemes are being implemented by various local authorities.</P>
      <P>All reed bed projects will be carefully monitored to assess their efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  Further proposals will be considered on their merits to establish whether they might provide the optimum solution, environmentally and economically, when compared with other conventional engineering systems.</P>

      <P>Rate support grant allocations to all local authorities, including Carlow Urban District Council, have been adjusted on a number of occasions from 1984 to 1995 to take account of various structural adjustments to the system of local financing during that period, including the removal from local authorities of a variety of levies and statutory demands, the writing-off of Local Loans Fund debt repayments, and the provision for direct rate payments by the ESB to local authorities.  The effect of these adjustments must be taken into account in any comparison of the rate support grant allocation in 1995 with previous years' allocations.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to promoting the active participation of parents at every level of the education process.  It also supports the right of parents to be consulted, as part of a collaborative process for educational decision making and policy making at school, regional and national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> As part of national education policy, it is essential to adopt a range of measures aimed at fostering active parental partnership with schools.  At national level, the National Parents' Council is formally recognised as the representative body for parents at first and second levels.  Parents are full partners in the consultative process between the Minister for Education, the Department and the other partners in education.  Under the proposed legislation arising from the implementation of the objectives of the White Paper on Education, parents will be given a statutory entitlement to representation on each school board of management and each education board.  A statutory duty will be placed on boards of management to promote the setting up by parents of a parents' association in every school in receipt of Exchequer funding.  In the context of developing dynamic and supportive links between the home and the school, each board of management will be required, as part of its school plan, to develop a formal home school links policy.</P>

      <P>There are 106 special schools which cater for children with special needs.  Following is a complete list of these schools, including their names and addresses.  In addition, there are 216 special classes attached to mainstream primary schools catering for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>Children are referred to the special schools and special classes on the basis of psychological and other relevant assessments.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education. <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> outlines the proposed future strategy for providing suitable education for children with special needs in either special educational facilities or in an integrated environment.  The fundamental objective of the commitment in the White Paper is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with special needs will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system.  The degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of the individual children concerned.</P>
      <P>The rights of consultation for parents of children with special needs will continue to be an integral part of this process.  The decision-making process, in relation to the replacement of a student in an ordinary and-or special school, will be a collaborative one, made by the parents and the professionals involved, with the objective of providing what is best suited to the child's development and needs.</P>

      <P>Returns for the 1995-96 academic year, from the authorities of second-level schools, show that the transition year programme is being offered in 497 schools to a total of 24,036 students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided that a six year cycle of postprimary education would be made available for students commencing their post primary cycle in 1991. Accordingly, a restructuring of the senior cycle programme began which gave a three year senior cycle option from September 1994 consisting of a <Col N="1062" /> one year transition year programme and a two year leaving certificate programme with three orientations, the established leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied.</P>
    <P>It is for the authorities of individual schools to decide whether to offer the transition year programme.  In making this choice, schools are subject to the same constraints as apply to their general curriculum choice.  Schools cannot always, for example, provide a range of curriculum or programme options to suit the wishes of every student.</P>
    <P>Each year, my Department issues a circular letter to school authorities, inviting those schools wishing to provide a transition year programme in the following academic year to register with the Department.  To date, 558 schools have indicated to my Department that they propose to provide the programme to a total of 28,162 pupils in the 1996-97 academic year.</P>

      <P>An application for disadvantaged status from the school in question was considered in my Department in 1994 in the context of an expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme being undertaken at that time.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the school did not rate high enough in terms of priority of needs to qualify for inclusion on that occasion.</P>
      <P>In 1995, I commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to conduct a detailed review of our current approaches to the identification and support of pupils suffering educational disadvantage.  The criteria used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme and the nature of supports to be provided were among the issues covered in this study.</P>
      <P>As a result of the recommendations brought forward by the Combat Poverty Agency, I recently announced an important new targeted initiative in this area.</P>
      <P>Under this new initiative, a special programme of intensified supports will be made available to selected urban schools and groups of rural schools.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has been commissioned to approach schools in the target groups and areas and invite their participation in this new initiative. I would expect that the schools in question will be contacted in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>Garda statistics for 1996 so far suggest that crime is decreasing as compared to the corresponding period last year.  This reduction in crime applies to both the Dublin Metropolitan Area and the rest of the country.  Even so the level of crime is too high and I share the general concern with it.</P>
      <P>I have, therefore, made the tackling of crime in all its forms my number one priority and I recently announced a series of measures, both immediate and long-term, to help deal with it.  These measures include the provision of a significant number of prison places over the next 18 months, the implementation of the Garda restructuring plan which provides for the creation of a regional command structure designed to improve the response to mobile crime, approval for the appointment of 15 new judges, steps to address the problem of drugs in prison and the management of addicted offenders, the early introduction of legislation in the criminal justice area and a new Garda Information Technology system.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in 1995, I established the Garda national drugs unit and the Garda National Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 will improve the efficiency of the courts and speed up trials.  In addition, at community level, I have funded many youth diversion projects and other schemes to engage youth and steer them away from crime.</P>
      <P>I believe that these measures will make a major impact in tackling crime throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The allocation of Garda resources is the responsibility of the Garda authorities. They have informed me that, contrary <Col N="1068" /> to what the Deputy states in his question, Garda stations are not experiencing difficulties when they require a replacement motor vehicle.  This is due to the fact that a replacement vehicle is normally made available to any station where it is envisaged that the permanently allocated vehicle is going to be out of service for a period of time.  The Garda authorities also inform me that existing arrangements are satisfactory to meet present policing requirements.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda resources and personnel to different areas.  Postal divisions and Garda divisions do not share the same geographical boundaries.  The following are details of mobile units allocated according to Garda districts:</P>

      <P>The Government recognises that the drugs problem is multi-faceted, requiring a response from a number of Departments and agencies.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that last year the Government approved a series of organisational, financial, legislative and operational measures to deal with the drugs problem.  A further series of measures &mdash; concerning education, prevention and treatment issues &mdash; was agreed by the Government in February.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult, in the context of an answer to a parliamentary question, to set out in detail the progress made on an item-by-item basis on the implementation by all the Departments and agencies concerned of all the measures in question, but the Deputy may be assured that significant progress has already been made and will continue to be made.</P>

They are accommodated on two floors of D-Wing, St. Patrick's Institution.  The remaining floor of D-Wing is in full use since late February this year and 33 young male prisoners are now held there.</P>
      <P>At the health care unit at Mountjoy prison, 38 out of the total of 57 prisoner places in the unit have been out of use following extensive fire damage on 18 December 1995.

      <P>At Portlaoise prison a total of 60 prisoner places are not in use at present. This is due to operational requirements in relation to the accommodation and management of different groupings of prisoners at this high security prison. Construction works are under way to facilitate rationalisation of accommodation arrangements, thus permitting use of all prisoner places at this prison.

      <P>Contrary to public perception, no Garda stations have been closed as a result of the community policing scheme for rural areas.  The main aim of the scheme is to forge closer links between the Garda and communities they serve. Prior to the introduction of rural community policing many Garda stations were open round the clock, a situation which was found to be unnecessary because of the low level of personal calls.  Now stations are open at set times to transact such administrative business as is necessary, based on detailed assessments of the administrative workload. For the rest of the time the gardaí, who would otherwise be deskbound, are engaged in active and operational duties in the community, moving around in that community and getting to know all the people they serve.  During the hours when stations are unmanned any caller to the station can make direct contact with a garda on duty at the district headquarters by using the direct communication link which is available at each Garda station involved in the rural community policing scheme.  The gardaí at the district headquarters can then arrange for the nearest Garda or mobile patrol unit to come to the assistance of the member of the public.  Under the scheme fixed opening hours of rural Garda stations are now guaranteed and this was not always the case in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural community policing scheme has a number of very positive benefits for <Col N="1072" /> those living in the communities in which it operates, including vulnerable groups such as the elderly.  It involves a more effective use of available resources. Community gardaí are now mobile and provide a more flexible service to the public by way of faster response to calls. They can maintain contact with elderly residents in remote areas in the course of normal patrols.  The gardaí in these areas have been able to acquire broader local knowledge and a wider degree of contact with the public.  The scheme has also facilitated greater involvement by the gardaí in community based crime prevention programmes.</P>

      <P>Section 35 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, makes it an offence for a licensee to allow any person under 18 years of age, with an exception for employees, on any part of his or her licensed premises during the time an exemption is in operation in that part.  It is also an offence for the person who is under 18 years of age to be on the part of a licensed premises where an exemption is in operation.  The 1988 Act also amended the special exemption order provisions as they relate to Sunday night-Monday morning.</P>

      <P>Neighbourhood watch schemes provide an extremely effective and valuable vehicle for community involvement in crime prevention.  While it is difficult to quantify, the Garda believe that such schemes play a vital part in preventing crime in those areas where schemes are in active operation.  They also provide an essential mechanism for bringing gardaí and local communities closer together.  For my part, I am committed to the development of the neighbourhood watch programme and, in this regard, I have directed officials in my Department to carry out an evaluation and assessment of all community based initiatives to ensure that all areas of the country are adequately covered.</P>

Provision was also made for existing community employment workers, i.e. those who had commenced their scheme prior to 6 April 1996, to be given the option of paying class A PRSI, if they wished, or of continuing with their existing class J PRSI.</P>

      <P>My Department funds a community development programme, with an allocation of £4.46 million in 1996.  The programme provides financial and other assistance to projects towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in the area and to other specialist community development projects.  The projects provide a range of supports, development opportunities and services to community groups and individuals in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a few of the projects in the programme make work with families a particular priority in their workplans. Moreover, in 1994, to mark the International Year of the Family, a special allocation of £250,000 was made available under my Department specifically for family resource centres.  Following from this allocation, ten such centres are <Col N="1083" /> being funded by my Department at a cost of £155,000 in 1996.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the community development programme is on personal development aimed at developing the individual's confidence and assertiveness so as to enable him-her to engage more fully with society.  The programme is essentially about promoting positive change in society in favour of those who benefit least from economic development.  A key principle is that projects be managed by a management committee on which people who themselves experience poverty and exclusion participate.  The aim of the community development programme is not the provision of social services, professional counselling or social work, although such services are sometimes provided as an outcome of the project's work.</P>

      <P>The question of dividing child dependant allowances on a <i>pro rata</i> basis between separated spouses, who have agreed shared custody arrangements, raises the issue of parents who both fulfil a contingency on an equal but partial basis.  Current provisions focus on issues, such as the normal residence of the child, and the question of maintenance, in determining the payment of child dependant allowances in cases where parents have separated. The allocation of these payments on a <i>pro rata</i> basis has significant policy and administrative implications across a range of social welfare schemes, and these are being considered by my <Col N="1084" /> Department in the context of the introduction of the one-parent family payment in early 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>A part from the ongoing activities of the agencies, FAS, Forbairt, IDA Ireland, SFADCo and the county enterprise boards, the Government has been responding to the particular problem of long-term unemployment through a variety of targeted measures.  These include the development of more employment friendly taxation and social welfare regimes and the introduction in this year's budget of a series of precisely targeted employment measures: the splitting of the community employment, CE, programme into two distinct options &mdash; a part-time integration option and a part-time jobs option &mdash; and the better targeting of the programme at the long-term unemployed; the introduction of a new pilot <Col N="1086" /> whole-time jobs option; the introduction of a new recruitment subsidy scheme called Jobstart; the introduction of a new work experience programme called Work-Place; the introduction of special measures for 18-19 year olds; the extension of the back to work allowance scheme; and the retention of certain benefits for those returning to work.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the local employment service represents an important component of the Government's response to tackling long-term unemployment.  The distinctive additional elements of this service, in providing an individually tailored progression path towards employment for its clients and ensuring that there is well co-ordinated employment service delivery at local level, should yield real benefits in terms of securing employment for long-term unemployed persons, as the service develops.  The fact that it is initially launched in 14 areas, including the major unemployment black spots in the country, means that it is first being targeted where it is most crucially needed.</P>
      <P>My plans for 1996 are that the local employment service should be consolidated in these 14 areas and subject to an initial evaluation before the service is expanded on a planned basis to other areas.  In this way we can ensure that the service is developed to maximum effect for its client population.</P>
      <P>Training is an another important component in any measure of active labour market interventions aimed at addressing the problems of long-term unemployment, given the strong link between low levels of education attainment and long-term unemployment.  I will be addressing this problem in the White Paper on Human Resource Development which I will be submitting to the Government shortly for consideration.</P>
      <P>I have already published a strategy paper on the labour market and this will be followed by papers later this year on enterprise strategy, services and longer-term planning.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has applied for a FEOGA capital grant under EU Regulation 866/90. It is a requirement of that regulation that applications for such aid undergo a rigorous examination and assessment procedure.  In this case, that procedure is now almost complete and I hope to <Col N="1088" /> be in a position to convey a decision on it shortly.</P>

      <P>The Government decision referred to in the Deputy's question states that price competitiveness and performance benchmarks should be established as part of the corporate planning process of each State enterprise that has a dominant or monopoly position in the Irish market. I wish to refute the suggestion in the Deputy's question that the companies concerned have ignored that Government decision.  I am satisfied that the companies under my Department's aegis have given this matter the attention and priority that it deserves in a corporate planning process.  I have frequently made reference to the importance for the commercial State companies of proper performance measurement, stressing the need for objective benchmarks to measure the extent to which the companies are meeting targets.</P>
