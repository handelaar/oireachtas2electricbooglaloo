    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last contributed to this debate I spoke at some length about the taxation aspects of the budget.  Today I should like to turn to its spending aspects and the Estimates procedures.</P>
      <P>In his budget the Minister for Finance sought to maintain levels of spending on social services which has provoked most criticism from Opposition Deputies.  The Minister has been criticised for failing to eliminate the current budget deficit.  We were told by Deputies McCreevy and Michael McDowell that he should have availed of this opportunity to run a budget surplus and reduce the overall level of our national dept.  While there is a serious argument to be advanced in this respect, it was advanced in a politically dishonest manner.  Whenever we offer people genuine choices we need to spell out their consequences.  Whenever we talk about reducing current spending we need to specify exactly where those cuts should be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago I listened with care to Deputy Brendan Kenneally recite the Fianna Fáil line which included some colourful phrases &mdash; I think I paraphrase his comments fairly accurately &mdash;<Col N="8" /> such as an allegation that the Government was embarking on the road to financial ruin, which most people accept is patent nonsense.  Deputy Kenneally then went on to to argue at great length why spending should be increased.  He described the lack of spending on county roads in his constituency; he condemned the reduction of the budget allocation to An Bord Bia; he mentioned the fact that Rehab could gain more from a single fund-raising event in or close to his constituency than they were being given in the budget.  He deplored the lack of spending on the Garda and prison service and became positively agitated at what he described as the disgraceful increases in social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>This typical double-think is politically dishonest.  The Fianna Fáil Party cannot simply condemn the Government for failing to make cuts and then go on to argue for a whole range of substantial increases in expenditure.  If Fianna Fáil was to effect cuts in public spending it would need simultaneously to specify precisely from where such funding will emanate.  It is simply not good enough for Deputy McCreevy to argue the macro-economic point to be followed by spokespersons from the spending ministries arguing the exact opposite.</P>
    <P>This budget has made provision for the continued improvement of child care services.  We need to know from Fianna Fáil whether it would have cut that provision.  The budget also makes provision for improvement in the legal aid service.  Would this provision have been cut if Fianna Fáil had been in Government?  For the fourth consecutive year the budget raises the level of capitation grant to primary and secondary schools.  Would this have occurred if Deputy McCreevy had been Minister for Finance and Deputy Martin Minister for Education?  I look forward to Fianna Fáil spokespersons answering some of these questions.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for supporting increases in spending of the kind to which I have just referred but that does not mean I believe all public spending is good; nor does it mean I believe the <Col N="9" /> State is uniquely gifted in spending people's money.  Undoubtedly there is waste within the public and Civil Service. Management and budgeting techniques in the Civil Service are archaic and in need of urgent reform.  I know the Government is committed to dealing with some of these issues by means of the strategic management initiative for which there is all-party support; its urgency cannot be overstated.</P>
    <P>We need to veer from the practice of budgets being increased incrementally in accordance with inflation without any serious evaluation of the need for that budget in the first place.  There is understandable pressure on local Civil Service managers to maintain their budgets which, in turn, leads to pressure to spend money in a given year so that an increase can be justified for the following year.  It is time for a serious re-evaluation of such budgetary practices and a fundamental examination of Government performance.  We need to question whether we are getting value for money but we need to go further; we need to ask ourselves whether, in some instances, we should be doing anything or whether we should continue to deliver a particular service in its present form.</P>
    <P>In many ways there already exists a precedent for such re-evaluation.  For example, our semi-State bodies such as Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann and the ESB have been forced through a painful, difficult process of self-analysis and restructuring.  We all appreciate the difficulties this has caused for many employees of those bodies.  However, we also acknowledge that the restructuring was necessary.  The Labour Party is and always has been committed to the public service.  We have sought to smooth the way and involve all of the social partners in the redefinition of the public service over the past few years. The process in Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann and the ESB has been undertaken responsibly by trade unions and employers alike, recognising the need for change.  The same thinking and process should be applied to elements of <Col N="10" /> the Civil Service itself.  In that respect I welcome the positive approach of the Civil Service unions to the strategic management initiative.  I hope the Government will honour its promise to involve the trade unions at every stage of that process.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the issue of public spending and the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  I repeat that I am opposed to the 2 per cent growth limit on public spending which, in itself, is a nonsense; it makes no sense to limit our overall level of expenditure without any reference to revenue.  What matters is not what we spend but rather whether we can afford to spend it.  In that respect, the borrowing requirement, expressed as a percentage of gross national product, is a meaningful indicator whereas the overall level of spending is not.  For example, no householder would attempt to budget by simply looking at one side of the equation; nor does it make any sense for a Government to do so.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I support responsible constraints on spending.  I support the Maastricht criteria and believe in getting value for money.  I also believe in clearly linking expenditure to results. For example, there is no point in flinging money at the health budget in the hope that hospital waiting lists will be reduced.  It is right that increased funding should clearly be seen to yield returns and I trust the Government will continue that approach.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the argument about the national debt because arguments about its absolute level are largely academic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, I had been in my office listening to this debate and heard Deputy Derek McDowell refer to me on a couple of occasions and to a number of things I had said in this debate.  I must point out that I have not yet contributed to this debate.  I should like the record corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, I apologise unreservedly to the Deputy; <Col N="11" /> that had been my understanding; perhaps I confused him with one of his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Doubtless Deputy Kenneally will have an opportunity of putting his point of view later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The absolute level of the national debt will inevitably fluctuate. This arises not only from increased expenditure but from changes in interest rates and in the relative values of the currencies in which that debt is denominated.  Those factors can add or subtract hundreds of millions of pounds to our national debt within a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, to run a current budget surplus of, say, £100 million for the express purpose of reducing our national debt would not be worth a candle and would inflict a great deal of social damage, most likely on those who can least afford it.  Ultimately, we would have reduced the national debt by a tiny fraction of 1 per cent only.  If we followed the strategy suggested by the Progressive Democrats and flogged off all our national utilities over the next three years, we would have succeeded in reducing our national debt by no more than 3 per cent of its current value, when the damage done to our public services and pain inflicted on individuals would be out of all proportion to the benefit gained.  This is not to say that the debt does not have to be repaid but it is clear that to deflate the economy in order to do so would be a gross mistake. Our debt-GDP ratio has decreased significantly in recent years.  This is a direct result of economic growth and increased tax revenue.  There is every reason to believe that economic growth and tax revenue will continue to increase in the coming years.  This will multiply and increase our capacity to repay the debt and at the end of the day that is all that matters.  Dangerous tinkering of the kind suggested by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats might gain us some brownie points from the markets <Col N="12" /> but it could end up having the opposite effect from what is intended.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the Minister's use of the phrase &ldquo;social solidarity&rdquo;.  This concept is critical not just in the way we formulate our budgetary strategy but also in the way we seek to run our society. The thrust of Government policy in recent years has been to concentrate additional spending on areas of disadvantage. Schools located in disadvantaged areas have attracted additional funding and tax reductions have been targeted at the lower paid.  We have sought by a range of expedient taxation measures to introduce an increased element of equity into our society.  It is right that we should continue to do so.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of social solidarity which we must acknowledge.  We must not just seek to benefit those who are less well off.  We must also ensure the continued willingness of those who are better off to subsidise their fellow citizens and contribute to institutions and services which benefit everyone. We must, at all costs, avoid the position which applies in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in the United Kingdom where the middle classes have private pensions, send their children to private schools, pay for private health care and do everything possible to shut themselves off from the realities of society elsewhere.  This inevitably breeds resentment and ultimately undermines the social solidarity which makes the welfare state possible.  We do this by ensuring that our public services are of a standard which caters for people of all backgrounds.  In many ways we have succeeded in doing that.</P>
    <P>Our health and education services are such that most people do not feel the need to opt out.  Nonetheless, there are some worrying signs on the horizon and we cannot afford to be complacent.  This budget represents an element of continuity in maintaining services and in targeting taxation reductions at the lower paid.  I commend the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost a month since the budget was introduced and its <Col N="13" /> impact has been overshadowed by the tragic breakdown of the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland.  Nevertheless, I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate even at this late stage.  I hope the breakdown in the ceasefire will not have too great an impact on our economic performance over the coming year.  I note this morning that the ESRI, in its quarterly report, suggests that any further deterioration in the peace process would have long-term implications for the economy.  Is it too much to hope that the vast majority of the people, North and South, who have expressed a desire for a political solution to the problem can penetrate the hearts and minds of the faceless people who send out guileless men to kill and maim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget will continue the progress made in the public finances during the past few years.  The basic thrust of an article by Senator Joe Lee in <i>The Irish Times</i> earlier this year in relation to general economic management was that if nothing is broken, do not try to fix it.  Such a prognosis is only half right. Despite recent economic progress, which according to the latest ESRI report is set to continue, we continue to have problems.  Economic growth has been secured but a certain section of the population has thus far been excluded from its benefits.  This has been a problem for some years.  It is not a concidence that the first budget to tackle the problem head on was introduced by a Labour Party Finance Minister.  This House and the people will recall that when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in power the measures they adopted, particularly in relation to taxation, were directed at the better off. This is not to say that taxation relief does not form an important part of this year's budget.  I have calculated that the total taxation relief provided for this year is £178 million.  This is not an inconsiderable figure.  If the provisions aimed at tackling long-term unemployment announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, are successful, as I am confident that they will be, in <Col N="14" /> future years the scope for increased tax relief will be all the greater.</P>
    <P>PRSI workers who pay over 80 per cent of the total tax take have to be convinced that other sectors of the community are paying their fair share.  It is up to the Government to ensure this is the case.  I avail of this opportunity to spell out some of the progress made in recent years.  Child benefit increases over the period of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> are worth £200 per year for a two child family.  For a four child family the same increases are worth over £500 per year.  These improvements are applicable to all families and are of great benefit to the income of the household because they are not taxed in any shape or form.  In the same period, it is estimated that 116,000 new jobs have been created, a 10 per cent increase in job creation.  This is not enough, there is still a long way to go but we have made progress over the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>The budget seeks to continue this improvement and to extend it to sections of the population who have not benefited from employment growth. Measures announced by the Minister include reduced employers' PRSI to increase the incentive to expand employment; refocused community employment to concentrate on the needs of the long-term unemployed; the provision of an additional 1,000 full-time places on community employment schemes; an £80 per week employers' subsidy scheme for those who take on a person who has been unemployed for three years or more &mdash; this is aimed at getting 5,000 people back at work; and expansion in the numbers on the back-to-work allowance scheme from 10,000 to 15,000 places; retention of child dependant allowance and medical card for a certain period by a person who has been long-term unemployed on taking up employment &mdash; this is a great incentive for those in low income jobs.</P>
    <P>I would encourage the employer groups who have lobbied myself and other backbenchers and who have made submissions to the Minister, particularly <Col N="15" /> the small business sector who have a role to play, on the basis of the progress and concessions made not only this year but last year, to take on extra employees.  This would make a significant impact on unemployment.</P>
    <P>The reason the budget was greeted with such ire by Members on the Opposition benches is that the measures I have outlined have been taken in conjunction with an ongoing improvement in our social infrastructure.  We are all aware of the poor condition of our non-national roads.  People have taken to the streets and to the ballot box to protest about potholes and the inadequate road network generally.  I am pleased that my party colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, was able to announce a £225 million package to modernise our roads, £146 million of which will be spent on non-national roads this year as part of a ten-year plan.  I compliment the Government on going down that road.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation from the National Roads Authority of almost £23 million to improve the roads in Fingal.  An additional £8 million has been allocated for the urban renewal scheme.  A submission has been made to the Department of the Environment for an urban renewal scheme in my constituency of Balbriggan which was once the industrial capital of Fingal but is now an unemployment blackspot.  The Department is currently reviewing the urban renewal scheme and I hope Balbriggan will be included in the next scheme.</P>
    <P>Progress has also been made in regard to housing, an area on which little headway was made by the Opposition parties when they were in power.  The Minister for the Environment has maintained Labour's commitment to this important area; the allocation for this year is £366 million.  With so many people on the housing waiting lists, a larger increase would have been appropriate but I congratulate the Minister on what he has achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> I congratulate my party colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, for the continuing improvement in funding for education. Capitation levels, the bedrock of financial support for our schools, have increased substantially each year since she entered office.  I am not satisfied, however, with the size of the allocation for the second level school building programme, the funding for which has been reduced to £30 million.  Will the Minister reconsider this matter because many children are being educated in prefabricated classrooms, which is totally unacceptable if we are to provide them with the type of education required in the future.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Opposition to argue for a reduction in public expenditure yet neither party could achieve this while in Government.  Rather than being a burden on the public, public services were viewed by those parties as essential.  The spectacle of Opposition politicians arguing for reductions in public expenditure is in stark contrast to their behaviour in their constituencies where they call for Government intervention on a regular basis.  They should stop knocking social services and acknowledge the invaluable role they play in our society.</P>
    <P>There are currently two industrial disputes on the horizon involving nurses and civil servants who were on picket duty yesterday.  I hope a mechanism will be found to ensure the people involved in those disputes are given adequate recompense for the valuable work they do on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>I commend this budget to the House and have no doubt next year's budget will result in further improvements in our social infrastructures in addition to necessary tax changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this debate on the budget.  In laying blame at the door of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Ryan and the previous speaker should remember that when Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1987 it took some difficult decisions, and the record will show that.  As a new <Col N="17" /> Deputy at that time, I found myself in the eye of the storm in having to cope with what we referred to then as cuts in public expenditures.  Those cuts were radical in certain cases but they were necessary.  It has since been proved that they laid the foundation for a developing and successful economy, the benefits of which we are all reaping now.</P>
      <P>The decisions taken at that time were painful and Fianna Fáil backbenchers were under enormous pressure to dissuade the Government from implementing various cutbacks but we held firm in that regard.  I acknowledge the appreciated assistance of the Fine Gael Party at the time.  That assistance was in the national interest and it is unfair for speakers now to say Fianna Fáil does not have the stomach for such action.  It has been proven that we do and the country is the better for it.</P>
      <P>There is no longer anything surprising about Budget Day which, in the past, was full of surprises.  The Minister for Finance was a popular and sought after person and the House was always full to capacity.  The public gallery would have been packed to overflowing with people who had a direct interest in certain aspects of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past two years that is no longer the case.  There were few people in the public gallery this year and it seemed like an ordinary working day in Leinster House which was a little disappointing. The reason for that lack of interest is that most of the information in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance is well known in advance.  In the period leading up to the budget, we can read in newspapers about the changes proposed, even those such as excise duties which would directly affect our taxation finances.  Deputy Hogan, unfortunately, lost his job on this issue.  In hindsight I believe he should have been restored to his job.  We certainly learnt a great deal more before this budget than we did from his <i>faux pas</i>.  Most people regretted his demotion because Deputy Hogan had been an effective <Col N="18" /> Minister of State in the short time he held that position.</P>
    <P>On budgetary policy, a debate is emerging on the financial planning of the country's finances, which seems to be done on a year to year basis.  That does not make much sense.  A set plan for economic development should be laid down over a three or five year period. The Government should consult the social partners and other interested groups on the general thrust of our financial management over a three or five year period.  If such planning was done on a three or five year basis, we would be less inclined to be subject to pressure and lobby groups, some of which are quite powerful, because the parameters to which we must adhere would have already been set.  I hope either this Government or a future Fianna Fáil led Administration will bite the bullet on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced in the budget that he intended moving the budget process forward to the autumn of each year, perhaps starting next year.  That is probably a good thing but I have a sneaking suspicion &mdash; perhaps I am quite wrong &mdash; that the proposal in the Estimates for the 1998 budget will become an election manifesto.  I will be watching very carefully to see if the budget proposals become the basis of the Government's election manifesto. The Government may decide to produce the Estimates in September or October 1997, if it has not left office, and then put the package to the people. That leaves the Government open to intense pressure to include sweetners that ordinarily it might not do.</P>

      <P>That remains to be seen and time will tell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social partners were called upon to participate in the preparation of a national plan in 1987 and since then have played a very constructive role. They accepted that certain corrective measures had to be taken and have supported them.  Society owes them a debt <Col N="19" /> of gratitude for the patriotic manner in which they have assisted in the proper planning and development of our economic and social affairs.  Their contribution has been significant and we are the better for it.</P>
    <P>A sound economy is essential to provide facilities for the less well off in society.  If the economy is doing badly it is the poor who tend to lose out, as has been proven in the past.  When the economy is doing well there is room to target the less well off with a view to improving their economic lot in terms of jobs, social welfare payments and other supports. The perennial problem of the past ten to 15 years is the question of unemployment. The blight of unemployment has led to increased emigration.  We are reaping the benefits of the decisions taken by successive Governments since 1987, with the support for part of that time of Fine Gael in Opposition.  I hope that will continue.  Latest reports suggest that our economic base is soundly rooted and, given the absence of certain extraneous issues, can grow by 5 per cent, which is very significant in European terms.  I hope that the difficulties with the peace process will not last and that by the combined efforts of the Government and Opposition together with the British Prime Minister and his Government a mechanism will be found to restore the peace.  Apart from the tragic loss of life, the collapse of the ceasefire has a crucial bearing on the development of our economy in areas such as tourism and people's willingness to invest in our economy.  The person who plants a bomb or who takes a life is making a direct impact on the ability of the economies North and South to develop.</P>
    <P>A significant number of net new jobs has been created in the past two years but the Minister for Finance did not refer in his budget speech to the type of jobs that have been created.  There is a growing concern that some new jobs are not what they are cracked up to be, jobs that do not give a person an opportunity to borrow from a bank because there is <Col N="20" /> no reasonable long-term guarantee of permanence.  We need to find out the types of jobs and the sectors in which they are being created.  One hears a great deal about growth in the service sector and it has contributed substantially to the increase in jobs but we are concerned about the type of job that has been created.  I hope such information can be made available because we need to know if we are creating sustainable jobs that give people a decent chance of making a living and planning their future with a degree of certainty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of a subsidy for employers taking on new employees who have been unemployed for at least three years.  Let me sound a note of caution, however, as the Government will need to ensure that the procedures for participating in the scheme are as simple as possible.  We introduced similar job subsidy schemes in the past but the administrative work involved was so detailed that many would be employers did not have the time to go through the rigmarole of the paperwork and wait a considerable length for the subsidy to be paid.  In those instances the targets were never met.  I call on the Government to establish a simple system for employers to avail of this £80 job creation subsidy so that it will be taken up by the maximum numbers.  Otherwise employers will be reluctant to participate in the scheme, not because they do not wish to but because it is time consuming to administer it.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that certain categories of unemployed persons can retain their medical card on their return to work. This is a good thing &mdash; something we were calling for when our party was in Government &mdash; and I hope it will be put in place as quickly as possible.  This has a bearing on people's decision to return to the labour force, particularly in low paid employment.  Concern will be expressed by those currently in employment earning sums marginally above the qualification threshold for receipt of a medical card.  They lose out consistently because of this.  They may argue that if <Col N="21" /> they were unemployed, they would receive a sum close to what they are now earning with the added benefit of a medical card.  The matter is not as simple as that, but, as the Minister is fully aware from dealing with constituents at clinics, different standards are applied in each health board area.  A graduated system would be worth considering taking the proposed changes into account.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with some of the matters for which I have responsibility in my role as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on the travelling community, child care and special education.  In mid-1995, the excellent report of the task force on travellers, established by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Administration and chaired initially by Deputy Liz McManus, now Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, was published.  It made a number of outstanding recommendations and brought together every aspect in a way that had never been done before, although there are umpteen reports dealing with the various needs and difficulties of the travelling community.  I have called on the Taoiseach to arrange for a debate on it at an early date.  Every Member has an interest in the welfare of travellers as the difficulties experienced in their constituencies impinge on their rights and entitlements.</P>
    <P>In reply to questions tabled by me the Minister for Equality and Law Reform indicated that interdepartmental discussions are taking place which I hope will be brought to a conclusion quickly. The Minister could then proceed to implement the recommendations in the report.  A number of serious issues remain to be dealt with, on which progress must be made quickly.  The travelling community has been singled out for special mention in recent media reports dealing with the upsurge in crime in rural areas.  These articles have been condemned across the board which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>One cannot provide a good health and education service to the travelling community unless its accommodation needs are met first.  Unless an extra <Col N="22" /> 3,100 units of accommodation are provided between now and the year 2000 the targets set out in the report will not be met with the result that travellers will continue to be forced to live on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>In the greater Dublin area 161 families are living on temporary halting sites which lack basic facilities such as water, sanitation and power; 204 families are living on the side of the road, often in dangerous conditions with nowhere to go and 60 families are living in overcrowded group housing schemes, giving a total of 425 families.  The figures are comparable in other major built-up areas.  Unless their accommodation needs are met, we cannot provide them with educational and training opportunities through agencies such as FÁS or a good health service.</P>
    <P>In this connection the proposal that a traveller accommodation agency should be established is an excellent one.  I hope that such an agency would be given the necessary statutory powers to ensure that every local authority plays its part in meeting the accommodation needs of travellers.  On the costs involved in providing such accommodation, criticism has been expressed.  I reject this on the basis that much ground has to be made up by comparison with every other sector in society.  That is the reason the expenditure involved seems inordinately high.</P>
    <P>The finding of a report published in 1987 showed that the number of deaths per 1,000 live births among the travelling community was 18.  This is a startling figure.  The comparable figure among the settled community was seven.  The findings also showed that the average life expectancy of travellers was only reaching the 1940 level of members of the settled community.</P>
    <P>It is not practical to suggest that the members of the travelling community who have their own culture and way of life should settle in ordinary housing. Many of them would not be able to cope in the same way that many members of the settled community would not be <Col N="23" /> able to cope if they were asked to live in a caravan for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>The INTO recently held a special conference in Galway to consider the issue of special education at which a number of crucial questions were raised. For a variety of reasons we have not been able to make the progress we would like in providing the necessary resources to meet the special education needs of children.  Teachers, management and support groups have been calling for the adoption of a co-ordinated approach as recommended in the report of the review group published a number of years ago.  I do not have time to deal with the issues that need to be addressed, but such an approach must be adopted if progress is to be made.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this legislation, the most important to come before the Oireachtas since 1908, are much more caring than those of the 1908 legislation. While they may have been an advance at the time, they leave much to be desired now.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is responsible for the implementation of many of the provisions of the 1991 Act.  As his predecessor, I welcome the progress in this area.  However, will he ensure that health board reports are founded on facts?  While the funding provided is substantial and encouraging, in the last number of years &mdash; even when Fianna Fáil was in Government &mdash; some projects were not developed to the extent envisaged.  For example, the provision of a small number of additional places for homeless children does not make an appreciable difference to a health board region.  Advisory committees, which have a crucial role to play in the implementation of the Child Care Act, should submit reports on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to create an additional 700 net new posts this year.  I hope they will not be created as a result of rejigging other services in the health area.  I hope personnel are not rearranged merely to deal with the implementation of the provisions of the <Col N="24" /> Child Care Act.  Will the Minister confirm that will not be the case?</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act is about putting in place resources, trained personnel and the legal framework on which a number of the sections are based.  All the necessary provisions are included in the Act.  If we can put in place the necessary structures to meet the priorities set out in the legislation we will have done a good job for our children.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas which the Minister must address.  He has a keen interest in the ongoing problem of truancy. He recently visited a primary school where approximately 83 per cent of the pupils attend on any one day.  In a similar school in a neighbouring middle class area approximately one pupil per class is absent on any one day.  The truants, who are generally absent on Mondays and Fridays usually, end up getting into conflict on a small scale with the Garda but in later years many of them end up involved in serious crime.  Will the Minister introduce proposals on truancy so that we can resolve this problem?</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this year's debate on the budget, the second introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  It is designed to create jobs, a major difficulty encountered by this and previous Governments, and it strikes a fair balance.  There were demands for major tax reductions, particularly in income tax.  There were also major demands on the Departments of Health and Education to ensure equality for all citizens.  Furthermore, there were demands for the unemployed, the disabled, those in receipt of pensions and for the improvement of our county and regional roads. To meet those demands serious consideration had to be given to the <Col N="25" /> amount of tax relief that could be given to those who contributed for many years to the upkeep of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister accommodated his Cabinet colleagues and at the same time introduced tax relief for those who deserve it.  The suggestion of many eminent journalists in recent years that a Labour Party Minister could not be trusted with the public finances has been put to bed by the Minister for Finance. His sound judgment has ensured that the economy will continue to grow, with the highest growth rate in Europe. A 1 per cent growth rate results in the creation of approximately 6,000 new jobs.  Last year our economy grew by 8 per cent, giving us 48,000 new jobs.  At the same time, we maintained low interest rates and low inflation which augurs well for the future.</P>
      <P>The Government must ensure that high growth rates translate into more jobs and the redistribution of wealth in a progressive and fair fashion.  State intervention in the market place is essential if we are to make real inroads to job creation.  In this regard, I welcome the Minister's decision to make this year's budget a budget for work.  It contains a series of significant specialised areas designed to assist the long-term unemployed.  I welcome the positive attitude the Government has adopted to tackle the unemployment crisis, but it cannot do it alone.  It will require the co-operation of the social partners, particularly the trade unions, IBEC and the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main cause of social deprivation and disadvantage is unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. It is generally accepted that if a person is unemployed for more that three years he or she has an 80 per cent chance of not getting a job.  That vicious cycle must be broken because not only does it require a considerable increase in the social welfare budget, it creates many difficulties in other areas.  An area where there is large scale unemployment presents difficulties for all Departments, unemployment destroys homes <Col N="26" /> and families.  In some communities several generations of families have not worked and that dangerous sociological trend must be arrested.  People should not be left in this vulnerable position.</P>
    <P>The Minister has implemented a series of fiscal measures designed to create jobs.  The reduction in employers' PRSI and the increase in the employees' PRSI allowance will make it attractive for employers to take on extra workers. These changes will help to eliminate unemployment traps which prevent many people from taking up work.  In future, the long-term unemployed who take up work will be able to retain social welfare benefits, for example, medical cards, for three years.  However, employers must not exploit this.  If the Minister is prepared to make £80 per week available to employers to take on extra workers they must match this amount and not take advantage of the long-term unemployed.  Many people do now want to take up employment because they are afraid of losing their medical cards.  As those of us who have to pay doctors know, medicine does not come cheap.  That they can retain their medical cards, for three years on taking up employment will make it easier for them to get back into the work force and get their lives together.</P>
    <P>The aim of all social welfare provisions should be to help people get back to work; they should be an investment in the capable and productive.  We must invest more funding to help people overcome their disabilities and upgrade their skills.  The community employment scheme is one of the initiatives which helped people develop new job skills.  It was launched by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, when he was Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Community employment workers have benefited greatly from the budget.  For example, the decision to transfer them from Class J to Class A was a progressive step forward &mdash; they should not have been singled out or had different conditions imposed on them.  There is enough of that type of class distinction <Col N="27" /> in various employments at present without contributing to it.  The budget gives proper recognition to the value of community employment schemes both for workers and the community at large. The allocation of an extra 1,000 places and the retention of 25 per cent of places for the long-term unemployed will help job creation.</P>
    <P>I understand why Department do not wish to increase public expenditure but schemes could be better policed and would be more productive if public bodies played a leading role in this area.  It is important to ensure that the jobs created under the community employment schemes do not replace existing jobs.  This happened in certain cases and many public sector workers have been left with a bad taste in their mouths since the decision in 1987 to cut back on the number of people employed in the public service.  The only way to solve this problem is to ensure that agreements are signed so that existing employees will welcome community employment workers into their places of employment.</P>
    <P>Growth in the economy is important for the creation of real jobs.  There was major growth in the tourism industry last year but jobs may be lost in the industry this year if the peace process is not reinstated.  I sincerely hope the people who have created the difficulties in the peace process will realise they are affecting their own people.  A return to violence will also affect the level of inward investment.  I hope the men of violence also realise that industrialists will not invest here if there is violence but will invest instead in peaceful countries.</P>
    <P>In the area of job sharing there is tremendous potential to create real jobs for which people have been educated and trained.  However, this will require the full co-operation of the trade unions and employers in the private and public sectors.  When people reach a certain age they do not have the same pressure on them to work a full week.  Their families may be reared and they may want <Col N="28" /> to have more free time.  Job sharing can create positions for college graduates, nurses, teachers, health care workers, engineers and technical staff.  In my trade union days I advocated the encouragement of this type of employment as I did not believe it would be possible in the long-term to provide 35, 38 or 40 hours work for all employees given the introduction of technology and the other developments in the work place.  Employers and trade unions must take steps to ensure that as many jobs as possible are available for young graduates so that they stay in the country and help build it in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for sharing his time with me.  I am not impressed by schemes run by State agencies which are supposed to help create employment.  One can fiddle around with figures and tamper with FÁS and other schemes run by Departments which provide employment on a temporary basis, but we need to solve the problem of unemployment on a permanent basis.  The way to do this is to reduce the level of taxation, PRSI contributions and levies.  In other words, there must be a direct attack on the disincentives to work.  A worker becomes liable for income tax on quite low income and he or she does not have to earn much more to be caught in the higher rate.  If the worker has a reasonable salary, at least half of it is paid in taxation and PRSI.  That is the real disincentive. Many of these schemes are piddling little schemes which do not achieve anything worthwhile.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget there should have been a reduction of 2 per cent in the taxation levels, taking the 27 per cent rate down to 25 per cent and the 48 per cent rate to 46 per cent.  That would give a clear message to hard working and highly taxed employees that the goal is to reduce taxation in the near future to 20 per cent and 40 per cent and widen the bands along the way. It is preferable to reduce the rates; widening the bands is a secondary consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> Employees should be given hope that they will gain from working hard as there is much hopelessness and helplessness. People do not see light at the end of the tunnel.  Although anyone who says this is criticised, a number of people who could work do not because it would not pay them.  Between their social welfare benefits and the perks from being unemployed, they find it much easier and more comfortable not to work rather than to take a job for a few pounds more per week.  If they can get a couple of days doing nixers, that is all the better.</P>
    <P>When unemployment tables are published they should not only contain a blanket figure like 270,000.  There should be projections and a breakdown of the figure into those who are generally out of work, those who are about to receive retirement pensions, those on FÁS schemes, those out of work on a temporary basis, etc.  The figures should contain a clear analysis of the overall position and every category should be listed.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of unemployed people are genuinely out of work but there is a significant element who, because of the reasons I mentioned, find it more profitable to stay unemployed, do nixers and get fringe benefits.  They see no point in working.  Every Member of this House is aware of this issue.  They will not speak about it publicly because they are afraid they will be criticised or lose votes but it is a fact of life and until it is faced we will have severe problems. The real issues should be tackled.  Tax should be reduced and people should be given an incentive to work hard.</P>
    <P>On last night's Private Members' motion there was an unfair attack by a Democratic Left Deputy on the farming community who, she said, are not paying their fair share of income tax.  Farmers are listed among the self-employed who pay taxation on the basis of what they earn.  If they do not earn much money they do not pay tax.  It is diabolically unfair to accuse a section of the community which works extraordinarily <Col N="30" /> hard of cheating the system.  That is basically what was said.</P>
    <P>About 180,000 people are listed as farmers but hardly 50,000 of them are commercial farmers.  Most of the other 130,000 are termed subsistence farmers and there is a huge distinction between the categories.  They live primarily on social welfare benefits and partly through their farming activities.  They may have four or fewer animals but they are categorised as farmers.  One gets a distorted figure when one looks at the amount of tax paid by farmers.  Many of the commercial farmers may also have commercial problems through heavy borrowings, disease, misfortune and bad weather, so some of them would not be elibible to pay tax.  As with any self-employed person, they return accounts, are assessed and pay what they should. It is unfair to attack a section which works as hard if not harder than anyone else, from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week at some times.</P>
    <P>The self-employed and the PAYE sector keep this country ticking over. They should get relief at every turn because we are too highly taxed as a nation.  People like Deputy Lynch should know that this year it is projected that agriculture will bring in earnings of £2 billion, which in itself will keep the social welfare system and health services going.  To criticise those who are working hard is counterproductive and unfair.</P>
    <P>A matter which has given rise to much concern in recent times is law and order and the position appears to be getting worse.  There have been horrifying crimes of late.  Some of them are in the process of being solved but that is not the point because the victims and their families have suffered.  We need a radical approach to deal with the problems on our streets and in the countryside. We can have all the strategies in the world using the present Garda Síochana force but it will not solve the problem to any significant extent.  The gardaí are doing their best and will continue to do so but the problem needs additional measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> Previously in this context I have mentioned our Army of 11,000 men and women.  I do not say our law and order problem is out of control because I do not want to over-dramatise, but it is creating serious difficulties.  When people feel unsafe in their homes or walking in our towns and cities, including O'Connell Street, the main street of our capital city, drastic action is needed. I advocate that the Army be mobilised to assist the Garda in securing our towns, cities and countryside.  People should feel safe in their homes, walking outside or driving about.</P>
    <P>In other countries the military act as an aid to the civil authority when the civil authority has been overrun by criminality.  As legislators, we need to adopt a new approach, and I wish a majority of my colleagues would say likewise.  We should mobilise the 11,000 people in the Army to help the civil authority to stop the loutish, criminal behaviour and the lewd comments one must listen to.  In my travels as a member of the Council of Europe I have never seen elsewhere in Europe the indiscipline, bad manners and misbehaviour that I see in this country.  In some countries which are supposed to be Third World countries the standard of manners and discipline is far superior to what we see here.  Strictures will have to be imposed on people who will not behave themselves.</P>
    <P>Present Garda numbers are not sufficient to bring a very serious situation under control.  I ask that the Government and the Members of this House consider a practical approach to law and order as the problem is out of control in many areas and cannot be tackled under the present system.</P>
    <P>Six months ago Deputy Séamus Brennan was in here screaming at the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, in connection with certain matters.  Now that the Minister has turned out to be a knight in shining armour, as he was yesterday on the Long Mile Road when <Col N="32" /> he and his driver Tadhg Daly went to the assistance of a mother and her child who were being assaulted, I thought Deputy Brennan would have been magnanimous and said a good word about somebody who has been attacked constantly in this Chamber.  This may not be a budgetary matter but it is related to the issue of law and order.  If we had more civic-spirited people we would go a long way towards solving our problems, but they will not be solved under the present system.  With due respect to the Garda they need more assistance numerically and in terms of legislation.</P>

      <P>Although I do not agree with all Deputy Deasy's views, I compliment him on the forthright manner in which he expressed them, and I certainly think he had courage to stand up and say what he believes.  I also compliment the Minister, Deputy Lowry, and his driver on their prompt action yesterday.</P>
      <P>Small events often highlight how out of touch Government is with the reality of people's lives.  One such event was the announcement in the budget that tax relief would be given on the cost of alarms.  On the Sunday before Tom Casey was murdered I spoke to a journalist about crime in rural Ireland and the provision in the budget of tax relief on the cost of alarms.  I told him that tax relief was not what we needed, because most vulnerable people in rural Ireland do not have a taxable income and, anyway, are afraid of the system. What is needed is a simple measure on which, for some reason best known to himself, the Minister for Social Welfare refuses to budget.  It relates to the penal assessment of capital, particularly in the case of pensioners who have lived frugally and saved for a lifetime.  Anyone who lives in rural Ireland knows that old people keep money in their homes because they will lose heavily on their pensions if they put it in the bank.  This is a double tragedy because it puts these people at risk and, further, money lying in houses is dead money which is no use to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> If somebody has lived frugally and saved £10,000 over a lifetime, he is assessed at the rate of 10 per cent and his pension is reduced by £20 a week. Many old people cannot understand why thriftiness and frugality are penalised by the loss of pension rights.  They cannot understand either the lack of relationship between the assessment of capital and the money that capital is earning.  The average interest rate on demand deposit accounts in the high street banks is .25 per cent.  To put it in simple terms, if a person is means-tested on £10,000 he loses £20 a week, but if he puts it in the bank he gets about £0.50 a week or £25 a year in interest.</P>
    <P>If we recognise the truth that much rural crime is associated with break-ins to houses where people are thought or known to have cash stashed away, we should do away with means-testing of capital in the case of pensioners, not set up more task forces.</P>
    <P>The State has always encouraged the saving of money.  I cannot understand, therefore, why the State does not encourage people to put their money into the Post Office savings banks or the credit unions where the money would become available to the community or to the State and serve a useful purpose. If the Minister for Social Welfare is interested in putting alarms into the houses of vulnerable people he should introduce a straight grant rather than tax relief and do away with means-testing of capital for pensioners.</P>
    <P>This budget does little for most people, but it certainly does nothing for rural people.  Most people in rural Ireland are subsistence farmers and very few in my area live off their holdings. As far as social welfare benefits are concerned, means are assessed on a £1 for £1 basis for the self-employed.  I often hear high earners complain about paying tax at 50 per cent but little is said about the rate at which small farmers, fishermen working out of currachs or those who operate a seasonal bed and breakfast business are taxed.  It is time to face up to this issue.  It is incredible that endless time and money is spent <Col N="34" /> trying to calculate whether small farmers with two or three cows have an income of £395 per annum.  It is also incredible that the income from operating a bed and breakfast business in a three-bedroomed house for six or eight weeks in the summer is assessed.</P>
    <P>Apart from the REPS scheme there is no mention of the social welfare code in the recent islands report.  What is the point of developing agriculture when most people on the islands depend on social assistance for supplementary income and are penalised if they increase their farm output?</P>
    <P>It has been traditional in my area for people to stay at home and look after their parents.  This is not confined exclusively to women.  One of the reasons for the bachelor syndrome in the west is that people stayed at home and dedicated their lives to the care of elderly parents.  If one spouse is working and the other applies for the carer's allowance the first £150 income is disregarded but if a small farmer with 20 acres stays at home to look after a parent he or she does not receive any relief for the small amount of income derived from the farm.  Even if the person earns £30 or £40 per week from the farm it is deducted from the carer's allowance. Both categories should be treated equally, otherwise we condemn the latter category to a subsistence standard of living.  We say to them that they cannot improve their incomes, which would directly benefit the person being cared for, because the bureaucrats who thought up the scheme did not take them into consideration.</P>
    <P>The car scrappage scheme is urban based.  A car is considered a necessity in the city although there is public transport whereas it is essential in rural areas.  Many families need second cars in areas where there is no public transport. Small cars such as a Micra which can be bought for £8,000 are suitable in the city but would not last long on country roads in mountainous areas.  People need good quality 1.3 or 1.6 litre cars.  I proposed some years ago that £200 should be paid for each car scrapped <Col N="35" /> provided the car and tax book were brought to a registered scrap-yard.  This matter should be reconsidered.  Abandoned cars, some of which are used as hen houses and so on, are the greatest eyesore in the countryside.  If such a scheme were operated this problem would be resolved.  Young joyriders buy &ldquo;company&rdquo; cars at knock down prices but if £200 was paid for scrappage it would do away with this practice.  It would be a more equitable and less artificial scheme than the present one which is geared towards the middle class urban second car owner.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the damage caused to the motor trade by the importation of second-hand cars.  There is VRT and VAT on cars.  If one imports a car and VAT has been paid in another jurisdiction one does not pay VAT on entry to this country which makes it attractive to import from countries with a lower VAT rate.  Many imports are from Britain where there is a 17.5 per cent VAT rate.  It would be interesting to know if there is an obscure EU regulation that prevents us from reducing our VAT rate to 12.5 per cent and increasing the VRT rate slightly.  Such a change would make importation of second-hand cars unattractive.  It would also mean that each car would bring in more revenue.  We could afford to reduce the total rates of car taxation when VAT and VRT are combined.  I hope the Minister understands what I am saying and will give it some consideration and pass it on to his colleagues.</P>
    <P>Medical cards are the bane of TDs' lives.  Many of us spend hours looking after those who have lost their medical cards because they are £5 over the means limit.  I welcome, to a point, the retention of the medical card for three years of employment.  However, that only defers the evil day because we hope that the person will stay in employment permanently.  That is the answer for only some people to the medical card issue.  It is a short-term <Col N="36" /> answer for those who obtain employment but it only defers the blow.  Losing their medical card means a great deal to people.</P>
    <P>Those who are less than £25 or £30 over the medical card means limit should be given a chance to buy into the medical card scheme.  In other words, they could have a medical card if they made a financial contribution towards it. An absolute cut off level means that people lose out.  The cost of drugs is not a huge problem for those who lose their medical card because there is a refund of drugs scheme under which a drugs bill of over £90 in a quarter is refunded. However, there is no ceiling for those, particularly families with young children, who make multiple visits to doctors.  Regardless of how much they pay in a quarter, they have no way of recouping that money.  Consideration should be given to a scheme to refund doctors' fees which would mirror the refund of drugs scheme.  If the amount one paid one's GP in a quarter exceeded £90, on a standard fee per visit basis, one could reclaim the difference. In that way a ceiling would be placed on the amount that people have to pay their GPs.  Fees charged by GPs seem to vary greatly but the standard fee per visit could be set at £15.  With a ceiling of £90 equalling six visits per quarter, the cost of every additional visit would be refunded as long as one could prove that one had paid the fee.  Such a scheme would be no more open to abuse than the issuing of prescriptions and would remove the huge gulf between those who do and do not have a medical card.</P>
    <P>All non-medical schemes and levies, such as leaving certificate examination fees, which depend on the holding of a medical card but have nothing to do with medicine should be detached from that scheme.  Such items add to the huge gap between holders and non-holders of medical cards and are a disincentive to take employment in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the lack of reform of the social welfare system in <Col N="37" /> this year's budget.  We could argue for hours about the general increases but I was very disappointed by the lack of reform.  A number of years ago a Minister of State spoke about integrating the tax and social welfare codes.  That seems to have gone by the board.  I could spend a week discussing the many anomalies in the social welfare code.  I wish to highlight some simple changes which could have been made and I hope will be made in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is crazy that dependent children are paid different rates under different schemes because all children have the same costs.  A rate should be fixed &mdash; preferably the higher rate &mdash; for a dependent child, regardless of the scheme.  Their shoes, cornflakes and clothes all cost the same.  If one wishes to give lone parents extra money that should be done through the basic allowance rather than through the child dependent allowance.  It is nonsense and illogical to say that children cost different amounts of money depending on the situation of their parents.</P>
    <P>All schemes for dependent children should have the same age limit.  The limit for unemployment benefit is 18 years of age but it is 21 years of age for long-term unemployment assistance as long as the child is in full-time education. All of the schemes for dependent children should have a uniform age limit of 21 years of age.  It would be a huge help to those who cannot work through illness or are laid off from their jobs if they received payments for their dependent children up to the age of 21 years.</P>
    <P>The demographic trend shows a large decrease in the number of children.  I welcome the increase in child benefit. However, I am disappointed that it was not extended to dependent children of 20 years of age who are still in full-time education.  Many parents who have difficulties in putting their children through full-time education find such child benefit a huge help.  We spent the autumn taking about the family but we should do something for families.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of merit in <Col N="38" /> what Deputy Deasy said about employment. Schemes will not solve the employment problem.  More worryingly, the number of jobs to be created by the schemes announced in the budget amounts to 11,000 jobs.  That is a poor response to the 285,000 people who are signing the unemployment register.  I am not saying that any recent Government has tackled this differently but it is time to look at the problem realistically.</P>
    <P>A scheme which gives employers £80 a week has been introduced.  I have spent my lifetime giving people employment and if I identified a good worker I did not care if he had been unemployed for three or ten years.  I did not need to be given any money to employ him if I had a job to give him.  Most employers will say that all the money and incentives in the world will not make them carry passengers who will not perform. Most employers would feel that subsidising workers who cannot perform their tasks at the same standards as everyone else would create a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation in the workforce.  We must approach employment creation in a different way.  While I do not agree with the solutions put forward by Deputy Deasy I agree with much of his analysis.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the tax system.  Tax changes in this year's budget were minimal. I particularly welcome the introduction over two years of the £80 PRSI exemption.  It is an innovative and welcome move.  Taking into account the reduction in mortgage relief there is very little change in the tax system, and everybody must recognise that.</P>
    <P>PRSI and levies should be amalgamated. The system whereby people with a medical card do not pay levies while those without one pay, and where people earning more than £173 per week pay levies while those earning less than that amount do not is nonsense. An employer would have to be a genius to work out the system without the aid of a computer and remember all the rules that apply.  I was involved in paying out wages for about 20 years and every year extra rules were introduced. I am glad I am not in that job now; if I <Col N="39" /> was I would insist on having a computer. The system need not be complicated.  It could be worked on a revenue neutral basis.  For example, the first £80 should be exempt, a rate of 5 per cent could be applied to the next £220, with the balance at 8 per cent.  The ceiling could be adjusted upwards until a revenue neutral basis is achieved.  It could then be decided how much money would be refunded.  Such a system would be simple, cogent and easily understood. There should be no ceiling on employers' PRSI.  The rate should be fixed at 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is essential that low paid people are taken out of the tax system.  We have been told that a further 12,000 people were taken out of the tax net this year, but if we accepted the figures quoted by every Minister for Finance in the last 30 years for those taken out of the tax system, there would be nobody in the system. The first £100 of income for a single person and £200 for married couples should be exempt from tax, with exemption limits for children.  It is a waste of time for the Revenue Commissioners to assess single people earning less than £100 per week and married people earning less than £200 per week.  Instead they should concentrate on those evading tax.  Until that is done there will continue to be an interface between social welfare and tax, which makes it difficult to create employment and causes people working legally in the system to lose money.  Much more radical changes are necessary to tackle this problem and I hope such an approach is taken in next year's budget.</P>

      <P>I compliment the previous speaker who made a very fair, reasonable and logical assessment of the budget.  It is a pity this debate did not take place before the budget so that <Col N="40" /> issues raised by speakers such as Deputy Ó Cuív could have been taken into account and changes made in those areas.  The Deputy referred to many issues about which I feel very stongly. As a small island nation we have an enormous capacity to produce complex and confusing systems.  A logical approach should be taken to the tax system. Bureaucrats have too much say in these matters.  Politicians who deal with problems on the ground should be able to convince bureaucrats that the system must be simplified.</P>
      <P>For example, in assessing people for social welfare, medical cards and other benefits, some civil servants enjoy prying into people's private affairs, meddling in their business and asking them to produce documents.  I agree assessments are necessary, but some assessments costing thousands of pounds need never be undertaken.  I refer to a case I dealt with recently of a 93-year-old man who was reassessed for eligibility for a medical card.  To exclude people such as these from assessment would not damage our attempts to eliminate fraud. That person was also asked to produce documents about his income and about a farm he handed over ten years ago. When I made inquiries into the matter I was told that the person's medical card would not be withdrawn anyway.</P>
      <P>Why waste public money and time on such matters?  Public servants went on strike yesterday because of the Government embargo on employment, yet time is wasted on assessments such as this.  I appeal for logic, understanding and a degree of humanity in making assessments. There is no point making assessments if a decision is made before the assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that assessments for subvention are necessary but I am aware of four cases where patients died before all the information was collected.  Is that a worth-while system?  I am not saying these people died within two to three weeks of application, I am talking about cases where people died seven and nine months after the date of application.  In those cases a decision could not be <Col N="41" /> made because all the information had not been collected.</P>
    <P>I have tremendous regard for carers, people who make an enormous contribution to society.  Everybody accepts that a carer's job is seven days a week, 24 hours a day and the system demands that it is so.  I am aware of a case where a carer's allowance was withdrawn because her sister cared for the invalid some weekends to give her a break.  Is that a fair system?  Even though as a country we support a five day working week, carers must work seven days. How can any policy based on such crude, heartless and severe basic guidelines be successful?  How can we expect people to continue to do such demanding work &mdash; in the course of which they save this country a fortune &mdash; without being entitled to a break? The position of carers must be reviewed.</P>
    <P>An elderly person living alone is entitled to additional allowances.  If he or she becomes invalided and can no longer live alone, the living alone allowance is withdrawn even though there are additional expenses because of the infirmity.  There are enormous financial demands in terms of heating and other necessary facilities when caring for an invalid in the home.  We must have a fairer system.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to discover that eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance varies according to the health board area in which one lives.  That should not be the case when dealing with public money.  The eligibility criteria for the disabled person's maintenance allowance should apply in the Southern Health Board, the Eastern Health Board and in other health boards.  I know of a young girl with a disability who was refused disabled person's maintenance allowance, but others in the same institution were granted the allowance.  When I examined the case, I was told health board areas have their own rules in regard to this allowance. That is a basic injustice.  I cannot understand why people who deserve support from the State are victimised in this <Col N="42" /> way.  This area must also be investigated.</P>
    <P>One cannot speak on the budget without referring to unemployment.  As Deputy Ó Cuív said, taking into account all the people taken out of the tax net under the provisions of previous budgets, one would wonder if anyone should pay tax.  If we added up all the jobs that were to be created during the past ten years, one would wonder why we are not in a position to recruit people from other countries to take up all the job opportunities.  Our aspirations are perfect, but things do not work out exactly as planned.</P>
    <P>Two basic principles must be followed if we are to solve our unemployment problem.  It must pay people to employ people.  It must be worthwhile for an employer to create a job.  While improvements have been made employers still find it too costly to employ workers.  It must be worthwhile for people to work.  We cannot expect people to take up employment opportunities if they would be better off financially on social welfare.  Those are the two basic principles for generating employment.</P>
    <P>Last week a working couple put the facts and figures before me and I could not contradict them or argue with the figures.  They would be better off financially if they gave up work.  They applied for a mortgage subsidy as they are both on low income, but were refused it because they are in full employment. That subsidy is one the benefits to which those on social welfare are entitled.  This must be examined.  We are depending on people with a work ethos to remain in employment and not be driven into unemployment for a period because benefits for the unemployed are higher.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to hear the views on medical cards.  Certain categories of people, such as those suffering from long-term diseases or multiple sclerosis, may consider they should be automatically entitled to a medical card.  Do people with medical cards attend doctors more frequently than those <Col N="43" /> without them.  Some people appear to be addicted to visiting doctors and taking pills or other medicine.  People who pay doctors' fees and chemists' bills do not run to the doctor with every pain and ache.  The real problem is the cost of providing the medical service.  Strenuous efforts are being made to curtail the expenses of that service.  It should be curtailed at a level which would ensure that people who need a medical card would not be denied one.  This too should be investigated.</P>
    <P>Overall, this was an excellent budget, based on objectives of which Members would be proud.  The objectives were to keep mortgage and interest rates low. This was to be achieved by curbing the growth in public spending and cutting State borrowing.  Another objective was to give the long-term unemployed the hope of employment.  Achieving that objective gives the possibility of overcoming the many social problems associated with long-term unemployment, particularly drug addition and crime.  The budget was excellent in ensuring that interest rates would be kept down, that employment would be encouraged and public spending would be restrained.  Those who claimed to know the contents of the Budget Statement prior to its reading in this House warned that public spending would escalate out of control, yet the Government has ensured that spending this year will grow by only 2.5 per cent in real terms, the lowest rate of increase in Government spending for years.  When Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Government, the rate of Government spending was 6.4 per cent. I am confident that the budget, produced by a Government of which my party is a member, will succeed in effecting a dramatic cut in the growth of expenditure compared with its rate of increase since 1993.</P>
    <P>It is a realistic budget, proposing improvements in social welfare benefits &mdash; with which I agree &mdash; and other creative measures which I hope will be successful in generating employment. <Col N="44" /> Once again the Minister increased child benefit &mdash; it has increased by 45 per cent over the past few years &mdash; clearly acknowledging that families with children should be accorded the recognition they deserve.</P>
    <P>While Members might have liked many other provisions included or changed, as in all walks of life, we must be patient and acknowledge that this budget constitutes a considerable step forward.  While some of its elements may be disappointing, its overall thrust was good for the individual and society as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with Deputy Theresa Ahearn's sentiments on means-testing. As Members will be aware, the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on this subject makes very interesting reading.  As my party spokesman on Social Welfare over many years in Opposition, I strongly argued that means-testing should be administered in a more effective, efficient manner.  The present system is not just time-consuming, it imposes ridiculous direct and indirect burdens on the Exchequer.  I doubt it is generally known that some 600,000 people are means-tested annually in one form or another, some even twice annually, at a total cost of £4.14 million, comprised of £3.5 million this year in respect of supplementary welfare allowance, £0.28 million in respect of disabled person's maintenance allowance and £0.36 million on determining eligibility for medical cards.  The need for a general, radical overhaul of the overall method of means-testing goes without saying, on which I will have some suggestions to make when discussing the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not have sufficient time to elaborate on his Budget Statement, as many of the benefits for the large spending Departments were not referred to because of the time constraint on him but were announced since by the relevant Ministers.  For example, many additional millions of pounds were allocated to the Department of <Col N="45" /> Education, announced later by the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, benefiting all regional technical colleges, in addition to assistance being given to 75 per cent of schools generally awaiting approval of capital projects over the past two years or so.  Some had already received assistance and will get more this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment produced the largest package &mdash; as he did when in the Department of Health &mdash; of local government proposals probably within the history of the State.  For example, the Louth county manager, following criticism by some Members of the Opposition, on Monday evening last indicated that he was perfectly happy with the allocation of £200 million for roads in the county with £76 million for sewerage and water schemes.  Collectively, that probably amounts to more money allocated to my county than that allocated by successive Governments since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to compare those figures with the performance of previous Governments.  I should point out also that the last Government provided additional moneys for roads. Indeed our acting chairman is probably more aware than most that roads in Border areas were totally neglected by successive Governments in recent years. However, my party colleague, the Minister, is providing very substantial funding for county roads in all Border counties, which has been fully acknowledged by the relevant local authorities.  He introduced a ten year programme, not alone for resurfacing and restructuring but for their replacement, as some were not designed to accommodate the volume of traffic now using them.  He is the first Minister to have produced such a positive, ten year programme which I very much welcome, and which was not referred to in the Minister's Budget Statement.  Knowing my colleague, Deputy Quinn, no doubt he wanted to share the good news with his Cabinet colleagues.  The annual budget no longer reflects the total financial package of benefit to the State generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Minister Howlin and Noonan, when in the Health portfolio, made a substantial impact on health services generally, providing additional funding for dental and optical treatment and increasing the eligibility limit for medical cards in addition to reducing the long list of patients awaiting hip replacements and other hospital and medical services.  I am glad to see that trend continue under the present Minister and Government, many of which were not referred to in the Minister's Budget Statement.  Subsequently, the Minister for Health informed us of the good news.  The additional moneys allocated, particularly to those large spending Departments, should be taken into account within the overall budget strategy.</P>
    <P>I heard a certain amount of criticism of the allocation of £14 million to the Department of Defence, on which I should comment since I am familiar with this subject.  Anyone who knows anything about an early retirement-pension scheme will be aware that not all the capital allocation will be made before its introduction, that several months may well elapse before its implementation.  In fact it has not yet been approved by Cabinet but I am satisfied the Minister will ensure it will be fair and achieve the objective of reducing the overall age limit within the Defence Forces, thus allowing older members to retire on a reasonable income.</P>
    <P>I must repeat &mdash; as the Minister has on several occasions &mdash; I am confident there will not be any closures of barracks within the Border region or elsewhere. Those of us who live in the greatest military area within the Border region will know and appreciate the present and past importance of such military installations, as I do having served on the Border for many years. As chairman of my parliamentary party and of the Defence subcommittee, I am more than confident that my party would not support any such proposal. Indeed, having spoken to the Minister, I am assured that no such proposal will be put to Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> It is usual for the Opposition to criticise the budget and the Government.  It should be noted that £160 million of the additional moneys allocated in the budget are effectively for public sector pay increases: income tax relief amounts to £92 million, PRSI levy reductions, £75 million, other tax reductions, £11 million, Army pensions, £13 million, long-term unemployed initiative, £10 million, social welfare increases due pre-budget 1996, £54 million and social welfare increases in the 1996 budget, £80 million.</P>
    <P>During my 14 years as a Member I have not come across any budget &mdash; I examined a number of them and participated in debates on social welfare Bills and budgets in those years &mdash; that equals this one.  I am proud to say that the budgets with Labour Party involvement over the past four years have and will achieve more.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who is the first Labour Minister for Finance in the history of the State, on his achievements.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the budget, set himself three targets: to reward work, to promote enterprise and to strengthen social solidarity.  The budget has succeeded in meeting the Minister's criteria and the Government's target.</P>
    <P>It is a budget for all the community, not merely sections of it.  That in itself presents problems because it is not possible to straddle so many different areas and give something to everybody.  One cannot give too much to anybody, one has to share it out as best one can.  In recent years the community has grown from strength to strength.  This performance improved considerably last year. Last year's employment figures represent a significant improvement on other year's figures, impressive though some of them have been.  In 1994 the labour force survey indicated that employment growth was in the region of 45,000.  The Opposition sought to throw cold water on those figures.  I know there is a considerable discrepancy in <Col N="48" /> the employment figures, as measured by the live register and the labour force survey and the Minister has correctly identified the labour force survey as the correct measure of employment.</P>
    <P>Much has been said in the House about the changing nature of work.  It has been correctly stated that our social welfare system is based on a model of work practice which is becoming rapidly outdated.  The live register contains a significant number of people whose income from unemployment is supplemented. It also includes a significant number of people who are seeking qualification for schemes.  Under the equal status arrangement many wives are claiming unemployment assistance in their own right in order to qualify for schemes.  This means that the figures on a household basis are doubled in that the live register shows two people unemployed in the one house rather than one.  I welcome greater participation by women in the work place.  I also believe in supporting people in part-time employment.</P>
    <P>There is much more I could say, some of which I will in the debate on the social welfare Bill.  I led an all-party delegation to a conference in Stuttgart in Germany two weeks ago on growth and unemployment.  The purpose of our visit was to listen and learn.  I can truthfully say for my colleagues from each of the parties represented that we were able to teach most of the Europeans a few lessons. They applauded our growth and the way we are conducting our financial affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate a number of Members from the Government side said Opposition Members had no great objection to the budget and were just going through the motions.  There is probably a degree of truth in that.  There was nothing in the budget about which one could go wild from either a positive or a negative stance.  There was much hype and fanfare about the budget.  It was brought forward a day from the usual Wednesday and I am not sure <Col N="49" /> why.  Senator Mitchell and his commission were issuing their report on the Wednesday.  From a PR point of view I presume it was better to bring it forward and have a couple of weeks hype beforehand because the Government knew the North and Senator Mitchell would take over after the Wednesday.</P>
      <P>To borrow a phrase used by another Member, this was a budget of lost opportunities.  In previous years Governments tried to keep the show on the road by raising a few extra million pounds to fund existing commitments. There were few opportunities for any innovative measures or reform.  Significant progress has taken place in recent years and the Government had an opportunity this year, if it chose, to take radical steps to act on what the Opposition and everyone involved in politics has been talking about for years.  The Minister produced a dull and boring budget.  There was little interest in it, perhaps that was due to half of it being leaked beforehand.  In the Chamber on budget day there were empty seats and in the public gallery.  I have been informed by people who have been Members for longer than me that there was a time when one could sell one's visitors' pass for £20 on budget day but this year they could not be given away. There was simply no interest in the budget or demand for visitors' passes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Theresa Ahearn said it was a pity we do not have this debate before the budget rather than weeks afterwards. That opportunity exists in debates on Estimates or the Appropriation Bill.  However, this year the debate on the latter was confined to four of five hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the economy has been progressing well in recent years.  I do not blame any Minister for Finance for taking the credit but the progress has not been all his doing.  If the economy was doing badly, he would have to take the blame.  He is right to bask in the glory while he can.  The economy does not get into a good state overnight and neither is a mess created overnight &mdash; it is a gradual process and, <Col N="50" /> in this case, it has probably taken seven or eight years.  We are now reaping the benefits of good economic management over that time.</P>
    <P>The statistics for employment, growth rates, exports and inflation given by the Minister for Finance on budget day, sounded impressive.  It has been said in relation to the inflation rate that if one excluded the free third level fees it may not be down as much as the figure bandied about.  I am not sure of my facts on that.  When we talk about giving an old age pensioner a 3 per cent increase, free fees are of no benefit to them.  I hope they are not being conned that the real inflation rate is 3.5 per cent or 4 per cent, before the free fees are taken into account.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Government for taking credit for something positive.  A number of speakers continue to claim credit for the low mortgage rate. Nothing that this Government has done in the past 14 months has helped that specifically.  If I recall correctly there were two increases in the mortgage rate last year, one of which was due to internal factors and the other to international factors.  That has evened out but one of the increases last year was due to internal factors for which the Government must share some of the blame.</P>
    <P>The Minister forecasts a current budget deficit this year of £80 million and that is to be welcomed.  He obviously lost the battle with other Ministers when the Estimates were being drawn up and, bearing in mind that the Department of Finance has been conservative with its figures in recent years, I am sure the £80 million deficit forecast for this year will turn out to be a surplus.  The Minister will then join Deputy Bertie Ahern in claiming to be the second Minister for Finance in 25 years to bring in a current budget surplus.</P>
    <P>This is a conservative budget and, from the point of view of figures, cannot be faulted because it should bring in a current budget surplus.  However, I hope the Minister is not storing up all <Col N="51" /> the goodies for next year to have a giveaway budget in the run-up to a general election.  That might be clever politically but it would be financially irresponsible, I realise a Government will try to put its best foot forward in the run-up to an election but I hope that will not be the case with next year's budget.</P>
    <P>I read in a newspaper recently that the average PAYE worker will contribute £200 million more in taxes this year than last.  This year taxpayer will pay approximately £730 million more than they did last year.  That is a huge amount of money, much of which has been swallowed up in additional expenditure.  I am sure it was spent on worth-while projects but was it necessary to spend such a huge amount so quickly without giving some of it back to the PAYE workers?</P>
    <P>The increases allowed to PAYE workers this year are pathetic.  Increasing the standard band by £1,000 for a married person and £500 for a single person is minimal.  Those are the type of figures we heard about ten years ago when salary levels and tax allowances were half what they are now.  Many people will be shocked and disappointed when they get their new tax free allowance forms in April because their mortgage and VHI allowances will have been reduced.  That is sound policy &mdash; everyone should get the same relief at the same rate &mdash; but when that was done three years ago I understood there would be an increase in the bands each year to compensate.</P>
    <P>No attempt has been made to get the average industrial worker out of the 48p band.  A recent statistic indicated that four-fifths, or 80 per cent, of the average industrial wage comes under the 48p band.  That is unacceptable as people earning those wages should not be in the top tax rate.  The answer might be to return to the old system of three rates but it is ludicrous that a person earning an average industrial wage should pay the same rate of tax as some high flyer earning £100,000 or £150,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The general exemption limits have <Col N="52" /> been increased to £400 for a married person.  That is inadequate.  Deputy Ó Cuív referred earlier to the numbers taken out of the tax band this year but when they are awarded their 1 per cent or 1.5 per cent under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, they will go back into that band.  That has been the trend up to now.  We hear much talk about taking low paid workers out of the tax net but when we get an opportunity to do it &mdash; and there was an opportunity in this budget &mdash; we simply remain in line with the inflation rate.</P>
    <P>This is the third budget under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  In the past three years various Governments failed to meet the commitments entered into with the unions. Low paid workers will enter the tax net this year at the same level of real income at which they entered it in 1993 when the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was first negotiated. It will be difficult for the Government to get the unions to agree to a new pay deal because, while it believes it kept to its commitments and gave the percentage increases promised at that time, the unions are of the view they have not shared in the benefits of the growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>As a former trade union activist, I know the value of these agreements. Rather than getting an increase, more workers remain on the same salary, depending on for whom they work. There is much goodwill on the part of the trade unions and the Government in regard to these agreements, but the Government must play fair with the unions.  They cannot be conned and the Government must give the various increases when they are due.</P>
    <P>This is a budget of missed opportunities. There was no reform or easing of the tax burden on low paid workers and the thresholds were not raised, which would have taken the average industrial worker out of the top rate of tax.  That was promised by some of the Government partners when they were in Opposition.  When taxation was <Col N="53" /> imposed some years ago on unemployment and disability benefit, some of the people now in Government hit the roof and promised faithfully if they were ever in power that provision would be removed.  That has not happened.</P>
    <P>Last year saw the closure of the Irish Press Group.  I realise the issue of VAT rates is an old chestnut &mdash; unlike the UK, we pay VAT on newspapers &mdash; but I thought some adjustment would have been made in this year's budget.  The closure resulted in the loss of approximately 600 jobs, many of which were journalists.  Some of those have found other work, some have not but several hundred other workers in the group have been totally forgotten.  A Government gesture on VAT rates would have signalled that these people had not been forgotten.  It would show them that somebody still cares about them.  It is sad that the Government chose not to do anything on this.  Irish newspapers face tough competition from UK newspapers and it is regrettable that the Government did not take the opportunity to support them.</P>
    <P>Tax relief to a maximum of £800 will be available to pensioners to install an alarm system.  This was a very good idea but it was handled badly.  It shows how out of touch the Government is in some respects.  Was it not extraordinary that the Government with its spin doctors, PR men, advertising agencies and handlers did not realise that few pensioners are in a position to claim the additional tax free allowance because they do not have that level of taxable income?  As somebody said to me, it gave the impression that the life of one old age pensioner was more valuable than another because he or she had a few extra pounds.  That sent out the wrong signal.  The Government in an effort to retrieve the situation set up a task force. I hope the Minister for Finance will take the opportunity to extend the scheme and allow a son or daughter to claim the additional tax relief when the old age pensioner installs the alarm.  Alternatively a cash grant of £200-£300 could be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> A sum of £4 million was provided in the budget to implement the recommendations of the Cabinet sub-committee on science and technology.  Prior to this Government taking office 14 months ago there were plans to establish a science and technology park in Dublin.  This idea has been mooted for some years and the chamber of commerce was actively pushing it.  Under the EU SPRINT programme a rigorous evaluation was carried out which recommended that a science and technology park be located on lands at Abbottstown Agricultural College, just beyond the boundaries of my constituency. This site is relatively close to Dublin City University and is close to Bally-coolen Industrial Estate, an IDA estate with a great many computer factories. This recommendation was overruled by this Government.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, who shares my constituency, allowed that science and technology park to be given to his party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in Dublin South-West.  If it had gone to Dublin South-Central, I could have said that Deputy Gay Mitchell and the Fine Gael Party had swiped it and Deputy De Rossa could plead that he cannot win every argument.  In this case, he gave it to his own man, Deputy Rabbitte. That has gone down very badly in Finglas, an area of high unemployment.</P>
    <P>The answer to the problems of the unemployed is not necessarily handouts but about providing jobs.  Fourteen months ago the people in Dublin NorthWest were eagerly awaiting the establishment of the science and technology park.  I have read all about science and technology parks and what has been achieved in the areas in which they are located, for example, the North Carolina triangle where hundreds of thousands of jobs have been created.  People are upset that this project was given away and the view locally is that Deputy De Rossa gave it to his colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, for Dublin South-West.</P>
    <P>Mining tax relief will cost £1 million <Col N="55" /> each year.  I am a little surprised about this.  As far as I am aware a condition of a mining planning permission is that the owners have to return the environment to the way they found it when the mine closes down.  One could never say that the Labour Party were the friends of the mine owners but it is extraordinary how matters have changed because now £1 million will be given to mining companies to do what they are legally obliged to do and undertook to do when they received planning permission.  Who looked for this concession and who will gain from it?  I wonder if it is a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to someone who supported the Government's divorce campaign.  It seems extraordinary to give £1 million away each year to a group to do what they are legally obliged to do.  I would have thought we could have come up with better ideas for spending £1 million.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare for his successful innovations in the budget.  The increase in the living alone allowance to £6 is a good idea.  For too long rises in the living alone allowance were limited to 10p and I am glad to see we are moving from that.  The extension of the free schemes to low income retired employees of semi-State bodies and the Civil Service whose pensions are £30 per week or less above the social welfare equivalent is a very good move.  I worked in CIE and I know that many people were going out on pensions which were not much better than the old age pension.  I would like to think that in years to come the £30 ceiling might be increased.  This will certainly help a great many people who paid the low rate of PRSI.</P>
    <P>The means that are disregarded when assessing people's eligibility for the fuel scheme have been increased to £15 and this is welcome.  Some people who have paid into occupational pension funds receive very small pensions, no more than £10 or £12 per week, but by getting this money they were losing the £8 fuel allowance.  This change is a good move. It is the second year in a row it has <Col N="56" /> moved in this direction and I hope this will continue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the carer's allowance.  There are many people caring for elderly parents or relatives at home who do not qualify for this allowance because their partner's earnings are above the qualification limit.  They deserve recognition, even if only £20 to £25 per week.</P>
    <P>On social welfare, I thought the Minister concerned would do something special this year.  The general increase of 3 per cent, in line with inflation, is disappointing.  It will be paid from mid-June. Last year, in a good move, the Minister decided to pay the increases three to four weeks earlier than normal and gave a commitment to make further progress.  It is a pity that will not happen on this occasion.  Many people are angry that the increases announced in January will not be paid until June or July.  It is my hope that in time it will be possible to pay them from April.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent increase for the elderly can be contrasted with the increase of 13 per cent in the allocation for the Arts Council.  I am aware that there are moves to encourage the wider community to take an interest in the arts, but the Arts Council will retain the image that it caters for the pseudo intelligentsia and the well to do in parts of Dublin city and Galway.  This is a clear indication of where the Government's priorities lie on certain matters.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in child benefit. There has been much hype about the large increase in the payment for twins. I have certain reservations about this in terms of the way it will be interpreted and acted upon by some.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to extend the family income supplement scheme to those who are job sharing.  How will this operate in practice?  Will the allowance be payable on a weekly basis or only in the weeks the person concerned is not working?  It is also proposed to reduce the number of hours from 20 to 19.  Will this apply to those participating on the community employment scheme?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> The people living in Dublin northwest were hoping that a commitment would be given by the Minister for the Environment to proceed with the proposed refurbishment project in Ballymun at a cost of £110 million over a period of years.  All they were seeking was the go ahead to commence the planning process.</P>
    <P>In the Budget Statement the Minister for Finance indicated that in future the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs will hear pre-budget submissions. I pay tribute to the chairman of the committee, Deputy Jim Mitchell, for broadening its remit in the past year. When this matter was discussed recently it was mentioned that there was a possibility the committee would get stuck with all the delegations which make pre-budget submissions to the Minister.  If he expects the committee to fulfil this role, he should give a commitment that he will take its recommendations into account in preparing the budget.</P>
    <P>In regard to the £80 subsidy payable when an employer takes on a person who has been unemployed for one year or more, will an employer be able to offer £20 to a married man with three children who will then be able to claim family income supplement?  I am eagerly awaiting the publication of the rules and regulations for the scheme.  It has potential but I hope it will not be abused.  Employers should be required to pay a minimum amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget is the key point in each year where the Government outlines its priorities. Coming into this budget the Government had two objectives: first, to ensure that public spending is contained and that an environment which would allow for sustained economic growth and <Col N="58" /> increased competitiveness is nurtured and developed; and second, to ensure that the problems associated with persistent high unemployment, poverty and social exclusion are addressed.  On this front progress has been made but much remains to be done.  Those of us who joined Fine Gael to pursue a just society still have a hill to climb.  I will return to this point later.</P>
      <P>Prudence in overall Government spending has helped create a climate where economic growth is at last converting to job creation on an admirable scale.  This concept of prudence must remain a cornerstone of economic policy. Government spending in 1996 will grow by only 2.5 per cent in real terms. This compares with a figure of 6.4 per cent under a recent Administration.  By keeping this tight rein on the public finances we have brought mortgage rates to their lowest level for 30 years. If interest rates were now at the same level as a few years ago, a mortgage holder with a £40,000 mortgage would have to find £130 per month more.</P>
      <P>Low interest rates are the key to the economic growth which we are currently enjoying.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the International Financial Services Centre, I can see the practical benefits of that growth with 11 cranes on the Custom House Docks site and a further 174,000 sq. ft. of office space to become available by the end of 1996.  Already more than 2,500 people are directly employed in the centre in over 380 projects with commitments from existing companies for a further 1,700 jobs.</P>
      <P>Overall, as a result of our record economic growth, the increase in employment in 1995 was 45,000 &mdash; 45,000 people now have the opportunity of work and more will follow in 1996 as a result of this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government's strategy is not based on the old discredited notion that a rising tide will lift all boats.  Economic growth of the magnitude currently being enjoyed will launch some boats but without special targeted measures many <Col N="59" /> other boats will remain stuck on the sand banks.</P>
    <P>Some have criticised this budget for its emphasis on targeting support to help people back into the workplace.  I ask those critics what sort of society they want to live in.  Are they happy to live in a society where people turn in despair to drugs and then to crime to feed the habit?  Are they prepared to write off entire communities as irrelevent? Do they not ponder when they read that 75 per cent of the prisoners in Mountjoy come from five deprived areas of Dublin?  Do they not believe action is required when they hear that less than 10 per cent of children in the south inner city of Dublin take up third level courses while better off parts of the same county enjoy a third level participation rate of 50 per cent and upwards?  I want to live in a better society than that and as a politician, particularly as a Minister of State with responsibility for local development, I intend to do everything possible to bring about a fairer society.</P>
    <P>No one claims the budget will solve all our problems.  However, it is a step in the right direction.  I welcome, in particular, the 5,000 places provided on the back-to-work scheme, the 5,000 places on the new work trial scheme and the extension of the VTOS scheme to give a further 1,000 unemployed people an opportunity to return to education, enhance their skills or acquire new ones that are required in the increasingly competitive jobs market.  I also welcome the 1,000 full time places reserved in community employment for people over 35 years who have been unemployed for more than three years and the 5,000 places on the £80 per week recruitment subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>Those measures are a clear demonstration of the Government's desire to tackle the cancer of long-term unemployment. There are also other pro-job measures in the budget designed to tackle the poverty trap.  For too long the lack of interaction between the tax and welfare systems has acted as a barrier to <Col N="60" /> people coming off welfare.  I welcome the provisions which allow the retention of the medical card for three years by those who enter employment after one year of unemployment, the retention of the child dependant allowance for 13 weeks by people unemployed for 12 months and the improvement in the family income supplement.  These measures, together with the extension of the area allowance scheme to all 38 designated partnership areas &mdash; which I announced before Christmas &mdash; will help bridge the wide cavern from the world of welfare to the world of work.</P>
    <P>However, I find it difficult to pat myself on the back when one of my constituents receives £75 per week, pays £1.25 in PRSI, lives alone and must bear the full running costs of his home since his mother's death.  He does not qualify for family income supplement or the dole, because he works more than two hours a day, and, according to the Eastern Health Board, he does not qualify for supplementary welfare, a matter I am pursuing.  Obviously, the just society has not yet arrived and much remains to be done.  Nonetheless, the budget measures are part of a concerted attack by this Government on disadvantage and unemployment.</P>
    <P>The local development programme, for which I have responsibility, is in the forefront of that attack and has a special and signal role to play in creating a just society.  I do not believe many Members, not to mention the public, understand what is meant by local development.  It is my ambition that people in every parish in poor areas will become as familiar with it as they have with the trade union movement.  My priority is to provide funding to get the partnership companies up and running.  I have undertaken a series of regional meetings with community leaders to explain how local development works.  I am holding a seminar on local development for members of the Oireachtas which I hope will be well attended.  It is important that Members are able to talk about local development and its potential for the removal of disadvantage and <Col N="61" /> the creation of a more just society. Local development is more advanced here in practice and in theory than in other member states.  In time, I hope we can present it to Europe as a way of tackling disadvantage in a real and targeted way.</P>
    <P>Local development is about giving the long-term unemployed, the disadvantaged and early school leavers a new opportunity.  It is about equipping them with skills and opportunities to solve their problems.  Rather than grandiose State imposed initiatives, local development offers an initiative from the bottom up &mdash; subsidiary in action.  It is about local communities analysing their problems and proposing community based solutions in partnership with the State, State agencies and the social partners. It may lack sufficient provision for democratic accountability, but I am examining this matter.</P>
    <P>The budget for the local development initiative is £111 million and job targets are set at 8,000 up to 1999.  Area Development Management Limited, the national intermediary with overall responsibility for administering local development, has already allocated almost £17.5 million to eight partnership areas as well as £300,000 to the 39 groups in non-designated areas to prepare their development plans.  That £111 million will be spent on local development in the next four years.</P>
    <P>In 1996 funding will be allocated to the remaining 30 partnership companies and to groups in non-designated areas. In addition, nearly £16 million will be allocated under the URBAN initiative to the north side of Cork city, west Tallaght, Clondalkin and Ballymun in Dublin. Those who accuse me of steering an unfair share to my constituency should take note.  For the first time an integrated, tailored and targeted approach is being adopted to deal with disadvantage. A menu will be available, ranging from psychological services to the availability of information technology, trauncy tracking and pre-school facilities, from which partnership companies, <Col N="62" /> with the assistance of an educational coordinator, can select.  A child who regularly falls behind in school is a clear candidate for long-term unemployment. That is why education is central to resolving this problem.</P>
    <P>In the area of training, FÁS is required to draw up a framework agreement with the partnership company to supply services which the partnership company identifies as needed within its area.  Funds are available to deal with environmental improvements.  No one would want to locate a business near dereliction.  Funds are also available for estate management training for tenants. While the area of estate management rests with the local authority and the Minister for the Environment, estate management training in partnership areas for tenants is a matter for the partnership company.  Grants are also available for those who set up enterprises with one to five employees in disadvantaged areas.  Mentoring services and advice will also be available.  The local development programme will be integrated, educational and environmentally friendly.  It will provide estate management training and money for jobs.  It involves 12 pilot schemes and was not drawn up overnight.  This programme will work and can be used as an example to other member states.</P>
    <P>During our Presidency of the EU a conference on local development will be held with that objective in mind.  I have already commissioned the OECD to produce a report on local development. I urge all Deputies to familiarise themselves with local development which has great potential to tackle long-term unemployment and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>For the first time an integrated, tailored &mdash; the programme for parts of Dublin will be different from that for the west for example &mdash; and targeted approach is being adopted to tackle the problem of disadvantage.  Local development, in tandem with the measures announced in the budget, can and will change our society for the better. My objective is to establish local development in every needy parish, <Col N="63" /> urban and rural, and to ensure that it becomes as well known and as effective as the credit union movement is known to be in meeting its remit.</P>
    <P>An important part of local development assisted by the budget is community development.  Basically this is about helping people to develop their capacity to influence development. Experience shows that such participation requires high levels of self-confidence and leadership skills.  The allocation of an additional 1,000 VTOS places means that more than 8,000 unemployed people will engage in full-time education at second and third level in the coming year.  The local development programme can provide further funding for activities such as training in communication, leadership and facilitation skills.</P>
    <P>As a Christian Democrat, I believe that every person counts and is entitled to equality of opportunity.  However, not everyone has an equal chance in the society in which we live today.  While the budget and the local development programme will help to give them that chance we have much further to go.  Parties in Opposition spend their time setting out visionary documents on areas of public policy.  In Government we should map out our journey for justice. As Martin Luther King said: &ldquo;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some critics have argued that an obsession with meeting the Maastricht economic and monetary union criteria is leading the Government to take wrong economic options.  They argue as if economic and monetary union were some theoretical central banker's invention rather than an essential element in the development of our economy and the creation of new jobs.  By creating economic and monetary union and the single currency we will enable Europe to realise fully its economic potential and to place itself centre stage in the global economy.  As a country which is largely dependent on trade Ireland should benefit more than most from this <Col N="64" /> development.  I welcome the debate which is now beginning on the single currency as it is essential that we prepare fully for the euro and are in a position to join from day one.</P>
    <P>As I said, I wish to live in a fairer society and I firmly believe that the budget can help us achieve that.  The 800,000 people on social welfare have 700,000 dependants.  At a time of prosperity, the sign of a mature and caring society is its wish to help others share in that prosperity rather than be left behind.  We can tackle disadvantage, unemployment and the sense of hopelessness experienced by some people in our society.  We have sought, and have responsibility, to lead people out of that hopelessness.  While the budget is a help in this regard, we have a long way to go before we achieve a just society.  For Christians, Lent is a time for penance while Easter is a time of great renewal. When I was in Syria last week I wondered if I was really on the road to Damascus.  Justice starts with each of us and within us, and it has no place for the bomb and bullet.  A sense of justice will enable us to deal with the law and order problem, with gardaí, judges, administrators and politicians carrying out their duty without fear of vested interests.  Justice will provide a real opportunity of access to third level education to the underclass in our society who cannot yet aspire to such education.</P>
    <P>While dealing harshly with the drug pusher and violent bully, justice will also address the need for prison reform and the provision of decent levels of local authority estate management which must deal with the real environmental issues, that is the conditions in which people live, particularly in inner city flat complexes where decent levels of order, control and partnership need to be fostered. Justice will admit the need for action when an inner city mother loses four of her children to AIDS and it will not ignore the problem until it reaches rural communities.</P>
    <P>Ministers and TDs are transient people.  It is a great privilege to be a <Col N="65" /> Member of the national Parliament and to be an office holder is a bonus.  We are all human and each of us has our own concerns and commitments.  I have a high regard for my political colleagues and I am aware of the genuine desire among the great majority of them to serve the public.  However, somehow our collective worth is not equal to the sum of our individual worth.</P>
    <P>The next millennium will begin in four years time and now is a good starting point for serious reflection.  The recent IRA bombs demonstrate how necessary that reflection is.  At a time of unparalleled growth and unprecedented levels of wealth we should remember that we pass this way but once.  What we do today will be history and we should ensure that our history tells a story of justice.  Never has there been a greater need for justice nor such an opportunity to advance it.  To quote Cicero, &ldquo;the fundamentals of justice are that no one shall suffer wrong and that the public good be served&rdquo;.  What better term of reference is there for a journey for justice, a charted course to the next millennium and beyond?</P>
    <P>We are all capable of committing the seven deadly sins and we as politicians are capable of appealing to the pride, hate or envy in society.  What society yearns for is justice.  A journey for justice which sets out to promote the idea that no one shall suffer wrong and that the public good will be served is a journey which the people want to make.  We can build on what we have achieved.  We know where we are starting from and by pinpointing our destination we can from time to time measure the progress of our journey.  Much needs to be done and the challenge is great.  The reward for public office is in achieving set goals and as we set about implementing the programme, A Government of Renewal we should also set our sights on the longer journey for justice.</P>

      <P>Budget day was so long ago that the public has forgotten what was contained in the budget.  Even though the public may not react to the <Col N="66" /> budget it should be remembered that its consequences are extremely important to the lives of most people.  During the short time at my disposal I wish to make a number of unconnected points.</P>
      <P>If I were asked the greatest achievement of the budget I would have to say it was the ability to keep borrowing at a low level.  This may mean little to the ordinary punter but at some stage most people will have to borrow money.  One of the problems of high interest rates is that it is very difficult to make money on borrowed money.  The biggest financial contract most people are likely to enter into is for the purchase of a house. Farmers who want to purchase tractors or animals will invariably have to borrow money.</P>
      <P>One great problem for many years was that the State was the biggest competitor for available money.  If it wants to borrow substantial sums for the everyday running of the State, so much pressure is placed on the money market that ordinary investors have to pay more for the money available.  As the Minister said, against that background we have not had lower interest rates for 30 years.  I am not an economist but while this period of low interest rates and inflation continues, many projects are making good ground and I hope those running them will be able to take on whatever competition comes their way, because due to external circumstances far beyond our control, we will not always have low interest rates. I compliment the Government and the Minister for Finance because the budgets of this year and last and next year's also, one hopes &mdash; ensured that the State will not be competing against ordinary borrowers, which is an important starting point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have said they will not gain much from the budget because they will pay as much income tax as ever and pensioners will argue that a 3 per cent increase is not a great deal on top of their current earnings.  I accept that it is a step in the right direction that pensioners and the disabled receive <Col N="67" /> increases greater than the rate of inflation but there is no point in overstating the case &mdash; people will not throw their caps in the air after a budget, because budgets do not work that way.</P>
    <P>It is important to steer the economy so that enterprise will flourish.  On the radio this morning Dr. Terry Baker of the ESRI stated that from his viewpoint as an economist, we would have a good year.  Given that the economy will grow by between 5 and 6 per cent, the inflation rate is just over 2 per cent and borrowings are so low, we are clearly in the middle of an economic hump.  He reckoned there would be 31,000 new jobs by the end of the year &mdash; I would prefer to see another 30,000 but this is a significant increase.</P>
    <P>Recently, there was an all out attack in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> on the Fine Gael element of the budget, which stated that quangos and white elephants were being bred again and money was being spent for the wrong purposes.  We have no shortage of white elephants, set up by Governments of all hues, but if the tide raises some or most boats, the rewards should be spent fairly evenly across the country.  I cannot see why anyone would object to county roads being repaired so that they do not have potholes one could bury a rabbit in. Why should country people put up with uneven surfaces?  The Government decision to pump million of pounds into country roads, although not enough, is much better than anything done before.</P>
    <P>The budget made it easier for those paying inheritance tax on the transfer of either farms or businesses to other family members.  I have long held the principle than when young people inherit, there should be no financial impediment to them making progress even before they get possession of a shop, van, farm, etc.  We should be in a position to transfer property for productive reasons, particularly to family members, so they will have a chance to establish themselves &mdash; they will have other big start-up costs.  Afterwards, a tax regime should ensure that if they genuinely <Col N="68" /> earn in excess of a taxable income, they should pay their fair share.  It is bad policy to have a system whereby people who inherit businesses, shops, farms, etc., should have to pay huge amounts of inheritance tax when a property has been transferred.  They should be given every chance in life and taxed if they make a profit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern referred to crime and I make an appeal to the Minister in that regard concerning the Finance Bill. He indicated he wished to give some financial help to people living in lonely areas &mdash; such as my part of the west &mdash; and the elderly living alone to ensure they installed the correct type of alarm. Telecom Éireann has a facility whereby if a person hears an intruder, he can press a mechanism kept with him, even in bed, to notify a next door neighbour and the gardaí.  That would save a huge amount of personal injuries and I sincerely hope that change will be made.</P>

      <P>This country needs a tough Minister for Finance.  Hard decisions must be made and he must not be dictated to by Democratic Left, as he was on this occasion.  All that party wants to do is borrow more and more. Ireland was in good financial shape when our former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds and former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern left office.  Let us hope this Coalition Government will not leave us in the same condition as in the aftermath of the 1982 to 1987 Coalition. After that tough decisions had to be taken by the then Fianna Fáil Government led by Mr. Charles Haughey and the Minister for Finance. Mr. MacSharry on taking office.  These paved the way for the current economic situation.  We all had to suffer cut-backs because of the inherited national debt. <Col N="69" /> which had doubled.  The country had almost gone down the tubes but Fianna Fáil turned the position around.  I pay tribute to the then Fine Gael Opposition, led by Deputy Dukes.  His party followed the &ldquo;Tallaght strategy&rdquo; of supporting the minority Fianna Fáil Government for the betterment of the country.  At that time Labour and Democratic Left voted against everything. They were more interested in criticising our party leader and Taoiseach at the time and telling untruths in the Dáil which led to the beef tribunal which cost this country millions of pounds.  That money would have been better spent on promoting industry in the west.  Would it not have been better for Deputy Pat Rabbitte, one of the chief spokespersons against the beef industry, to have tried to promote industry in Tallaght in his own constituency where there is 78.5 per cent unemployment? Would it not have been better for him to do something about the drug problem in his constituency which has got out of hand and where the mothers of school-going children are taking drugs?</P>
      <P>We have heard from Deputy Gay Mitchell and others about low interest rates, etc.  These are the result of the 1987 budget and the hard decisions that had to be made at that time, but it is not we who are in Government to reap the benefit but Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left.  Are they thinking about the end of the millennium when we will no longer receive money from Europe?  As a member of the Council of Europe I have been in both eastern and western Europe and there are better incentives for employment in Poland now than there are in Ireland.  Before Deputy Albert Reynolds left office as Taoiseach, he signed for Masonite to set up in County Leitrim where there has been a decline in population.  Five hundred people are employed there and, it is hoped, another 500 people will be employed.  That has been a great boost to the west, but it is the only industry that has set up in the west in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> The Minister for Finance intends to borrow over £1 billion this year to run this country, but he should instead repay some of our national debt.</P>
    <P>On the subject of crime, is the Minister for Social Welfare so much out of touch that he thinks pensioners in the least populated areas of the west are so affluent that they are paying tax?  The vast majority of old age pensioners in my constituency are living on non-contributory pensions.  They do not pay tax and, therefore will not benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>Very little was done in this budget to benefit my constituency.  No industry has set up there in the past few years. The only jobs in my area are those under the community schemes which, although welcome, are only a drop in the ocean given present unemployment figures.  Rural Ireland has always suffered under Fine Gael and Labour and is now suffering under Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>Farming is a way of life in rural Ireland, but little was done for farmers in the budget.  Farmers who bought cattle to fatten in their sheds during the winter will probably lose £100 a head because the Minister was unsuccessful in obtaining a cattle export subsidy on his many visits to Europe.  Because of our wet winters cattle must be housed during the winter.  This winter was the driest ever in the west, but the Minister has done away with the grant for slatted houses because they were over subscribed last year.  If that is the case the Minister should have made a new application to Europe for money to enable people to build slatted houses.</P>
    <P>The budget does not promote indigenous industry.  I welcome the money made available for county roads by the Minister for the Environment. It was badly needed. However, we also need a great deal of money for national primary roads.  The Collooney-Sligo by-pass is well under way but the road from Collooney to the County Roscommon border needs to be upgraded, widened and relined <Col N="71" /> and I hope money will be made available for that.  If we want to have industry we must have good roads and the more money that is made available for them the better.  It is hoped that before 1999 we will get our fair share because after that I do not expect we will get much money from Europe. Poland and other countries will apply to join the EU and they will get much of the money we were getting up to now.  It is up to us to make sure we get money from the Cohesion Funds for our roads.</P>
    <P>On the provision of housing in rural areas, if we want to increase the population in rural Ireland and encourage people to live and work there we will have to give them housing grants of £8,000 to £10,000.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the planting of trees in rural Ireland. Recently I received a letter from a constituent of mine who bought a house in a very scenic part of rural Ireland with the Ox Mountains at the rear and a beautiful landscape to the front.  The area was planted with trees which obscure his view of the Ox Mountains and beautiful landscape. Planning permission should be required for tree planting.  At present it applies only to the planting of areas in excess of 200 hectares.</P>
    <P>How do we encourage people to take up employment?  At a recent seminar it was stated that a person with four children is better off unemployed because he or she will receive a medical card, mortgage subsidy and other benefits.  If people could retain the medical card, it might encourage them to seek employment. I know a person who wishes to set up an industry in a rural village but cannot do so as the village does not have three phase electricity.  This should be available in every village, as well as a sewerage scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me.  Despite high <Col N="72" /> economic growth, spending is unacceptably high and instead of 2 per cent it will be 5 or 6 per cent.  Rather than tinkering with issues we should have long-term strategic planning.  We must tackle the problems and not adopt &ldquo;safe&rdquo; budgets.</P>
      <P>Many social welfare recipients would gladly forego their recent increase if it was redirected to the justice area and they could feel safe in their homes. People wanted a reduction in taxation and changes in PRSI.  There is great economic growth and the financial markets are buoyant but we have not taken advantage of that.</P>
      <P>We did not tackle the problems in the health area.  Nurses are threatening to go on strike.  Despite the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> teachers were given increases but the position of the caring profession was put on the long finger.  No money was provided to deal with problems in the accident and emergency service, waiting lists, etc.  We need a long-term strategy.  The hepatitis C issue has not been resolved.  There are delays in the orthopaedic, cardiac surgery and other areas.  An extra £10 million was allocated for mental handicap services, of which £4 million was for capital expenditure.  Some £3 million was spent in 1995.  That leaves £3 million for this year which is totally inadequate, particularly when we consider the numbers on waiting lists for placement in hospitals, community units and respite care.  It is unfortunate that we do not look after the weaker sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Social Welfare for increasing the carer's and children's allowances.  However, we have given increases across the board and that is not good management. Money must be targeted at areas of greatest need.  Employment in peripheral areas is often neglected.  There are employment black spots in Dublin but the infrastructure is in place there unlike in remote rural areas.  In Ballina where there are 3,000 people unemployed out of a population of 8,000-9,000, an advance factory was financed privately.  The IDA is afraid to take <Col N="73" /> risks and does not erect advance factories. Short-term employment schemes such as FÁS schemes and so on will not solve the unemployment problem in the long-term.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's proposals in that area were more concrete.  We said that we would try to get 4,000 people off the long-term unemployed register immediately and give them long-term employment rather than tinkering at the edges with small schemes.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 55 and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of what more might be done to enhance the security of the elderly in the light of the recent attacks has been under consideration in my Department. I decided to establish a task force <Col N="74" /> in response to an ICTU pre-budget submission seeking assistance for elderly people with regard to their security.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement, provided for tax relief for the purchase cost of alarm systems for persons aged 65 and over living alone.  I announced in this House on Wednesday, 24 January, that I was setting up this task force to examine the situation of persons, mainly those receiving social welfare pensions, who could not avail of the tax allowance initiative announced by the Minister for Finance because their incomes were below the relevant tax exemption limits. I also indicated then that I had asked for it to report by the end of February.</P>
    <P>The task force members are drawn from various Government Departments and organisations which have experience and expertise in this area.  The full membership was given in response to written parliamentary questions on 1 February 1996.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the report of the task force at the end of the month and I can assure the Deputies that its recommendations will receive full and sympathetic consideration at the earliest practicable date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the tax concession in the budget will not help people in this situation to any great extent?  Elderly people living alone in rural areas, where there is so much disquiet, are looking for an actual contribution towards the cost.  I understand that this equipment costs in the region of £250.  I encourage the Minister to make a contribution towards that cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years <Col N="76" /> or over, as well as certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. The scheme provides free travel at off-peak periods to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. Currently, about 470,000 people qualify for free travel at an estimated annual cost this year of some £32.7 million.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked if I will give consideration to extending the free travel scheme to enable the long-term unemployed to attend job interviews or to enable employed people, who were formerly long-term unemployed, to attend work within a specified travel range.  An extension of that nature would have policy, cost and administrative implications bearing in mind that the scheme is based on spare seating capacity being available on public transport during off-peak hours only.  I am not convinced that the Deputy's proposals would represent the most effective use of limited resources.</P>
    <P>Priority has been given by this Government to a wide range of pro-employment measures designed to encourage and enable unemployed people, particularly those unemployed for a longer period, to return to work or improve their levels of education, skills and work experience.  In relation to the long-term unemployed, the 1996 budget, for example, provided for an additional 5,000 back to work allowances this year, retention of child dependant allowances for 13 weeks after taking up work, increased access to community employment, a special employer subsidy to foster additional employment opportunities and an increase in the number of second chance education places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the situation where an advertised job is located some distance from a long-term unemployed applicant, would the Minister not consider providing limited free travel passes &mdash; not an extension of the scheme &mdash; as a gesture towards reducing the number of long-term unemployed?  Such people cannot afford to travel to job interviews, <Col N="77" /> which in many cases are for vacancies which have already been filled.  Does the Minister see any merit in giving a limited number of free travel passes to the long-term unemployed who wish to attend job interviews?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy's intentions are motivated by a desire to facilitate the reintegration of the long-term unemployed into the workforce.  In practice, however, his proposals would be unworkable as it would not be practicable to provide temporary passes for the express purpose of attending interviews.  Equally, providing a full pass to the long-term unemployed, conditional on its use only for the purpose of attending job interviews, would impose an impossible burden on CIÉ personnel or any other transport operator who would have to seek proof of the purpose of the journey.</P>
      <P>In situations where an unemployed person is not in a position to pay the costs of attending a job interview out of their own resources, they have the option of approaching the community welfare officer in their local clinic.  If the community welfare officer considers that their needs come within the scope of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme they can be facilitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of long-term unemployment is the highest on record and from April to October 1995 it increased from 48.1 per cent to 48.5 per cent.  We have to look at all avenues and measures to reduce it.  This is one such measure and I press the Minister to at least look at it further to see if it could be introduced in a limited way to help those who wish to obtain employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>Under section 172(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, people in full-time education are not eligible to receive assistance, including rent supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  However, Article 7 of S.I. 382 of 1995 provides for a number of exceptions to this exclusion.  Persons participating in a vocational training opportunities scheme; a second level initiative scheme; a third level allowance scheme; and a part-time education initiative scheme may continue to receive their full weekly social welfare payment and may retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which they may have been receiving prior to participating on one of these schemes.</P>
      <P>Until recently, successful applicants for the vocational training opportunities scheme, the second level initiative scheme and the third level allowance scheme had to be at least 23 years of age and had to have been in receipt of an unemployment payment or lone parent's allowance for at least 12 months. However, last year I announced an improvement to the qualifying conditions for these schemes.  The age requirement has been reduced to 21 years of age and applicants need only be in receipt of an unemployment payment or lone parent's allowance for six months to qualify for the schemes and, therefore, rent allowance if they were in receipt of such allowance at the time of applying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of extending entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance rent <Col N="79" /> supplements to all lone parents in full-time education would have resource implications which I am unable to meet at present but I intend to keep the matter under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his broad reply.  While I appreciate he has made an effort to reduce the age limit, it is still too high.  People wishing to pursue education should be compensated, not discriminated against.  The Department should be prepared to assist them financially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will appreciate from my reply that I am sympathetic to the case of lone parents seeking to take up third level education.  Last year I reduced the qualifying age from 23 to 21 and the length of time a person would have to be on unemployment assistance or lone parent's allowance in order to qualify. The extension of rent allowance to these students would inevitably increase pressure to extend the allowance to all students, most of whom live away from home.  The cost of such extension would be £84 million, on top of the £60 million paid in rent supplements.  There are, therefore, serious cost implications.</P>
      <P>Bearing that in mind I am sympathetic to the position of those people because there is evidence to show that lone parents, particularly the younger age group, tend to be trapped in poverty as a result of their circumstances.  I am anxious to assist them in extricating themselves from that problem.  I am keeping the matter under review and would like to find a solution, which is not easy given the cost implications involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 12, 38, 54 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the social welfare code, a person is required to apply for a social welfare payment within a specified time.  For example, in the case of pensions, the application <Col N="81" /> must be made not later than three months following the time the person becomes eligible for pension.  Where a person fails to apply within the prescribed time, he or she can be disqualified for receiving payment prior to the date of application.  However, there are provisions for backdating applications where the person shows that there was a good cause for the delay in making the application.  In general, applications for social welfare payments can be backdated for six months.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in replies to earlier questions, my Department has been reviewing the existing arrangements for backdating applications for social welfare payments.  The issues involved in the review have turned out to be more difficult than originally anticipated.  In particular it appears that relaxation of the current legislative requirements could have significant cost implications and would, therefore, have to be considered in the light of other priorities.</P>
    <P>My Department is not aware of any court decision which indicated that arrears of social welfare could be paid for a period in excess of six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is unfair that people, particularly widows, who, through no fault of their own and perhaps as a result of bad advice, apply for a pension more than six months after they become entitled to it are deemed eligible only from the time of application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The present system has applied for a number of years, long before I became Minister for Social Welfare.  Within months of coming into the Department I undertook to have the matter reviewed and that review has proceeded since then.  It has been interrupted to some extent by the fact that the Department is engaged in much new work initiated by me and the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way of overcoming the problem would be to ensure information is better targeted.  It is important that people apply in time for their entitlements and <Col N="82" /> that the level of late claims is reduced. From the review to date the main reason recorded for late applications in the case of retirement pension and old age contributory pension is that claimants are not aware of their entitlements. Some claimants assume they are not entitled to a pension if they are in employment and others do not realise they have reached the qualifying age. Similarly in the case of survivor's pension, the main reason seems to be lack of knowledge about entitlement.  For instance, survivors of public servants, particularly teachers, do not claim as they are not aware they can receive survivor's pension in addition to an occupational pension.</P>
    <P>The priority for my Department is to seek better ways of targeting the information to those who may be approaching the point where they are eligible, or those sectors of employees who might for various reasons become eligible. That is my intention in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree what is at stake here is equity and fairness? If people are overpaid in error, they are obliged to repay the amount involved which, in some cases, may be deducted from their salaries over a period of several years.  However, many people eligible for a survivor's pension may not be aware of their entitlement and do not apply for it on time.  Such people should be entitled to that benefit from their date of eligibility.  That is only equitable.  The Minister should be more sympathetic towards the people concerned and give an undertaking that he will introduce a legislative measure to facilitate this necessary change.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that my undertaking a review of this issue within months of coming into office, despite the fact that this position had pertained for years previously, is an indication that I am interested and concerned about it.  It would be better for me to wait until the review is completed before indicating to <Col N="83" /> the House what action we may or may not be able to take on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Ombudsman has reflected negatively on the Department's attitude to this issue?  I can only assume it will be a matter of time before it is referred to the European court.  Will he agree it would be better and more equitable to take the initiative now and make the necessary legislative change to resolve the problem?</P>

      <P>While it was my intention to seek Government approval to have the White Paper published by the end of 1995, due to the introduction of a number of new policy initiatives within the Department it was not possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the delay in publishing this important document which is long awaited by the voluntary organisations. Last October in reply to a question I tabled the Minister promised that the White Paper would be published by the end of last year.  It was virtually finalised before the previous Minister, Deputy Woods, left office.  The Minister explained he wanted to make an input to the document and to consider the final draft before publication, but that was 15 months ago.  The delay in its publication is not fair to voluntary organisations. Will the Minister explain why it has taken 15 months to clarify a document which was virtually finalised before the former Minister left office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, I have been a Minister since the beginning of 1995.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government decided in 1990 to publish a White Paper on voluntary activity to set out a clear framework for partnership between the State and the voluntary sector and to develop a cohesive strategy to support voluntary activity, and preliminary work was undertaken in that regard.  The publication of that White Paper in 1994 was incorporated as an objective in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, but it was not published then.  This area needs to be properly addressed.  Previous Ministers for Social Welfare took a considerable length of time to develop their thinking on the matter, up to four years from the date on which it was first promised to the date the former Minister, Deputy Woods, proposed to present a draft document to Government. As I indicated in previous replies, when I became Minister I considered the draft White Paper did not adequately reflect the various developments that had occurred in the four <Col N="85" /> years it had taken to draft it to that point.  As a new Minister I considered it appropriate to revise the draft at that stage and I have been doing that during the past year.  As I indicated, I hope to be in a position shortly to circulate the revised draft to my Government colleagues for their observations and, on receipt of those, I will present the final draft to Government for approval.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about the Minister's use of the word &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  We have heard many promises from the Department and about delivery on them shortly.  The Minister should realise that he is the Minister for Social Welfare and he must not constantly blame Fianna Fáil for delays in his Department.  The Minister is 15 months in the Department and he has not made progress on many issues.  The disabled person's maintenance allowance is a case in point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better if the Deputy awaited publication of the White Paper when she would know if adequate provision has been made for it.  We will not know precisely what, if any, funding will be required arising from the White Paper, bearing in mind that a White Paper is a statement of Government policy on a particular area.  It is not my intention to blame Fianna Fáil for the fact that it took four years to draft the White Paper to the stage it was at before the former Minister, Deputy Woods, left office.  I made that point to indicate that this is not an area about which it is easy to draw conclusions.  The voluntary and community sector is very diverse.  A range of Departments have relationships with that sector and they address its needs and work with it in different ways.  That has evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  To prepare a White Paper reflecting that reality and seek to create a partnership between the State, through its agencies, Departments and the voluntary community sector, is not something that should be brushed off with a few platitudes.  Rather we must examine it thoroughly and develop a serious policy with some prospect of implementation.  It would be very easy to produce a White Paper, full of pious platitudes, projections and predictions but I am keen to publish a White Paper clearly stating Government policy, with <Col N="87" /> a realistic prospect of being implemented by this and future Administrations. It is important to bear in mind that there have been a number of developments in the four years since the decision was taken to prepare a White Paper.  As a new Minister I considered it would be important to reflect on those developments and ensure they were incorporated in the White Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In the White Paper and Charter will the Minister address the chronic funding problem of voluntary bodies which, since he assumed office, have completed two further applications, one for last year and another for this year, to several Government Departments for various grants? Would he agree that the Government has failed to provide core funding for such voluntary bodies or to deliver a specific multi-annual system of funding for them?  Does the Minister intend addressing that issue in the White Paper in addition to the overall funding for respite care?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the need for a clear view of how the relationship between State agencies and the voluntary sector can be developed.  My Department is leading the way in providing core and multi-annual funding under our community development programme and through the monetary advice and budgeting service.  My predecessor deserves credit for having initiated both schemes, on having had the foresight to perceive that core, multi-annual funding was a necessity for the long-term requirements of voluntary organisations.  However, it is also necessary to bear in mind that the services provided by the voluntary sector need to be carefully dove-tailed with other services such as those within health boards and local authorities.  For example, groups of voluntary organisations cannot be allowed to dictate how public moneys are spent because they may decide a particular service needs to be provided and, through lobbying and <Col N="88" /> public pressure, succeed in getting funding allocated for that purpose, perhaps to the detriment of priorities already established by this House.  There is need to be careful in determining how we move forward in developing that relationship, in the first place ensuring that the voluntary sector remains independent and, in the second, that it has a worthwhile partnership relationship with the State agencies that also provide core services.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is considerable uncertainty <Col N="90" /> about the payment of the Christmas bonus?  In replying, he said its payment was dependent on budgetary considerations, which is why it is not included in the budget at the beginning of any year. Would he agree that it would be better for him to take such a decision now and have it included in the annual budget, thus guaranteeing a specific, minimum level of bonus rather than allow the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement to continue?</P>

      <P>While funding for the Christmas bonus clearly has not been included in the budgetary arithmetic for any year since its introduction in 1980, it has been paid annually by all successive Governments regardless of their composition.  However, the rate of bonus paid has varied from year to year, as have the categories of recipients. Since 1980 the number of categories of eligible recipients has been increased rather than reduced.  The level of the bonus has been reduced at various stages and increased at others.  For example, when first introduced in 1980, it was a 100 per cent bonus; some years later it was reduced to 60 per cent.  It was subsequently increased to 70 per cent and to 75 per cent in 1993, 1994 and last year.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree it would be a neater budgetary exercise to include the Christmas bonus?  Sometimes it may be regarded as a political bonus for a Government to announce, prior to Christmas, that a bonus will be awarded, often in response to parliamentary questions tabled at that time.  Since it has been paid since 1980, would the Minister not agree that a round figure should be included in the annual budget since, in essence, it has come to be perceived as an entitlement?</P>

      <P>There is an argument on both sides.  One argument is that it would be neater to have the Christmas bonus included in the budgetary arithmetic and the amount in terms of payment fixed, the categories and so <Col N="91" /> forth.  The other side of the argument is that if there is pressure in any year, as in past years, on the budgetary arithmetic, there might be a tendency to reduce it because it is a bonus and not a weekly payment on which people budget their weekly existence.  There would be pressure to reduce it because there would be pressure on the budgetary arithmetic. Having examined both arguments I am in favour, for the moment at any rate, of maintaining the current position.</P>

      <P>Under existing provisions, an increase of weekly social welfare entitlement is payable in respect <Col N="93" /> of a spouse or partner where they are not in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right and do not have income in excess of £60 per week.</P>
      <P>Increasing the present income limit of £60 would not resolve the existing problem whereby a beneficiary loses entitlement to the adult dependant allowance and half of the increase payable for dependent children where the income of the spouse or partner exceeds the income limit.  This issue could probably best be addressed by the introduction of a tapered withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance where the income of the spouse or partner is within specified income limits.</P>
      <P>A number of options for a tapered withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance were examined by my Department in the context of this year's budget.  One such option involved reducing the rate of the allowance by £1 for each £2 of earnings in excess of the £60 income limit and the cost of applying this measure to short-term payments only is estimated at £27 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>This measure was not proceeded with, however, in the light of other priorities which will be provided for in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill, 1996.  These priorities include increasing the weekly rates of social welfare payments in real terms thereby bringing the rates closer to those recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, providing a further increase in the rates of child benefit, the introduction of a new one parent family payment to replace the existing deserted wife's benefit and lone parent's allowance schemes, the introduction of a number of pro-employment measures which will facilitate unemployed people in seeking and taking up employment and a number of improvements for pensioners on low incomes who find themselves just marginally outside the conditions or income limits for various benefits.</P>

I had a case recently where a lady who was doing some part time catering in a third level establishment was earning £57 per week.  She will be laid off for 14 weeks during the summer.  She was informed she could not work a few hours overtime and, perhaps, earn £65 per week. Can the amount be balanced over the year?  If what this lady has been told is correct, equating the £60 to the £3,100 would help in the knowledge that she will not be working 52 weeks in the year and it would give her the freedom to take work when it was available.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to self employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over <Col N="96" /> would not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  They are, of course, covered for survivor's and orphan's pensions. I presume the Deputy meant to refer to 1988, not 1998, in his question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that if a person was over the age of 56, it was not possible to have ten years' contributions to qualify for a pension.  That is compounded by the 1994 legislation in that if a dependant dies, the survivor automatically receives a pension if they have three years' contributions. Will the Minister of State agree that is harsh on self-employed people who paid their taxes, RSI, PRSI and VAT through the years and whose employees were entitled to all benefits? They now find they are not entitled to this pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions pertaining to qualification were set out in the 1988 Act.  Everybody will agree it would be better from the point of view of the beneficiaries to make the necessary changes but it would require an amendment to the 1988 Act which would have financial implications. Detailed consideration has been given by the Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard, costings done in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned. The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years' contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very <Col N="97" /> costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would also be prohibitive. The question would also arise as to whether the option should be available.</P>

      <P>On the figures referred to by the Minister of State, a review has been carried out by the people concerned which would suggest that, because of the 1994 Act, the number of those affected by this anomaly might be as low as 1,500.  That suggests that the cost involved in correcting it would be negligible and I ask the Minister of State to take that into consideration because these people have been treated harshly.  As the Minister's backup team is costing £200,000, they have a very jaundiced view of how they are being treated by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and myself have spent a considerable amount of time examining this aspect of pension entitlements.  A number of anomalies have arisen over the years, some of which have been addressed, but it will take considerable time, effort and funding to resolve any outstanding issues.  In its final report, &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo;, the National Pensions Board put forward, <i>inter alia,</i> a number of recommendations relating <Col N="98" /> to eligibility for old age pensions, including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime.  However, it also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension be increased from 156, or three years, to 520 or ten years' contributions. The report, and its recommendations, are currently being studied in the Department.</P>
      <P>I should mention also that a number of other problems have arisen over the years with particular reference to the non-qualification of persons with contributions prior to 1953.  Many of those people do not qualify for any pension despite the fact that they might have more than the equivalent number of contributions in the ten year period to which the Deputy refers.  We are attempting to address that anomaly also. I should mention that the parliamentary reply to which the Deputy referred was similar to those given to me when I sat on the opposite side of the House. Unfortunately, the basic information has not changed dramatically because the problem is virtually the same in terms of addressing it financially but the matter is under constant review.</P>

      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, that this is an important issue for self-employed people and farmers.  I cannot understand the Government's attitude to dealing with this anomaly because correcting it would be a popular move.  The issue is being talked about by farming groups, the self-employed and others. Much money has been paid out to social welfare recipients over the years but the people in this sector gave a great deal to this State in terms of taxation and employment.  They were not in a position to make these contributions prior to the introduction of the scheme in 1988.  I agree with the Minister of State when he refers to the anomalies in the pre-1953 scheme in that they should be assisted also but in this case we are talking about a small number of people, <Col N="99" /> approximately 1,500, who contributed to the welfare of this State in many ways over the years.  They are now at the end of their working lives and are faced with having only eight or nine years' contributions paid.  They were unable to pay any more contributions because the system was not in place.  This is the right time to correct that anomaly because the figures can be fully assessed &mdash; perhaps it was not possible to do that in 1988.  The Government should act to help farmers and the self-employed who have contributed to the State in so many ways over the years.</P>

      <P>This area covers a multiplicity of self-employed people, including those who spent part of their lives working both in and outside the public service.  There has been an ongoing review but it is not possible at this stage to determine the changes that will take place in the future.  The anomalies were pointed out in 1988 when the legislation was initiated but it was accepted there was not enough money to extend entitlement.  A base line had to be found for determining eligibility.  The number who may be eligible has grown.  The review is with a view to determining the best way to tackle this issue.  What is most upsetting for the individual is when he or she has up to a dozen contributions in 1955 for example and then work again, not having worked for 20 or 30 years and is excluded by virtue of having the contributions for this short period included in the calculable period over which his or her working life is determined.  That is one anomaly and there is a number of others.</P>

    <P>The National Pensions Board report sets out what would appear to be a reduction of the pension payable in some cases.

For example, if one contributes for 40 years one gets a full pension, for 20 years a half pension and for one year, one fortieth.

We have spent considerable time studying the issue and hope to reach a decision before the end of the year.  We will try to encompass within the changes that may be made the issues that have been raised by Deputies.

The self employed and farmers have paid tax and have created employment and as soon as they had the opportunity <Col N="101" /> to join the scheme they paid into it.  We can look with clarity at what was introduced in 1988 and we can now say that the State took money from these people knowing they would not be entitled to a pension.  That is wrong.

    <P>We are not talking exclusively about the pensions of the self-employed.  A <Col N="102" /> woman in full-time employment who does not have ten years of contributions will not be entitled to a contributory pension.  Am I right in deducing that? To what degree does the review factor in the changes because I think the amount of money involved is excessive.</P>

      <P>All the points raised by Deputy Finucane are being taken into consideration in the context of the review.  That some people would qualify for non-contributory pensions has been considered.  The <i>pro rata</i> element as set out in the National Pensions Board report would mean that some people in receipt of pensions would now be entitled to a lower pension.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's policy at least has the merit that if we keep reviewing it for long enough it will resolve itself.  I have some sympathy with that as a former Minister who knows about using scarce resources. How much is raised under the scheme per annum?</P>

      <P>When I referred to the self-employed I did not mention the farmers because I was afraid that farmerette Lynch would get her hooks on it removing any opportunity to change the scheme.  It appeared at one stage as if we were getting nowhere, but at least the Minister of State has now given a commitment to review it.  A similar promise was given in February last year. To ensure consistency will the Minister of State consider reducing the ten year requirement to three in line with the provisions of the 1994 Act dealing with widows and widowers?  That would prove extremely helpful.</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, legal costs have not been paid in respect of any plaintiff who did not have an entitlement under the arrangements which I introduced in 1995 to give effect to the decision of the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The budget introduced by the Minister for Finance on 23 January was a coherent package designed to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.</P>
      <P>The performance of our economy in 1995 provides evidence of the benefits of this approach.  The overall growth rate as measured by GNP was over 7 per cent.  Investment grew by almost 11 per cent in real terms.  Mortgage and short-term interest rates are at historically low levels and, most importantly, this economic buoyancy has translated into increases in the number of people at work.  During 1995 employment increased by some 45,000.</P>
      <P>This job creation performance has been facilitated by moderate increases in the domestic cost base, and tax and PRSI incentives aimed at producing job-friendly growth.  The 1996 budget continues the process of introducing measures to maximise job creation and help the unemployed back into the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget measures on employees' PRSI and income tax will significantly reduce the direct taxation burden, <Col N="195" /> particularly for those on low pay.  These reductions will make work a more viable option for those confronted with the difficulties caused by the interface of the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has also introduced a series of measures which will be of particular benefit to the small business sector.  The reduction in employers' PRSI and the increase in the threshold for the lower PRSI rate will reduce the tax wedge for small businesses. The new special rate of corporation tax of 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of taxable income will help many small firms to reinvest and expand.</P>
    <P>These changes will reinforce the supports already available for this sector through the county enterprise boards, Leader groups and Forbairt.  There are many towns and villages outside the main population centres which have difficulty in attracting large multinational investment.  These areas are heavily dependent on Irish-owned and small firms.  There is now a highly favourable climate for the expansion of this sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>Tá béim ar leith leagtha ag an gCáinaisnéis ar chruthú fostaíochta agus is ar Údarás na Gaeltachta atá an cúram sonrach sin leagtha laistigh de theorainneacha na Gaeltachta.  Tá soláthar de bhreis agus £20 millúin á chur ar fáil don eagraíocht i 1996 le haghaidh forbairt na Gaeltachta.  Is ionann é sin agus méadú de bhreis ar 2 faoin gcéad i gcomparáid le bunsoláthar na bliana 1995.  Tá suim £6.6 milliún á tabhairt don Údarás i 1996 chun clár tógála na heagraíochta a airgeadú agus chun scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcuideachtaí.  Is méadú de 5.6 faoin gcéad é sin i gcomparáid le bunsoláthar na bliana seo caite.  Caithfear an fuílleach de £2.5 milliún go príomha ar chostais riarcháin na heagraíochta agus ar chur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Is soláthar maith airgid é sin cibé slat tomhais a úsáidtear agus is léiriú é ar an tábhacht a chuireann an Rialtas i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta agus i gcur chun cinn na <Col N="196" /> Gaeilge.  Beidh mé ag súil leis go gcaithfear an soláthar go coigilteach tíosach ar thograí fiúntacha.</P>
    <P>Tá an iomaíocht thionsclaíoch ag éirí níos géire i gcónaí agus tá dualgas ar, agus ról ag, Údarás na Gaeltachta cabhrú le cuideachtaí Gaeltachta chun iad féin a chur in oiriúint do na fadhbanna a chothaíonn sé sin dóibh.  Tá béim níos mó ag an Údarás anois ar thacaíocht a thabhairt do chomhlachtaí chun a gcumas iomaíochta agus éifeachtúlachta a fheabhsú.  Tá coimhlint mhór ann ó thíortha a bhfuil geilleagair ísealchostais acu agus ní foláir do cheantar Ghaeltachta díriú ar riachtanais bhunúsacha ar nós na gceann seo a leanas le go mbeifear iomaíoch sa mhargadh: teicneolaíocht a uasghrádú, scileanna foirne agus bainistíochta a fheabhsú, agus tairgí ardchaighdeánacha a chur ar fáil.  Tá céadatán ard de na poist nua a cruthaíodh le roinnt bhlianta anuas i dtionscail Ghaeltachta á ghiniúint ag gnóthais sheanbhunaithe.  Is comhartha mhór dóchais é sin agus táim cinnte go leanfaidh an tÚdarás lena gcuid iarrachtaí leanúnacha chun comhlachtaí faoina scáth &mdash; cinn sheanbhunaithe agus cinn nua &mdash; a fhorbairt agus a neartú oiread agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Le bunú Theilifís na Gaeilge tá gealladh ar leith ag baint leis an earnáil léiriúcháin neamhspleách chun deiseanna fostaíochta breise a chruthú.  Beidh an tÚdarás ag tacú leis an earnáil sin chun an tairbhe is fearr is féidir, ó thaobh cruthú fostaíochta de, a bhaint amach don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, bíonn obair fhiúntach ar mhaithe le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ar siúl freisin le cúnamh na ndeontas a thugann mo Roinnse féin le haghaidh Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.  Is suim de £3.35 milliún a bheidh ar fáil i mbliana le haghaidh muiroibreacha, forbairt chomharchumann, hallaí agus Coláistí Gaeilge agus saoráidí ilghnéitheacha ar nós páirceanna imeartha, cúirteanna leadóige agus mar sin de.  Úsáidfear cuid den tsoláthar sin chun an mhórscéim mhuiroibreacha ar Inis Meáin-Inis Oírr a chríochnú i mbliana.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> Faoi mar a dúrt mé, is suim £3.35 milliún atá sna Meastacháin le haghaidh 1996.  Táthar ag pleanáil go gcaithfear timpeall £2.35 milliún de sin ar mhuiroibreacha agus tá soláthar de £0.55 milliún ann chun deontais reachtála a íoc le Comharchumainn Ghaeltachta, i gcomhréir leis na méaduithe suntasacha a cheadaigh mé dóibh anuraidh.  Is ar éigean is gá dom a rá go mbeidh mo Roinnse ag leanacht ar aghaidh ag tabhairt tacaíocht láidir do go leor scéimeanna tábhachtacha eile a théann chun tairbhe labhairt na Gaeilge agus muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh Scéim an bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, d'fhreastal beagnach 23,000 foghlaimeoirí ar na Coláistí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht i 1995 agus d'fhán siad ar iostas i 740 teach Gaeltachta.  Is cuid antábhachtach d'eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta iad na Coláistí Samhraidh Gaeilge agus meastar go mbeidh thart ar an líon céanna foghlaimeoirí i gceist arís i mbliana.  I gcás Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, meastar go n-íocfar deontas faoin Scéim le thart ar 3,200 teaghlaigh Ghaeltachta i mbliana.  Tá an scéim nua seo tar éis cur le húsáid na Gaeilge i roinnt mhaith teaghlaigh ó cuireadh tús leí cúpla bliain ó shin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le deontas do thithíocht sa Ghaeltacht, is mian liom a rá arís nach bhfuil deireadh curtha le deontais feabhsúcháin tithe sa Ghaeltacht &mdash; tá na deontais sin ar fáil i gcónaí agus tá soláthar maith airgid déanta lena n-aghaidh i mbliana.  Tá athrú sa scéim, áfach, sa mhéid nach gcuirfear oibreacha áirithe neamh-shubstaintiúla san áireamh feasta le aghaidh deontais.  Ina lán cásanna, áfach, ní dhéanfaidh sé seo difríocht ar bith, mar go mbeidh go leor oibre i gceist chun an tuasdheontas feabhsucháin a thuilleamh ar aon chuma.  Tá deontas feabhsúcháin ar fáil i gcónaí d'oibreacha substaintiúla ar bhunchreatlach tithe agus do shaoráidí sláintíochta cosúil le huisce, séarachais agus seomraí folctha.</P>
    <P>The budget also contained reliefs for the farming sector.  The measures in relation to capital acquisition tax, farmer's flat rate VAT and farm leasing will <Col N="198" /> promote investment in agriculture and help to provide the climate for continued investment in this industry.  This sector is the single most important part of the economic base of rural areas, particularly the west.</P>
    <P>The NESC report &ldquo;New Approaches to Rural Development&rdquo; provides a valuable insight into population decline in rural Ireland and shows the extent of the problem.  This loss of population causes further difficulties with regard to service provision and a cycle of decline can be generated.  A falling population reduces the demand for services and this, in turn, reduces the number of jobs in shops and local services.</P>
    <P>The evidence on the ground tells the same story.  During the past year I visited many of the more rural areas along the western seaboard and almost everywhere people related the problems of rural decline.  There is great concern about the concentration of economic activity in cities.  This is not to deny the existence of real poverty and social exclusion in large cities, and the movement of people from the country to Dublin may help to create pockets of disadvantage in Dublin.  There is much evidence that people tend to be more entrepreneurial when living in rural areas and attracting them to Dublin to get employment benefits neither the city nor countryside.</P>
    <P>Rural decline and the despondency it gives rise to can be partly traced to the reduction in the number of people employed full-time in agriculture.  The current competitive climate faced by the IDA, and the priorities of multinational companies investing here, also makes it more difficult to attract large investment outside the cities.  There is also a significant &ldquo;pull&rdquo; factor which should not be ignored.  The majority of new jobs are created in the services sector and by their nature, these jobs tend to be in towns or cities.  Despite the possibilities of new technologies, jobs in retailing, financial services, health, education and commercial services still tend to be created in urban areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> I am pleased that funding has been provided in 1996 for a pilot programme on the delivery of public services in rural areas.  Under the programme projects will be developed using a single point of delivery for services in rural areas.  Such an approach will make it more cost-effective to maintain services in areas with a low population, while developing new models for improved service quality.  The programme will use a community-based approach and several local community groups are already working on the development of their projects.  There is great potential for involving the local community in service provision and I look forward to progress in this area during 1996.</P>
    <P>Rural areas, particularly the west coast, have a natural advantage from the point of view of the tourism industry and there should be continued expansion in this sector in 1996.  The terrible events in London could affect this growth but there is still room for optimism.  A well balanced tourism industry will provide employment throughout the west, often in rural locations.  The unique problems faced by the west of Ireland result from its economic characteristics.  It has an ageing population structure, a greater dependence on small farm holdings and a lower average level of income than the rest of the country.  These difficulties are perceived within the region as barriers to economic and social progress.  The problem is manifested most obviously in areas where population decline is affecting the viability of existing villages and towns.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Partnership Board was established by the Government as a response to the problem of population decline.  It was given the resources to prepare an action plan based on the target of population stability by the end of the decade at 1991 census levels.  The partnership board forms part of the broader local development structures and they have now produced their action plan.  This is currently being analysed with a view to a positive <Col N="200" /> Government response to the proposals contained within it.  This action plan is a further part of the western development initiative stretching back to the initial leadership provided by the bishops of the region.  As such, it allows us to maintain a focus on the difficulties of the west, as well as the opportunities for development within the region.</P>
    <P>One of the most positive aspects of Irish life at present is the renewed energy and vigour of the community development process.  Every town and village in the west appears to have taken the effort to improve the economic life of their area.  This process is facilitated by the funds available through the local development programme and community employment.  I am pleased that the Minister for Finance has introduced further measures to improve the CE programme.  These will reinforce the enormous role it plays in community-based development.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment and poverty are not confined to the cities.  The more dispersed nature of rural poverty can make it less visible but as recent studies have shown, disadvantage afflicts rural Ireland too.  Community employment has just as great an importance for rural as urban areas.</P>
    <P>On the first day of this month the report of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development was published.  On the same day the Leader II programme for Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann was launched.  These two initiatives are a significant step forward for the island communities. The Government has for the first time explicitly acknowledged the unique contribution of the offshore islands to Irish life.  The report puts in place a strategic framework within which future decisions on island development can be taken.  I am glad the Government has agreed to the financial envelope of £1 million and when work is completed on this matter, many people will have a happier and better life on our offshore islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, for sharing his time with me.  The 1996 budget was a good one, although people may say I would say that.  The comments of Deputy Mattie Brennan brought a context to this debate which had been lacking. This year's budget reflects a trend which has been evident with regard to the management of public finances over the past ten years.  The Deputy referred to the Tallaght strategy under the stewardship of Deputy Dukes as Fine Gael leader.  That generosity of spirit is sadly lacking from the Opposition, particularly Fianna Fáil, in their reactions to a budget which continues the overall economic policies of the previous Administration.</P>
      <P>The budget is a continuation of prudent management of public finances.  To borrow a phrase from another arena, it takes a twin track approach, using the benefits of that prudent management on the one hand to continue to prime the economic pumps to generate greater wealth and on the other to ensure those who have been excluded from the benefits of additional wealth generation are included to a greater extent in that benefit.</P>
      <P>The proof of the pudding is in the eating. In today's newspapers, the ESRI commented on the prospect of 5 per cent growth in 1996 and the creation of an additional 31,000 jobs.  The incoherent babbling from Fianna Fáil is supposed to count as real opposition but that comment from an independent institution and the banks' actions in continuing to lower interest rates highlight the bankruptcy of the Fianna Fáil response.  Their reaction is because they lack the generosity of political and economic spirit which was evident over the past ten years, particularly under the Tallaght strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeing the battle for the heart of Fianna Fáil.  On one side the finance spokesperson, Deputy McCreevy, preaches austerity and prudent management but the battle is being won by the party's social welfare wing.  One side <Col N="202" /> claims the Department of Social Welfare ran amok, the other criticises the Government for failing to give adequate increases.  There is no consistency or coherence in that approach.  As I said, institutional confidence exists.  Interest rates and inflation are low and mortgage rates are at their smallest level yet.  That is the type of commentary and adjudication which is worth listening to when deciding what was achieved in the budget.</P>
    <P>The other disappointing reaction to the budget came from the farming community. There are no better lobby groups than the farming organisations. Paper will not refuse ink, the broadcast media will not refuse commentary and when two organisations are competing for membership, the more outlandish and ridiculous their statements, the greater guarantee they have of access to the public airwaves and the print media.</P>
    <P>Who benefits more from prudent management of public finances and low inflation and interest rates but the farming community?  Notwithstanding that, numerous provisions in the budget were tailored specifically for the agricultural sector.  As regards capital acquisitions tax, the current agricultural relief for gifts and inheritance is being increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent.  The flat rate VAT refund is being increased for unregistered farmers, mostly small farmers, from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent.  Tax on non-automotive LPG is being reduced by 2 pence a gallon. There are other incentives in the REPS scheme, where one can disregard the first £2,000 of income, incentives for leasing of land and relief for transfer of stock.  As a representative of a rural constituency, I was disappointed at the begrudging recognition of that prudent management and the specific inclusions in the budget which were tailored for the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The single biggest problem facing the country is unemployment.  Families are being reared and educated to graduate and technical level, wondering whether there will be jobs or they will be forced to emigrate.  People get jobs and wonder <Col N="203" /> if they will be secure and whether they will be able to invest in their home or educate their family to the same standard as themselves.  These are all serious problems and in that regard 1995 was a good year.  A total of 49,000 new jobs were created; if one subtracts the 10,000 on State schemes there was a net total of 39,000 economic jobs.  As chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Small Businesses and Services I want to put that figure in context.  The IDA dealing with multinational companies setting up here and Forbairt dealing with large Irish-owned indigenous businesses between them created 7,000 or 8,000 new jobs, the bulk of them, some 6,000, created by the IDA.  The investment of Intel, Apple Computers and General Instrument in my own constituency is very welcome.  Nonetheless, over 30,000 of the new jobs were created by small indigenous Irish-owned companies.  In that regard a most welcome feature of this year's budget was the reduction in corporation profits tax from 38 per cent to 30 per cent for the first £50,000 profits. The record of the Government over two budgets has seen a 25 per cent reduction in corporation profits tax which specifically focus on that sector which is delivering the greatest number of jobs, the sector which cannot afford the luxury of a boardroom decision to get up and leave, the sector that, by virtue of its roots in an Irish community, by virtue of its indigenous ownership, is not involved in profit repatriation but puts back into its business as much money as it can.</P>
    <P>In the past few years there has been the failure to turn small firms into medium and large firms and a high rate of failure among start-ups.  That was largely the result of difficulties with working capital.  Reducing their tax obligations by 25 per cent in two successive budgets will significantly contribute to turning small firms into medium and big companies reducing the rate of failure.</P>
    <P>There are still significant difficulties in financing start-up businesses.  There have been a number of initiatives, <Col N="204" /> including the access to a finance scheme most recently, and its predecessor, the small business expansion loans scheme. The committee which I chair is involved in a detailed analysis of this and it has found that the bulk of finance in this regard went to existing companies who wished to expand rather than towards financing start-ups.  There is a need for the creation of a specific fund to finance micro-enterprises which may require only £4,000 to £6,000 to get off the ground but which are not seen as a good risk when they approach financial institutions. If we could have schemes such as we have had but tailored exclusively to start-ups, we would see greater job creation in this sector in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The currency crisis, with the IR£ at £1.03 <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling, poses significant problems in certain sectors of Irish industry, particularly those exporting to the UK.  Although we have a declining reliance on the UK market our dependence is, nonetheless, very significant. There may be difficulties under EU legislation in introducing specific schemes to resolve this, and some people have used this in arguments against the Maastricht Treaty and the Government's adherence to the principle of a single currency.  However, the case for the discipline the Maastricht Treaty imposes on us and for a single currency has never been stronger, as evidenced by the currency crisis and resultant problems faced by certain exposed sectors of the economy, particularly the food and textile industries.</P>
    <P>I would like the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment to again look at this area.  Although there have been no significant job losses, there is a danger that we will not be able to sustain the present exchange rates over the long-term.  The likelihood is that it will continue at the present rate and this will significantly affect the ability of small firms to ride out the storm.  There is a need for something like the market development fund we had previously but which ran into difficulties in the context of EU competition <Col N="205" /> law.  Something needs to be done, and I welcome the initiatives in the budget relating to PRSI reductions.</P>
    <P>The small business sector is the most dynamic.  A small company increasing its workforce from two to three, or by 50 per cent, will never make the headlines. However, small businesses are contributing the vast majority of new jobs and deserve increased investment. When one takes into account the amount of money we invest in attracting mobile international investment through the IDA and through Forbairt investing in large companies, the return for the county enterprise boards and organisations like Údarás na Gaeltachta and Leader groups for the small funding at their disposal is far more significant. IDA figures last year for jobs created and sustained was about £12,000.  That is an improvement on previous years, but county enterprise boards can deliver jobs much more cheaply than that. Additional investment in this area would be of far greater benefit to the economy compared with the large investments in organisations like the IDA and Forbairt.</P>
    <P>The budget was positive, but a number of things need to be delivered on. Will the Minister for Finance give serious consideration in the Finance Bill to making available to the proprietors of small businesses and the self-employed the PAYE and PRSI allowances of £800 and £286 respectively? People who are putting their own resources into creating employment and taking real risks deserve some recognition. This allowance, which is available to employees, should also be available to those who create employment and employ themselves and others.  That would be broadly welcomed by the small business community.</P>
    <P>Despite the efforts in the 1995 budget, there are still difficulties with section 115 which give preferential status to the Revenue Commissioners when a business is in difficulty.  We made some effort to resolve that last year but more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the back-to-work <Col N="206" /> incentives in the budget.  In my opening remarks I mentioned sharing the fruits of a growing economy with those who have been excluded for a long time.  I very much welcome the efforts to get long-term unemployed people back into economic jobs.  However, many long-term unemployed people are unskilled and it is difficult to persuade employers, in an increasingly competitive and highly-skilled workplace, to take them on.  I beg the Minister to consider making this incentive available to local authorities. If we could marry our two resources &mdash; on the one hand a large number of people who are unemployed and on the other huge amounts of work to be done, particularly by local authorities &mdash; we could make significant progress in tackling long-term unemployment. That £80 per week could be topped up by local authorities from their own resources to give an economic wage to people, and we would see tangible results from their employment by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I need not remind the House about the condition of county roads.  I welcome the significant increase in funding, but it is no substitute for manpower. Many of the long-term unemployed are unskilled anyway, and if local authorities could employ them it would offer a significant prospect of reducing long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the budget and the 3 per cent increases in social welfare.  I regret that Opposition members have the impression that 3 per cent represents an outlandish attack on the public finances for those who are most vulnerable in our society.  The budget is a prudent and balanced one that reconciles the necessity to prime the economic pump to create additional jobs and share the benefits of a growing economy with the marginalised who have been left untouched by the economic miracle we have witnessed.</P>

      <Col N="207" /> Tuigeann siad go bhfuil deacrachtaí bunúsacha ag na trí páirtithe sa Chomhrialtas. Is léir ón mbuiséad seo go bhfuil tionchar mór ag na fadhbanna seo ar na polasaithe atá so-dhéanta don Rialtas &mdash; i ndeireadh an lae tá ag teip orthu teacht ar réiteach ar aon cheist dheacair.</P>
    <P>Dá dheascadh sin níl an Rialtas ag rialú.  Ní féidir leo é a dhéanamh mar tá siad ag dul i dtrí threo éagsúil ag an am gcéanna.  Ceapann daoine áirithe nach ndearna an tAire é seo nó é súid i mbliana mar go mbeidh buiséad réamhthoghchán le cur le chéile aige an bhliain seo chugainn &mdash; ag tús nó ag deireadh na bliana.  Measann siad go mbeidh dea-scéala aige ag an am sin agus go mbeidh moltaí aige a dhéanfaidh difríocht fhiúntach dóibh agus a chabhróidh leo ó lá go lá.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil baol ann nach n-éireoidh leis an Aire buiséad mar sin a thabhairt isteach.  Tá an deighilt idir na páirtithe chomh mór sin faoi láthair agus an t-easaontas chomh soiléir go bhfuil sé deacair a chreidiúint go leanfaidh siad le chéile nó go gcuirfidh siad buiséad tríd an Dáil díreach roimh an toghchán.</P>
    <P>Cheana féin is léir go bhfuil na daoine neamh-tofa &mdash; na daoine leis an bhfíorchumhacht &mdash; ag iarraidh an seans is fearr a fháil chun long an rialtais a fhágáil. Bí cinnte de go bhfaighidh siad an deis sin faoi mar a tharla ag deireadh 1994 agus i 1987.  Bí cinnte freisin go mbeidh fadhbanna uafásacha le réiteach ag an Rialtas nua faoi mar a bhí ag Fianna Fáil i 1987.  Ní gá ach stracfhéachaint a thabhairt ar an dá bhuiséad a chur an tAire seo os ár gcomhair chun a bheith éadóchasach faoi chúrsaí na tíre sa bhfad-théarma.  Níl ar siúl ach piocadh anseo is ansiúd agus na réitigh atá riachtanach a chur ar athló.</P>
    <P>The national debt is running at £30 billion having increased by £1 billion in 1995.  We are gradually slipping back to the grossly incompetent borrowing policy of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government of 1982 to 1987 which doubled the debt from £12 billion to £24 <Col N="208" /> billion.  No other Government so pauperised its citizens and sold their future for short-term political gain.  Let all who value their children's rights and future lay down clear ground rules and financial parameters that may not be breached.</P>
    <P>This budget provides for a further Exchequer borrowing requirement of £583 million in 1996.  The Minister and his apologists represent this as a negligible percentage of GNP and in certain circumstances it could well be so.  However, we receive record levels of EU transfers which we know cannot and will not continue <i>ad infinitum</i>.  They contribute to the apparently healthy financial situation and artificially inflate GNP and GDP figures.  Instead of increasing our EBR we should look at ways to reduce it in years of economic growth.  Economic trends are cyclical and factors will come into play which will reverse current growth trends. Some are flagged well in advance but others come out of the blue and are influenced by political and other factors over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>The Government must take the long-term view as well as looking after its friends in the short-term.  The long-term prognosis resulting from budgets of this nature is depressing and worrying.  Participation in economic and monetary union will present special challenges. There will be less national control and no room for manoeuvre in currency devaluation.  There will be further demands for State intervention to support indigenous industry or other elements of the economy.  It has the potential to be an exciting time for the economy but, if not properly prepared for, employment prospects in many Irish firms could be damaged.  We boast that we are one of a few countries likely to meet the Maastricht guidelines but we need to take account of the factors that contribute to our being in that position which may not exist in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister and other spokespersons frequently respond to Fianna Fáil's criticisms of their policy by accusing us of demanding extra services <Col N="209" /> but wanting a reduction in taxation and borrowing.  This is a superficial representation of our approach.  No one likes to be taxed but there is widespread acceptance of the need to pay for certain services and for the transfer of resources from the wealthy to the poor.</P>
    <P>A good Government ought to be sufficiently transparent and accountable to show people that their hard earned money is well used in their name. Despite the Taoiseach's undertakings in the early days of his coming to office the opposite is clearly the case.  Part of the problem lies with the ideological incompatibility of the Government parties which makes it almost impossible to reach an agreed long-term strategy.  A number of speakers referred to lack of political and financial leadership and a clear coherent policy.  It is possible to put policies forward which provide for the services we wish to have and are fair to those expected to pay for them.</P>
    <P>In my constituency three second level schools in Kilrush amalgamated.  Difficulties about site acquisition were subsequently resolved.  Everyone accepts the need for a new school.  If it had been built last year it would have cost less than it will this year.  The school will be built sometime, probably in the next two or three years.  While the Department procrastinates teachers and pupils must go between three sites which is an appalling imposition on them.  People are greatly discommoded but at the end of the day the school will be built.  There is urgent need to include it in the 1996 capital budget rather than the 1999 one.</P>
    <P>Tourism was virtually ignored in the budget even though it is a major contributor to revenue and employment. The political correctness of the 1990s made jobs in tourism somehow inferior and issues were raised which intended to do down tourism and those who invested in it.  It would be dangerous for any Government to go down that road. The grant to Bord Fáilte has been reduced by 11 per cent.  Wise investment in product development and marketing will yield results in terms of jobs and foreign earnings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> This week the overseas tourism marketing initiatives decided to drop advertising on British television.  As most of our visitors come from Britain, surely we should have more rather than less advertising there.  I am appalled that the Minister refused to take a special notice question today tabled by me and Deputy Andrews on the grounds that the matter was the responsibility of Bord Fáilte, OTMI, RTOs or SFADCo. Is the Minister responsible for anything? Is it any wonder that tourism interests look to the Opposition to put forward their point of view?</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews' speech on the peace process a few weeks ago was regrettably prophetic when he referred to the dangers of weak political leadership. Unfortunately the peace process is going through a very difficult patch &mdash; I hope that is all it is.  The implications for tourism are quite frightening.  There is an urgent need to initiate counter measures in advertising as quickly as possible.  It is not good enough to say there is nothing we can do &mdash; we can always do something.  I call on the Minister to take action and stop hiding behind Bord Fáilte or whoever else seems to have responsibility at a particular time.</P>
    <P>There has been a welcome increase in tourism in Dublin and the eastern region which we want to continue.  Dublin can appeal to the short break market. However, it also needs to appeal to tourists who have a great deal of money to spend.  Tourists do not make a great contribution to the economy if they do not have plenty of money to spend.</P>
    <P>The failure to attract to Shannon scheduled services from Europe, particularly British cities other than London, is very worrying.  That nothing is being done about it is even more worrying. We have failed to attract significant new transatlantic business.  A few years ago, when the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government faced a difficulty in relation to Aer Lingus, the Opposition tabled a cheap, points scoring motion.  Unfortunately, their action at that time has not been matched by action in Government.  I <Col N="211" /> received very little support at the time but concessions were wrung from Fianna Fáil Ministers by unorthodox and unapproved political tactics.  Shannon has held its core position enabling it to be built on in the future.  However, there is no such building, development or effort even when those who were so vocal in Opposition are now in Government.</P>
    <P>There is also an urgent need for services to Waterford, Kerry, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Carrickfin.  These areas do not have the ferry access Dublin and other east coast areas have.  The only realistic way to increase the number of tourists and open up new markets is by providing such services.  Those areas have a huge concentration of bed nights available and have had very disappointing and low occupancies recently.  Some of them experienced a drop in revenue at a time when we had record increases in tourism figures.  A major Donegal hotelier is about to open a hotel beside the Bleeding Horse pub. I wish him luck, but is he making a statement about how he sees tourism developing in the north-west as opposed to Dublin?</P>
    <P>The IHF and ITIC expressed great disappointment in the budget.  There is no extra money for marketing which is the life blood of the industry.  There are no product development concessions, which would not involve the Government in direct expenditure and would encourage hoteliers and others to invest in better products and upgrade existing products.  That opportunity must be grasped very soon before it is lost.</P>
    <P>The special resorts scheme introduced in the 1995 budget is having very little impact.  No development has arisen from it in Lahinch, which is very near where I live.  Despite there being a couple of hundred applications for planning permission for tourism related developments, there were no approvals because the sewerage scheme is substandard. The county council submitted plans three or four years ago.  It upgraded the plans and submitted <Col N="212" /> smaller plans which might meet the Department's budget but there has been no movement.  An excellent scheme which offered the opportunity to revitalise a resort which had fallen on difficult times cannot be availed of.</P>
    <P>The lack of water and sewerage facilities is also inhibiting development in the famous spa town of Lisdoonvarna.  The Minister's former colleague, who is the biggest hotelier in the town, is in an impossible situation.  The application for funding was regarded as the first and best Cohesion Fund application in the country.  Unfortunately, despite the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, allowing a fairly substantial grant in 1994 in the expectation of getting Cohesion Funding, no money has been provided by this Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Health to intervene in the industrial dispute which will disrupt services in 40 hospitals and many health centres in the greater Dublin area tomorrow.  As the Minister of State knows, tomorrow's dispute will be the second disruption of hospitals and health centres in a week.  Last week's stoppage resulted in severe difficulties for hospital patients and staff due to lack of portering facilities and so on.  It also resulted in hot lunches for patients being replaced with soup and sandwiches. Non emergency admissions in many hospitals were cancelled, while one third of the Eastern Health Board's 110 health centres were closed.  Payment <Col N="213" /> of supplementary welfare was also affected at ten centres.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow's stoppage is likely to result in the same level of disruption and an escalation of the dispute is threatened unless a resolution is quickly found.  For example, a 24 hour stoppage by manual workers is planned for next Wednesday.  If this goes ahead, it will result in absolute chaos in the health services and will put many other hospital workers under immense pressure. The entire health system in the greater Dublin area could grind to a halt with potentially serious implications for some patients.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to be alarmist.  It is time for management, on behalf of the Minister for Health, and the unions to get together through the LRC machinery and resolve this.  I ask the Minister for Health &mdash; whom I am delighted to see in the House &mdash; to intervene in this dispute about pension provisions for manual workers which has dragged on for too long.  New talks should be convened following the failure of this week's talks with the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>The workers involved in this dispute are exasperated at the delays in improving what appears to be a very complex pensions scheme.  They state that some of the payments are very low.  According to SIPTU figures, a porter with a maximum of 40 years service has an occupational pension of £27.50 per week.  One of the anomalies is that when the social welfare old age pension increases in July by £2.20, the occupational pension for such a porter will reduce to £23.10.  That is extraordinary and there must be something which can be done to resolve the exasperation felt by workers.</P>
    <P>A great deal of progress was made at the LRC talks in relation to part-time workers.  Some progress was made in relation to referring issues to the pensions commission.  There is scope for improvement and a resolution satisfactory to both sides.  I ask the Minister to encourage both sides to get together <Col N="214" /> again and use the comprehensive industrial relations machinery which is there to resolve the situation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for giving me this opportunity of responding to the issue she has raised of the proposed industrial action by non-nursing unions.</P>
      <P>Health service management has, for some time, been engaged in talks with the unions representing the non-nursing group in relation to their claim for an improvement in superannuation schemes.  The union has been pursuing this claim under Clause 4 of the agreement on pay incorporated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The management side is of the view that the claim is not covered under this clause, which is concerned with claims for the introduction of pension schemes where none exist, and claims for the improvement of such schemes where these are substantially out of line with appropriate standards in comparable employments.</P>
      <P>This group is covered under the public service superannuation schemes and is not considered by the health service management to be out of line with analogous employments.  The claim, as presented, would represent a fundamental change to the public service superannuation code, particularly in regard to the co-ordination of occupational pension and social welfare entitlement.  Any consideration of the claim must also have regard to the terms of reference of the recently established Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
      <P>While I am concerned about the potential impact of the threatened strike, I am of the view that the negotiation process has not yet been exhausted. Apart from the breach of the industrial peace clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> agreement involved, I am concerned at the nature and scale of disruption to services which would arise from a continuation of industrial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> The union and management sides are currently engaged in further talks under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission in an attempt to avert tomorrow's threatened action.  Given the sensitivity of the discussions which have been taking place today, any further comment at this time would not be appropriate or constructive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to take this matter.  I raise this issue in the context of an increasing problem, the significant number of children out of school.  Officially there is a minimum school leaving age, but that is of little use unless the Department is in a position to enforce that requirement. In my constituency frequently during the day individuals and sometimes large numbers of children are seen hanging around.  It has been brought to my attention on a number of occasions that these children are not attending school regularly.  Recently I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education seeking facts and figures for my constituency and asking how many children are currently out of school.  The reply is that the information is not available because schools are not required to report such cases to the Department. The onus should be on schools to notify the Department so that the necessary follow-up can take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am conscious of the general problem, three cases came to my attention in recent months which are a cause of concern.  In the first case a child was refused entry to a second level school on the grounds of lack of ability.  The child has been out of school since leaving primary school last June.  The parents came to me in desperation and after a large number of phone calls and letters to the Department an unsatisfactory <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement was reached. The second case involves a child who was refused entry to a special school <Col N="216" /> because it is in dispute with the Department. That child is in limbo with no school service.  The third case involves an 11 year old girl who was expelled from primary school and whose parents could not get her into another school.</P>
    <P>When these cases were brought to my attention by the parents concerned I contacted the Department but it was unaware of them.  It has taken considerable time for the Department to provide the necessary follow-up.  In two of the cases the inspectorate has yet to make contact with the parents concerned and in the meantime the children are out of school.  In these cases the parents were sufficiently interested to pursue the matter and contacted me as a public representative.  There are, however, cases where parents may not be interested.  There is an onus on the Department to provide the necessary follow-up, but how can that be done if it is unaware of the problem?  Research shows that children who drop out of school early are likely to become long-term unemployed and there is a significant chance they will end up in difficulties. Investment in services will be repaid many times in terms of averting problems at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Young people with learning difficulties or behavioural problems deserve proper services and follow-up from the Department of Education.  That would be a sound investment and I appeal to the Minister to give early attention to the matter.  Schools should be required to notify the Department when children drop out or are expelled.  Obviously that would lead to pressure for new services but it would be in the best interest of the young people who are at risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary and second-level schools are not required to notify my Department of cases where children are suspended or otherwise excluded from schools.  This is a matter for the board of management of primary schools and for the managerial authorities of second-level schools subject to the provisions of the School Attendance <Col N="217" /> Act, 1926.  I was as surprised as the Deputy appears to be when I learned of that some time ago.</P>
      <P>Under the rules for national schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.  The selection and enrolment of pupils in second-level schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school, subject to relevant recognition and funding conditions.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions took place during 1993 between representatives of the Department of Education and the three post-primary managerial associations, the Joint Managerial Body, the Irish Vocational Education Association and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools.  It was agreed that the selection of pupils for enrolment in second-level schools should not be used on academic ability and selection on that basis, where used heretofore, must be discontinued; the principle of the school working in and for the community it serves should be emphasised; the Department of Education and the managerial authorities would cooperate in monitoring the situation. Where difficulties arise in the enrolment of a pupil or pupils in any particular type of post-primary school, the Department of Education and the appropriate managerial body would, through the mechanism of a monitoring committee for each particular sector, consider each case with a view to resolving the difficulty follwing consultation, where necessary, with the school authorities and the appropriate trustees.  The following represented criteria which might be used in selection procedures: priority to pupils from national schools in the area; enrolment on a &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo; basis; random selection on the basis of age of applicants; priority to brothers and sisters of pupils already enrolled in the school and priority to <Col N="218" /> pupils of a particular religious denomination.</P>
    <P>While there have been a number of cases brought to the attention of my Department where schools continue to hold such academic tests for the purpose of enrolment, the general position is that these tests have been abolished.  In the cases which were brought to the attention of my Department action has been taken to have the enrolment policy of such schools revised to eliminate those tests.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problem of children who are not attending school because they have been expelled or excluded from second-level schools and the related difficulties this presents for both schools and parents.  The managerial authorities of second-level schools are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.</P>
    <P>Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up the detail of a code of discipline appropriate for that school. Accordingly, the most effective method of countering indiscipline is for each school to draw up its code of behaviour. In drawing up the code, school authorities should have regard to guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
    <P>In 1990 and 1991, my Department issued &ldquo;Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; together with &ldquo;A Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; to all schools.  Within these guidelines individual boards are given the discretion to work out specific details.  The guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspension only as a last resort. My information is that, in general, schools adhere to these guidelines.</P>
    <P>My Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically this can arise where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative <Col N="219" /> arrangements need to be made.  In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through its inspectorate to assist in the reinstatement of the pupil in the school or alternatively, his or her placement in another school. In more difficult situations, my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.  Programmes such as youth encounter projects and Youthreach are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside of the mainstream school system.</P>
    <P>The issue raised by the Deputy is also actively being examined by the Truancy Task Force established last year.  The question of requiring school authorities to report expulsions is being considered in the context of proposals for a revision of school attendance regulations and the school attendance service.  I hope the problems raised by the Deputy will be solved in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise the serious and vexatious matter of an investigation into five separate allegations of child sexual abuse, which occurred in 1988 involving children in the Wexford area, and why, as reported in the media last weekend, that investigation did not proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cloak of authority must not be used to shield the perpetrators of child sexual abuse.  Serious questions must be answered about the investigation of at least five allegations of child sexual abuse in the Wexford area in 1988. Media reports during the past week highlighted that these serious allegations were in the first instance properly and competently investigated by the South Eastern Health Board which was sufficiently concerned with the results to refer the allegations to the <Col N="220" /> gardaí and, as we know, no prosecution followed as a result of that.</P>
    <P>According to reports, following the referral by the health board, statements were taken from a number of young girls aged between 11 and 12 alleging abuse by a priest in the Wexford area. A decision was taken by local Garda management not to proceed with the investigation and now, mysteriously, the file on the investigation is missing.</P>
    <P>Many worrying aspects of this investigation require explanation.  An internal Garda inquiry is to take place to establish if the investigation was properly carried out and a report on it will be made to the Garda Commissioner.  What are the terms of reference of that inquiry? Does the Minister intend to make this report public?  Will the report answer the accusation that a garda was instructed to call upon the priest to request that he leave the parish with the caveat that if he refused he would be arrested?  Will it reveal on whose instruction the investigating officer was acting when he was told to send handwritten statements to Garda headquarters in Wexford without making copies of them which is the normal procedure? Will the report indicate who in local Garda management made the decision to drop the case and why?  Will it indicate if the priest's superiors were informed of the investigation and, if so, what action was taken by them?  Were the priest's superiors made aware of the direction to the priest to leave the parish? Were any subsequent allegations made of abuse by the priest after that initial investigation?</P>
    <P>Those questions must be answered. The Garda report must be completed without delay so that the victims and their parents, in particular, can see that justice has been done to a certain exent.</P>
    <P>There cannot be a suspicion that the cloak of authority, in whatever guise, could be used to shield the perpetrators of the appalling crime of child sexual abuse.  Anyone who knowingly shields an abuser is as guilty of perpetuating the suffering of children and also of putting children at further risk.  That cannot be <Col N="221" /> allowed to happen.  For that reason it is crucial that a report of the investigation into the allegations of child sexual abuse in Wexford should be made public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that she tabled only one question, to ask the Minister for Justice why the investigation into five separate allegations of child sexual abuse, occurring in 1988 and involving children in the Wexford area, was stopped, as reported in the weekend media.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the matter referred to by the Deputy is now the subject of a Garda investigation.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the practice for the Minister for Justice to make statements to the House about the progress of particular Garda investigations except in instances where the circumstances are so exceptional that such a course of action is appropriate.</P>
      <P>All I propose to say in this case and in response to the specific question Deputy Keogh asked is that the matter is now the subject of a Garda investigation which will be concluded as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise an important matter concerning the future well-being of approximately 3,000 farmers in Longford and 1,500 in Leitrim.  There are four agricultural advisers in County Longford, and the contract of two of them will be terminated at the end of this month.  I understand the intention of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is to transfer those two advisers to another county or counties, thus leaving two advisers to provide a service for 3,000 farmers engaged in dairying, cattle fattening and sheep production. It is impossible for two advisers to provide an adequate advisory service to 3,000 farmers in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one adviser in Leitrim whose <Col N="222" /> contract will expire at the end of February. I understand it is the Department's intention to transfer that gentleman to some other county.  The two advisers in County Longford are agricultural science graduates who joined Teagasc in February 1993, when the need for such advisory service for smallholders was acute, since the common agricultural policy reform programme had to be implemented.  Resulting from the employment of those two extra advisers a significantly enhanced programme of work was put in place by the county staff and the county agricultural officer &mdash; at the time, Mr. Michael Lennon &mdash; whose targets specified over the following three years have been reached and, in many cases, surpassed.</P>
    <P>At this time of enormous change in methods of agricultural production within members states of the European Union and elsewhere, in particular in Eastern Europe, farmers need a well staffed agricultural advisory service that has recourse to the most modern technology and research available.  In the past that research was undertaken by An Foras Talúntais, and is now provided by the research arm of Teagasc. Agricultural researchers undertook tremendous work, were second to none and led the field in many research projects worldwide over the past 15 to 20 years.</P>
    <P>While many people give lip service to the issue, when it comes to the preservation of rural communities, small farms and so on, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is now afforded an opportunity to really demonstrate its practical prowess in reinstating the contracts of those advisers.  If they do not do so, in the county of Longford there will be two advisers only endeavouring to cater for the welfare of some 3,000 farmers, a quite impossible task.  The Department would be well advised to close down Teagasc in Longford if it proposes reducing the numbers of advisory staff to two.</P>
    <P>The county of Longford is in my constituency. I worked as an agricultural adviser in County Leitrim for many <Col N="223" /> years and know the soil types in both counties.  Admittedly there is some very good land in both, although most is of an inferior quality.  Farmers have enough to contend with in normal circumstances to eke out a living but, to do so with such difficult soil conditions, makes their task almost impossible.  The removal of advisory services from such farmers would constitute the kiss of death for them.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the general level of research available nationwide, which rates among the best worldwide, but there is no point in having research unless its fruits can be clearly seen and reaped at farm level.  The conduit between researchers and farmers who will eventually implement the results of such research are those agricultural advisers without whom, never the twain &mdash; researchers and farmers &mdash; shall meet.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to be reasonable, to use common sense and renew the contracts of those two advisers in Longford and the one in County Leitrim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Tom Foxe.  I am aware of the importance of having a good agricultural service in the counties of Longford and Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 (1) (a) of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988 charges Teagasc, <i>inter alia,</i> with responsibility for the provision of advisory services in agriculture.  Specifically, section 8 authorises Teagasc to appoint such numbers of persons to be members of the staff of Teagasc, as it may determine, with the consent of the Minister <Col N="224" /> and the Minister for Finance.  In other words, the total number of staff employed by Teagasc in each grade is subject to the consent of the two Ministers but the deployment of the authorised staff is a matter for Teagasc.</P>
    <P>On 22 January 1996 Teagasc management applied to my Department for approval to appoint three advisers to new permanent pensionable positions. In accordance with the terms of the Government decision of 6 June 1995 on the recruitment of staff in the public sector, such approval would require a specific Government decision.  My Department replied to Teagasc management on 16 February 1996 pointing out the situation and requesting further information.  A reply to this letter is awaited.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of issues here, one, the replacement of agricultural advisers on which my officals have been engaging in discussions with the Department of Finance.  I hope we will be able to secure a satisfactory outcome.  Those discussions are continuing and I can report some progress.</P>
    <P>In regard to contract staff, a permanent right accrues to employees whenever they are employed on back-to-back contracts beyond a certain period.  Continuity of people's employment on the issuing of contracts to people are matters for Teagasc and not for me.  My responsibility is in relation to the overall provision of numbers.  I will bear in mind what Deputy Foxe said.  I will ask my senior officials to liaise with Teagasc to ensure an adequate agricultural advisory service is provided in the counties of Longford and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 February 1996.</P>

      <P>Total expenditure on the social welfare system was over £4,000 million in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present system is funded partly by the Exchequer from general taxation and partly by the Social Insurance Fund from Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions.  Means tested payments, such as old age non-contributory pensions, unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, are <Col N="109" /> paid from the Exchequer, while contributory pensions and benefits are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>In general, the rates of payment received by individuals under the various social assistance schemes are lower that the rates paid under the equivalent social insurance schemes.  However, a greater number of people depend on social assistance payments with the result that Exchequer funded assistance schemes account for about 56 per cent of social welfare spending.</P>
    <P>The Social Insurance Fund accounts for about 44 per cent of all social welfare spending.  It provides retirement pensions survivor's benefits, income support in the event of unemployment or illness and other benefits as a matter of entitlement based on contributions paid by workers and their employers. The PRSI system relieves employers of the need to make direct provision for such matters and provides assurance to workers which facilitates the smooth operation of the labour market.</P>
    <P>As stated in the Government's policy agreement of December 1994, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> this Government is committed to the maintenance and development of the social insurance system.  In view of its significance within the social welfare system as a whole, it is important that the income to the Social Insurance Fund should be maintained at a level which is adequate to meet its current and accrued liabilities to insured persons.  The future financing of pensions is of relevance here and I have referred to this in other questions which I am answering today.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute are undertaking a review of the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, fulfilling a commitment given in the Government's agreed policy programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  This review will be completed by mid-1996 and will form the basis, along with other reviews such as that of the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare, for the <Col N="110" /> formulation of proposals for social welfare rates of payment and the funding of these in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, at the UN World Summit for Social Development in 1955, the Irish Government agreed a programme of action geared not only to eliminating absolute poverty in the developing world but to a substantial reduction of overall poverty and inequalities everywhere.  For Ireland, this will require the development of a coherent and targeted anti-poverty strategy, placing poverty and inequality issues firmly at the heart of national policy-making with the aim of developing a more inclusive and just society.</P>
      <P>The strategy is being developed by a high level interdepartmental policy committee.  In keeping with the commitment in A Government of Renewal to extend the opportunities for democratic participation by citizens in all aspects of public life, the committee is providing for consultation with and the participation of those affected by social exclusion through their representative organisations.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee has been charged with preparing a report which will form part of the National Report for the United Nations, to be completed before the end of 1996, to demonstrate national progress in implementing the UN Commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An overview statement, summary of submissions and a booklet on the institutional mechanisms required to support the national anti-poverty strategy <Col N="111" /> in the medium to long-term have been published and were issued to several thousand organisations and individuals. A series of national seminars were held (Cork, Monaghan, Galway and Dublin) and the consultation process is continuing. The three documents mentioned above will be amended in the light of feedback from the seminars.</P>
    <P>Poverty is a deep-seated problem requiring priority attention.  It has to be tackled by a combination of state action, the engagement of all key interests in Irish society and the involvement of those directly affected by poverty.  Poverty is a matter of economic as well as social policy and is, therefore, as important a concern for the framing of economic policy as it is for the development of a social dimension in economic and social development.  In the medium term, the setting of specific targets to be achieved in moving towards a reduction in the levels of poverty will help focus attention on overall policy goals and objectives and provide a clear measure of relative success.</P>
    <P>It is intended indeed that the strategy should become embedded in the policy-making process and it is therefore &mdash; of its very nature &mdash; not an <i>ad hoc</i> approach as the Deputy states, but one requiring a medium to long-term perspective.</P>

      <P>At present, my Department funds 35 money advice and budgeting service projects throughout the country and I am committed to making this service available nation-wide by the end of 1996.  As an indication of the strength of this commitment, an additional £750,000 has been made available in the 1996 budget towards the cost or expansion of the service, bringing the total allocation for 1996 to just under £2 million.</P>
      <P>A number of proposals for new projects are currently under consideration by my Department and it is anticipated that these will be funded before the end of the year.  New projects are funded on a provisional basis for an initial period of one year.  After the satisfactory completion of one year's operations, projects can be offered a three year funding commitment, which involves signing a formal contract with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contract includes a three year work plan, prepared by the management committee of the project, in which they set out the programme of work they will undertake, and the objectives they hope to achieve in the three year period.  It is important to emphasise that while the Department of Social Welfare provides the funding for the running <Col N="113" /> costs of the projects, the service is independent and confidential.</P>
    <P>In addition to the moneylending and budgeting advice services my Department also operates a household budget deduction scheme through An Post. Under this scheme a person can arrange to have deductions made from her or his social welfare payments in respect of: rent and mortgage with their local authority, their ESB bills, their gas bills and their phone bills.  There is no charge to the customer for this service.</P>
    <P>At present this facility is available only to unemployed customers who are paid at post offices by means of the postdraft system.  There are currently 8,790 people making 13,521 deductions under the household budget deduction scheme.  Fourty-four local authorities or urban district councils are participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are around 160,000 unemployed people paid by postdraft. However the number participating has steadily increased over the past year as more people appreciate its benefits.</P>
    <P>I favour the extension of the household budgeting scheme to all social welfare customers as soon as possible.  I hope to be able to extend the deduction facility shortly to lone parents when the necessary arrangements can be completed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 27, 56, 104, 106 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985, the Commission on Social Welfare estimated that the minimum adequate income required by a single <Col N="115" /> adult was £50 per week.  This was termed the &ldquo;main rate&rdquo; and is equivalent to £68.10 in 1996 terms.</P>
    <P>At that time, the only social welfare schemes that provided rates of payment at or above the main rate were the old age contributory pension, retirement pension and some occupational injury schemes.  All other social welfare payments provided between 64 per cent and 93 per cent of the main rate.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made since 1985 in bringing rates of payment up to the minimum levels identified by the commission.  By 1990, all social welfare payments had been increased in real terms and those not already above the main rate provided between 77 per cent and 95 per cent of the main rate.</P>
    <P>The increases in this year's budget will bring all social welfare payments to a minimum of 92 per cent of the main rate, after compensating for inflation. The survivor's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit will reach the main rate when the budget increases are implemented in June 1996.  The bulk of the remaining payments will then be least 95 per cent of the main rate.</P>
    <P>Economic performance has been very strong in recent years and the economic outlook remains very positive.  It is important we take advantage of this opportunity to put in place adequate levels of income support for those who need it.</P>
    <P>While it is clearly necessary to bring the remaining payment levels up to the main rate it is also appropriate to review from time to time what constitutes a minimum adequate level of income.  To this end, I have initiated such a review and will put forward suggestions for new rates in the light of improvements in social welfare and other changes since the report of the commission was published, taking into account changes set out in the policy agreement.  It will provide an objective basis for assessing the adequacy or otherwise of the current levels of old age contributory pension and other social welfare entitlements. The review will also discuss how the <Col N="116" /> proposed rates could be indexed in future years.</P>
    <P>The review will be completed by mid 1996 and, with other reviews of the social welfare systems, such as that of the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare, will form the basis for the formulation of proposals for improvements in the social welfare system in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Consideration will be given at that time to the suggestion that increases in payment levels should be implemented on a flat-rate as opposed to percentage basis in future budgets.  Flat-rate increases provide one way of directing a relatively greater share of the available resources to those in receipt of the lowest rates of payment.  However, over time, the exclusive use of flat-rate increases would diminish the differential paid to certain groups such as old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>A percentage increase in social welfare payments adjusted to guarantee a minimum cash increase to all receipients avoids this difficulty while, at the same time, providing higher than average increases to those in receipt of the lowest rates of payment.  This is the approach I took in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Applying flat-rate increases in social welfare payments across the board would not materially affect the fact that the increases in nett income experienced over a period by people on very high salary levels will be greater than the increases in nett income experienced over the same period by people on low incomes such as the long-term unemployed.  This is simply because even modest percentage increases in salary, such as those provided for under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> (PCW), amount to a larger cash sum when applied to very highly paid people.  It will be noted in this context that fewer than 3 per cent of taxpayers are estimated to have earned income in excess of £40,000, which is the salary referred to by Deputy Flood.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have arrangements made to enable social welfare old-age pensioners to receive their pension for a reasonble number of weeks per year at a post office, other than the normal post office of payment without the pensioner being required to send the pension book to Sligo Pension Services Office at the beginning and at the end of the temporary absence(s) from the normal address.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Old age pensions are normally paid by means of personalised payable order books which are encashed at local post offices.  This payment system ensures uninterrupted payments to the majority of people whose claims are of a long-term nature.  Pension order books are mandated for payment at the post office nominated by the pensioner.</P>
      <P>If a pensioner changes address, even for a temporary period, and wishes to obtain payment at a different post office it is necessary to return the book of payable orders to the Department.  This arrangement is part of the control mechanism for the order book system and to depart from these arrangements would significantly weaken a fundamental control element.  Every effort is made to ensure that, where a pensioner returns the book in these circumstances, the changes are implemented without delay, so that a new book will issue within the week to the new post office.  This minimises any interruption of payment to the pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a more general level, I am committed to providing payment options to people in receipt of social welfare payments. In the case of old age pensions those receiving contributory pensions may opt to have their pension credited directly to their bank accounts by electronic fund transfer.  This option is now being extended to those receiving non-contributory pension.  Of course, payments which are credited to the pensioner's bank account may be accessed at banks in other parts of the country. <Col N="118" /> Depending on the person's circumstances this arrangement might provide greater flexibility for the pensioner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Death grant is a social insurance benefit which is payable, subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person or of their spouse or child under 18.  The amount of the grant varies with the contribution record and, in the case of children, with the age of the child.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the grant, which was introduced with effect from October 1970, was to help with funeral and other post-bereavement costs.  While I accept that the value of the grant has fallen, having regard to average funeral costs, there are other measures in place designed to assist people in the immediate aftermath of bereavement.</P>
      <P>For example, where a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, the payment usually continues to be paid to his or her adult dependant for six weeks.  In addition, payment may also continue for six weeks after the death of an adult or child dependant.</P>
      <P>The rate of death grant is reviewed in the context of the budget each year in common with all other social welfare rates of payment.  I am currently reviewing the present arrangements with a view to developing improved provision for income support for bereaved person generally.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the free travel scheme is to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems.  Expenditure on the scheme this year will amount to some £32.7 million and will benefit some 470,000 people.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They are necessary on city and provincial bus routes because the transport services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.</P>
      <P>However, time restrictions do not apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled or blind people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time restrictions apply generally from 7.00 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., Monday to Friday inclusive, and on Bus Éireann long-distance buses from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. on Friday for up to 20 miles from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  The removal of these restrictions would have significant cost implications for the transport companies involved who, in turn, would seek compensation from my Department. In relation specifically to Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann, it is understood that both companies would not be prepared to lift the current time restrictions, even if appropriate compensation was offered, because of the major passenger capacity constraints <Col N="120" /> operating in their case at those peak times of the day.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have no plans at present to alter the current time restrictions applying in the case of the free travel scheme.</P>

      <P>The voluntary work option, operated by my Department, enables people in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance to undertake certain types of voluntary work while retaining their unemployment payments.  The option covers a range of voluntary work, including helping the elderly, sick or handicapped and assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports clubs, cultural organisations and local residents, associations.  The groups involved may be nationally organised groups, local voluntary groups or community groups.</P>
      <P>My Department encourages voluntary organisations to involve unemployed people in their activities.  The value of the voluntary work option scheme is that it provides an opportunity for people to develop their existing skills or prepare for full-time employment while undertaking work which is of benefit to their community.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that the back-to-work allowance scheme provides an opportunity for an unemployed person to take up work in certain sectors, including voluntary organisations and community development groups, and retain a percentage of his or her payment. Eligible participants retain 75 per cent, 50 per cent and 25 per cent of their payments for the first, second and third year respectively while also retaining their secondary benefits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The part-time job incentive scheme was introduced on a pilot basis in mid 1986 and was extended nation-wide in 1988.  It was one of my Department's early measures to assist the long-term unemployed in gaining access to the labour market.  It allows the long-term unemployed to take up part-time employment while continuing to receive a flat rate income supplement from my Department.  The objective of the scheme is to encourage the long-term unemployed to make the transition to full-time employment.  There are 538 persons only participating in the scheme at present.  Persons with dependent children who work for between 20 and 24 hours a week may also claim family income supplement.

      <P>Social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988.  Some 138,000 self-employed people are now registered with the Department.</P>
      <P>While precise figures are difficult to calculate, it is estimated that up to 50,000 self-employed people may fail to qualify for an old age contributory pension because they were over 56 in 1988 &mdash; this is very much an upper limit estimate. Many of these people, however, are likely to qualify for an old age non-contributory pension which is payable subject to a means test.  They are, of course, covered for survivor's and orphan's pensions.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Self-employed people who were over 56 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed and who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 &mdash; depending on their total contribution record &mdash; could qualify for the old age contributory pension, as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension entitlement purposes.  As these people first entered the social insurance system prior to age 56 they were not entitled to a refund of contributions in the event of failing to qualify for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> As the Deputy will be aware, the legislation dealing with refunds of contributions has been under review in my Department.</P>
    <P>As a result of this review it has been decided that, where a self-employed person was over age 56 in 1988, when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced, and whose only previous contributions were prior to 1953 &mdash; when the unified system of social insurance was first introduced &mdash; a refund of the old age pension portion of their self-employed contribution will be made to that person provided they do not qualify for an old age non-contributory pension.  Approximately 400 people will be entitled to refunds which will be made by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to those self-employed contributors who were over 56 years in 1988 and whose previous contributions include contributions after the unified system of social insurance was introduced in 1953, a decision in respect of refunds in their cases will not be made until full consideration has been given to the question of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions.</P>
    <P>The whole question of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions falls to be considered both in the context of the recommendations contained in the final report of the National Pensions Board &mdash;<i>Developing the National Pension System</i>&mdash; and, in a budgetary context, also taking account of the overall future financing of pensions.</P>

However, the legislation also specifies that no claim can be backdated more than six months prior to the date of claim.</P>
      <P>A pension claim from the person concerned was received by the Department in April 1994.  A decision was made initially to award her widow's contributory pension with effect from January 1994, three months prior to the receipt of her claim.  Subsequently it was decided to backdate the award by a further three months &mdash; that is, six months in total &mdash; to October 1993. Accordingly, the person concerned has received her pension backdated to the maximum period allowable in legislation.</P>
      <P>Any further backdating of pension award for longer periods, in late claim cases such as that of the person concerned, would require a change in regulations. The Department is at present carrying out a review of these provisions. I should point out, however, that any relaxation in the present backdating arrangements would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The blind pension, first introduced in 1920, is a means-tested pension payable to people who are resident in the State and are blind or visually impaired.  The blind pension has been historically linked with the old age non-contributory pension.  It is payable at the same rate and subject to the same general means test conditions as that pension. Those persons in receipt of a blind pension automatically qualify for free travel and may also qualify for the free schemes operated by my Department subject, of course, to the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>When a blind or visually impaired person reaches 66 they can qualify for an old age contributory pension (age 65 in the case of retirement pension) subject, of course, to satisfying the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>Persons in receipt of a blind pension from my Department can also qualify for widow's non-contributory pension, survivor's pension, deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance, lone parent's allowance, unemployment benefit or disability benefit and may receive both payments simultaneously.  Duplicate adult and child dependant allowances are also paid in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blind pensions form part of the social assistance payments which target resources towards those most in need. There are also proposals to introduce <Col N="126" /> either a contributory blind pension or a contributory blind old age pension.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government commitment to openness and transparency there is a commitment on the part of the Department of Social Welfare to publish all the guidance given by the Department on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to the health boards, who administer the scheme.  The first step of this task was completed on 19 October 1995 when the guidelines on exceptional needs payments were made public for the first time ever.  In the preparation for publication of the guidance on rent and mortgage supplements, it was considered appropriate to give a legislative basis to this guidance, where it was possible to do so.  This has been done through two new SIs Nos. 381 and 382 of 1995, copies of which can be made available to the Deputy on request.  Those aspects of the guidance on rent and mortgage supplements which did not lend themselves to incorporation in an SI will be published as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current guidance on rent and mortgage supplements is, therefore, contained in the new SI No. 382 of 1995 and the explanatory documentation which was sent to the health boards with the SI.  The current guidance builds on the previous guidance which was drawn up in 1988 and incorporates some of the <Col N="127" /> good administrative practices which have been developed within the health boards since then.</P>
    <P>The main change from the 1988 guidance is that some direction which was formerly contained in administrative internal circulars is now covered by a statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>I also availed of the opportunity to consolidate the regulatory provisions relating to supplementary welfare allowance and related provisions governing the making of claims and payments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 42, 46 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The integrated short-term schemes system (ISTS) is part of a continuing programme of improvement and modernisation of my Department's systems and services that has been under way for a number of years.  The ISTS project is the biggest one ever undertaken by <Col N="128" /> the Department and impinges on the work of over 2,000 staff located throughout the country.  The project's aim is to provide a single integrated system for the processing and payment of all short-term social welfare payments, viz., unemployment payments, sickness benefits, and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Most of the work on the development and implementation of the new system was done by staff of the Department who are normally engaged on development and business change programmes. Additional costs arose from the appointment of extra staff, the engagement of external assistance in the development of the software and management of the project, the provision of specific technical skills, the purchase of additional computing capacity and the training of staff in the use of the system.</P>
    <P>The system was developed in two phases.  Phase 1 which caters for unemployment payments went live at the first social welfare local office in March 1995 and now operates in all 55 local offices throughout the country.  Some 230,000 unemployment claims are now being processed and paid by the ISTS system.</P>
    <P>Phase 2 of the project is due to go live in early May 1996 with additional features for the unemployment payments system.  It will be extended to sickness benefit schemes in June.  Towards the end of May the systems will be extended to the first community welfare officers employed by the health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The computerisation of supplementary welfare allowance will bring significant benefits in the form of better customer service, better support for the community welfare officers, and improved control of expenditure.  Network access to the new system will be extended to some 450 community welfare officers in a 12 month rollout period from June this year.</P>
    <P>Specific costs which arose during the development and implementation of the system in 1993, 1994 and 1995 are as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The document to which the Deputy refers is based on a survey of the quality and conditions of service for social welfare recipients at social welfare local offices, health board offices, post offices and Garda stations.  While the survey was limited it highlights issues that have been and are continuing to be addressed by the Department in an active way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has made significant <Col N="131" /> progress in recent years in improving the quality of services provided to social welfare recipients and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The regional management structure introduced a number of years ago has enabled a more focused and co-ordinated approach at local level to the delivery of services to customers.</P>
    <P>Local access to the full range of social services is an important objective.  A continuing programme of investment in accommodation means that there is a growing number of more modern offices.  My Department is also in the process of modernising its computer systems in its local offices, to support a wider range of information and other services for people.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the employment support service has given pro-active support to the unemployed, particularly to the long-term unemployed, to facilitate their access to an enhanced range of work, training and development opportunities.</P>
    <P>The strategic management initiative has presented my Department with the opportunity to build on these initiatives and improving customer service is one of the priority areas for action.</P>
    <P>The primary objective is to develop and build upon the existing customer service culture across all activities of the Department with the aim of ensuring high standards of service, value for money, efficiency, courtesy and accountability.</P>
    <P>The programme of action over the next few years will include; further development of local social welfare offices to ensure that people have improved access to services, better privacy facilities, better information, and, when possible, access to complementary services provided by other statutory agencies; new payment, facilities; a concerted drive to simplify social welfare services, access to them, and information about them and better information about entitlements.</P>
    <P>The Department relies extensively on feedback from customers as a valuable <Col N="132" /> input to help improve services.  As part of this feedback process, sample surveys of people in receipt of various benefits including those in receipt of unemployment payments have been carried out by the Department over the past number of years.  In addition, the Department invites comments from members of the public through comment cards which are available at all our main offices.  The Department also has a number of customer panels in place where officials and customers meet on a regular basis to discuss issues, concerns and improvements generally.  To complement these activities my Department is also conducting a nationwide survey on customer service using independent market research consultancy.</P>
    <P>My aim is for an efficient, professional and responsive system that will serve the needs of all those who come in contact with the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>The nutrition advisory group (NAG) was established by the Minister for Health in 1991.  Its brief was to advise on all issues relating to nutrition and to draw up recommendations for a food and nutrition policy.</P>
      <P>The group published its report Recommendations for a Food and Nutrition Policy for Ireland on 16 November 1995.  It recommends that all government departments should be required to take health considerations into account when deciding on policies which influence food production and consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> Under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependent of his, has an entitlement to Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA).  It is expected that the normal day to day food bills would be met from any weekly social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>As long as a person is entitled to receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, additional assistance in the form of a weekly diet supplement, is available to an eligible person who has been prescribed a specified diet arising from a specific medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards under the provisions of SI No. 382 of 1995 which specifies the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid.  The main considerations in determining entitlement for a diet supplement are by reference to the type of diet prescribed, the household income and whether the person in respect of whom the diet supplement is payable is an adult or a child.  A person who wishes to apply for a diet supplement should contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement of December 1994, A Government of Renewal, included a commitment to commission the Economic and Social Research Institute to review the minimum adequate income rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The review is under way and will put forward suggestions for new rates in the light of improvements in social welfare and other changes since the report of the commission was published, taking into account changes set out in the policy agreement.  It will provide an objective basis for assessing the adequacy of payments taking account of clients' basic needs.  The review will be completed by mid 1996.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people who are unable to meet their housing needs from their own resources. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.  In the calculation of the amount of rent supplement payable, the legislation enables the health board to set rent limits.</P>
      <P>The community employment (CE) scheme was launched on 11 April 1994, by the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, following a review of existing schemes for the unemployed by an interdepartmental policy committee on local development.  The highest weekly or monthly outgoing for most people is in respect of their rent or mortgage payments.  It was decided that a contribution towards these costs would continue by allowing participants on community employment schemes to retain secondary benefits, and thus to reduce the disincentives arising from the loss of such benefits on taking up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the community employment scheme participants may have income up to £250 per week and <Col N="135" /> retain their entitlement to rent-mortgage interest supplements and must contribute a standard minimum contribution of £8.10 towards their accommodation costs.</P>
    <P>In addition rent and mortgage supplementation is subject to a maximum limit of £250 per month.</P>
    <P>These arrangements which apply to all community employment participants irrespective of family size are considered to be reasonably generous for all within the terms of the scheme and not to discriminate unfairly against any category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 40 together.  The issue of co-habitation is of relevance mainly to deserted wife's benefit and allowance, lone parent's allowance, contributory pension for widows and widowers and the widow's non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as satisfying the cohabitation conditions, the following conditions also apply to an applicant for deserted wife's benefit or deserted wife's allowance: she must be deserted by her husband for at least three months; she must not be adequately maintained by him; she must have made appropriate efforts to secure maintenance.  In general, I am satisfied <Col N="136" /> that the Department takes all due and reasonable audit steps, at both new claims and review stages, to validate the family status of applicants and beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>In determining entitlement to these payments, deciding officers who are statutorily appointed and are independent in the exercise of their functions must satisfy themselves that all the statutory conditions are satisfied.</P>
    <P>Relevant information is supplied by the applicant on the claim form, and in supporting documents such as birth and marriage certificates.  In the case of claims to deserted wife's benefit and deserted wife's allowance a local inspector interviews the applicant and requests information on the circumstances giving rise to the separation and the efforts made to secure maintenance.  The husband is also interviewed when his whereabouts are known.  Following this it may be necessary to have a further interview with his wife.  The objective is to obtain the fullest picture possible of the circumstances and to ensure that the rights of both partners to the marriage are fully respected. The process also ensures that the husband is aware of his statutory obligations to contribute towards the cost of a lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit or deserted wife's allowance awarded to his wife.  Where payment is awarded, the claim is subject to periodic review.</P>
    <P>The issue of cohabitation may arise at initial investigation or at a subsequent review.  There is no definition in social welfare legislation of what constitutes cohabitation.  The question for determination by the deciding officer, or appeals officer in the case of an appeal, is whether the relationship between the two people involved is such that they should be regarded as living together as husband and wife.  There is no single factor by which this issue can be decided.  However, court case law indicates that issues such as co-residence and relationship, for example, financial, social etc., should be considered in determining the question of cohabitation and deciding officers are made <Col N="137" /> aware of and have regard to these in giving decisions on this issue.</P>
    <P>Domestic household and financial relationships can vary widely, not just for cohabitating couples, but for married couples also.  Each potential cohabitation must be considered on the particular facts of that case.  The deciding officer, in the final analysis, must form a judgment on whether the circumstances of a case are sufficiently similar to those of a married couple as to constitute cohabitation as man and wife. The person concerned is always afforded an opportunity by the deciding officer under natural justice rules to comment on the evidence available before a formal decision is made.  Where payment is refused or withdrawn, the person concerned has the right to appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

    <P>(Includes Exchequer and non-Exchequer funds).</P>
    <P>I consider the Combat Poverty Agency to be a strategic national resource in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.  The agency plays a very significant role in advising on policies that impact on poverty.  It promotes research into the causes and effects of poverty.  It raises public awareness of policy issues and it supports pilot projects to tackle poverty.  In all of these ways, the work of the agency has in my view brought tangible benefits for disadvantaged sectors in our society.</P>
    <P>The agency has helped ensure that poverty remains high on the national policy agenda.  The agency has placed much emphasis, supported by research, on the importance of addressing child poverty.  It has supported pilot projects for disadvantaged youth and has put forward proposals relating to reducing educational disadvantage at preschool and primary level.  It has played a key role in creating a debate on the changing nature of the family in Ireland and the implications of this for poverty and social policy here.</P>
    <P>The development of North-South exchanges between groups and individuals involved in community development is a very important initiative in <Col N="139" /> which the agency is centrally involved. Cross-Border links between community groups have been in existence for some time now and an anti-poverty exchange programme will serve to consolidate and increase these links in the context of the peace process.</P>
    <P>A key role is being played by the agency in the development of a national anti-poverty strategy.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government approved the development of a national anti-poverty strategy in April last year.  This strategy places poverty and inequality issues firmly at the heart of national policy-making with the aim of developing a more inclusive and just society.  Considerable progress has already been achieved in the development of this strategy such as the preparation of a number of draft reports including an Overview Paper on Poverty in Ireland, and the holding of seminars in a number of locations.  The agency has been very actively involved in this process.</P>
    <P>Research undertaken by the agency had a pivotal role in the Department's money advice and budgeting service (MABS) initiative.  There are now over 30 MABS projects throughout the country. An important element of the approach is the targeting of families who have been identified as having particular problems with debt and moneylending.</P>
    <P>The agency has had a major role in the community development sector since its inception.  It has assisted the growth of community development and has encouraged the growth and development of locally based groups.  It has provided a source of continuous support to groups wishing to commence projects and has provided specific funding to community groups for training, development and evaluation purposes. The agency has also provided substantial support for projects funded under the EU poverty programmes.</P>
    <P>While I have highlighted some of the issues in which the agency has played a fundamental role over the last number of years these are in no way exhaustive <Col N="140" /> and I have no doubt but that the agency will continue to play a key role in the effort to eliminate poverty and social exclusion in this country.</P>
    <P>As there have been many significant changes in the years since the agency was set up, including the development of a national anti-poverty strategy and considerable developments at EU level, I commissioned a review of the Combat Poverty Agency in 1995.  The purpose of the review is to identify and describe the full range of the agency's activities to date and to identify priority objectives for the agency in the light of the changed environment in which it now operates.  The report will be published shortly and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the fact that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and <Col N="141" /> spring, the scheme is not confined to the winter months but runs for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
    <P>Last year I increased the income limit for the national fuel scheme from £5 to £10 per week.  In this year's budget I announced a further £5 increase in the income limit which will take effect from October 1996.  This means that a person may have a combined household income of £15 per week over the appropriate Irish maximum contributory pension rate or savings/investments of £8,000, and still qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>The scheme is a fixed scheme; it is not temperature related.  As a result there may be a small number of occasions when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably cold.  However, as the scheme extends over six months of the year, this is likely to be the exception rather than the rule. Of course there will also be times when the allowances will be paid even though temperatures are above the seasonal norm.</P>
    <P>Although the national fuel scheme operates for a fixed period, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement.  An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the local community welfare officer.</P>
    <P>Any extension to the rate of the fuel allowance or to the duration of the national fuel scheme would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  It is estimated that to extend the scheme for one month would cost £7 million and to increase the rate from £5 to £7.50 would cost an estimated £18.3 million.</P>
    <P>In the five year period from 1989 to 1994 expenditure on the national fuel scheme increased by almost 54 per cent. <Col N="142" /> This year a sum of £44.5 million has been set aside in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>

      <P>Voluntary and community groups can play a vital role in improving the quality of life for people dependent on social welfare thus enabling them to change their situation for the better.</P>
      <P>My Department funds a number of once-off grant schemes which concentrate on support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work.  The individual grant schemes provided to support such voluntary and community activity are as follows; scheme of grants to voluntary organisations; scheme of grants for locally-based women's groups; scheme of grants for locally-based men's groups; scheme of grants for lone parents, second chance education and return to work opportunities.</P>
      <P>The Department under its community development programme and the money advice and budgeting service provides seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>Under the community development programme funding is provided towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in an area and to other specialised community development projects. This programme was established in 1990 when 15 projects were funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are some 75 projects participating in the programme or in the process of being set up.  I am at present <Col N="143" /> considering a number of new applications and it is my intention to extend the programme further in 1996.</P>
    <P>A number of community development support agencies have also been contracted under the community development programme to provide support and advice to local projects and set standards for their work.  There is also a provision of capacity-building in disadvantaged areas which lack basic infrastructural development work and in this regard I have asked that a number of areas be looked at.</P>
    <P>The Department has also been directly involved in activities to tackle the problems of moneylending and overindebtedness since the publication of 1988 of the Combat Poverty Agency's report <i>Moneylending and Low Income Families</i>.  At present, the Department funds 35 money advice and budgeting service (MABS) projects throughout the country.  This service has an emphasis on practical budget based measures that will encourage people to help themselves to tackle problems of indebtedness.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated, I am committed to making this service available nation-wide by the end of the 1996. As an indication of the strength of this commitment, an additional £750,000 has been made available in the 1996 budget towards the expansion of the MABS service, bringing the total allocation for 1996 to just under £2 million.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals for new projects are currently under consideration by my Department and it is anticipated that these will be funded before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Finally the Combat Poverty Agency provides once-off funding for community and voluntary groups i.e. community development education and training grants scheme, occasional grants for once-off activities and research grants.  These grants are aimed at enabling groups to develop a deeper insight into the causes of disadvantage or to enable groups to evaluate the <Col N="144" /> adequacy of their own response to tackling poverty.</P>
    <P>In addition, the agency will be responsible for managing a budget of some £13 million over a three year period under the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The agency will have specific responsibility for delivering measures within the programme relating to (1) cross-Border community reconciliation, (2) developing grassroots capacities, (3) promoting the inclusion of women and other vulnerable groups and (4) improving the accessibility of services aimed at these groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my objectives as Minister for Social Welfare is to build a social welfare system which is truly &ldquo;work-friendly&rdquo; in the sense that it not only provides an adequate minimum income for people without other adequate means of support, but enables such people to take up any employment opportunities which may arise for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this aim in mind, I have been reviewing the various obstacles facing unemployed people who are presented with job opportunities.  I am intending to make a number of significant reforms which will, I hope, make it much more worth while for unemployed people to take up work opportunities in the future.  I hope, for example, to make it less risky for them to do so, particularly if they have families to support, by enabling them to retain certain welfare payments until they get a firm foothold <Col N="145" /> in the labour market, or until their income exceeds levels that put them out of danger of poverty.  In this context I made a speech last October in UCD in which I pointed out that these types of measures to encourage unemployed people back into the workforce can be seen as representing a form of subsidy to employers towards the cost of hiring labour.  Already that subsidy is considerable. Therefore, making the social welfare system even more friendly and generous towards employment means, essentially, providing an even greater subsidy to Irish business than is already the case.</P>
    <P>I see a move towards decent, acceptable wage levels in all industries and occupations as the employers' <i>quid pro quo</i> for the social welfare and tax changes which the Government is introducing to improve the net return from work, especially low-paid work.  In statements which I have made, I have urged IBEC and other employers' organisations to begin to consider how, in the light of other pro-employment changes in the tax and welfare areas, the problem of low pay can best be addressed.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I made was that we could build on the rudimentary system of &ldquo;sectoral minimum wages&rdquo;, as represented by the legally-binding Joint Labour Committee rates in a number of industries and the Registered Employment Agreement provisions of the industrial relations legislation (which altogether cover around 150,000 workers).  I would like to see an extension of the JLC arrangements to other industries and occupations; and the system developed to cover all sectors in which low pay is actually a problem. Even now considerable progress on dealing with low pay could be made under the existing JLC and Labour Court arrangements if the social partners, particularly employers, were agreeable to it.</P>
    <P>Low pay is not a problem in all industries and sectors, so I do not see that we need to address all sectors immediately.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel companion pass, which was introduced in 1990, is aimed primarily at incapacitated people who are unable to travel alone and who would otherwise be unable to benefit under the free travel scheme.  It is a special version of the standard travel pass and enables a companion to travel free with the passholder.</P>
      <P>Free travel companion passes are available to people in receipt of a blind person's pension from my Department and to certain other people who are currently, or who were previously, in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards. Companion passes are also available to people in receipt of invalidity pension who are wheelchair-bound.  As announced in last month's budget, companion passes are also to be given to blind or visually impaired children with effect from next July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in receipt of a blind person's pension who reach pension age and qualify for the old age (non-contributory) pension retain their free travel companion pass.  Furthermore, pensioners who become blind have the option of applying for the blind person's pension which, if granted, would be paid in lieu of their old age pension.  In these <Col N="147" /> circumstances, they would also qualify for the companion pass.  Last year, the companion pass was further extended to include existing free travel passholders who are being cared for by recipients of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>No statistics are maintained by my Department as to the number of people who qualify for old age (non-contributory) pension and who subsequently become blind.  However, as said earlier, people in this category may apply to be transferred to blind pension which is payable at the same rate as old age (non-contributory) pension.</P>
    <P>Information is not available as to the number of blind recipients of old age (contributory) pension.  People in this category would normally not qualify for blind pension during their working lives due to the application of the means test.</P>

      <P>The free cross-Border travel scheme was introduced between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in July last year.  It is available to passholders in the Republic, their spouses or companions in the case of people holding companion passes, and to Northern Ireland concession travel passholders.</P>
      <P>Since the scheme's inception, a total of 118,882 cross-Border trips have been undertaken up to the end of January last at a cost of almost £1.2 million. This includes an estimated 46,000 passengers who have travelled from Northern Ireland to the Republic.</P>

      <P>Social welfare regulations, provide for the refund of the old age pension element of self-employment contributions paid by a person who entered social insurance for the first time after attaining the age of 56 years. However, under the regulations no contribution shall be returned in respect of an insured person who is entitled to, or in receipt of, a retirement pension, an old age (contributory) pension or an old age (non-contributory) pension.  Before a refund can be made in any particular case, it is necessary to establish if the person has an entitlement to any of these pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will, of course, have available to it all the information necessary to decide if the person is entitled to a retirement pension or an old age (contributory) pension based on social insurance contributions.  However, it will not be in a position to know if the person would have an entitlement to an old age (non-contributory) pension which is based on a means test.  The only practical way of establishing this is for a person to apply for the pension.  While the formality of completing a claim form may appear unnecessary to people who will, themselves, know that they have no <Col N="149" /> chance of qualifying for a non-contributory pension, nonetheless, it is necessary for the Department to satisfy itself that entitlement to a pension does not exist before a claim for a refund can be entertained.</P>

      <P>When this Government assumed office Mr. Tony Heffernan was appointed Assistant Government Press Secretary by the Taoiseach on foot of my nomination.  This is in accordance with standard practice where the Government comprises a number of parties, each of the party leaders appoints a nominee to a senior Government press role.  Mr. Heffernan took up his duties on 7 January 1995.</P>
      <P>I appointed Ms Anna Lee chair of the Combat Poverty Agency.  Ms Lee is highly qualified for the position.  She has a 20 years record of outstanding work on social and community issues and is currently manager of the Tallaght Partnership, one of the most effective partnerships in the country.  Ms Lee enjoys the absolute respect of the voluntary and community sector and of the social partners involved in local development issues for expertise, commitment and independence.  Ms Lee assumed her duties with Combat Poverty Agency 21 June 1995.  The position is unpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appointed Mr. Eamon Heffernan chairman of the National Pensions Board with effect from 20 December 1995.  Mr. Heffernan brings to this position his 30 years of experience in the <Col N="150" /> pensions industry with the esteem and recognition of his professional colleagues. He is a past president of the Irish Association of Pensions Funds and was nominated by that body to serve on the National Pensions Board, 1986 93 and the outgoing National Pensions Board, 1990-95.  His nomination was approved on each occasion by my predecessors.</P>
    <P>I was aware at the time of the appointments that the Heffernans are brothers and that Ms Lee is married to Mr. Tony Heffernan.  I knew when making the appointments that it was likely that Fianna Fáil would seek to make an issue of this fact.  I do not believe the fact of family relationships should militate against the appointment of people of ability.  The appointment of each of the three persons in question was based entirely on merit and their undoubted and unchallenged suitability for the tasks to be undertaken.  No expression of public concern has been brought to my attention other than that expressed by the Deputy himself in a Sunday newspaper.  There is no salary attached to the position of chairman of the combat Poverty Agency.  The chairman of the National Pensions Board receives an annual payment of £2,000.  This does not come from the Exchequer, but from the resources of the National Pensions Board.  All the appointments and nominations I have made to boards since becoming a member of Government are similarly based on the principles of merit and suitability.</P>

      <P>The free schemes mentioned by the Deputy are normally available only to people in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and either living alone or with certain excepted persons.  In the case of free telephone rental allowance, for example, the excepted categories include dependent children under the age of 15 and people so permanently handicapped that they could not get help in an emergency.  In last month's budget I announced that the age limit for dependent children is being increased from 15 to 18 years with effect from next July.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, first time applicants for both the free electricity and telephone rental allowance, aged 75 years and over, may qualify if there is one person residing with them who is not normally an excepted person.  I have no plans at present to extend the free schemes to all new applicants, regardless of age and where at least one person, other than an excepted person, is residing in the household.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Deputy's previous question on this matter, I undertook to contact each of the transport operators currently participating in the free travel pass scheme on the question of accessible transport.  There are currently 48 operators which include the CIE Group, Northern Ireland Railways, 36 private bus operators, nine private ferry operators and one private airline <Col N="152" /> operator.  My Department wrote to each of them last November requesting details of any arrangements which they had in place to cater for the specific needs of disabled or infirm people wishing to use their transport services.</P>
      <P>In particular, the transport operators were asked: if their drivers were encouraged to assist disabled passengers in embarking or disembarking from their vehicles; if they had boarding ramps to enable wheelchair users to embark and disembark in safety; if they had spaces on board their vehicles which were set aside for the exclusive use of disabled passengers; what plans, if any, they had to provide such facilities in the near future, and if they had any other ideas on how access for disabled people might be improved on the transport services they provide.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of 34 replies have been received and reminders have issued to those operators who have not yet responded.  Most of the operators who have replied have indicated that they were able to provide some form of facility for the disabled.  All of them stated that their drivers assist disabled people in whatever way possible.  Some respondents said that they would be prepared to adapt their vehicles or invest in new vehicles if they received financial assistance from my Department.</P>
      <P>I will review the situation in the light of the responses received from all transport operators to see what can be done to further address the issue of accessible transport for infirm people or people with disabilities within the scope of my Department's free travel scheme.</P>

      <P>In reply to previous questions about this matter I indicated that my Department acts on any information it receives about possible abuse of the social welfare system.

      <P>A record is not maintained in my Department of the number of reports of cases of possible abuse of the social welfare system received from the Garda or any other source.  I am not, therefore, in a position to give the Deputy the information he requests.</P>

      <P>Payment of a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is provided for in section 179 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 as amended by paragraph 3 of the Sixth Schedule to that Act and in SI 382 of 1995.</P>

      <Col N="154" /> A person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, or the needs of any dependants, may be eligible to receive a diet supplement where the person, or their dependants, has been prescribed a specified diet by a hospital consultant or qualified dietition in respect of a specified medical condition.</P>
    <P>Recent changes to the legislation relating to diet supplements has led to the following improvements: a standard supplement of either £5 or £8, depending on the type of diet, is paid in respect of child dependants under the age of 18 years of age; the definition of a qualified child has been extended, for the purposes of diet supplements, to include children between 18 and 22 years of age in full-time education who are dependent on their parents &mdash; such child dependants are treated as adults for the purpose of calculating the amount of diet supplement to be paid; the amount of supplement paid in respect of an adult is either £27 or £35, depending on the type of diet, less a proportion of the applicant's weekly income &mdash; the amount of this reduction depends on whether the applicant is: a single person or lone parent; a member of a couple; in receipt of a rent or mortgage supplement; the amount of any benefit or assistance paid in respect of a child dependant is not assessed as income when calculating a diet supplement in respect of an adult; where the applicant is in receipt of a rent or mortgage supplement, any excess income over the SWA rate is not taken into account when calculating the diet supplement.  This allows for the fact that such excess income has already been taken into account when calculating the rent or mortgage supplement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rate of diet supplement payable, it is my intention to take the necessary steps, within a budgetary context, to ensure that the rates will be increased in line with the rates of other social welfare payments. This should ensure that eligible applicants will retain the full value of the diet supplement.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I met EU Commissioner for Social Affairs Pádraig Flynn on 23 November last.  The purpose of the meeting was indeed, as suggested by the Deputy, to advance planning for those aspects of the Irish Presidency of the EU which relate to my Department and to ensure the necessary degree of co-ordination between the Commission and my Department.</P>
      <P>In a reply to a question from Deputy Ned O'Keeffe on 14 November, shortly before this meeting, I had outlined the programme of Council meetings and conferences which I was proposing to hold during our Presidency, together with the issues to which I was seeking to give priority attention.  Following my meeting with the Commissioner and subsequent discussions at official level with the Commission and with the Italian Presidency, the plans I outlined then remain unchanged but have been firmed up in several respects.  For example, I referred in November to the Commission's communication on &ldquo;The Future of Social Protection&rdquo; and my wish to have a debate among my fellow social security Ministers on this document. It is my intention that the Informal Social Affairs Council Meeting, to be held in Dublin Castle on 10-11 July next will be devoted to one of the topics raised in the communication, namely the positive role of social protection in the fight against unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that social exclusion was the second issue to which I attached priority in my reply of 14 November last.  I set out in detail the <Col N="156" /> position in relation to the impasse which exists regarding the Poverty 4 programme in a reply to the Deputy during my last Question Time before the House on 23 January 1996.</P>
    <P>I will seek all opportunities to place the issue of social exclusion, and the question of the development of an appropriate response by the European Union, on the agenda during my Presidency of the Social Affairs Council.  It will certainly arise in the context of the ongoing discussion on the Commission's communication &ldquo;The Future of Social Protection&rdquo; to which I referred earlier. In addition, the European Commission has promised a document by the autumn of this year reviewing all areas of Community activity in relation to social exclusion.</P>

      <P>The process of the evaluation by the users and technical staff of the board of equipment to be installed in this unit has been ongoing culminating in the placing of the required advertisement for the equipment in January 1996.</P>
      <P>The Board is conscious of the hardship to patients who are required to travel to Dublin for this treatment and are working towards the opening of the new renal dialysis unit at the earliest possible date in the coming months.  In the meantime, the existing dialysis unit is still operational and will continue to function pending the opening of the new unit which will mean an increase in the number of dialysis places from five to nine.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to special funding for transport purposes to enable hearing impaired children to attend their school which is more than 20 miles from their homes. Wherever possible, my Department arranges transport for such children on the school transport service.  However, in some cases it is simply not possible to provide particular children with school transport due to the excessive costs or distances involved.  In such cases my Department offers the alternative of a grant to parents towards the cost of making private transport arrangements. The amount of grant paid in such cases depends on the distance involved and the level of school attendance of the pupil.</P>
      <P>The rate of grant payable in such cases has recently been significantly increased.  The maximum annual grant per child travelling between 15 and 25 miles to a special school or class now stands at £1,250.  The maximum amount payable for distances over 25 miles now stands at £1,500.  The maximum grant previously available in respect of all such distances was £600.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; is an educational package for use with second-level students aimed at the development of personal and social skills for the prevention of substance abuse.  The overall aim of the package is to enable students to develop the ability to take charge of their health and specifically, to make conscious and informed decisions about the use of drugs (legal and illegal) in their lives. Information on drugs is integrated with exercises and lessons relating to identity and self-esteem, understanding influences, assertive communication, feelings and decision-making.</P>
      <P>The programme was developed by the Department of Education and the Department of Health in conjunction with the Mater Dei Counselling Centre. It was launched in October 1994 and is being disseminated to second level schools generally since then.  To date, approximately 600 schools here participated in the training programmes which enable them to receive the resource materials and begin the programme in their schools.  This dissemination will continue so that all second-level schools will have the opportunity of availing of the programme.</P>
      <P>Data on the number of pupils who have completed the programme are not yet available.  However, the steering committee for the project are conducting a survey of its use in schools and information on the number of pupils involved should be available later in the year when the survey is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is training provided for those teachers who use the resource materials and teach the programme in schools. This training is supported by the in-career development unit of my Department and takes place at venues throughout the country.  Each training course is of 50 hours duration and deals with the participatory methods appropriate to the use of the materials.  Principals of <Col N="166" /> the schools concerned participate in sessions of the training dealing with organisation of the programme in schools. Forty-six training courses have been organised since the programme was launched in October 1994 including two running at present.  Further courses are being planned at present.</P>

    <P>The above upgrades arose from an error in not giving credit for all components of the art examination.  In addition, further investigation has now revealed that one further upgrade is warranted as a result of the incorrect processing of an appeal.  The candidate and school are being advised of the revised result.  All aspects of this further upgrade will be addressed by Price Waterhouse in their ongoing inquiry.</P>

      <P>The amount allocated to funding of the Irish Association for Victim Support in 1995 was £130,000.  The payment is a contribution towards the general expenses of administration and training of the association.  It was on this basis that the Dáil approved of the inclusion of this sum in the Estimates for my Department &mdash; see subhead D.2 of the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice for 1995.</P>
      <P>The Irish Association for Victim Support is a voluntary body, independent of my Department, which provides an invaluable service to victims of crime and the allocation of this funding is, primarily, a matter for them to decide.  The association submits to my Department audited accounts of how the allocation is spent.  However, the audited accounts do not provide a breakdown of the allocation on a region by region basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> I am aware that the association has established branches in the following locations: County Carlow, one branch; County Cork, four branches; County Dublin, four branches; County Laois, one branch; County Louth, one branch; County Mayo, one branch; County Sligo, one branch; County Westmeath, one branch; County Wexford, one branch; County Wicklow, one branch.</P>
    <P>I understand that the association is planning to open new branches in counties Galway, Kerry, Limerick and Waterford as well as setting-up further units of existing branches this year.  In addition, the association has established the court victim witness service, based in the Four Courts, Dublin.  The association also runs a 24-hour national helpline for victims and, in association with the Garda Síochána, the Department of Tourism and Trade and sponsors from the tourism industry, they operate the tourist victim support service.</P>

      <P>The latest year for which complete overpayment statistics are available is 1994.  In that year, 11,040 overpayments, amounting to £11.5 million, were attributed to fraud or suspected fraud.  A further 15,797 overpayments, amounting to £4.5 million, arose due to a variety of reasons including errors by claimants and departmental error.</P>
      <P>While every effort is made to recover overpayments due regard is had to the capacity of the individuals concerned to make repayments.  In some cases it may be possible to recover the overpayment immediately while in others it may take a number of years.  In 1994 £5.4 million was recovered in respect of both fraud and non-fraud overpayments which occurred in 1994 and in earlier years. Separate figures are not maintained for amounts recovered in respect of fraud overpayments.</P>
      <P>Overpayments should be viewed in the context of the scale of operation of my Department.  In 1994 the value of overpayments represented less than half of one per cent of total scheme expenditure. There were some 823,000 claimants of a weekly social welfare payment at the end of 1994 covering nearly 1.5 million people and nearly half a million families were in receipt of child benefit.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 101 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years or over and also to certain disabled people under that age.  The other schemes of free electricity allowance, free colour television licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>Retired civil or public servants may, depending on the level of their pensions, be entitled to receive an old age (non-contributory) pension from my Department even at a reduced rate.  If they are so entitled and can satisfy the living alone condition, they will also qualify for the free schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In last month's budget I announced a major extension of the free schemes in so far as low income pensioners, whether private sector or public service, are concerned.  From next July, these schemes will be available to low income <Col N="176" /> pensioners who do not qualify at present because they do not get a social welfare pension and whose weekly means do not exceed the new maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension (£75 per week), plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.  Pensioners whose weekly means come within those limits, who only have access to free travel at present, will now, for the first time, have access to all the free schemes.</P>
    <P>Any further extension of the free schemes to public service pensioners not qualified under current conditions would have financial implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the issues regarding the ageing of the population.  On a number of occasions recently I have drawn attention to the demographic patterns which indicate a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population over the first half of the next century.  This will have a significant impact on the future costs of social welfare pensions, which are set to increase by some 100 per cent by the year 2035.  At the same time, the ratio of persons in the economically active age group to those over age 65 is projected to fall.  This would result, in the absence of any policy change, in the increasing burden of the cost of pensions falling on future generations of PRSI contributors and taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are important factors in any consideration of the development of future pension arrangements and the SIF and require us to consider the capacity of the present financing <Col N="177" /> arrangements to meet these emerging costs.  The pensions industry is also placing considerable emphasis on this issue at present.  One aspect which needs to be examined further in this regard is the effect of real long-term growth in the economy.  If this is maintained, it should increase the resources available to pay for pensions in the future; although as the Deputy will appreciate, there will be many competing claims for any resources freed up as a result of this growth.  I am examining the reports on this area at present.</P>
    <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board &lsquo;Developing the National Pension System&rsquo; raised and considered these issues.  This report is being considered within my Department at present and I intend to bring forward proposals based on the recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>In this context, a major survey of occupational pension schemes, which was recommended by the National Pensions Board, has been commissioned jointly by my Department and the pensions board and a report will be available in the first half of next year.  The last major survey was carried out in 1985 and the results of this new survey will give essential up to date information on occupational cover, which will be of considerable assistance when proposals in relation to pensions are being formulated.</P>
    <P>I have also stated frequently that demands to abolish or significantly reduce income to the social insurance fund are short-sighted given the demands which are currently being placed on it and which will grow in the years ahead.  We must preserve the principle of solidarity embodied in the PRSI system if we are to guarantee pensions needed in the future due to the ageing of the population.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that there is no danger to anyone's current pension entitlement.  However, as I pointed out earlier this is an issue which we cannot afford to ignore.  Provided we face up, over the next few years, to the needs which we know will arise because of the <Col N="178" /> demographic changes, we can plan to deal with them in an orderly and effective way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became Minister for Social Welfare, I have given particular priority to the need to ensure that the social welfare system encourages people to create employment and to take up jobs.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy of the many changes aimed at improving incentives in the social welfare system which were announced in this year's budget.  First, there were three measures in relation to people with children, as these families can face particular disincentives to work.  Instead of just selectively increasing child dependant allowances for unemployed families, we are increasing child benefit, which is paid to all families with children; so an employed person with children gains as much as an unemployed person.  This builds on the progress made last year, when we gave a very substantial increase in child benefit. We are also increasing payments under the family income supplement scheme, which is paid to low-paid employees with children.  In addition, in order to improve the transition to work for unemployed people with children, I am bringing in new arrangements whereby a person who takes up employment will continue to receive child dependant allowances for up to 13 weeks in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget also included a substantial concession in relation to PRSI contributions paid by employers, employees and the self-employed.  In particular, the employee PRSI allowance was increased by 60 per cent, from £50 to £80.  This will improve the net-pay position of employees, and low-paid <Col N="179" /> employees in particular.  In addition, employer's PRSI rates were reduced, thereby reducing the cost to employers of creating new jobs.</P>
    <P>Other work-friendly measures announced in the budget were an increase in the number of places available on the back to work allowance scheme, 10,000 to 15,000, and improvements in the means test for unemployed people who take up casual or part-time work opportunities.</P>
    <P>The social welfare measures were part of a very comprehensive budget package by Government to tackle the problems of unemployment.  This included tax reductions, targeted job subsidies and improved arrangements for training and work experience for the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I will continue to develop the social welfare system with the aim of removing any anomalies that prevent people from taking up work.  In this regard, I understand that the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems is nearing completion of its work, and I look forward to receiving its report in the next couple of months.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Currently, about 470,000 people qualify for free travel at an estimated annual cost this year of some £32.7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> The scheme has been improved and extended in recent years as follows: in 1990, the free travel companion pass was introduced for recipients of disabled person's maintanance allowance (DPMA) who could not travel alone, primarily, the mentally handicapped and blind.</P>
    <P>The 1991 budget provided that persons who had been in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance but had forfeited the allowance by going into health board residential care could retain their free travel passes.  In 1992, the companion pass was extended to blind pensioners and in 1993, the companion pass was made available to invalidity pensioners who are wheelchair bound.  The issue of free passes to survivors of passholders who are 60-65 years of age was provided for in 1994. In 1995, the companion pass was extended to include existing free travel passholders who are being cared for by a recipient of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Also in 1995, the free travel scheme was extended to include passholders wishing to travel to Northern Ireland.  In last month's budget, I announced that, with effect from July next, the companion pass will be provided to visually impaired children.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme, in common with the other free schemes operated by my Department, is kept under constant review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements.  Any such proposals fall for consideration in the context of the budget and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that my <Col N="181" /> Department deals with claims for unemployment assistance properly and in accordance with the legislation.  The value of free board and lodging enjoyed by an applicant is one of the items which falls to be taken into account in the assessment of means.  The assessment in an individual case is determined by reference to the parental income, that is after deductions for tax, PRSI, union subscriptions, rent or mortgage payments and a parental allowance.  This income is allocated equally among the non-earning members of the household and constitutes the assessment applied to any son or daughter who claims unemployment assistance.  The maximum assessment that can be applied to any applicant is limited to 17 per cent of net parental income.  In the absence of such a limit, many applicants from families on average incomes with a low number of non-earners would not be entitled to any payment.</P>
      <P>It is important, in the context of a scheme like unemployment assistance as applied to young people, to strike a balance between using limited resources in the most effective way to address need and the need to provide a reasonable degree of financial independence to young unemployed people living at home.  In 1995 I increased the minimum weekly payment of unemployment assistance from £10 to £25 for people who are assessed with the benefit of board and lodgings.  I will be examining the possibility of further improvements in this area having regard to budgetary constraints.</P>

      <P>However, by far the largest proportion of such letters contain allegations against individuals and groups receiving moneys from my Department.

    <P>Inspectors may use the information in the letter as a pointer to the inquiries they will make.  If there is no substance in the allegation no further action is taken.

For the Industrial and Provident Societies, he has the function of the statutory registration of societies and of their rules once he is satisfied they are in conformity with the legislation.  My functions in this area relate to general policy and legislation.  I have no role in relation to day-to-day matters such as appear to be at issue in this case.</P>
      <P>I understand from the registrar that he registered a partial transfer of engagements to Radio County Sound Limited in February 1991.  This would have required the passing by the members of the I &amp; P Society of a &ldquo;special resolution&rdquo; in accordance with the terms of the legislation.  Sections 51, 53 and 56 of the 1893 Act would appear to be germane in this respect.  The provisions for the convening of general meetings of the society and any disputes arising are set out in the society's rules first registered by the registrar in April 1986 with amendments subsequently registered in December 1990 and April 1991.  The rules bind all members. Members disputing their society's actions have remedies available in the rules of the society and in the I &amp; P Society Acts 1893 to 1978.  I am informed that no members have in fact approached the registrar with any complaints. It appears that the society's rules provide for any arbitration proceedings to be carried out by the committee of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society Limited and not by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>

    <P>The Attorney General has not advised the Government in relation to its approach to the claim against the State by the Goodman Group, as suggested. All advices given in relation to <Col N="187" /> the Goodman Group's costs and expenses have been given &mdash; without reference to the Attorney General &mdash; by a member of his office, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and by counsel.  The Attorney General has from the beginning put in place procedures to deal with conflict of interest cases such as this.</P>
    <P>The costs now sought by Goodman/Goodman International do include the costs incurred by them in respect of discharging fees to counsel &mdash; including the present Attorney General &mdash; but as far as the Attorney General is concerned his fees have been paid and the only persons who have an interest in the matter are his clients.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent newspaper reports on the widespread abuse of angel dust in cattle production with the consequent risk to consumers; and the measures, if any, he proposes to take to eliminate this practise.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4113/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of media reports since the weekend some of which, without regard for the facts, made allegations that there has been an increase in the use of clenbuterol, also called angel dust, in Irish beef or more extremely that Irish beef is &ldquo;laced with angel dust&rdquo;.  The poistion is far different from what these uninformed reports would lead people to believe.</P>
      <P>Ireland, under EU rules, carries out an intensive random sampling programme for illegal substances, including clenbuterol.  In addition, officers of my Department carry out investigations at points of distribution, at meat factories and on the farms of suspected abusers. The level of surveillance in Ireland far exceeds the targets set by the EU.  The methods in place have resulted in the Irish beef industry being subjected to a level of surveillance unmatched in Europe with a view to protecting public health and increasing consumer confidence in Irish beef.  As a result of investigations into the use of clenbuterol, crininal proceedings have been instituted against 78 persons, files in respect of nine others have been forwarded to the office of the Chief State Solicitor with a view to instituting legal proceedings and a further three cases are being investigated by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to what was said in one newspaper report, neither I nor my <Col N="189" /> Department are reluctant to talk about this issue.  Rather, I wish to highlight the progress that is being made in tackling the use of angel dust.  The systems I have outlined are in place to protect the public.  Irish beef is a high quality product and the small minority who are involved in the use of clenbuterol are being, and will be, pursued with the full rigours of the law.  I would urge farmers and members of the wider community to provide to my Department or the Garda any information they may have on distributors and users of angel dust. All information received will be treated in strictest confidence.</P>
    <P>Following is a copy of a press release issued today announcing the introduction of additional measures aimed at eradicating the illegal use of growth promoting substances.</P>
    <P>New Measures Introduced on Illegal Growth Promoting Substances.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Mr Ivan Yates TD, referring to recent statements alleging widespread use of illegal growth promoters, assured consumers that these allegations were unsubstantiated by factual evidence.  While the results of his Department's comprehensive surveillance and monitoring programmes confirmed that there were abuses, this activity was limited to an unrepresentative minority of farmers.  &ldquo;The number of animals testing positive for illegal substances has declined in recent years&rdquo; the Minister stated.  Last year, 637 animals/carcases were confirmed as positive to illegal substances out of a total of 84,500 animals which were sampled.  This is a reduction of 50 per cent on 1994.</P>
    <P>Minister Yates said he wanted to leave consumers in no doubt about his efforts to stamp out the scourge of illegal drugs.  He was, therefore, announcing the introduction of the following additional stringent measures aimed at eradicating the illegal use of growth promoting substances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> New Legislation</P>
    <P>Legislation will be introduced to enable the results of sampling carried out in individual meat factories to be published.  The aim of this measure is to make the operators of meat factories subject to public scrutiny in relation to the controls they exercise regarding the purchase and slaughter of animals after 1 March, 1996.  It is intended that this development will encourage a greater level of self-regulation in the meat industry.</P>
    <P>Confidential Hotline</P>
    <P>A confidential hotline service is being introduced to cover growth promoters. People who are in any way suspicious or have information relating to such criminal activities may telephone 1-850-245900 where their reports will be treated with total confidence.  A poster campaign, aimed at District Veterinary Offices, Garda Stations, marts and meat factories is under preparation to highlight this initiative.</P>
    <P>Extra Laboratory Facilities</P>
    <P>The facilities for laboratory analysis are being expanded with additional testing being carried out by Teagasc and other private laboratories.  All authorised officers, in particular the Department's Special Unit, will continue to focus their activities on the identification and institution of criminal proceedings against suppliers and users of illegal substances.  The monitoring and surveillance on persons suspected of using illegal substances will be intensified.</P>
    <P>Traceability of Animals</P>
    <P>The Minister said that because of the strict measures he was imposing certain individuals may be tempted to use fictitious names.  There will, therefore, be a review of the measures relating to the traceability of animals.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that he has written to the Consumers Association asking them to substantiate the recent comments made by the Chairman of their strategy group regarding the level <Col N="191" /> of abuse of clenbuterol and added that any new evidence or leads received from the Consumers Association would be expeditiously acted upon.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland has the strictest legislation and the most extensive screening system of any country in Europe.  Irish beef is an excellent product and compares with the best in the world.  The new measures announced today on top of an already strict regime of testing and penalties were to reassure consumers as to the quality of Irish beef,&rdquo; the Minister concluded.</P>
    <P>22 February 1996.</P>
    <P>Note for the Editor</P>
    <P>The Animal Remedies Act, 1993, provides wide ranging powers for authorised officers to enter, inspect, detain, sample and seize evidence where contravention of the Act or Regulations made thereunder is suspected.  In addition to the severe financial and custodial penalties provided under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993 (the maximum penalty under the Act is a fine of £250,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment), a Court may order the destruction of illegally treated animals and prohibit a person from being involved in the production of animals or dealing in pharmaceutical products for a specified period which may extend to the life of the person convicted.</P>
