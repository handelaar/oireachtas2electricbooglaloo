      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise three matters with the Tánaiste.  Can he update the House on the discussions he engaged in on behalf of the House yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the revelations of the past week, the resultant concern of the public and of all Members of this House in regard to electoral funding issues and the relevant legislation, I suggest that party leaders with the Whips and chairmen of the parties meet within the next week or so before the Christmas recess in an endeavour to resolve the issues raised.  This would enable us to bring forward the Electoral Bill early in the next session, providing some type of <Col N="958" /> independent control or audit, thus ensuring appropriate balance.</P>
    <P>Having spoken to most of my colleagues and many others in the House, other matters arise such as the review of Members' pay and conditions, with pressures being exerted on Members from all sides of the House.  I certainly do not want the public to be given the impression that Members of this House are affluent because most of my colleagues on either side of the House are not.  That is another issue that should be given serious consideration within the political domain.</P>
    <P>I did not raise the third issue yesterday morning because I had not then checked the unrevised Official Report.  On having checked the rulings of the Chair, I contend a word used by the Tánaiste in the course of his contribution on the debate on the nomination of a member of the Government was not in compliance with the relevant order.  Therefore, I would ask him kindly to withdraw that remark about me and my colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with those three issues.  In response to the last request by the Leader of the Opposition, I withdraw that remark and I do that quite willingly.</P>
      <P>I will agree to discussions taking place between the party leaders and Whips on the Electoral Bill, work on which is at a very advanced stage and should be concluded within a matter of days as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>On the other issue we discussed yesterday, as I informed the Leader of the Opposition, after the Order of Business I established contact with a member of the Dunne family and conveyed the views expressed by party leaders yesterday morning.  I outlined the desirability of publishing the Price Waterhouse report in so far as there is a legitimate public interest in it.  I received assurances that the company wished to cooperate with the House in every way, subject of course to the legal advice they received.  I asked that they contact the Taoiseach's office yesterday afternoon and that was done.  The Taoiseach arranged for a meeting to take place in Government Buildings between a representative of the Government and a representative of Dunnes Stores.  That meeting took place and, from the reports I received from the Taoiseach, I understand it was a satisfactory one and a followup meeting will take place today.</P>
      <P>There are enormous legal complexities, which we will address as a matter of urgency, to secure publication of the report.  I am conscious that the Dáil will rise today until Tuesday next but I will undertake to keep party leaders informed of developments over the next few days because this could be unfolding very quickly.  Of course, like all party leaders, I will continue my own investigations in this matter.</P>

      <P>We in this House have the power to ensure that the contents of that report are disclosed, and we cannot be beholden to <Col N="959" /> anybody, no matter how powerful any family may be.  We have the power to ensure that these facts are made known.  We have a duty to serve the public, the public interest must come first and newspaper reports that party leaders might see its contents are not sufficient.  We cannot have a sanitised version of that report made known or party leaders only seeing its contents.  We require full disclosure.  People who have nothing to fear have nothing to hide.</P>
      <P>If we cannot obtain publication through the family over the next day or so then we should establish a judicial inquiry or one under the Companies Act.  We cannot delay this matter which has now continued for almost a week.  The public and most Members of this House are becoming frustrated about what is not happening.</P>
      <P>May I have the Tánaiste's assurance that if we do not get publication of this report from the family the Government will either establish a tribunal of inquiry, table a motion in the House or use its powers under the Companies Act to ensure full disclosure of this matter.</P>

      <P>I resent the implication that someone is beholden to someone else.  No member of the Government and, I hope, no Member of the House is beholden to anybody.  I gave undertakings in the House yesterday morning and I have responded to the Leader of the main Opposition party again this morning.  I also made it clear yesterday morning that, if necessary, we will take other remedies and follow other courses of action.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making every effort to have this matter sorted out as quickly and expeditiously as possible.  Regardless of whether the Leader of the Progressive Democrats likes it, there are legal constraints in regard to such matters.  I presume the Deputy, who was a Minister of State, is aware of the legal constraints and of the rights of individuals under natural justice and law which must be respected.  I will leave no stone unturned in trying to get to the root of the matter but rights have to be respected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Report of the Minister for Defence pursuant to Section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, I wish to report to the House on Irish military participation in United Nations missions in 1995.  The compilation of this report has afforded me a very welcome opportunity to outline to the House the contribution made by our troops in the various UN missions around the world, a contribution of which we are all immensely proud.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer first to the United Nations interim force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, which is our largest single overseas commitment and which has been much to the fore following events earlier this year in South Lebanon.  Thankfully, none of the Irish troops sustained injury during what must have been one of the most perilous times in South Lebanon since they took up duty there.  In 1995 the strength of the contingent was 631, consisting of a battalion of 542 and 89 personnel at UNIFIL headquarters.  As part of an overall reduction in the strength of UNIFIL, in which eight other countries participate, the strength of the Irish contingent was reduced by 33 in October 1995. The position of Deputy Force Commander was held by Brigadier-General Pierce Redmond, who returned home in April 1996.</P>
      <P>The Irish battalion is deployed in South Lebanon in its new headquarters located near Tibnin.  The new battalion headquarters was occupied by the 77th Battalion in April 1995.  The concept of the new camp is very good with fixed brick buildings as opposed to the prefabs used at old headquarters.  In 1995 the battalion continued to carry out its mission by operating observation posts and checkpoints, conducting extensive patrolling and maintaining a village presence and providing humanitarian assistance to a variety of worthy causes such as the orphanage in Tibnin and some village medical clinics. It also carried out a number of controlled demolition explosions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nineteen ninety-five was generally quieter than 1994 in UNIFIL although from October onwards there was an upsurge in activity by armed elements and a resultant increase in retaliatory <Col N="962" /> fire by the Israelis and the Israeli backed <i>de facto</i> forces.  A very serious incident took place on 10 June 1995 when <i>de facto</i> forces retaliatory fire for armed elements attacks on their compounds included a mortar round which impacted within an IRISHBATT post at Haddathah.  The personnel manning the checkpoint were under cover at the time of the impact and there were no casualties.  However, windows in the post were blown out and shrapnel caused damage to sentry posts and buildings.  Again in November 1995 there were 50 firings close to IRISHBATT posts by the Israelis and their militia.  This included two rounds of 155mm artillery smoke which impacted within the new headquarters position near Tibnin.  There were no casualties in this incident, which was the subject of a strong diplomatic protest to the Israeli authorities.</P>
    <P>Ireland provides 30 military personnel to the United Nations Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP.  Three officers and five NCOs fill staff appointments at force headquarters and a camp command component, consisting of three officers and 19 NCOs, has been serving with the mission since 16 February 1994.  UNFICYP's mandate is &ldquo;to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting and, as necessary, to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions&rdquo;.  The principal task of UNFICYP is the maintenance of a buffer zone between the lines of the Cypriot National Guard and the Turkish-Cypriot forces.  The force is also involved in humanitarian activities.  There are 15 members of the Garda Síochána attached to that mission.</P>
    <P>Two lieutenant colonels fill the appointments of personnel officer and supply officer in the field operations division of UNHQ, New York.  Our commitment of 19 officers to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East &mdash; UNTSO &mdash; was reduced to 14 in October 1995, in line with a strength reduction programme being implemented by the UN.  We have participated in this mission since 1958 and our commitment to it is set to reduce further, to a strength of 12 this year.  Our UNTSO observers are currently based in Israel, Syria and Lebanon. UNTSO's main tasks today are concerned with the conflict between Israel and Lebanon and Israel and Syria, working closely with UNIFIL and UNDOF &mdash; the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force.  It also maintains a presence in Egypt and Jordan, although those fronts are now quiet.</P>
    <P>Since February 1992 an Irish colonel has been serving with OSGAP &mdash; the Office of the Secretary General in Afghanistan and Pakistan as senior military adviser to the secretary general's special representative.  This mission is concerned with confirming violations of the Geneva accords on the settlement of the situation relating to Afghanistan and facilitating a comprehensive political settlement.</P>
    <P>Irish participation in UNIKOM, the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, <Col N="963" /> continued in 1995 by providing six officers, all of whom are based in Kuwait and hold both staff and observer appointments.  The mandate of UNIKOM involves monitoring the demilitarised zone established on the Iraq-Kuwait border following the Gulf War.  Irish involvement with the United Nations mission in Haiti continued throughout 1995 by providing two officers who served as staff officers at the headquarters.  Our involvement with this mission terminated in March of this year.</P>
    <P>We also continued to provide nine officers to MINURSO &mdash; the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.  In 1995, the officers continued their tasks at the force headquarters in Laayoune and at sector and team sites throughout the mission area.  Progress towards holding the referendum for which this mission was established has been very slow due to disagreement between the interested parties on the composition of the electoral register.  The date for the referendum, originally planned for January 1992, is not yet known.</P>
    <P>In 1995 nine Irish military personnel served with UNPROFOR &mdash; the United Nations protection force in the former Yugoslavia performing staff officer and observer duties.  The force was retitled the United Nations Peace Forces &mdash; UNPF &mdash; and was closed down in January of this year.</P>
    <P>A number of missions were created in UNPROFOR's stead &mdash; UNPREDEP, UN Preventative Deployment to prevent the Balkan conflict from spreading and possibly involving Greece and Turkey; Ireland supplies one officer to this mission.  Ireland supplies three officers to UNTAES, the UN Transition Administration Eastern Slavonia.  This force will oversee the return to Croatia of the last part of its territory held by rebel Serbs.  Ireland supplies one officer to UNMOP, UN Military Observers Prevlaka. Under the terms of the Dayton Agreement this mission monitors the demilitarisation of the Prevlaka Peninsula and ensures freedom of movement into and out of Kotor Bay.</P>
    <P>Irish involvement with the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia ICFY &mdash; finished in April of this year.  Since October 1994 we have deployed two officers for service with this mission which was co-chaired by the UN and EU, and monitored the delivery of humanitarian aid across designated border crossing points between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
    <P>The amount currently owed by the UN is £12.8 million approximately.  Arrears of approximately £4.5 million were paid in 1995.  The annual extra costs, net of reimbursements, of our current UN commitments, is about £3.6 million.  On average in 1995 there were approximately 700 personnel involved in the various missions throughout the year.  Normal pay and allowances amounted to approximately £14 million.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the considerable undertaking <Col N="964" /> which it represents both in financial and personnel terms, the Government remains committed, with due regard to the safety of our troops, to the principle of military participation in UN operations in the cause of international peace and we can reflect, with justifiable pride, on Irish military personnel who have been actively and continuously involved in UN missions for nearly 40 years, often in very senior positions.  As the House will be aware, yesterday the Dáil approved a motion for participation by the Irish Defence Forces in the temporary UN multinational force established for humanitarian purposes in regard to the situation in Eastern Zaire.  Planning for the dispatch of personnel of the Defence Forces for this purpose is under way in my Department at present.</P>
    <P>I am confident our personnel will continue to serve the United Nations with distinction, demonstrating, in practical ways, our support for the highest ideals of that organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House, against some odds, to outline the range of activities in which our Defence Forces are involved in peace-keeping activities in many different parts of the world.  Since we joined the United Nations and our first troops went to the Congo 36 years ago, we have been proud of the role played by a small nation and defence force in helping strife torn communities where there are ethnic conflicts, famine and many other problems.  Because of our non-colonial history we have been welcomed in most parts of the world and we hope that will always be the position.</P>
      <P>Involvement in the United Nations and the involvement of our troops overseas is crucial to the development of the Defence Forces.  Not only does it keep up morale, but it is also an important part of training and ensures that those who enter the forces will be capable of representing us overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion gives us an opportunity to reflect on how the changes taking place in the world will place increased demands on the Minister for Defence to continue to improve the range of activities in which we can engage abroad.  In this regard, we must question the facilities available to our forces, whether two armoured cars are sufficient to ensure the safety of our troops and, equally important, whether we are able to participate in a meaningful way where the United Nations may call on us to serve.  As cost is a major consideration in this regard, perhaps the Minister should consider, for the first time, leasing equipment for the Defence Forces.  It is not necessary to incur very large expenditure.  The Minister should consider supporting the Defence Forces and providing more sophisticated equipment by way of leasing.  He might also consider introducing legislation to facilitate the signing and ratification by the Government of the convention on the safety of United Nations troops and associated personnel.  He is aware <Col N="965" /> concern has been expressed by Defence Forces personnel on this matter because a number of other countries and some of our partners in Europe have ratified that convention.  There should not be any great difficulty in that regard. This side of the House would support the early introduction of legislation to facilitate its ratification.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of disappointment to the House that there continue to be arrears in funding from the United Nations for which no blame attaches to the Minister.  I am sure he has made his case as strongly as possible and it should be made to some of the larger nations whose resistance to meeting their financial commitments to the United Nations is deplorable.  Those nations, which can afford to contribute much more than this country, have been very deficient in ensuring the capacity of the United Nations is enhanced by making available necessary funds to deal with many of the situations.  We can only ask the Minister once again to do whatever is possible because we have limited resources.  The present position is not fair to small countries anxious to get involved.  As agreed yesterday, we are sending a small contingent to eastern Zaire and other problems will arise in the future.  It is important that the necessary funds are made available to the United Nations to enable it to discharge its obligations and, if possible, to refund the participating nations more quickly.</P>
    <P>Regarding our continuing capacity to meet our obligations in this area, there are reports that Army personnel are overstretched in carrying out their duties here, particularly Border duties. When reviewing the Defence Forces it is important to ensure the necessary numbers are available to enable us to respond quickly to our international obligations.  The necessary personnel, highly trained and motivated, should be available in the force to do this work.  Because of voluntary early retirement and the lack of consistent recruitment over many years, Defence Forces personnel are extremely overstretched.  In the context of this brief debate this morning, it is important to record that we should never again allow the situation to develop whereby we do not have a consistent recruitment campaign to deal with wastage in the Defence Forces.  All the bottlenecks and other problems are emerging now.  Those that existed with regard to the hump, as it is called, developed because we have not had a consistent recruitment programme.  I know the Minister is contemplating certain changes in the five-year contract which we urge him to complete as soon as possible.  We must ensure mistakes made in the past are not repeated.  If we do that, it will place us in a much stronger position to have troops available in increasing numbers to serve with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>A reading of the Minister's statement highlights the geography, range, variety and diversity of work our troops are called upon to do.  It is an indication of what must be done in terms of training, recruitment and providing <Col N="966" /> facilities, equipment and so on to ensure we deliver on our mandate.  This side of the House supports all these activities and we look forward to ensuring we can always be in a position to respond to these great needs wherever they arise in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on the Opposition benches are somewhat at a disadvantage in this brief debate.  We are here to discuss a report on the United Nations peacekeeping activities of the Irish Defence Forces during 1995, but we have not had advance copies of that report.  We have only been able to formulate our views as the Minister made his speech.  He gave a brief description of the various trouble spots around the world where our Defence Forces members are serving.  This is not a satisfactory way to go about discussing defence policy in Parliament.</P>
      <P>All in this House will agree our country is proud of the record of service of United Nations peacekeeping missions in which Irish Defence Forces personnel have participated.  Starting with the Congo nearly 40 years ago Irish troops have served with great distinction around the world. As the Minister reported to the House, in 1995 our troops were serving with 13 United Nations missions in international trouble spots.  Wherever they have served, our troops have acquitted themselves well, have earned a high reputation and, in general, have won a wide level of acceptance from the local population.  The people are rightly proud of the record of our peacekeepers overseas and politicians are happy to bask in the reflected glory arising from the outstanding level of service our Defence Forces personnel have given in all the missions they have undertaken under the flag of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Our Defence Forces are now about to embark on one of their most difficult and challenging peacekeeping assignments in several years.  They are about to participate in the temporary multinational force set up to deal with the situation in eastern Zaire on which a motion was agreed yesterday.  That mission will take Irish troops into unfamiliar, dangerous and inhospitable territory.  All in this House wish them well in their difficult and demanding task. If we are to continue to contribute to the United Nations international peacekeeping effort, it is important we maintain a Permanent Defence Force that is well motivated, adequately equipped and properly provided for.  Above all, morale should be high at all times.  The Permanent Defence Force should be capable of undertaking any assignment the Government gives it, but unfortunately all the indications are that its morale is at rock bottom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces are grossly under strength, the hours worked in duties at home are excessive and pay and conditions are poor.  This is highlighted for many soldiers when they are on Border duty and cash escort duty with the Garda. There is a lack of political leadership of the Defence Forces.  We do not have a defence policy <Col N="967" /> in any meaningful sense like the coherent, well-thought and well managed defence policies that other small European countries such as Denmark, Norway and Switzerland have.  Morale in the Defence Forces is as low as it is because of the lack of political commitment.  Low morale contributes to a situation where hundreds of officers, among them the brightest and the best, have opted for early retirement instead of a military career.  That lack of political commitment is evident everywhere in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>We must rationalise and streamline our whole defence infrastructure to make the force more effective and efficient.  Of necessity, that will involve barrack closures.  The Minister has shown no willingness to grasp this nettle.  Important decisions are postponed until after the next election and the election after that.  This restructuring is essential if our Defence Forces are to cope with the challenges of the 21st century and if they are to be properly equipped to undertake the series of missions this House is allocating them.</P>
    <P>Instead, our forces will enter the next millennium in a condition that is far from ideal. The conditions in the Army Apprentice School in Naas, County Kildare, are substandard.  It is not satisfactory that such conditions should continue to be tolerated in the Defence Forces.  The Air Corps are using helicopters up to 33 years old and the manufacturers are surprised when they learn those helicopters are still airworthy and in use. The Naval Service has vessels tied up in ports because there are not enough personnel to keep those vessels on patrol in our territorial and fishery waters, one of our most valuable natural assets.  It is being raped regularly by foreign fishing vessels and international drug traffickers use the Irish coast as a safe haven for their activities despite the best efforts of the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Let us send our troops on their mission to Zaire but let us also have a properly thought out defence policy.  The world around us is changing rapidly.  Surely it is time to have a real debate on defence policy and that the Government brought forward a White Paper, or at least a Green Paper, on this subject.  We cannot continue indefinitely to ignore the area of national defence in making public policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the report of the Minister regarding our Defence Forces serving with the UN is a good idea.  As speakers said, we take this for granted.  The wonderful work of the Defence Forces abroad is only brought to our attention when things go wrong.  They are trying to bring peace to different parts of the world. Participation on UN duty has always been seen as a great opportunity by members of the Defence Forces.  They are limited in what they can do at home and most see it as an opportunity to put their training into action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, Governments have been mature <Col N="968" /> and treated requests for international duty seriously.  That is how it should be.  The safety of the Defence Forces should always be of the utmost importance.  It is worrying that this year there was a difficulty in putting together a sufficient number to serve overseas.  I attended the RACO and PDFORRA conferences and this matter received much debate.  It was suggested that boredom was one of the reasons there was a difficulty in getting sufficient volunteers for service abroad and that may be true.  Some Defence Forces personnel have served abroad eight to ten times, particularly in the Lebanon. There would be a certain familiarity and repetition then for them, especially in the training given before going overseas which they would regard as unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces chiefs have decided to make changes to make this more attractive. Financially, overseas service does not have the attraction it used to have and we must examine this.  The Minister mentioned the financial implications of our participation in the UN.  He said that at present the UN owes us almost £13 million and that arrears of £4.5 million were paid last year.  This has not just arisen under this Government or the previous one.  It has gone on for some time and we have raised our concerns about it before.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Andrews was Minister for Defence, he assured the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on Committee Stage that a serious effort was being made to redress this UN funding.  He felt the problem could be solved within a matter of a few years.  We have not made much progress on this and the Minister should use his good offices to rectify the situation.  It is not good enough.  We have made a contribution far above what would be expected of us because of our size.  That should not be taken for granted and the financial aspect should be addressed quickly.</P>
    <P>To return to the problem of getting personnel for overseas service, the opportunities in new missions for our Defence Forces should be seriously considered by the Minister.  We are going to send personnel to eastern Zaire.  I wish them well and hope our efforts there will be rewarded.  As said by other speakers, our Defence Forces have a tremendous record in overseas service.  They have always been seen as independent and neutral in areas of major conflict.  This has had a beneficial effect.  They have been tremendous ambassadors for us.  This was recognised by President Clinton when he addressed the House.</P>
    <P>The lack of equipment restricts the capacity of the Defence Forces to serve overseas.  While I accept a Minister for Defence will always find it difficult to obtain the necessary finances to provide better equipment and improve infrastructure, if we are serious about restructuring the Defence Forces, this nettle will have to be grasped.  Now is the time to grasp it.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces operate from a number of <Col N="969" /> valuable properties.  As housekeeping duties are taking up far too much time, a major decision will have to be made to redress this.  The voluntary early retirement package will result in savings in the not too distant future.  The Minister should insist that these savings are reinvested to provide essential new equipment and improve infrastructure.  This would have a much greater effect on morale in the Defence Forces than any other decision the Minister could make.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Michael Smith, highlighted the lack of continuity in recruitment. We should acknowledge the folly of our ways in the past and not allow this to happen.  While I accept there are ever increasing demands for funds in all Departments, lack of continuity in recruitment has a detrimental effect on morale in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the spouses and families of Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.  An organisation has been established in the Curragh to help them keep in touch with one another, as this can be a lonely time.  This is often forgotten until something goes wrong.  In preparing the Estimates, if they have not already been agreed, the Minister may find it possible to allocate a small sum to allow this organisation continue its good work.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to present the report.  I wish to be associated with the remarks made about the men and women in the Defence Forces who have given of their time and effort in the interest of keeping the peace throughout the world.  They have done us proud. Long may this continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>On my own behalf and that of the Minister, Deputy Barrett, I thank Deputies Michael Smith, Molloy and Power for participating in the debate.  It has been acknowledged that in recent months we have had the most dramatic review of the Defence Forces ever undertaken.  There has been an in-depth analysis, constant consultation with the two representative organisations representing officers and rank and file members, and numerous discussions with other interested groups.  Having listened to the views of all sides, a plan has been put in place to ensure we will have a well motivated, vibrant and highly skilled army which will continue to do us proud at national and international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Power alluded to the boredom factor. We have decided to enlist over a three year period 1,000 new recruits to inject new blood into the Defence Forces.  We are seeking to ensure we will have a well trained and equipped and highly motivated force.  We acknowledge there are deficiencies but there is an ongoing programme of barracks refurbishment to improve office accommodation and training facilities.  On the question of resources, we are seeking to ensure the balance is tipped in the direction of equipment rather than pay.  As Deputies are <Col N="970" /> aware, the current ratio is 80:20 in favour of pay. We aim to achieve a ratio of 70:30 in providing modern communications equipment to meet the demands of the modern soldier.</P>
    <P>Last year we had the pleasure of signing a multi-million dollar contract with an American company to ensure Defence Forces personnel serving with United Nations peacekeeping or observation forces have the best communications equipment available to them in carrying out their duties.  We are seeking to ensure Defence Forces personnel do the jobs for which they have been trained, in other words, that they are involved in active soldiering duties.</P>
    <P>The question of arrears continues to exercise our minds.  The Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs are constantly pressing the United Nations to discharge the arrears due in recognition of the fact that the Defence Forces are entitled to be paid for the good work they are doing.  This has to be viewed, however, in context of the reality of the financial situation which continues to afflict the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power raised the issue of morale.  In September I visited the Middle East and saw at first hand the tremendous work being done by Irish troops in the cause of peace.  I visited Irish troops serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus.  The force commander in Cyprus, Brigadier General Vartiainen, specially mentioned Ireland's contribution during the years to UNFICYP.  The Chief of Staff of UNFICYP, Colonel Talbot, also commended the Irish involvement.</P>
    <P>I also visited the Irish contingent serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Irish contingents have served with UNIFIL since 1978 and while the mandate has not yet been fulfilled, a great deal has been achieved in the intervening years.  An important contribution has been made to the lives of thousands of Lebanese people who have been protected from the worst excesses of the conflict and allowed to lead a near normal lifestyle.</P>
    <P>One of the highlights of my visit to South Lebanon was the ceremony for the presentation of medals by the force commander to the Irish troops serving there.  The force commander, Major General Wozniak, was generous in his tributes to the work done by successive Irish battalions.  He stated that Irish troops had made an immeasurable contribution to the efforts made by the United Nations to fulfil the mandate laid down in the Security Council Resolutions.</P>
    <P>While in the Middle East I took the opportunity to travel to Damascus where I met the Irish military observers serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation. The issue of the Golan Heights, a place which I visited while in Syria, is one which is crucial to the ultimate success of the Middle East peace process.  I also met Major General Mustafa Tlass, the Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.  General Tlass expressed his country's appreciation of Ireland's contribution, <Col N="971" /> through its involvement in the UNTSO mission, to the whole peace process.</P>
    <P>The Government regards the United Nations as the principal forum for the peaceful resolution of international conflict.  As a small neutral country, Ireland has a particular interest in the effective operation of the UN in accordance with its charter.  Our security depends on the establishment of international order rather than on force of arms.  Our commitment to the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations is a practical expression of our dedication to the maintenance of world peace and security.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long tradition of supporting United Nations peacekeeping missions.  We have contributed actively and continuously to such operations since 1958 when a group of officers took up duty in Lebanon with a United Nations observer group.  Since then about 44,000 Irish personnel have participated in UN missions.  This has been a considerable commitment for a nation of this size and has been made possible by the willingness of members of the Defence Forces to volunteer for UN service.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government approved the participation of the Defence Forces in the United Nations stand-by arrangements system.  The concept of stand-by forces for UN peacekeeping missions has been in the course of development since 1990.  This system is intended to enhance the United Nations' capacity for rapid response to emergency situations.  Member states will specify resources which could be made available within agreed response times for UN peacekeeping operations mandated by the Security Council. These resources may be military individuals or units, civilian police, civilian personnel, equipment or services.  Our commitment in terms of military personnel will be up to 850 people. This is indicative of the Government's strong commitment to peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>A total of 688 military personnel are currently serving with ten United Nations missions in a total of 13 countries as follows: Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Cyprus, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Western Sahara, Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Macedonia, Serbia and in the USA at the United Nations headquarters in New York.  The number of Irish military personnel currently serving overseas with United Nations missions represents 5.5 per cent of our armed forces.  This equates to 191 personnel per million of population.</P>
    <P>Irish military personnel have also rendered service in United Nations missions in Iran, Namibia, Zaire-Congo, West Guinea, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Haiti, India, Angola, Cambodia, El Salvador, Iraq and Somalia.</P>
    <P>The preservation of peace is not achieved easily or without cost to members of the Defence Forces and we are all very much aware of the sacrifices that are often required in order that the defenceless may be protected and made safe.  We remember with deep gratitude the courage and <Col N="972" /> heroism of those members of the Defence Forces who have died, or suffered injury, so that communities torn by strife can have an opportunity to live in peace and security.</P>
    <P>The professional advantages of service with UN missions are substantial.  The benefits as regards training are particularly evident in the context of our UNIFIL contingent.  In Lebanon our battalion personnel from junior NCO rank upwards have the opportunity to exercise command in dangerous operational situations. Valuable experience is gained in patrolling and in defusing tension.  There is a lot to be learnt from holding staff appointments in force headquarters. Interaction with contingents of other countries and exposure to methods employed by them is also beneficial.  The wide experience gained from participation in UN peacekeeping operations is of benefit, not only to the Defence Forces in the discharge of their functions in aid of the civil power but also to various Departments and local authorities which, as occasion demands, have reason to avail of emergency services provided by the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I commend the professionalism and dedication of members of the Defence Forces who have a long and proud tradition in peacekeeping operations.  The skills of negotiation and diplomacy for which they are renowned are often more important than their professional military skills.  I take this opportunity to assure the House of this Government's continued commitment to involvement in United Nations peacekeeping operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the House had a brief opportunity to discuss the dispatch of a small contingent of Irish troops, including military personnel, police and engineers, and others who will assist the 2,000 strong unit led by a Canadian in eastern Zaire.  This century has experienced much change in terms of benefits to society. The developed world has seen advances in medical science, food nutrition, transport, communications and all areas of life.  The world's population has increased from 2 billion to 5.6 billion this century.  Most people in developed countries live at least ten years longer than was the case at the beginning of the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this development, we hear harrowing stories about parts of the world where ethnic conflict, murder, hunger, disease and death are an everyday occurrence.  It awakens the <Col N="973" /> consciousness of all of us to our international responsibilities.  Nobody can feel comfortable watching a television programme which shows the frail hands of young children being trampled on by the stronger as they reach for a daily donation of food.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity to act as a UN observer during the general election in Tanzania where I met aid workers and visited villages.  I saw the standard of housing, the lack of educational facilities, the almost non-existent road network and the impossibility of communicating with even near neighbours &mdash; it was just a glimpse of the problems in central Africa.  We need to be conscious of these problems, but we should also constantly ask ourselves what we can do to help solve them.  We are immensely proud of our aid workers in organisations such as Concern, Goal and others, many of whom have risked their lives and have appeared on television to expose atrocities and difficulties to the world.  We have seen refugee camps with hundreds of thousands of people living like animals with literally no food and facilities.  We have seen thousands walking on mud sodden roads heading nowhere but hoping against hope that at the end of their journey they will be rescued from the torment of war and strife.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has been extraordinarily slow in assembling troops and others to open up corridors for aid workers.  The blame does not lie solely with the United Nations.  The Government has not yet awakened to its powers in the context of the EU Presidency.  The Presidency of the European Union brings with it an extraordinarily onerous responsibility but it also provides a tremendous opportunity in leading 15 nations, heading Councils and activating, pushing and urging action in areas such as this.  It would not be worthwhile for any Minister to be President of a European Council which is paralysed in the face of the difficulties encountered in places such as eastern Zaire.  Politics would not be worthwhile if one insulated oneself from the risks of becoming involved.</P>
    <P>It is only a couple of months since the Government stated, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that there was no likelihood of the EU becoming involved.  Belatedly, that picture has changed and we now see at least a semblance of the urgency which should have been shown much sooner.  We welcome that, late as it might be.  We urge that, with the wealth we enjoy &mdash; it is said that we are the 22nd best off country in the world &mdash; every opportunity is taken to assist in this area.  The people, in their contributions to aid organisations for the Third World, have proven time and again that, <i>per capita</i>, no country in the world can beat us in subscribing to that great need.  It is a pity, therefore, that sometimes Governments lurk behind, accepting that is the best we can do.  We should lead in that regard.  Because of our non-colonial history, the fact that we are welcome in many parts of the world and that we have made <Col N="974" /> a great contribution since 1958 to the United Nations in peacekeeping operations, we have a much bigger role than our size dictates.</P>
    <P>We too experienced famine almost 150 years ago, and the stark message of that time is carried through poems, songs and folklore to the present generation.  We know what it is like for one million people to die and we know what it is like for one million people to emigrate.  We know that such a disturbance affects families, some of whom may never meet again.</P>
    <P>This debate is about concern and care.  It is not about taking action too late.  It is a pity, therefore, the opportunity was almost lost during the Presidency of the Council to take action in circumstances such as these.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> This is the third occasion in the past two days we have had an opportunity to consider aspects of the problems of this region of Africa.  Yesterday morning the Dáil approved a motion allowing for the participation by members of the Defence Force in the UN force which will, belatedly but thankfully, intervene in the current crisis in Rwanda and eastern Zaire.  Yesterday afternoon the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs considered a Supplementary Estimate to allow the Government to make an extra contribution to humanitarian emergency relief operations in that region.  This morning we resumed the debate which began last week on the wider aspects of the position in the Great Lakes region.</P>
      <P>While I agree with most of the comments of contributors on this issue in recent days, it is unnecessary and inaccurate for Members such as Deputy Smith and Deputy Burke, who spoke yesterday morning, to criticise the Government for lack of action in this area.  The Government has been extremely active in this region of Africa since the humanitarian crisis began in 1994.  It is a region with which we have no historic or missionary connections, yet the great response of the Irish people and NGOs has been reflected in the Government's response since 1994.</P>
      <P>From my knowledge of the work done by Ministers and officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, their efforts in this regard are not confined to the periods when CNN relays aspects of the emergency on television screens around the world.  There has been a sustained political effort over a period which supports initiatives such as that of President Nyerere of Tanzania and led to the appointment by the European Union of Mr. Ajello as special envoy to the region.  I compliment him on the work he has done in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From experience, we are aware that the painstaking, behind the scenes work which eventually leads to political agreement does not attract the public eye.  It is much easier to respond to pictures of dying children, starving mothers and deserted refugee camps than to the less attractive activities of diplomats, politicians and others.  I defend the record of the Department of <Col N="975" /> Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, particularly during our EU Presidency.  It is not correct to say that we have not used the Presidency to advance progress on this issue.  We have taken a lead to the extent that it has been open to us to do so.</P>
    <P>When this renewed crisis came to the world's attention the Irish Presidency took the initiative of convening in Brussels last month an emergency meeting of the EU Development Council, a second rank council in European terms, at which for the first time representatives and heads of all major UN and international agencies gathered to co-ordinate a response.  That was a major achievement.  The visit to the region by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and her colleagues in the European Union, including Commissioner Bonino, was very useful in informing Europe of what is happening.  It shamed the United Nations, which had dragged its heels for a long period, into taking action. Similarly, in the past two to three years the Irish Government has been extremely active in the international arena in trying to secure agreements to tackle the international trade in arms.  If there is anything which has been pointed to over the past three to four years as being one of the root causes of the problems in this part of Africa it is the almost unlimited access to arms all sides in the conflict have had, even when such trade was banned by the United Nations and many governments around the world.  The documents found in the Mugunga refugee camp showing trade by British companies is only one example. If that evidence can be found on the side of the road in a refugee camp, one can imagine the hidden evidence that must exist of this most vile trade.  The Irish Government has taken the lead in general in combating the international arms trade and in particular in the area of landmines control and I appreciate the efforts made by the Minister and the Minister of State in these areas. Accusations of inaction and ineffectiveness are incorrect.</P>
    <P>Ireland has the Presidency of the European Council and it is our job to oversee a common foreign and security policy, but anyone familiar with the terms of that policy will realise it is extremely weak.  The capacity of the European Union to act as a body in a singular fashion internationally is limited and member states have shown great reluctance to give up any freedom of action they currently have as sovereign states. They have shown a reluctance to pool that in any way to the extent that the European Union could be seen to have a position to which all members subscribe.  We have seen that in their attitude to this region of Africa and some Middle East countries where member states insist on implementing their own foreign policy in their own interests rather than agreeing that the Union should act independently.</P>
    <P>To the extent open to it the Government has <Col N="976" /> tried to ensure there is a common European Union response to this crisis and that the European Union makes its voice heard as one body internationally, but it cannot compel member states to go in a particular direction when it does not have the power to do so.  Many of our so-called partners in the European Union have a damning record in relation to their activities in this part of Africa.</P>
    <P>The carving out of the entities of Rwanda and Burundi was initially done by the Germans as part of their participation in the scramble for Africa in the last century.  When the Germans were defeated in the First World War the Belgians took over the area.  King Leopold had carved out the state of the Congo as his own personal fiefdom and the record of the Germans, the Belgians and latterly the French in this area is despicable.  It would make one ashamed to be called a partner of any of these countries, particularly when there is evidence that the French and the Belgians did not play a benign part in the history of Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire since those countries gained independence in the 1960s.</P>
    <P>The evidence of those who have investigated the position in this part of Africa is that the Belgians had a large part to play in the type of conflict that developed in the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s and again in the 1990s.  They agreed with the superimposition of Tutsi dominance over the Hutu majority which the Germans had used to install a colonial regime in the last century. They belatedly decided they had to switch sides before independence and assisted the Hutus in rising up against the Tutsis.  There is evidence that in the events leading up to the genocide in 1994 and the assassination of President Habyarimana, all part of a wider effort to undermine the Arusha accords, both Belgium and France played an active part in those destabilisation efforts.  The rapid intervention of the French in Rwanda during that period to give cover to the retreating Hutus is in stark contrast to the slowness of the international community to respond to this crisis.</P>
    <P>These matters present problems internationally, to us as a small member state of the European Union and to any Presidency trying to lead the European Union in a particular direction in the area of common foreign and security policy.  It is ironic to hear Members of this House who criticise efforts to strengthen the common foreign and security policy element of the European Union calling in the next breath for an EU military intervention in this part of Africa or anywhere else when the EU does not have such a capacity.  It does not have that capacity because member states have chosen not to have it.  Those who criticise cannot have their cake and eat it. They cannot say that we must have progress in this area of European Union affairs while criticising the EU and the Irish Presidency because we are not sending a European army to the area.  However, that is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> I am sure members of the public who have seen the various images from the region on their television screens in the past five or six weeks wonder if this is just another African disaster, one of many which seem to unfold before our eyes at regular intervals.  That is not the case.  Most of these disasters occur for political reasons and only a political response will ensure problems are dealt with and that they do not surface again.  We are familiar with the slowness of peace processes and the public should be told that such efforts take time.  This crisis was not created by an act of nature, nor did it arise because of any innate incapacity on the part of these peoples to handle their own affairs.  They are the result of a complex series of political manoeuvrings, many of which have their basis in 19th century colonialism and are supported by ex-colonial countries.</P>
    <P>The public appreciates that the problem we face now is not the same as the problem in 1994. People realise that while humanitarian aid is needed it is not enough.  The public have begun to understand that this genocide did not just happen; it was organised and carried out for political reasons to keep a certain political clique in power.  The international community's intervention has in part contributed to the ongoing conflict by setting up massive refugee camps in eastern Zaire in which the necessary work of caring for starving people and meeting their medical needs is carried out.  In doing that, however, we also set up a system whereby the perpetrators of the genocide in 1994 were allowed to continue their operations under cover.</P>

      <P>At the conclusion of my remarks yesterday evening I was critical of the Minister in relation to the pupil-teacher ratio which is an important aspect of this debate.  I made the point that the Minister had effectively frozen the pupil-teacher ratio numbers.  That is a retrograde step despite the Minister's talk about providing assistants to clusters of disadvantaged schools in rural areas as well as targeting schools in disadvantaged urban areas.  There is still an urgent need to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  As the INTO has pointed out, Ireland has the largest primary school class size in Europe.  I hope the Minister can also reduce the pupil-teacher ratio for remedial teachers.  If she did, especially in rural areas, teachers would not have to go on a panel from which it is difficult and sometimes impossible to get into the school in which they work in a temporary capacity.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education and Research Centre Project and they identify the need to help smaller schools in remote and isolated rural areas.  I hope this will get special attention.  It is sad that staffing of primary schools is based on the enrolment in the school on the previous September.  This will continue to be a major concern every year.</P>
      <P>As we are talking about remedial teaching, I refer to a submission made by Dyslexic Support Centre based in Limerick.  The document details some facilities in Cork as well as Dublin and states that, in every Deputy's constituency, one family in ten has a dyslexic child.  The survey carried out by the group and research it has from Europe and America suggest that 87 per cent of dyslexic children will fall in the average to above average ability range.  Many will have artistic, mathematical or scientific abilities but are not being catered for by the current remedial education system and, for that reason, cannot reach their full potential.  The problem, and remedial teachers will say this, is that there is no suitable programme in remedial teaching for dyslexic children.</P>
      <P>I hope when the Minister addresses this issue, she will examine the parts of the country where no support is provided by the support centres. For example, no services are provided for these children in the provinces of Connacht and Ulster. The services are currently in Limerick, Shannon, Ennis and Tralee and it is hoped to open a unit in Clonmel in January.  This is an important issue which has been neglected in the past.  The Minister talked about four special schools dedicated to the problem of dyslexia.  Three of these are in Dublin and one in Cork.  What happens to a dyslexic child from any other part of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> It is encouraging that remedial and resource teaching has been noticed by the Minister and the Government in recent years.  However, I fail to understand why the appointment of these teachers has come to a full stop.  It is time the Minister examined the available research, that remedial and resource teachers were provided and the issue of dyslexia or other problems in primary schools were addressed.</P>
    <P>It is important in an overcrowded school that a classroom is made available for a remedial teacher.  I know of one school in my constituency where the remedial teacher, who is shared by six schools, has the use of a small room measuring five feet by five feet.  It is disgraceful there is no proper accommodation for that teacher.  We are looking for something very minimal and I hope the Minister will respond.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to be given a chance to speak on this subject.  As Deputy Martin said last night, Fianna Fáil has tabled this motion to highlight the lack of access of primary school children to a proper and comprehensive remedial teacher programme.  We call on the Minister to appoint additional remedial teachers. Neither I nor many TDs will be aware of the situation nationally but we are aware of it in our counties because people come to us for assistance.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that up to 80 per cent of schoolchildren have access to remedial teachers. The most disadvantaged schools in Donegal must be part of the 20 per cent.  I can give examples in my area and the problems there.  I have a file containing 25 letters written to the Minister and the Department of Education over six years seeking a remedial teacher for different areas. Some of the statistics are horrific.  When an application was made for a remedial teacher for a cluster of schools, Termon, Kilmacrennan, Rathdonnell, Trentagh and Portlean, it was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Termon national school was built in 1977 and serves an extremely remote area of Donegal.  The county is vast and towns and families are scattered.  Herein lies the kernel of many of its social and educational problems.  The nearest neighbours of some children live more than two miles away.  There is, therefore, a lack of peer group stimulation outside of school.  This is what is happening in rural areas where children live vast distances apart and do not have peer group stimulation.  It means that children remain weak and many have speech and vocabulary problems apart from not being able to interact socially with their peers.  Termon, for example, has 101 children from 52 families.  This gives an idea of its remoteness.  There are no factories.  Of the 52 families, 24 have no wage earner and, of the other 28, only one wage earner has full-time pensionable employment.  Many of the families are dependent on the parent working in part-time occupations.  Of the 52 families, 17 live in local <Col N="980" /> authority rented housing and 22 draw the dole. One child attending the school has cerebral palsy, one is attending a psychologist for hypersensitivity and one other small child, Raymond McLaughlin, has been disgnosed with a high mental handicap by the educational psychologist with the recommendation that he be moved to St. Bernadette's in Letterkenny.  The parents do not want the child to move.  Therefore, the school must take the child on board.  A resource teacher should and must be appointed to such a school.  Unfortunately, there is only one resource teacher in the whole of Donegal.  It is in these rural areas that priority should be given.  I give this as an horrific example of what has happened.</P>
    <P>I wonder what has happened to the submission sent in by the principal, Mr. Gillespie, to St. Patrick's College in the last week which indicated that these schools required updating of their teacher numbers?  Unfortunately, schools which are not half as bad have received word that they have got teachers.  I wonder if it is at local level or somewhere else that the problem lies when a school like Termon cannot get a remedial teacher?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputies Bradford and Kathleen Lynch.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate.  Since my election to Dáil Éireann I have taken a personal interest in the remedial and special needs of the children in my constituency of Kerry South.  The last speaker spoke about his Donegal constituency and as I represent a constituency which is similar to his I can appreciate his concerns.  I must confess, however, that I am very surprised that Fianna Fáil has chosen this issue as the subject of a Private Members' motion.  Fianna Fáil's record in this area is appalling, yet that party has the audacity to criticise the Minister for Education who has made specialised intervention at all levels of the education system a priority since she took office.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats were Fianna Fáil's partners in crime and I vividly recall the neglect of the education system under the Fianna FáilProgressive Democrats Government.  When we debate economic matters we hear much from Fianna Fáil about their management of the economy between 1987 and 1992.  They are less keen to debate their management of other policy areas, including education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined a number of areas where her track record is far superior to that of her predecessors.  Those of us working in constituencies need no facts or figures to prove the improvements that have been made since 1992.  In my constituency alone 21 additional schools have been included for access to remedial services since I was elected to this House.  The people of Caherciveen have no complaints about this Minister's performance with regard to <Col N="981" /> national schools.  It is my hope that the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio in these schools, namely, St. Mary's Boys' national school, St. Joseph's national school, Scoil Bhreanainn in Portmagee and five other national schools, will be a big help to pupils and teachers in these schools.  It is also my hope that the teachers in these schools will now be in a position to devote more time to the special education needs of pupils who have significant difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am aware, from my meetings with parents in Kerry South, that much more is required but, unfortunately, the Minister cannot in a short time make up for many years of neglect in this area by previous Ministers.  We need more, and as we raise people's expectations of the education system we contribute to their refusal to accept anything but the best.  That is how it should be.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that she has initiated a new study on the provision of remedial education in schools.  The Education Research Centre in Drumcondra has a fine reputation, and I am sure that its work will be of huge benefit to us in the future.  If we are to commit more resources to tackling problems in our education system, it is essential that we determine the most effective way to spend this money.  That is why the Minister has initiated the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative to complement the existing system for disadvantaged areas.  The concern to get value for money has marked the Minister's approach to change in our education system, and I commend her for that.</P>
    <P>Our education system is one of the finest in Europe.  However, as our society has changed, pressures on children and teachers have increased.  The concept of special needs has broadened considerably.  In some schools the role of teacher overlaps with that of psychologist, social worker and other specialists.  Teacher training has sought to keep abreast of these developments.  However, teachers who were trained in earlier times find it difficult to cope with the range of demands placed upon them.  I fully support the Minister's statement that the provision of remedial teachers is only part of the debate about special needs.  However, Fianna Fáil Front Bench Deputies should have squirmed when she pointed out that she has appointed almost three times as many remedial teachers as they did when they were last in control of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Martin trotted out his party's usual line when confronted by an impressive Labour Party performance in Government.  They point out that they too were in Government with my party and hence are entitled to a share in the credit for the wonderful work of the present Minister.  The real difference was achieved by the appointment of the first Labour Minister for Education, not Fianna Fáil's participation in Government.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the holistic way in which she has addressed the issue of special needs in education.  This includes a 700 per cent increase <Col N="982" /> in the appointment of resources teachers since the Minister took office; the appointment of visiting teachers for the travelling community and children with visual and hearing impairments and Down's syndrome; huge improvements in resources available for special classes which, in some cases represent an increase of 400 per cent in the allocation provided by the Minister's predecessor; the appointment of child care assistants; and the appointment of 27 teacher counsellors to deal with the growing occurrence of disruptive behaviour, which is a special need in itself.  This is an impressive record.</P>
    <P>However, despite the progress that has been made in the past three years, we cannot afford to be complacent.  As we move towards a society in which the economy is determined by an individual's level of skills, the importance of education cannot be underestimated.  We must continually seek improvements.  This applies not only to remedial education but to all aspects of educational policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made an impressive contribution to righting the wrongs that preceded her in her Department.  I am confident that this year's Book of Estimates will represent another step towards an efficient and effective education sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on the important topic of education, which is a core issue in the development of society.  The last speaker summed up matters well when she said we have raised people's expectations of education to the extent that they will no longer accept second best.  That applies particularly to remedial education and the teaching of disadvantaged people in our society.</P>
      <P>We must concede that the overall level of education services over the past 20 or 30 years has improved dramatically.  We now have perhaps the best education system in Europe in the context of third level education, with an ever increasing number of people availing of third level education and graduating each year with certificates, diplomas and degrees from our many excellent and varied third level institutions.</P>
      <P>Simultaneously, we still have much too high an incidence, particularly at national school level, of people who have great difficulty in grasping the basic tools of education.  No matter how high we raise the bar regarding third level education, we must realise that we have many challenges to face when we still have people entering second level schools unable to read or write properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistically, the record of the present Minister in relation to remedial education and the provision of educational facilities for the disadvantaged in society is second to none. During her time in the Department she has approved the appointment of 241 extra remedial teachers.  This means that 87 per cent of pupils have access to remedial education compared with 77 per cent prior to Deputy Bhreathnach's becoming Minister for Education.  I hope we will <Col N="983" /> soon arrive at a situation where 100 per cent of pupils at national school level will have access to the remedial teacher, the resource teacher or the specialist teacher.  Until such time as we reach 100 per cent of pupils we are not giving children the service they deserve.</P>
    <P>The education budget which the Minister has to approve and manage each year is one of the largest departmental budgets.  It is one which has increased in size and scope at a significant level each year.  No matter how much money is available to the Minister for distribution within her Department there will always be competing claims.  Remedial teaching and specialist education is a vital area and therefore requires urgent attention and the maximum possible amount of the money available.  The Minister also has to provide for a huge salaries and wages bill, equipment and school buildings.</P>
    <P>While we are debating remedial education and the need for further investment in that area, only a few days ago the main topic of the education debate related to schools buildings when the INTO made public the list of national school buildings which are not in an acceptable condition.  This is a huge problem which needs the Minister's attention.  Sadly it is impossible to tackle all the problems together.  That is why any Minister in any Department is always under pressure from competing demands.  I commend the Minister on the amount of money she has put into educational facilities and resources for the disadvantaged and I appeal to her to ensure these moneys will be increased in 1997.</P>
    <P>Basic education is vital to the development of the pupil, society and the economy.  Any pound spent at the most basic level of the education ladder produces tremendous value.  While I am all in favour of the Minister's initiative in regard to improving access to and providing free fees for third level education, we cannot forget there is still a huge number of pupils at national school level who require significant extra help and resources.  The bulk of the available money must be targeted at those people because one cannot build a solid education system on weak foundations.  Where 5 per cent, 6 per cent or 7 per cent of pupils leave national school without the ability to read or write there is something fundamentally wrong which requires urgent attention.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the socio-economic background to much of the problem.  Statistics clearly demonstrate that pupils coming from a background where the majority of parents are unemployed and have low educational qualifications appear to have a greater need for specialist education than other pupils.  The Minister is correct in trying to target areas and schools.  Our difficulty as public representatives is that the areas targeted are never as widespread as we would wish.  We can all report from our constituencies schools which require extra resources and access to remedial teachers and, <Col N="984" /> perhaps, entire areas which require disadvantaged status.  Progress has been made during 1996 but we hope further progress can be made in 1997.  We must ensure we do not have the educational wastelands which exist in some of our larger urban areas.  I commend the Minister's attempt to deal with matters requiring specialist attention.  I trust she recognises there are schools in the smaller towns and villages in rural areas which also require urgent attention and access to remedial and resource teachers.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on her record to date. The statistics speak for themselves.  She has ploughed record resources and a record number of teachers into the system but all backbench Deputies can report that serious problems remain to be addressed.  We hope that during 1997 she will build on her record and make further resources and facilities available to weaker and marginalised pupils.  Unless that is done we will continue to create other socio-economic problems down the line.  Let us nip the problem in the bud and from an education point of view that means ploughing further money into the schools and areas where there are serious problems.</P>

      <P>While I do not have a great deal of experience in this area I understand that Private Members' motions tabled by the Opposition are meant to embarrass the Government and to point out the defects in its programme or its inaction in certain areas.  I always find them interesting.  It may be because since I became a Member I have spent only three weeks in turmoil and the rest on the Government side so that I do not have the great chastisement of being in Opposition.  These debates are an opportunity to discuss areas about which I feel strongly.</P>
      <P>Parliaments all over the world have interest groups within them and ours is no different.  For example, as soon as one mentions agriculture a certain group of people get extremely excited. Various other interest groups are concerned with taxation, business, newspapers, etc.  The subject about which I am passionate is education and disadvantage.  Education which has the ability to alleviate disadvantage has the global effect.  I regard these debates as an opportunity to express my point of view.  Fianna Fáil, which has spent 50 of the past 75 years in Government, has a cheek to expect anyone, in a period of two years, to remedy the neglect over which it has presided for such a lengthy period in the life of the State.  It is incredible that Fianna Fáil can sit without blushing and listen to the litany of neglect in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody would dispute that there are six areas in Ireland which would be termed severely disadvantaged in all aspects.  I represent one of those areas.  How could anyone with any vestige of compassion &mdash; I am not talking about intellectual ability &mdash; have allowed this to happen?  It is estimated that 15 per cent of pupils <Col N="985" /> attending school need the attention of remedial teachers.  This is a huge figure.  It is also estimated that 6,000 remedial teachers are necessary to address that need.  The number of such teachers is increasing dramatically, although not enough.</P>
    <P>I favour the targeted intervention approach which has never been favoured by Fianna Fáil, except in Gaeltacht areas where it has been most successful.  Fianna Fáil should have learned from that.  We should have a targeted approach to deal with education in areas of disadvantage.  Such an approach would mean that areas most in need of attention in all their social aspects would have a greater chance of attaining the level other areas have reached, although that is not to say other areas have an enormous advantage.</P>
    <P>The number of remedial teachers has increased although not sufficiently.  In 1992-93 there were 947 remedial teachers and in 1995-96 that figure had increased to 1,188.  Remedial teachers are now augmented by resource teachers which is an advantage.  However, how much of an advantage is it and where will it lead in future?  It is not enough and unless we take a targeted approach the figure will never be enough.  The scatter-gun approach does not and never will work.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss areas of disadvantages, particularly the area of Cork North-Central which I represent.  My remarks will be verified by other Deputies who represent that area.  Research shows that high quality early education intervention has a positive impact in combating educational disadvantage in the future success of children.  According to Damien Hannan in his research paper, &ldquo;Ending Inequality in Education (Poverty Today 1992)&rdquo;, one in two children leaving school without a qualification or with poor junior certificate qualifications remains unemployed for up to five years, with up to one-third of such children never becoming employed. Can one imagine the prospect of never working as a result of how one is treated in primary education?</P>
    <P>While we continue to build tower blocks at third level we give advantage to those who have already reached that level and who would have gone on to third level education anyway.  The remainder of the children surveyed get low skilled and poorly paid jobs, are subject to high rates of turnover and have poor promotional prospects.  Employment is, in many ways, indispensable to transition to adulthood and in establishing independent relationships, separate households and getting married.  Gaining employment is essential for a successful adult life but it is difficult, especially in a labour market such as Ireland's which demands qualifications that are too high.  If people do not have such qualifications they are in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>The majority of the people I represent do not have the resources to enable them to secure a good education or employment.  As Deputy Bradford pointed out, we are responsible for the social circumstances which we allow to exist. According to the 1991 census figures, Cork city <Col N="986" /> was generally in line with national figures for educational attainment.  However, a number of areas on the north side of the city showed an extremely high rate of early school leavers. Damien Hannan included graphs in his paper to show the contrast between the population which left education at age 15 years or less and that which remained in education after 20 years of age.  In areas where people left education at 15 years or less almost 70 per cent and never less than 37 per cent were employed.  In areas where people continued to third level education, less than 2 per cent were unemployed.  In one area in Cork city, where attendance at third level education was 40 per cent, unemployment was less than 4 per cent.  In a similar area, where attendance at third level education was less than 2 per cent, unemployment was 70 per cent.  The connection cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>This phenomenon did not occur in the last two years.  It was not an accident and was not caused by lack of attention.  It was the result of a deliberate policy to court a section of society where one knew one would get support and neglect the rest.  That is disgraceful.</P>

      <P>Unless we try to deal with this problem and ensure that it does not continue, none of us can hold up our heads and be grateful for the society we have.</P>
      <P>A survey of students from 20 disadvantaged schools in this area showed that of the number of students who should have started second level education in 1992, 6 per cent never attended. There is no obligation on schools to inform the Department of Education about children who should attend school but do not.  Those figures have to be gleaned from private surveys usually commissioned by people doing theses on a subject such as poverty.  The Department of Education, which has sole responsibility for the education of our children, does not know whether the children are at school.  This is crazy.  Where are those children?  What are they doing?  Who has responsibility for them?  We had better start taking that responsibility.  Our only response to issues of social unrest appears to be right wing, conservative, repressive measures instead of ploughing money into areas where it will yield most benefit.  Can one imagine a society in which every child had a proper education, was confident enough to apply for a job and had the ability to walk into an interview and say he or she is capable of doing it?  However, that is not happening and it has not been a phenomenon of the last two years.  We are talking about 70 years of neglect which will come home to roost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discuss remedial teaching, we must never assume that people from particular areas need remedial teaching because they are intellectually deficient.  There are many reasons for needing remedial teaching.  People in all areas <Col N="987" /> need remedial teaching from time to time.  When we look at education we must not simply look at what we provide today.  Education is about the consequences of tomorrow.  We must ensure those consequences are good for the individual because if they are they will be good for society.</P>
    <P>I agree we do not have enough remedial teachers.  However, if we put sufficient resources into other areas in addition to remedial teaching, we will not need as many remedial teachers.  It is not difficult to understand that children who do not have a proper place in which to study and who do not have sufficient food to eat are unable to concentrate.  Would anybody be able to concentrate?  They would not.  This issue is not just about remedial teaching but about a package that must be put together.</P>
    <P>My plea is that such a package would be targeted at the six areas which have been identified as being in greatest need.  If every Member could leave this House at the end of his or her term and say they directed resources at the areas of greatest need, they would have done something worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I am particularly pleased to have an opportunity of contributing to this debate.  It is only right and proper that, on occasion, we take time to debate important educational issues, particularly as they apply to primary and pre-schooling education, the basis of all education.  If we can get our resources in order in pre-schools and primary schools a number of later problems can be averted or eliminated.  I am glad we have focused our attention on this matter today.</P>
      <P>It is not my form and has not been my practice to address any statement made by Deputy Kathleen Lynch here.  However, I should remind her there never has been a better time within my period of involvement in education, from the age of three and a half until elected to this House in 1987, for any Minister for Education to invest proper teaching resources in our schools because of the fall in school population or enrolments. Undoubtedly, any Minister who does not invest now has a case to answer.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this year the Minister for Education had 346 teachers surplus to normal classroom requirements.  She had the option of allocating remedial or similar posts in primary education.  I do not ever remember any previous Minister for Education who had that number of surplus teachers with which to do the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two points to raise, one in relation to pre-school and the other to the Breaking the Cycle scheme announced by the Minister this year.  I regret the Minister is not present but because of the involvement of her Minister of <Col N="988" /> State, Deputy Currie, with the Juvenile Justice Bill he will be in a position to readily respond to my comments and it is because he is present I make these remarks.</P>
    <P>I want to make a very strong case for additional funding in pre-school education because it is at that level disadvantage begins.  If we are prepared to invest proper resources in pre-schooling, at least we shall get the first rung of the educational ladder right.  If we get young people properly established on that first rung, there is the prospect they will climb each additional one whereas, if they falter on the first, climbing will be more difficult.</P>
    <P>The most respectable research has proven that for every £1 invested in pre-school education, society would benefit to the tune of £1,700 after 27 years.  Greater care of and emphasis on pre-school and primary education promises even greater dividends resulting in reduced delinquency, truancy and early school-leaving. There will be a reduced cycle of poor parenting, fewer people in the poverty trap and reduced temptation toward crime.  That has been proven by the best international research available.</P>
    <P>I make a very strong plea of the Minister for Education to allocate more resources to pre-school education, which is where advantage or disadvantage begins.  Indeed, in natural justice, we have a moral duty to ensure that all our children at least are given a fair start.  If given a fair start they will have some hope later in life whereas, if they do not get it at age three, three-and-a-half or four, they will have little prospect later.</P>
    <P>Primary school education here is severely under-financed.  We have heard a great deal about a reduction in class sizes, in the pupil-teacher ratio but that is not always the case.  For example, my sister, teaches in a convent school in Cork city and has 38 eight-years-olds in her class. If there is a weak child in that class, what chance has that child of receiving individual attention? What chance has any child of receiving the kind of individual attention needed and to which he or she is entitled when one teacher has to cope with 38 students daily?</P>
    <P>The strongest point I make this morning relates to the manner in which the Breaking the Cycle scheme was administered and applied.  When that scheme was first announced it filled me with optimism, I thought this was the beginning of correct thinking, the kind of thinking that would divert young people from the disadvantage visited on their homesteads, parents and communities through unemployment.  I thought then at least we were doing something to protect young people from the worst social and economic side effects of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In the case of my constituency, referred to already by another Member, two schools which by any objective standard met the eligibility criteria for the Breaking the Cycle scheme were not included.  The schools to which I refer are Knocknaheeny and Churchfield in Cork North-Central. <Col N="989" /> Those two schools ought to have topped the list of eligibility for that scheme.  I raised this issue in the House before and repeatedly with the Minister and the Minister of State at her Department.  I have pointed out the gross injustice done to the pupils in those two schools, their parents and teachers on not having been included in that scheme.  If that omission is not rectified the scheme will be discredited.  If schools that ought to be top of the list, under every heading in the criteria laid down, are not included, the question to be asked is on what criterion were some schools included and others excluded.  In terms of the greatest need, those two schools were the most deserving in Cork city, and most likely, in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to take all necessary steps to ensure that wrong is remedied. The worst possible thing that could happen in education is that teachers would lose heart.  In many areas of huge unemployment, very often the brightest and safest place for a child to be is at school and the most positive and constructive person with whom such a young pupil may come in contact is his or her teacher.</P>
    <P>Primary school teachers are very creative and their efforts to brighten the education system are in stark contrast with the position when I was at school.  Primary teachers are the most creative, caring and energetic people in the public service and it is important that they do not lose heart, throw in the towel and say they can no longer continue to teach in areas which are not given the resources necessary to give pupils a fair start in life and want to teach in areas which are more favourable from the point of view of teaching.  If this happens then the loss to the education system will be immense and irreparable.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to allocate more resources to pre-schools and the early start programme.  I also appeal to her to allocate more resources to primary schools to ensure the appointment of additional remedial teachers and the provision of access for students to counselling and psychological services so that difficulties are identified and addressed early in life.  Most importantly, there must be a proper application of the Breaking the Cycle initiative and the inclusion in it this year of the two schools to which I referred, Knocknaheeny and Churchfield in Cork.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I compliment our spokesperson, Deputy Martin, and Deputy Coughlan on putting down this timely motion which will help the Minister for Education in fighting her corner at the Cabinet table.  The Government refers to our booming economy and the record returns to the Exchequer.  It is important for the Minister for Education to secure a significant amount of this money for the development of primary education.  This money should be targeted specifically towards the disadvantaged in the primary school sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree we have a good education system but <Col N="990" /> we are living in changing times of increased poverty, unemployment and pressure on families. We must tackle specific areas of education, particularly the primary sector which must be properly funded.  A high percentage of pupils do not go on to second level education and we must ensure they are given the best possible education within the primary school system.  Many young people leave school without being able to read or write and they find it impossible to find jobs.  The booming economy and the demographic dividend provide the Minister with the ideal opportunity to appoint additional remedial teachers.  Primary teachers do a magnificent job but they need extra resources and facilities.  There are many problems in the primary school sector which require attention, for example, large classes, urban and rural disadvantage and a lack of remedial teachers.  The Minister has not utilised the resources at her disposal in the best interests of the primary school system.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Martin said, the Minister has a great PR machine which gives the impression that every school has a remedial teacher.  However, that is not the case.  There are approximately 1,100 remedial teachers and approximately 3,000 national schools, 900 of which have no remedial teacher service.  The perception is that all schools in County Wexford have a remedial teacher. However, some schools still have no access to a remedial teacher, while in most cases as many as three, four and five schools are served by one remedial teacher.  It is not possible for a remedial teacher to provide a proper service when 10-15 per cent of pupils in all schools need special care and attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clouded the issue and given the impression that every school has top class remedial teaching facilities.  I have spoken to remedial teachers and parents who have told me that this is not the case.  Many of them are concerned that remedial teachers can make only one or two visits a week to schools.  The Minister refers to the need to look after the disadvantaged and needy in society and has introduced the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  While I welcome this initiative I do not know how it can be justified when there is a lack of remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch praised the Minister for what she has done and castigated Fianna Fáil for its lack of interest in education.  If she looks at Fianna Fáil's record she will see that all the magnificent improvements in education were introduced by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers. The most breathtaking improvements, free second level education and school transport, introduced by Donogh O'Malley gave every young person, particularly those in rural areas, an opportunity to attend second and third level education.  We will be forever indebted to Donogh O'Malley for these improvements.  It is the height of hypocrisy for Deputy Lynch, who has only been in the House a wet day, to castigate the achievements of Fianna Fáil Ministers in the area of education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> The Minister has an ideal opportunity with the demographic dividend to appoint additional remedial teachers.  Last year there were 346 teachers available under the demographic dividend but not one of these was appointed as a remedial teacher.  The same number of teachers will probably be available this year and I call on the Minister to ensure that an adequate number of remedial teachers are appointed so that pupils are given a proper and adequate service.  Many parents in County Wexford send their children to remedial classes outside school hours.  It is disgraceful that they should have to do this.  I hope this motion will prompt the Minister to fight her corner at the Cabinet table and to utilise the available resources in the appointment of the necessary number of remedial teachers in 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the problems of disadvantage, disadvantaged pupils and the lack of remedial teachers.  Deputy Browne dealt adequately with the comments made by Deputy Lynch.  If Deputy Lynch checks the record of Fianna Fáil in terms of the provision of money for education she will see that, as was said when we introduced free second level education in the 1960s, we took the brains from the bog.  The introduction of free second level education for all citizens and the school transport system were major achievements.</P>
      <P>We refer to disadvantaged pupils and schools. However, there are so many types of disadvantage that it is difficult to know how to deal with it.  In many schools the pupil-teacher ratios may not be adequate to give a fair and balanced opportunity to each pupil.  In some rural areas the pupil-teacher ratios may be low, but the schools may have only two teachers catering for 30 or 40 pupils.  Teachers should not have to teach three or four classes.  While remedial teachers have been appointed in the past few years, they work only three or four hours per week in each school.  Such a part-time service is not sufficient to give children who need that service a proper standard of education.  A one teacher school in my constituency caters for 19 pupils, seven of whom are non-nationals and have difficulty learning through English.  Children with special needs also attend that school.  I have raised this matter with the Minister who, in fairness, stated that she has asked an inspector to investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>The waiting time for child assessment in some schools is two years.  That is a long time in the life of a child attending national school.  The Minister should introduce a proper assessment system under which assessments can be processed within two months.  The number of difficulties children encounter in two years could have a detrimental effect on them for the rest of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne referred to the fact that many parents send their children to private remedial education, but many parents could not afford such an education for their children.  Groups, <Col N="992" /> such as ACLD, continually seek money from the Minister, but are told it is not available.  Parents who send their children to ACLD raise the necessary funding in whatever way they can, but many parents cannot afford the service provided by such groups.  If we cannot provide remedial education in State institutions, we should allocate funding to such groups, which operate outside school hours, on an ongoing basis.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister to provide funding for those groups in the budget?  They are bridging a gap in the education system.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that parents should be told their child will not be assessed for two years unless they can afford to have it done privately. We should not base a school's needs on its pupil-teacher ratio.  Every pupil in the school should be assessed individually.  Perhaps we should consider assessing every child in their first two years at primary school.  School inspectors are expected to identify children's problems without the assistance of a proper assessment programme.</P>
    <P>We are not raising these points for political purposes, we are trying to deal with a problem that will lead to major social problems if it is not addressed immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate about the lack of remedial teachers, particularly in disadvantaged rural areas in the west.  Everyone recognises the benefit of a good education.  If education is to benefit individuals and the nation, it must be based on a solid foundation.  That is where our primary schools play a role because, with the home, they are the foundation of our educational structure.</P>
      <P>Every pupil does not have a similar ability. Because of their sociological background or other special difficulties, such as dyslexia, hearing difficulties, hyperactivity or autism, some children need extra tuition.  If children are given a proper start in school, it will benefit them for life.  If children in the west do not receive a proper education they have little hope of securing proper jobs in future.  Children need a good education if they are to have a proper chance in life.</P>
      <P>We must keep up with international trends and standards in other countries.  We must have balanced pupil-teacher ratios, sufficient numbers of remedial teachers and psychological assessment programmes.  To enable remedial teachers to identify children's problems, the children must be psychologically assessed.  If a psychological assessment programme is implemented and sufficient numbers of remedial teachers provided, primary education will be well served.  Primary teachers who have had the benefit of a remedial teacher in their schools are aware of the dramatic effect such a service can have on pupils.  It gives every child an opportunity to avail of good primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members referred to the Minister's work in this area.  While she may have a special interest in it, she must remember that her time in Government <Col N="993" /> with Fianna Fáil gave her the first opportunity to initiate many of those developments.  When the economy is doing well, additional funding could be provided for remedial teaching and, as Deputy Browne stated, we should make our pitch for remedial teaching in the run up to the budget. Members have extolled the advantages that can be derived from remedial teaching.  Primary and secondary education are the cornerstone of education.  We have a good education system, but children must be capable of attending second level schools if they are to gain full advantage from their education.</P>
    <P>Primary education has changed in the past few years.  Teachers must outline to their pupils the dangers associated with drugs, alcohol and crime. We should allocate as much money as possible to the primary sector to give every child a good chance in life.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to commend and congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Education, on her commitment to ensuring that children with special needs have access to suitable education during their time at school.  It is a rare opportunity to pay tribute to the work achieved during her Ministry.  Often progress and hard work go unnoticed.  Yet the Minister has achieved much in three years.</P>
      <P>In her speech yesterday she outlined the progress made.  I would like to reiterate some of the many advances that have taken place during the past three years.  My colleague has deployed resources across a broad spectrum of special needs ranging from a lower pupil-teacher ratio for children with a mental handicap to initiating schemes in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  She has significantly improved the rates of capitation payable to schools and in respect of children attending special schools and special classes.  She has provided an additional ten psychologists to the school psychological service.  She has initiated a pilot scheme to provide safety harnesses and escorts on certain school transport services to assist pupils with special needs.  On that point I wish to refer to the establishment of the School Transport Review Committee.  That committee was asked to review the transport arrangements for pupils in special schools and classes. I expect its report will be presented to me shortly.</P>

      <Col N="994" /> The Minister has deployed an additional 241 remedial and 39 resource teachers, bringing the total number of posts in the primary sector to 1,188 and 46 respectively.  Those additional 280 posts demonstrate the enormous commitment the Minister and Government have made to children with special needs integrated into mainstream national schools.  Despite attempts by the Opposition to take credit for the expansion of remedial education, the facts speak for themselves.  In 1989, 1991 and 1992 not a single additional remedial teacher was appointed by the then Minister for Education.  Can Fianna Fáil Deputies tell us why?</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage 87 per cent of pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher.  That is a big improvement on the position when my colleague, the Minister for Education, took office in 1993 when 77 per cent of pupils had a possibility of such access.  Much has been done, but more remains to be done.  It will be done in a planned way in contrast with the neglect of the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education has always sought to ensure scarce resources are deployed in the most effective way for the benefit of children most in need.  In the current year the Minister has adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and has sought to target resources at that area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of that process the Minister recently launched a major initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children who suffer serious educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate reference was made to the fact that certain schools were not selected for inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle of disadvantage initiative.  The criteria used for selecting schools and the selection process were carried out by the education research centre on an independent basis.  All applicant schools were vetted and selected on the basis of the education research centre's assessment of needs as reflected in data submitted by the schools.  I consider the Minister's decision to commission the education research centre to carry out that independent exercise was right, given the particular expertise of that body in the area of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to some of the schools mentioned.  Two of them, Knocknaheeny and Churchfield, are in the north western ward of Cork city where I live and was educated.  They are excellent schools and their staffs are committed to their pupils, as are the parents who support those teachers.  They were recognised in the past and will be recognised for their commitment to their pupils.</P>

      <P>I shared some of my time with the Minister for which I am sure he was grateful.</P>
      <P>As a former teacher with limited experience, I recognise the need to put young people on the right road at an early age.  That has been a cornerstone of Fianna Fáil policy and the record proves it.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government we recognised the necessity to improve the education system at all levels.  In the 1960s we introduced free education at second level and free school travel.  Those two decisions changed our educational landscape.</P>
      <P>The third level education system is very important and improvements in it have been made through the years, some by this Government.  I give it credit where it is due.  The facilities and funding available for investment in education as in other areas have been made available due to the good management of the economy since 1987.  This year alone £2 billion has been made available for education purposes. From 1987 we in this party turned around the fortunes of the country and made it possible for this Government to use the money available wisely.</P>
      <P>The Minister has increased the coverage of schools with remedial teachers geographically but there is then a problem of one teacher covering three to five schools, or more in some areas.  The time then available to students with remedial teachers has been reduced.  The Minister will have to reserve this.  The reason for this was that pressure was on the Minister and she decided to use a political trick to say the Government had improved the situation.</P>

Unfortunately, we went out of power and the present Government did not continue our policies.

They are uncomfortable that we raised this matter.  The Minister defensively outlined all she has done in education over the last four years.  This motion was not introduced acrimoniously.  We support the need for remedial education and teachers.</P>
      <P>Remedial education was first seen as a need in the 1960s but it was only in the 1970s when the child-centred approach was adopted that the grave need for remedial education was really noticed.  I could have anticipated that the Minister would say &ldquo;When I came into office 77 per cent of pupils had access to remedial education and now 87 per cent have access&rdquo;.  However, the reality, as some of my colleagues have pointed out, is that there are 3,203 national schools in the country and 1,188 remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>On 28 September 1995, on foot of a parliamentary question to the Minister, it was found that there are 918 national schools without access to a remedial teacher.  Many remedial teachers are shared by clusters of schools.  Up to ten schools may share a remedial teacher, as happens in the Gaeltacht.  A cluster of four is enough.  The teacher must spend time lifting material in and out of the car, not giving time to teaching.  Many schools do not even have a room for remedial education.  There are grave practical needs in remedial education.</P>
      <P>All Deputies would agree all who need it should be entitled to remedial education.  It is almost laughable that the Minister has introduced a review for 1997 and that she will have a report for the end of that year.  I do not know where she will be then but she will not be Minister for Education.  We will then decide what to do.  We need remedial teachers in 1997, not 1998. Remedial teachers were not appointed last year because the Minister has gone off on a tangent. She sees a problem with disadvantage and puts all her money into that instead of spreading it out equitably.</P>
      <P>We have spoken about the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; scheme.  Many Deputies have reservations about it and every Deputy would say there are schools in his or her constituency that should have been included.  One lack in that scheme is that no remediation is attached to it.  The scheme will work out well and I commend the work gone into it.  We look forward to the review promised by the Minister but the lack of remediation attached to it will be a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remedial teachers were appointed in recent years so that large schools have an advantage over small rural schools.  In a response to a parliamentary question on 25 July 1996, it was <Col N="998" /> stated there are 120 national schools in County Clare and 63 have access to remedial education. About 50 per cent of children &mdash; 62 per cent of schools &mdash; do not have access to remedial education.  In County Leitrim, there are 43 schools with 25 having access to remedial education, so 50 per cent do not have access.  In almost every county 50 per cent of children have no access to remedial education.</P>
    <P>There are probably a plethora of applications for remedial education on the Minister's desk. We want to see an equitable spread of all resources in education &mdash; remedial teachers, visiting teachers, the pilot scheme introduced successfully in Tallaght by Deputy O'Rourke, educational psychologists &mdash; but instead of increasing the numbers of people, the increase has been in the geographical spread.  Instead of looking at need, the Minister looks at geography. That is the wrong way to implement a targeted approach to children.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned international surveys on children's literacy performances.  I am annoyed at this and no Member of the Dáil could be proud of them.  It is absolutely terrible.  In a survey of nine-year olds in this country, 12 per cent were identified by their teachers as needing remedial education but only half of them have access to it.  At second level, an area totally neglected in remedial education, 13 per cent of pupils need help but only two in ten receive it. We will go nowhere unless there is a proper targeted approach and access to assessment which is almost non-existent because of the lack of educational psychologists.  The grants available, £200 per remedial teacher, are paltry. That grant is to one school, not the four to 11 schools the teacher may be serving.  The school with access to a remedial teacher should also have a grant to provide proper facilities for the children, particularly computers for those with special needs and dyslexia, and calculators.  There are many practical things the Minister should address as well as appointing additional remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>A Minister for Education has never had access to so much money: £2 billion.  Many Minister for Education would have done far better with half that.  We are tired listening to the Minister telling us that Fianna Fáil did nothing while in Government.  She has access to £2 billion and what is described as the demographic dividend out of which the many needs we have highlighted in this debate should be met.  She should not get on her high horse whenever the media highlights various issues or put all her eggs in one basket. There is a need for equity.  She should ensure additional remedial teachers are appointed next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> In our response to this crisis, we must guard against recreating the situation in the refugee camps where those who had perpetrated the genocide were sheltered and benefited from international aid generously given over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address what is taking place in the political sphere.  The initiatives taken by former President Nyerere of Tanzania are those which will bring peace to the area.  There was a measure of progress with the Arusha accords in 1994 which provided for power sharing, democracy and accountability in Rwanda.  The people set to lose out by the introduction of those democratic measures were those who ordered <Col N="1001" /> and perpetrated the genocide.  I would like those agreements to be put in place and built on, in particular to include measures to address the restoration of the justice system in that country.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect European countries to ride in on white horses and sort out these problems given that they caused most of them in the first instance.  We must continue to assist the initiatives of the African countries, the Organisation of African Unity and former President Nyerere, with the help of figures like President Mandela of South Africa, to reach agreement between Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire.  This crisis, if not addressed politically, has the potential to destabilise the entire region.  We are seeing that happen in Zaire and we know what is going on in Burundi.  While Tanzania has been lucky not to have experienced any major political overspill, it wants the situation resolved.</P>
    <P>Any solution brokered must address the need for political progress.  We must have guarantees on the passage of humanitarian aid in Rwanda and eastern Zaire.  It is necessary to reach agreement on the appointment of human rights monitors in Rwanda because a huge job will need to be done to ensure human rights for those who return there from Zaire and other countries.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on the money it has given to the humanitarian aid effort. Yesterday, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs approved a Supplementary Estimate for £2.5 million of which £1 million came from the national lottery.  The people agree with such funding.  Unless there is a political solution, we will have to come back again with such requests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994 we witnessed scenes of the most appalling suffering in Rwanda and in the sprawling refugee camps around Goma.  It seemed from media coverage that the suffering had abated and that law and order was more or less restored to Rwanda.  A few half-hearted attempts were made to put those responsible for the genocide on trial and refugees got on with the business of living in Goma and the other camps.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago hostilities between the Hutus and Tutsis flared up again, this time in eastern Zaire, and the world looked on in amazement as the scenes of 1994 were replayed.  Recent events in the Great Lakes region should have surprised nobody, particularly those with an interest in Africa.  My greatest fear is that the international community may sink back into complacency, as happened at the end of 1994, now that the refugees are returning to Rwanda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who would try to make us believe that Africa is doomed to be a political and economic mess, beset by tribalism and violence, and that the developed world should keep well away from what are essentially internal tribal conflicts, but I do not subscribe to that view. Europe as a whole must start picking up the political and economic tab for the great wrongs <Col N="1002" /> which were done to Africa in the past &mdash; that matter was referred to by other Deputies.  Ethnic conflict and the resulting streams of refugees are the symptoms rather than the cause of the problems besetting this part of Africa.  The root cause can be traced back to the colonial history of Africa, a history dominated by European intervention.  More than 100 years ago when Africa was a peaceful, stable society Europe was more than anxious to intervene but now when intervention is essential it seems reluctant to do so.</P>
    <P>The great European powers carved up Africa with mathematical precision during the 1870 Berlin conference.  Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Portugal passed these countries around as if they were prize possessions which were theirs to take advantage of, and ethnic, religious and linguistic groups found themselves divided by arbitrary borders.  The result of that is to be seen today.  To look at Africa one would think that God divided it with a slide rule.  Today the people of the Great Lakes region in particular are picking up the tab for the games played by the great powers 126 years ago.</P>
    <P>The 1870 conference marked the beginning of more than a century of exploitation.  Political colonialism was followed in recent decades by corporate colonialism which has wreaked havoc in countries such as Nigeria &mdash; that matter was highlighted by Democratic Left in the wake of Ken Saro-Wiwa's execution.  The World Bank and the IMF have combined to ensure that many post colonial countries are shackled by debt and the policies adopted by the World Trade Organisation have undermined any prospect of food security for many countries in Africa. Underlying all this is the arms trade.  Only recently we learned that a British arms company, Mil-Tec, supplied large amounts of arms and ammunition to the former Rwandan Government before and after it murdered an estimated one million people in 1994.  I have little doubt that European arms companies currently supply the Zairean rebels and other elements led by President Mobutu.</P>
    <P>UN and EU arms embargoes will continue to be empty aspirations unless a concerted effort is made to close the loopholes exploited by arms manufacturers.  Mil-Tec was able to continue supplying arms to Rwanda after the embargo by producing Zairean end-user certificates.  The current arms embargo against Nigeria is not worth the paper it is written on since EU arms companies can continue to fulfil supply contracts concluded before the embargo and arms supply contracts may take several years to fulfil.  When there is a requirement that arms trading should cease, there should be complete cessation.  I hope the Government will press for a thorough review of the conditions governing arms embargoes and insist that when an embargo is put in place all trade in arms stops.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned at the smug complacency displayed by the international <Col N="1003" /> community following the return of refugees from Zaire to Rwanda.  The voluntary nature of that return was hastened by the civil war in Zaire.  The return of refugees merely alleviates one immediate symptom of the ethnic conflicts plaguing that region; it does not address the root causes.  The return of refugees does not spell the end of the problem facing the area.  On the contrary, mass migration brings its own problems. It is by no means clear that all refugees are returning voluntarily.  Yesterday at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I was heartened to hear the Minister say that the aid recently approved by Parliament will go directly towards problems relating to returning refugees.  It is very important that we are given such information.</P>
    <P>I welcome the various aid packages which have been agreed by the European Union as well as the package announced by the Government.  A long-term resolution of the crisis facing the Great Lakes region demands more than short-term responses.  In this regard I particularly welcome the proposal, favoured by Ireland and the EU, that there be an international conference on peace, stability and development in the region. Such a conference, if properly convened and given the appropriate powers, may go some way towards clearing up the territorial mess left in the wake of the 1870 Berlin conference.  Conclusions must be backed up by appropriate financial, technical and material assistance.  The EU must examine its own policies to ensure they do not militate against stability and development in the Third World.  We are a power in the world to be reckoned with and we must use that power with a degree of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The refugees in the Great Lakes region are fleeing from war, and war is fed by arms.  For the most part those arms are manufactured in the United States and the European Union, of which we are a member.  A binding code of conduct governing EU arms exports is urgently needed to ensure that armaments manufactured in the European Union do not find their way into the hands of repressive regimes and those involved in civil war.  It is only by addressing issues such as arms exports that the EU will be able to make a lasting contribution to settle the conflicts currently raging not only in the Great Lakes region but in other areas around the world.</P>
    <P>Our aid agencies abroad have an adequate advance warning system, with good conductors of information which are well equipped.  Ireland has played an enormous part in ensuring the troubles besetting this region are alleviated and we can play an even greater part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on her efforts in this region of Africa and for the time she spent there organising aid.  I am sure she is frustrated by the chaos in most parts of Africa, but particularly in this area.  We must ensure that moneys we send go directly to the people who need it because there is a high level of corruption <Col N="1004" /> in Africa, and the Great Lakes region is particularly vulnerable in that regard.  The bully men will always try to take over, as we saw in Somalia not very long ago.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago I pointed out to the Department of Foreign Affairs that millions of pounds worth of pharmaceutical products, which have a lifespan of two to three years, are destroyed here every year.  Those products are normally withdrawn a year before they are destroyed because of European regulations but they can still be used for another year.  They could be used in emergencies such as this.  That would not solve the problem but it would be a way of providing immediate aid that would not cost a great deal of money.  I am anxious that the Department gives consideration to that suggestion.</P>
      <P>It is important that the task force is not made up only of Europeans because many European countries carry a lot of baggage in regard to their involvement in Africa.  Ireland is the only country which did not have a colony in the region.  We do not have an interest in arms, we are a neutral country and we have only helped Africans in the areas of religion and education.  I am highly suspicious of the long-term intentions in regard to business interests of some of our European colleagues.</P>
      <P>This is not a European crisis, Europe cannot deal with it on its own, for a variety of reasons. The international community has a duty to help in this crisis because every African country which has achieved independence has experienced a disastrous civil war.  Unfortunately some of those wars have continued and the countries involved have been described as totally corrupt.  I have no doubt that is true in the case of Nigeria.</P>
      <P>A permanent force of people to help with administration is needed in the area.  They can oversee that the loans given to these governments in the early stages of stabilisation do not get into the hands of people other than those they were intended to help.  I thank the Minister of State for the prompt action she has taken which does great credit to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all Members, I have watched with horror the unfolding saga of death and human misery in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  Despite the best efforts of the international community to relieve the crisis there, the underlying political problem has continued and it was not surprising that it arose again recently in eastern Zaire.</P>
      <P>While there have been positive developments since, with up to 600,000 refugees returning voluntarily to Rwanda, the migration of such a large number of people poses a serious problem for their well-being.  The first challenge facing the Rwandan government, to reabsorb this element of its population, will be an enormous task and that task will place an onus on the international community to do everything it can to help relieve human suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> The problems are a great deal more serious in Burundi where the refugees are experiencing enormous difficulties in returning home. Tanzania, which has been caring for over half a million refugees, now finds itself expected to cater for thousands more refugees fleeing this disaster.  It is right to praise Tanzania but we must also help it to shoulder this enormous burden it has voluntarily taken on.</P>
    <P>The position in eastern Zaire is precarious and something must be done to reach a political settlement in that area.  It is obvious that the region will require outside help to accomplish this.  I join other speakers who complimented the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, on her efforts in this regard.  She led and EU delegation to the region some weeks ago and I thank her for the time she has devoted to this particular problem, both in addressing this House and the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, and for steering the additional budget agreed by the House yesterday through the select committee.  The Minister of State has shown herself to be a caring Minister who has played a major role in highlighting the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>According to the figures the Minister of State gave yesterday there are now approximately 360,000 refugees in this area.  That poses an enormous problem, even if the numbers are smaller than expected, because it means that a large number of people are on the move.  I understand the aid agencies are concentrating their efforts now on helping to relocate these people.  We are told also that the UNHCR has begun to help the returnees and that the World Food Programme, working through the NGOs, has started to deliver food and medical supplies to alleviate the immediate humanitarian concerns of the refugees.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Irish NGOs have as usual played a prominent, commendable and distinguished role in the provision of this aid.  The Irish Presidency of the European Union has also responded well to the emergency in its visit headed by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and the Commission, and in taking whatever measures it can to deal with this crisis.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided approximately £9.5 million to the Great Lakes region since 1994 and the Supplementary Estimate of £1 million passed by the House yesterday will bring our total commitment this year alone to £4.75 million which, for a small nation, is a good contribution for the relief of this crisis.</P>
    <P>In addition to the humanitarian aid the Government has provided, with the approval of the Dáil, we have agreed to send our forces to the area to help keep the peace and to aid the distribution of humanitarian relief.  While we are all proud of the role Irish troops have played and continue to play in their many peacekeeping roles, we are also aware that the matter can only be settled locally by political means.  In that regard it is refreshing that the Heads of State in <Col N="1006" /> the region have already begun a process in respect of Burundi.  It is to be hoped that Julius Nyerere, who led the heads of state in this meeting, will go on to address the problem in the region and, with the aid of the international community, arrive at a comprehensive settlement. I am also glad the European Union is playing an important role in these discussions with the assistance of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton. The UN special envoy, Mr. Ajello, is also making a useful contribution to solving this problem.</P>
    <P>The international community has so far acted merely to alleviate the immediate suffering of the refugees.  We must now have some form of political viability in the area.  I am glad Ireland has been among the positive contributors, not alone financially but in helping people reach political settlements.  Major contributions have been made through the NGOs and the Government.  However, we must do more in cooperation with our European Union partners to encourage local dialogue and to demand that the international community concentrates on creating a political solution for the problems of the Great Lakes region.  As far back as last November, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs passed a resolution calling on the Government and the EU Presidency to take specific action.  With the guidance of the Minister of State we have responded collectively in a positive way to those people's needs.  I hope a political solution can be achieved quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.  The empty benches in the Chamber are a testimony to the difficulty in sustaining interest in an issue once it goes out of the headlines.</P>
      <P>I understand the frustration expressed by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on foreign affairs, Deputy Ray Burke, and by the Progressive Democrats spokesperson, Deputy O'Malley.  If they are disinclined to believe the version of events as told to them by the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and me, I encourage them to talk to the aid agencies such as Concern and Trócaire or to other members of their parties who have taken a detailed interest in this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be acknowledged that the Irish Government has prepared for the possibility of a crisis in the region, especially in Burundi.  We wanted the refugees to return home.  In preparing for our Presidency, we planned to have the capacity to respond as quickly as possible.  We did this by the troika visit I led to the region and by the various special meetings convened, including, for the first time, a special meeting of European development ministers with the head of the UNHCR, Mrs. Ogata, the heads of the DHA, the Red Cross, the World Food Programme and the head of UNICEF, Mrs. Bellamy.  The purpose was to produce a co-ordinated response as well as <Col N="1007" /> substantial monetary input by Ireland and other European Union countries on a bilateral basis and the European Union on a collective basis.  In terms of responding financially to crises, whether they be Bosnia, the Middle East or Africa, European Union countries are by far the largest contributors, individually and collectively, to the humanitarian needs these crises create.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination is needed.  So far, some of what has happened has given cause for hope.  In relative calm 550,000 refugees have, at this stage, returned to Rwanda.  We must provide the material sustenance which will see them through their first few months at home and provide funding for housing in dealing with this major political and humanitarian issue.  The Rwandan Government has allowed 15 days for people occupying houses to get out and make way for returning refugees.  Some of those occupying the houses are survivors of the genocide and some of those returning were involved in it.  It can be imagined how dreadfully stressful and complex this aspect of the emergency is.</P>
    <P>In terms of examining overall solutions to this problem, I am disappointed by the thinking of Deputy Ray Burke and Deputy O'Malley, especially as I would have regarded Fianna Fáil as a broadly anti-colonial party.  The essence of Africa's problems is that they must be dealt with by Africa, whatever the colonial legacy.  What happened in the 1870s and at the turn of the century in the follow-up to the Berlin Conference is known but most African countries have been independent for 20 to 30 years.  We may criticise the corruption and mismanagement which has affected independent African countries, but we also agree with the analysis of Deputy Lynch that some of this is as a result of colonial problems. The problems of Africa will only be dealt with if Africa takes responsibility and gives a lead.  To suggest that the European powers can simply apply a band-aid to a crisis of great proportions and do nothing else, no matter how well-intentioned that is, is to suggest a profoundly neocolonial approach.</P>
    <P>We should take the long road which is to work with African countries to evolve solutions they can broker and underwrite and to support those solutions with substantial and generous financial backing.  We should also adopt multilateral approaches to other problems such as African debt and effective access to European Union markets.  It is only by that broad approach, working with Africa rather than handing down solutions to it, that we will begin to emerge from this nightmare which has engulfed central Africa.</P>
    <P>Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire constitute a nightmare.  This is one of the most fertile parts of the world.  It looks like Killarney and has many small lakes except the mountains are capable of growing three crops per year.  It could be one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the world, but instead, it is a hell hole.  I spoke to an Irish person last night who had worked in <Col N="1008" /> Bukavu.  He spoke of one Zairean family which had been looted seven times by different sets of soldiers.  On the seventh time, they left their house and fled into the bush because they had nothing left.  If there is nothing left to give soldiers when they come, they kill the inhabitants. This is the reality facing families.</P>
    <P>The variety of Irish and international aid agencies working in the region are doing a tremendous job and are rightly widely respected for their hands-on practical approach which helps people get their lives back together and deals with the practicalities of problems.  The sight of the refugees walking back along the road, the sight of a mother with a baby on her back and a bundle on her head &mdash; all that she possesses, a water pot, a jerry can and mats on which to lie down &mdash; will stay with me for my life.  People are walking 50, 70, 100 miles over two and three days.</P>
    <P>At intervals of about 15 miles along the road Concern have put up tents like marquees, and large water tanks, so that people can stop for water.  Concern, with the government of Rwanda, had the foresight to start doing this about six weeks ago before the crisis really hit the headlines.  However, only about 200 lorries are available to the government, so most people walk, as they do in most of Africa.  They are capable of walking but I would be extremely worried about the physical condition of refugees, particularly those in eastern Zaire who have been out of camps for more than five weeks.  About 8,000 have crossed from Bukavu to Cyangugu in southern Rwanda in the past two weeks, and they are crossing at the rate of 700 a day at the moment; this route was opened within the past two weeks.  Those people are in a bad condition because they have been out on the road or in the forest for more than five weeks.  They badly need assistance, so when the international force gets there I hope that, whatever the generals do, they will get stuck in and help people who need water, blankets, receptacles for water, tools for planting and seeds.  The work is not glamorous but very practical.  I am delighted that Irish soldiers are going because wherever they have worked &mdash; the same goes for the Garda Síochána &mdash; people have complimented me on the sheer practicality they bring to their work.  They are prepared to go out and help local people and listen to them.</P>
    <P>In the Uvira area, which is further south, there are 220,000 refugees.  There has been much fighting here by rebel forces under Major Kabila. The Zairean army seems to be looting all around it.  Various factions in Burundi are also fighting a war.  There are 220,000 refugees in that area. There has been much focus on the issue of numbers.  A few weeks ago the UN claimed there were 750,000 refugees but most people felt that number was exaggerated.  Everyone now agrees that the correct number is about 350,000, give or take 10 per cent.  However, that is a huge number of people.  About 220,000 of them are between Uvira and Bukavu.  Currently the UNHCR is sending out teams to try to find these people, <Col N="1009" /> some of whom are not in good condition.  I hope the military force will be of practical assistance.</P>
    <P>I have spoken before of what is needed.  On the question of the arms trade, I agree that an enforceable code of conduct by the EU in relation to both arms sales and arms transfers is essential.  At the same time we should remember that, while one million people were killed in Rwanda in the genocide, most of that was with machetes, not with modern armaments. Neighbours killed neighbours with agricultural implements and machetes.  We have to not just look at the arms trade but also at how we can sponsor and foster reconciliation in Rwanda.  One of the critical elements in that is the justice system.  At the moment there are more than 90,000 prisoners in Rwandan jails, and the numbers are increasing.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the year when I was in Rwanda there were 50,000.  By the time I came back a few weeks ago the number had increased to just under 90,000.  The Irish Government and the Irish Aid programme have given substantial support to the government of Rwanda to rehabilitate the justice system.  We are supporting the Red Cross and Concern who are feeding the prisoners, and providing them with water and medical attention, but the jails are unbelievably crowded.  I had the doubtful pleasure of visiting three of them and, while conditions have improved, they are impossibly overcrowded.  We have encouraged the government of Rwanda to start the judicial system in relation to the prisoners in jail who are accused of genocide.  We are told that process will begin in mid-December, and that is good.  They have also introduced an element of the South Affrican system whereby people come forward to confess so that the trial process does not have to take an undue amount of time.</P>
    <P>I have been bitterly and deeply disappointed at the failure of the international tribunal in Arusha to bring to justice those who are guilty of planning the genocide.  Deputy Pat Gallagher spoke earlier about how the genocide did not accidentally happen.  Rather like the work of Goebbels in Nazi Germany, it was planned; it was based on hate propaganda produced on local radio.  It is extremely frustrating, and one of the greatest failures of the international justice system, that those who planned the killing of one million people, Tutsis and moderate Hutus are still at large, and some of them may even be in member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I saw today that Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as Secretary General of the UN, has suspended his campaign for re-election for the moment. Whoever becomes secretary general after Mr. Boutros-Ghali would really need a sense of urgency and commitment to having a proper international justice system and a permanent international criminal court.  Those soldiers that I spoke about last night, who are looting the area, have nothing to fear.  What tribunal will ever bring them to justice?  Unless there is a proper <Col N="1010" /> international justice system the people who are killing can continue to do so with impunity.  We need a political solution, but we also need a system that will bring to justice those who are guilty of atrocities in the Great Lakes area. Ireland, in supporting the justice system, is playing an important role in seeking to bring reconciliation between the different groups in Rwanda.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the privatisation of State companies; the State business, if any, he envisages as likely candidates for part or full flotation; if he favours any part-flotation of Telecom Éireann; his views on the recent interview on this subject by the chief executive of Telecom Éireann; and if he will make a statement of his policy outlook in relation to State businesses and CIÉ in particular in view of the fact that a major strike is looming.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23616/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to note that the last phrase of his question is redundant in that no major strike is looming.  I am pleased that issue has been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of privatisation, I would refer the Deputy to section 21 of the Government's programme for renewal, which clearly states that State assets will not be sold, except where it <Col N="1011" /> protects employment and is in the long-term strategic interest of the company and its stakeholders.  The programme also gives a commitment to the retention of a majority State ownership in these companies and to the encouragement of opportunities for expansion to utilise the banks of skills in those companies.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the proposed Telecom Éireann strategic alliance involving the sale of up to 35 per cent of the company, there are no plans to embark on a similar exercise in any of the other State companies under my control.</P>
    <P>As regards the views attributed to the chief executive of Telecom Éireann regarding the part flotation of the company, the chief executive seems to have in mind the possible flotation of all or part of the 15 per cent shareholding which the strategic partner has an option to purchase in three years' time, together with an entitlement to call for a subsequent public offering of all or part of such shares.  Such flotation, if it occurs, would be the basis for valuing all the shares sold to the alliance partners and determining the final payment for such shares.</P>
    <P>It would be a matter for the Government to decide if such a public offering included any of the Government's own shares, having regard to the provisions in the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, to retain a majority shareholding.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matter of general policy for State business, State bodies, as commercial companies, have to face dramatic challenges in an increasingly competitive environment. Furthermore, these commercial challenges will intensify over the coming years.  In facing such challenges, I am concerned to ensure that the State companies manage their operations in the best interests of employees, taxpayers and most importantly, consumers.  In short, I will be looking for State companies to become increasingly competitive, commercially orientated and customer focused.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's specific reference to Córas Iompair Éireann, with effect from 1997 it is proposed to replace the existing State subvention for socially necessary, noncommercial services with public service contracts which will be transparent, objective and performance-based.  It is clear from recent CIÉ financial results that the company's costs are very much out of line with its ability to generate revenue.  This issue needs to be addressed urgently by both management and unions within a fixed timeframe.  This is essential if the company is to be in a position to respond to increasing competition and EU-driven market liberalisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Minister's first policy statement, as I understand it, is to the effect that there are no plans for any further privatisations.  I had occasion to argue at length with his predecessor and the famous committee which comprised the Minister of State, <Col N="1012" /> Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and was aware of the policy concerning State companies and privatisation. That committee had a substantial input into whether or not there were privatisations.  Will the Minister clarify my understanding of his policy statement that, other than Telecom, he has no plans to dispose of any shares in any other State company?  Is that the Minister's policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to clarify the Deputy's understanding, either to expand or to broaden it. I have stated what Government policy is, that State assets will not be sold except where it protects employment and is in the long-term interest of the company and its stakeholders.  I have mentioned the other case which is going on at present and I have said there are now no plans in relation to any other State company.  If, however, a situation were to arise where it appeared to be in the interest of protecting employment in the long-term strategic interest of another company and in the interest of the stakeholder to embark on a similar kind of process with any other company, I would be prepared to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister does not see any such circumstances arising.  His position as of now, unless something arises, is that he has no plans for any further privatisations in the State sector.  That is an important policy statement in view of the Minister's background and some of his previous statements.  Many of the State companies will be interested in whether the Minister has any privatisation plans for the future.  I am being told there are no such plans unless some circumstances arise, as happened in Telecom Éireann, in which case he would consider it.  As I see it now the Minister has no plans for privatisation.</P>
      <P>The chief executive of Telecom Éireann has been quoted as saying he would like to see Telecom customers owning an equity stake in the company and the easiest way to bring this about would be to float a percentage of the company. He said it was reasonable to assume that that would happen within three years.  I realise he is speaking about the shares held by the Dutch and the Swedes but is it fair that the shares about to be held by the Dutch and the Swedes in Telecom Éireann, which could not be held by Irish people, should be sold off in this manner, even within three years?  Does the Minister agree with the chief executive that a flotation is likely within three years?  Is it fair that the people who have bought in at a ridiculously low price should now be thinking about selling out that share at a windfall profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that people bought in for a ridiculously low price.  The Deputy knows perfectly well we do not yet know the price because all the circumstances that go into <Col N="1013" /> determining that price have not come about.  As pointed out in my reply, it seems the chief executive had in mind the possible flotation of all or part of that 15 per cent shareholding which the strategic partner would have an option to purchase.  If the Deputy needs any more information about what the chief executive had in mind I suggest he ask the chief executive who is perfectly entitled to have his views on the matter.  When he has views on the matter I will be delighted to hear them.  No such flotation could take place without the Government deciding it because the Government has to decide, not anybody else.</P>

      <P>The strike at CIÉ, which has thankfully been averted, was threatened because CIÉ did not want to pay the 2.5 per cent <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> award. Does the Minister agree that the management of CIÉ, in making a stand on not paying an award which is an agreed figure between workers and management in a national agreement, was extremely provocative and appeared to be engineering a dispute and wasting the time of everyone concerned?  Does the Minister agree that CIÉ management should have agreed to pay the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> in the first place and not engineered this artificial crisis?</P>

I am glad the agreement of the two groups to accept that decision has averted what would have been a damaging strike for everybody concerned.</P>

      <Quest>the effect, if any, of the EU Commission decision to refuse a request from Telecom Éireann for a derogation on alternative networks for business calls and international mobile call connections until 1999 and its decision to review Telecom Éireann's control of Cablelink; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23510/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>One of my first tasks will be to ensure that the Telecom Éireann strategic alliance deal is brought to a successful conclusion in the near future.  This deal represents an excellent outcome to the search for a partner for Telecom Éireann. It is good for the Irish consumer and Irish business and represents excellent value in terms of both the strategic benefits which Telecom Éireann will receive and in terms of cash value which, it is anticipated, will produce overall proceeds in excess of £500 million.</P>
      <P>The principal features of the deal, in terms of its strategic and operational merit and the purchase price, were made public at the time of the signing of the deal in July, through numerous debates in this House and in the media.  It is, therefore, not my intention to repeat them today. Deputy Brennan must accept, however, that certain aspects of this deal are commercially sensitive and must remain confidential.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recent Commission decision on Ireland's derogation, this is a successful outcome and in line with the Government's strategic objective for the telecommunications sector.  The decision strikes a balance between the needs of telecommunications consumers, who will soon start to see greater choice, higher quality and lower prices, and the need to secure a period of transition in which Telecom Éireann can make the necessary structural changes for successful operation in a competitive market.</P>
      <P>The strategic alliance agreement includes a condition that a derogation be secured from the need to liberalise voice telephony and the supporting public infrastructure until 1 January 2000.  The Commission decision enables the Government to fulfil this condition.  Telecom Éireann's strategic partners accept the decision and are committed, in partnership with Telecom, to meeting the challenge of the earlier liberalisation date for alternative infrastructure which is now proposed.</P>
      <P>This part of the Commission's decision does not change the existing situation in relation to business telecommunications traffic, contrary to what has been widely reported.  The July 1997 date for liberalisation of alternative networks permits these networks to carry liberalised traffic only but not voice telephony traffic which is reserved for Telecom Éireann under the same derogation decision until 1 January 2000.  The voice telephony reservation does not make any distinction between business calls and any other voice calls which are originated and delivered over switched networks open to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> Finally, it is to be expected that, as part of the review of large transactions of this type, the EU Commission will examine all aspects of the deal and this obviously includes issues arising from Telecom Éireann's majority ownership of Cablelink in the context of the alliance.  This is standard procedure and I am confident that clearance for the deal will be received in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not respond to the first part of my question which was if he had any plans to review the transactions which were undertaken by his predecessor.  Perhaps he would respond to it.  There are three areas which I thought he might review.  The first is the Esat second mobile telephone licence.  We still do not know the full list of investors in that project and, despite repeated questions, I could not prise the information from the previous Minister.  Will the new Minister release the names of all the investors in Esat?  To my knowledge, they have not been put before the House.</P>
      <P>The second deal that might be reviewed is the £20 million deal to lease Moneypoint to Americans who would lease it back to the ESB. I asked the previous Minister about the deal.  He said he brought the deal to Cabinet where it was approved.  When I asked him who were the members of the consortium he said it was a US trust and that he was not privy to its membership. Will the Minister get information on the members of this US trust, which now has a hold on Moneypoint, and release it?</P>
      <P>On the same theme of departmental secrecy, a contract was signed on 26 July to sell a stake in Telecom Éireann at what I and most independent commentators regard as a scandalously low price. Will the Minister release the documentation of 26 July, which includes the contract and other details of that deal, so Members can see exactly what is involved?  The Minister should adopt a different attitude from that of his predecessor to the three deals I have mentioned.  He should release the names of those involved in the Moneypoint deal, the names of those involved in Esat and the contract to sell 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann so the House can evaluate whether the deals are good or bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Brennan wished to ask a question about Esat and Moneypoint he should have said so.  I have no intention of looking at all the decisions made by my predecessor and proceeding to unpick them.  My very good friend, the late Deputy Frank Cluskey, once said to me when we were about to make a difficult decision and he wanted to be sure that the decision was necessary: &ldquo;You would want to be sure about this because you do not go through hell just for practice&rdquo;.  I have no intention of going through hell just for practice.  If the Deputy thinks I will blaze into the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, unpick everything I find <Col N="1016" /> and put it all back together in a way that pleases him, he is mistaken.  If I did so, I would be making a terrible hash of this job.  I invite the Deputy to put down specific questions about East and Moneypoint.</P>
      <P>With regard to the publication of details, I am aware that the Deputy and my predecessor discussed this matter at length.  My predecessor told the Deputy, as I reiterate today, that there are aspects of the deal which must remain confidential for good, solid commercial reasons. Agreements and understandings were reached with the partners, before the deal was completed, requiring such confidentiality.  The Deputy is aware that if we went back on such undertakings it would set an extremely bad precedent and would be bad for the deal itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is proper, as a matter of principle, that when the State sells a national asset such as a second mobile telephone licence, the beneficial shareholders in that licence should be known to his Department, the Government and to the Oireachtas before a decision is made to approve the sale?  Is the Minister aware that 20 per cent of the second mobile telephone licence was awarded to a consortium which contained a group under IIU Nominees Limited, a company owned by Mr. Dermot Desmond?</P>
      <P>That company had not put its money in place at the time the contract was awarded, which meant it had a contract without having to advance any funds.  It furnished a list of potential investors to the Department.  The Secretary of the Department was quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 20 April 1996 as having said that the investors in the 20 per cent stake in that nominee company would be drawn from the list of potential investors furnished.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think it right and proper that the names of those investors should now be withheld from the public?  Will he publish them? In view of recent events, when an alleged improper association between his predecessor and certain businessmen here &mdash; who, in other allegations, are said to have sought to have an opportunity to invest in this licence &mdash; was highlighted in the national papers, does the Minister not consider it would have been correct, at the outset, to have made the names of beneficial shareholders available to the public? Will he publish the list of potential investors which the Secretary of his Department said he had from which those investors will be drawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>While allegations on the last matter adverted to by Deputy Molloy have been flying around the last few days, it has been made very clear, certainly yesterday if not before, that there is absolutely no foundation for one of them. Deputy Molloy is just as capable of reading and understanding that as I am.  I am astonished he would try to sidle crabwise into that old allegation <Col N="1017" /> knowing, as well as I do, that there is absolutely no truth in it.</P>
      <P>In this case, of course I agree that as much information as possible should be made available to the public.  The Government was acting as the stakeholder on behalf of the electorate and set out to get the best deal consistent with its objectives.  In any commercial transaction, there will be a requirement for an element of confidentiality, which certainly exists in this case. My predecessor made the maximum possible amount of information available without trespassing on confidentiality in a manner that would have rendered the deal more difficult. Deputies will have to accept that assurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some confusion appears to have arisen here.  We are talking about the mobile telephone licence and the fact that the Minister's predecessor was unable to give the House the list of investors; a major contract was awarded, yet the investors' names remain unknown.  While fully appreciating that the Minister has been only a couple of days in his Department &mdash; and, to paraphrase him, he does not want to go through hell voluntarily &mdash; I am endeavouring to probe his attitude to his portfolio.  Is it one of releasing basic information relating to investors in Esat, those in the Moneypoint deal, whom I understand were substantially Americans, although Cypriots were involved, and the Telecom Éireann contract, all of which are not commercially sensitive?  Has he, as the new Minister, a different attitude from his predecessor to releasing this information?  If his attitude is the same, that is fair enough, we shall have to deal with the matter on the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor's attitude to these matters was perfectly justified, balanced and in accordance with the needs of the circumstances. I do not intend to take a different line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary of the Department at a press conference on 19 April last said that the list from which potential investors in the 20 per cent stake in the Dermot Desmond nominee company would be drawn was handed to and known by his Department.  Subsequently a contract was awarded and, this week, the Secretary of his Department informed me that the 20 per cent stake in that IIU nominee company, owned by Dermot Desmond, was owned solely and exclusively by Dermot Desmond.  Will the Minister explain that contradiction and why those names are being withheld?  Surely he now recognises the importance of making their names known to testify that no improper associations existed?</P>

      <P>I am disappointed to hear the Minister stand over the decision of his predecessor, not to release the information on Esat, Moneypoint or the contract for the sale of 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not adopt the position that at least he would re-examine those matters.  Within such a short time in office, I am disappointed he has taken the view that these three contracts or documents must remain secret.</P>
      <P>In regard to the sale of 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann &mdash; since the initial contract was signed on 26 July last, and I am aware of the political toing and froing about price, the bottom line is that £183 million was paid by two foreign companies that will bring little to Telecom Éireann, in addition to their getting a 20 per cent share in Eircell and Cablelink, whereas proportionately other companies worldwide have been sold recently at nine or ten times the price obtained by Telecom Éireann &mdash; does the Minister agree that clearly it is a really bad deal? Even at this late stage will he re-examine the contract from a price and quality point of view and the fact that no Irish investor is allowed while Dutch and Swedish investors can do so?  Is the Minister prepared to stand over that position, bearing in mind that the Dutch Stock Exchange can buy shares in Telecom Éireann while no Irish person can obtain a single share?  Is the Minister really closing his mind to that now critical position since the contract will have been finalised within a few months?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he favours putting the city centre part of the Dublin light rail underground in view of traffic chaos in Dublin city and the fact that the Luas plans were drawn up on the basis of car traffic projections which are out of date.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23619/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have followed with interest the debate which has taken place on light rail during the public consultation process.  That debate has been both useful and enlightening but I hope the time is now ripe to move on to the decision-making phase.  The CIÉ project team should be given the time and space to complete its consideration of the issues raised during the consultation process and to decide on the detailed shape and form of its formal application for a light railway order to construct the Tallaght to Dundrum line.</P>
      <P>The Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, provides for full and effective public involvement in the statutory decision-making process.  People will be able to make written objections to the formal CIÉ proposals.  A mandatory public inquiry will be held which will provide the forum for an open, independent, robust and objective scrutiny of the CIÉ proposals, during which people will be able to make oral submissions on matters of concern to them.</P>
      <P>Before I make a decision on CIÉ's application for the necessary powers, I will be obliged to take account of the inspector's report on the public inquiry and any written submissions made to me. I do not intend to prejudice my eventual decision on the CIÉ application by commenting on detailed issues relating to the light rail proposal. I will weigh all these matters carefully in the light of the evidence placed before me in my quasi-judicial capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That amazing reply is clearly the start of a most welcome U-turn.  I asked the Minister if he favoured putting the city centre part of the Dublin light rail underground and he said it was time to move on to the decision-making phase.  The Minister of State and Deputy Lowry repeatedly told me in the House that I was holding up the process by proposing that the <Col N="1022" /> centre city part of the Dublin light rail should be put underground, that there was a fundamental difference between me and them on this point and that a study on my proposal would be a waste of time.  The Minister said he would await a submission from CIÉ before deciding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I might get the Deputy thinking. There are several more stages to be gone through and all of the submissions which can conceivably be made can be made to the public inquiry &mdash; they will all have to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>On the questions of CIÉ, I invite the Deputy to consider what I said, that is the CIÉ project team should be given the time and space to decide on the detailed shape and form of its formal application for a light railway order.  This is entirely a matter for the project team.  Once the application is made I will have to consider it. There must also be a public inquiry.  There is plenty of room in this process to explore all these issues.  At the end of the day it will fall to me, in my quasi-judicial capacity, to make a decision on these matters.  It would be wrong of me to prejudice, prejudge or pre-empt any decision I might make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a clear change of policy by the Cabinet of whom Deputy Lowry was a member.  The Minister's predecessor was adamant that the city centre part of Luas should be overground and thought that anyone who took a different view was living in the past and trying to delay setting up the system.  The Minister will wait until the options are put to him before deciding, in his quasi-judicial capacity, on whether the city centre part of Luas should be put underground.  I welcome this change of heart by the Minister as I am in favour of putting this part of Luas underground if we can afford it.</P>
      <P>The only study on the possibility of putting part of Luas underground has been carried out by CIÉ consultants.  I have asked that an independent study on the cost of the underground option for Dublin city centre be carried out quickly.  Will the Minister commission a quick study, independent of CIÉ, on the possibility of putting this part of Luas underground in view of the horrendous traffic problems in the city centre?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the priorities for the Irish Presidency in respect of all sectors, including transport, energy and communications, were published at the commencement of the Irish Presidency and are available in the Dáil Library.  While no specific proposals were put forward on behalf of Ireland by my Department, a number of proposals, at EU level, were put forward during the Irish Presidency which impact on the citizens of the European Union as a whole in the areas of transport, energy and communications.</P>
      <P>In regard to transport proposals, the Irish Presidency sought to focus on the development of a more efficient, competitive, safe, environmentally friendly and customer orientated European transport system.  In this context, the Presidency is pursuing the development of an action plan in response to the European Commission's White Paper for revitalising the Community's railways.  We also seek to promote the orderly development of relations in the transport sector with third countries.  In the aviation sector, it is expected that the Council of Transport Ministers on 12 December next will arrive at some conclusions as to the way forward for air traffic management in Europe, and that a common position will be achieved on the draft regulation on air carrier liability in case of accidents.  There are also significant developments in regard to relations with third countries such as central and eastern European countries and on a possible EU-US common aviation area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the energy sector, the Irish Presidency had three priorities &mdash; the draft directive concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas, an EU strategy for renewable energy and the energy dimension of climate change.  At the Energy Council on 3 December agreement was reached on Council conclusions on natural gas. These conclusions reflect the considerable <Col N="1024" /> progress made during the Irish Presidency on this issue within a very short time, including the drafting of a Presidency compromise proposal, and give guidance as to how the issue will be progressed by the incoming Netherlands Presidency.  On renewable energy, the Irish Presidency put considerable pressure on the Commission to produce an EU strategy on renewables.  The optimum exploitation of Europe's renewable energy resources can happen only within the framework of a clear and supportive strategy that will vigorously promote renewables.  I am pleased that, as a result of our efforts, the Commission presented to Council a Green Paper on an EU strategy for renewables. This was generally supported by member states as an important development.  The Commission will now consult widely within the EU on the paper before preparing a detailed strategy.  On the question of climate change, the Presidency took an initiative to highlight the important role which energy has to play in the context of CO 2 objectives after the year 2000, and the negotiations currently under way for a legally binding Protocol on climate change.  This was an important initiative in that it placed the climate change issue on the agenda of EU Energy Ministers and highlighted the special contribution they can make in encouraging appropriate response strategies that will underpin and help deliver future climate change objectives.</P>
    <P>As regards communications, the priority for the Irish Presidency has been to achieve the maximum progress on the package of legislative proposals put forward by the Commission to ensure the development of a transparent, regulatory framework to promote effective competition in a liberalised telecommunications market and to introduce the first step towards liberalisation of the postal sector.  Ireland's Presidency did of course necessitate the development of compromise proposals particularly in the postal area with a view to reaching agreement within the Council.  Progress has been achieved through the adoption of common positions on a draft Directive relating to a harmonised licensing framework for telecommunications, a draft decision on satellite personal communications services and a revision of the open network provision framework and leased lines directives.  The Irish Presidency also achieved political orientation on some of the main principles of a draft directive relating to the provision of harmonised voice telephony services and universal service throughout the European Union and has clearly identified political positions of member states on the difficult questions of the first step towards liberalisation of the postal sector.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that is an excellent record of achievement for the Presidency.</P>

      <P>It is obvious from the Minister's reply that we have not taken an initiative on transport, energy and communications during the Presidency.  We are basically managing proposals put forward by EU bureaucrats.  Having regard to our geographic location, the expertise available in the Irish Aviation Authority and our accident free record, we could have made a major contribution to aviation matters.  We also missed an opportunity to ensure an equal delivery of energy services to all parts of the country.  On the communication side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It will also provide for a density of contact points adequate to the needs of users.  It is expected to measure up to one of the qualities which most of us believe is essential for a postal service, to which the Deputy correctly adverted.</P>

I was available to participate in that debate, but was not afforded an opportunity to do so because of a time limit. As a Member who had to go to the back benches and was not always afforded an opportunity to participate in debates, the Minister should understand that it is not always possible to participate in debates.  That was an ungracious remark from him in his first week in office. Despite that, I wish him well in office and, for the sake of the country, I hope he is successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister referred to density of population for the delivery of postal services, he appears to be talking about a semi-urban <Col N="1026" /> environment for the delivery of an equitable service.  Can he assure the House, on behalf of the Government which holds the EU Presidency, that there will not be a diminution of postal services to the people of rural Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>I understand my predecessor's recent meeting with the board of Aer Rianta ranged over the key current issues in the airports sector.</P>
      <P>My predecessor told the board that while charges at the country's three main airports compare favourably with charges elsewhere in Europe, the more important question was whether, in the circumstances of growth in passengers and revenues at Irish airports, especially Dublin, Aer Rianta could not be even more competitive on airport charges.  He asked the board to consider that issue.</P>
      <P>With reference to the profit base of Aer Rianta, my predecessor went on to acknowledge that as things stand, the abolition of duty-free facilities on intra-European Union flights from mid-1999 would impact substantially on Aer Rianta's bottom line.  He also pointed out that, whether or not duty free goes, he would always urge Aer Rianta to so conduct its business strategies as to make prudent provision for necessary renewal of airport assets into the future without recourse to the Exchequer.  He urged the board to examine how it could compensate for much of the potential revenue losses from the abolition of duty-free facilities by a combination of increased cost efficiencies and new business strategies.</P>
      <P>The Minister also informed the board that he had obtained Government approval for the drafting of a Bill to change the anachronistic status of Aer Rianta from that of agent of the Minister to that of a normal commercial State body.  The drafting work is now in hands and the Bill is a priority in my Department's substantial legislative programme.  The new legislation will have the effect of transferring ownership of Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports from the State to Aer Rianta.  My predecessor stressed this development, and the resulting increase in Aer Rianta's commercial autonomy, would call for a review of the present airports' regulatory regime. The whole business environments today, in both the private and commercial public sectors, demands clear and transparent regulatory arrangements independent of ownership.  This is particularly necessary where, notwithstanding the generally increased competitive environment, virtual monopolies such as Dublin Airports would remain in place.</P>
      <P>An important part of my predecessor's overall message to the board was that new business opportunities, organically linked to the core business, should continue to be exploited, both to anticipate possible duty-free abolition and more generally to assist in discharging the company's essential mandate from the shareholder to keep Irish air access costs as low as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor stressed that, in any proposals for developing new business, the board should balance two principal considerations: on the one hand, the new opportunities that may be presented, assuming a valid business case can be <Col N="1028" /> made and on the other, the need to ensure that any such new opportunity is not at the expense of the primary focus of the board and management which, of course, must continue to be on the proper management and development of Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports.</P>
    <P>I have outlined for the House the main points my predecessor made to the Aer Rianta board at his recent meeting.  I have considered these points and I can endorse them as a general statement of the policies I will follow in relation to Aer Rianta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the monopoly is to stay in place.  Did the questions of private sector investment in airports arise at the meeting with his predecessor or during his preparation for dealing with these questions?  I refer to the proposal from Ryanair to develop Baldonnel and the proposal from another group to use a runway in Dublin Airport to provide an alternative type of airport system.  Has the Minister had time to consider either of those proposals?  What would be his general philosophy on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware there was any discussion of those issues between my predecessor and the board of Aer Rianta on the occasion that is the subject of the question.  I have had only a very brief opportunity to consider the second of the proposals to which the Deputy referred which is under close examination in my Department.  I will reflect further on it as that work progresses.  It would be wrong to say I have not had any discussion on the first proposal.  It has come up in conversation but not as a primary matter of investigation.  It seems the vigour behind the proposal is a good deal less than it seemed to be originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that proposal another time.  I take it the Minister wants time to discuss it.  I sense he has an open mind about it and I will wait to see what happens.</P>
      <P>How vigorously is the Government trying to defend the retention of the duty-free facility?  I remind the Minister that the Minister for Finance recently failed to get his European ministerial colleagues to agree to put a study in place to examine the effects of the loss of the duty-free facility.  Given his good but nevertheless unsuccessful attempt, how confident is the Minister that the duty-free facility will be retained or could he put a date on when it might be abolished?  What battle will he put up to retain that facility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, although the duty-free facility affects very considerably a number of the companies that come within my ambit, so to speak, it is a matter which falls to be decided by the Ministers for Finance.  The Minister for Finance recently revived the issue at a meeting of the ECOFIN Council and found there was no support among any of the other <Col N="1029" /> member states at that point for a review of a decision that has so far been taken that would lead to the ending of the duty-free facility on the target date set.  That situation was a little surprising in that one had expected a more supportive reaction from some other member states which, for their own reasons, seem to have decided not to maintain the position they had previously taken in relation to duty-free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Question No. 6, Aer Rianta is bidding for contracts all over the world.  I appreciate it is early days for the Minister, but I would like to establish today, if possible, some of his general approaches to policy issues.  Is he of the same view as his predecessor, that State companies like Aer Rianta should stick to their knitting as opposed to spreading their wings?  Which of those schools of thought does the Minister support?  The Minister's predecessor appeared to support the &ldquo;stick to their knitting&rdquo; school and lectured State companies regularly about that.  It would be useful if the Minister told us in regard to Question No. 6 his general approach to that matter.  Does he want State companies to stick to their core business or to expand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be mistaken if he presents the choices as being either that they should stick to their core business or expand. There are companies which can stick to their core business and expand at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant diversify.  Should that company stick to its core business of landing aeroplanes at Dublin Airport or should it diversify to Australia to run an airport which it is presently seeking to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that at some length in my original answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be tedious and read it again.  I said that my predecessor in his discussion with the board, and I agree with his view, stressed that in any proposals for developing new business, the board should balance two principal considerations: on the one hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the new business opportunities that may be presented, assuming a valid business case can be made and, on the other, the need to ensure that any such new opportunity is not at the expense of the primary focus of the board and management, which must continue to be on the proper management of the three airports in the care of Aer Rianta at present.  The Deputy agrees that we would not wish diversification at the <Col N="1030" /> expense of the proper running of the core business of the company.  My expectation of the management of Aer Rianta is that they would not come forward with a proposal that would diversify at the expense of their core business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate Deputy Dukes on his appointment as Minister.  As far as diversification is concerned, I am delighted to see the Great Southern Hotel developing at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>With nearly 20 million people unemployed in the EU and given that the abolition of duty free will put a further 140,000 people out of work in the EU, does the Minister agree that this is no more than intellectual purity for the Eurocrats?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, is the Minister aware that the abolition of duty free will put some 300 people at Dublin Airport out of work, recording a loss of £60 million in turnover in Dublin Airport alone? Given that the Minister said: &ldquo;Possible duty free abolition and whether or not duty free goes&rdquo;, could he outline what he can do to ensure this decision can be overturned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concerns about the effects of ending the duty free facility. I am disappointed at how this has evolved.  It is now almost 20 years since the abolition of those facilities was only a gleam in the eye of bureaucrats in the Commission in Brussels.  I regret that the contagion seems to have spread and that it is now a view held by many Governments in the EU.  Last month, the Minister for Finance endeavoured to bring the question of duty free back into discussion with a view to encouraging other States to taking a different view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>He got a very muted response but he will bring the issue up again.  There is some time before it comes into effect on 1 July 1999 and the Minister for Finance should have opportunities to encourage other countries to maintain the facility.  For all its intellectual purity, <Col N="1031" /> as the Deputy put it, it is much loved by the travelling public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Minister is reported to have urged the board of Aer Rianta to reduce airport charges further.  Will the Minister agree that one of the effects of reducing charges in Dublin might be that instead of winning extra business from elsewhere it might reduce business in Cork and Shannon and increase the need for infrastructural change in Dublin?  It could have the effect of reducing the overall level of income to Aer Rianta, which would be clearly damaging. In relation to capital works at Shannon, will the Minister give an undertaking, as his predecessors did, that if it cannot be paid for by profits from Shannon, it will paid for by the company?  That will be extremely important.  I wish the Minister well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor asked Aer Rianta if they could not be even more competitive on airport charges at all their airports than they are already.  The level of charges at our three main airports compares very favourably with charges elsewhere.  I would not expect Aer Rianta to come forward with a proposal that would reduce its overall revenue.  If there were a proposal to reduce charges, the objective should be to increase business overall at the airports.</P>
      <P>My predecessor also urged Aer Rianta to conduct its business strategies to make prudent and proper provision for the necessary renewal of airport assets in future without recourse to the Exchequer.  That policy would apply generally to the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The steering group in question was set up in December last year by my predecessor and by my colleague Deputy Kenny, Minister for Tourism and Trade to look at the issue of Ireland-US access.  The group comprises senior officials from both Departments, Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte.  A report has been prepared by the Group and has been submitted to both myself and the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  It is not the intention to publish this report as it contains <Col N="1032" /> sensitive market research and other commercial information.</P>
      <P>In summary, the report of the Steering Group has highlighted priority US points to target, the importance of a strong and developing Aer Lingus presence in the market and the various strategies which should be pursued in considering approaches to US airlines.  The group also stressed the need for ongoing review of its work having regard to the fluid nature of the aviation world.</P>
      <P>During its work, the group commissioned research on the Ireland-US market which looked at major US gateway airports, transatlantic traffic flows, hub strategies of major US airlines, the major carriers at the different gateways, overall airline development strategies, etc.  Bord Fáilte also carried out an examination of the performance of nine US regions in terms of tourism to Ireland, on the basis of traffic to the UK and Europe, degrees of Irish ethnicity, and measure of potential &mdash; future intention to travel &mdash; revealed in a recent major US research study.</P>
      <P>The State agencies involved also met a number of US airlines to ascertain their interest in and plans, if any, for the Irish market.  While certain US airlines have expressed general interest in the Irish market, none of the airlines approached has indicated any firm proposals to inaugurate new services to Ireland.</P>

It has, as the Minister is aware, its final report since last March and there is no indication of any benefit flowing from the intensive studies it is reported to have undertaken.  Copies are not to be made available to us but I accept that.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of a lot of complaints in the tourism industry at the lack of access from the southern and south eastern States of the US to the Irish market and that there is an unwelcome trend in the way in which the growth in tourism is more evident on the east coast than on the west coast.</P>

Decisions have to be made on foot of those recommendations by those <Col N="1033" /> involved, principally the airlines.  As the Deputy knows, the development of new services generally do not happen quickly.  While certain US airlines expressed a general interest in the Irish market, none of the airlines approached has firm proposals to inaugurate new services.

Should we not also be concerned?  What stance will the Minister take? Will it reflect the views expressed here or will he <Col N="1034" /> go along with what the majority decides?  Given the level of rural depopulation and the importance of primary services to rural communities, will he give us an assurance that these proposals would not lead to job losses or a reduction in services in rural areas?

      <P>After the heady business of the past few days, I wish to raise a practical matter with the Minister, that is, the need for a physical education/assembly hall for St. Michael's secondary school, Finglas.  It is a large girls secondary school with over 800 pupils from my constituency.  Some pupils come from areas experiencing high levels of disadvantage in terms of education and social infrastructure.  Despite that, St. Michael's secondary school has a well deserved reputation for excellence in the provision of all aspects of education and the formation of the young people in its care. However, this work is hindered by the absence of a large space in which they can engage in the many activities other schools that have such a facility can.  Assemblies, concerts and physical <Col N="1037" /> education activities are inhibited by the absence of a hall.</P>
      <P>I have been contacted not only by present staff, pupils and parents, but by past pupils.  Schools are often the focus for ongoing interest in terms of sporting activities.  This year the local people decided to engage in a concerted campaign to address this inadequacy which has gone on for too long and to raise matching funds.  We hope the Department will give the go ahead for the provision of this facility in this financial year.  I invite Ministers and Ministers of State to visit the school to see the tiny space in which the school must provide a full range of activities for 800 young women.  No more young women should be deprived of basic facilities in a modern school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this practical matter.  The authorities of St. Michael's secondary school, Finglas, formally applied for a PE hall for the school in December 1995.  The application was examined in terms of enrolments, future viability and cost implications and the school authorities were notified that due to demands for urgently needed classroom accommodation the project would not proceed at this time.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide physical education facilities on a phased basis at all second level schools where such facilities are not already available.  However, my Department has before it at present a large number of applications for second level school building projects involving the provision of urgently needed classroom accommodation in addition to a large number of applications for sports facilities.</P>
      <P>As the capital allocation to the Department is not adequate to meet all these demands, available financial resources must be reserved for the provision of essential classroom accommodation and emergency works.  My Department's planning and building unit incorporates physical education facilities and changing areas into the schedule of accommodation for new schools and for major extensions to schools which do not have such accommodation.  In the 1996 capital programme it was found possible to make provision for the architectural planning of PE halls.  The further progress of these projects is now being considered.  The provision of PE facilities at schools which do not have such accommodation will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for classroom accommodation has eased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also administers a sports capital programme.  In general, school projects are not eligible for funding under either the major sports capital programme or the recreation facilities scheme.  However, a limited number of school sports facilities have been assisted under the schemes where the project is being undertaken by a local community group in co-operation with a school.  One of the conditions attaching to this scheme is that the completed <Col N="1038" /> facility must be available to all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I and the Minister are aware of the requirements of St. Michael's secondary school in relation to the provision of physical education facilities.  However, as I already stated, the provision of such PE facilities will resume only when pressure on available resources for classroom accommodation has eased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the ongoing impasse in the dispute in County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee which affects the payments of grants to third level students.  The trade dispute among the administrative staff of Westmeath Vocational Education Committee has been ongoing for some time and as a result up to this week a considerable number of third level students attending colleges throughout the country are unable to get access to their sanctioned grants.  I am sure the concerns of the staff are legitimate and my exercise tonight is not to castigate them for making their demand but to ask the Minister to ensure there is direct intervention to have the impasse resolved.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough that a large number of third level students, many of whom are from homes with a financial disadvantage, are left without their grants.  I have spoken to some of the students involved and, in many cases, to their parents who cannot continue to fund their children, who in turn cannot continue in college. While this school term has virtually come to an end, the dispute is allowed to fester.  In my experience in the Department of Education I never witnessed an incident such as this, with the adoption of a prolonged non-interventionist approach to what is a decidedly difficult situation for many families.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister and Department officials to make a determined effort to intervene in the dispute to ensure the difficult circumstances in which many students find themselves are alleviated and the grants are paid before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this issue and I thank the Minister and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to do so.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan is sent in to reply to an agriculture debate it usually means bad news, but he is a good, solid man who is able to deliver it.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, who is in hiding, has refused to give important information on issues of serious concern.  The questions I raised relate to quantities of output by meat and bonemeal plants &mdash; Questions Nos. 267 and 268 of 3 December 1996 &mdash; the building of a facility to deal with slaughterhouse waste &mdash; Question No. 253 of 3 December 1996 &mdash; the proposals made by the Minister for reform of the headage payment system &mdash; Question No.274 of 3 December 1996 &mdash; and transport arrangements for the transport of live animals &mdash; Questions Nos. 257 and 258 of 3 December 1996.  The Minister's refusal to disclose vital information on a number of key issues threatens to undermine public confidence. Having famously said too much on a previous occasion, his new strategy is to sing dumb.  The Minister has apparently taken a vow of oral rectitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeatedly asked the Minister to disclose the amounts of meat and bonemeal produced by the nine operating plants.  Although he has the information and concedes that no law or agreement precludes him from disclosing it, he <Col N="1040" /> will not give the figures sought.  It is the Minister's opinion that meat and bonemeal fed since the 1990 ban is a cause of BSE.  I was told yesterday that it is legal to feed meat and bonemeal for white meat.  How are activities monitored on a farm that produces white meat and cattle?  Does the Minister consider it possible that meat and bonemeal held on a farm where cattle are reared could be fed to the cattle?  I note the Minister of State's disinterest in this issue.  How much meat and bonemeal has been produced and where did it go?  What is the Minister covering up and why? His arrogance in arrogating to himself information which the public has an unequivocal right to know shows contempt for consumer rights.  The culture of secrecy at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is in no danger as long as Deputy Yates is Minister.</P>
    <P>This is not the only issue on which Minister Yates has clammed up.  Regarding a report drawn up for the Government on the viability of a national incinerator to deal with diseased herds, the Minister stated it was &ldquo;not anticipated&rdquo; that the report would be published.  The building of a national incinerator is an important issue.  That report should be made public and there must be a public debate on it.</P>
    <P>On the important question of reform of the headage payments system, the Minister has repeatedly refused to disclose his proposals.  This issue is at the core of the future of farm incomes. Elderly farmers are particularly concerned about speculation that headage payments will be withheld from those over the age of 65.  It is extraordinary that the future livelihoods of 160,000 farm families are being negotiated in secret behind their backs.  What exactly is Minister Yates hiding?</P>
    <P>The Minister's belated reticence also extends to the export of live animals.  The regulations he introduced for the transport of livestock have severely affected the trade.  The number of boats in operation has more than halved.  When asked to disclose the true position the Minister again refused.  His refusal to disclose the names of recipients of licences under the new regulations is a farce.  The issuing of licences is a public matter and must be fully transparent.</P>
    <P>Following the BSE and antibiotic residue débâcles the Minister promised to ensure openness in his Department.  He promised that information would be given to the public as soon as it was available to him.  It is now apparent that nothing has changed.  The same discredited culture of secrecy and arrogance is being operated by Minister Yates.  His continuing failure to face down vested interests and deal with issues openly risks a repeat of the crisis that has almost wrecked the farming and food industries.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply to this matter and I apologise to him for not being here at the appropriate time.  It was late when I received the message that it would be taken earlier.</P>
      <P>I want to make my position clear on this agreement which we are told is imminent.  I congratulate the Garda Commissioner on his initiative in negotiating this deal &mdash; we do not have the full details and I look forward to getting those in the House at some stage &mdash; which I understand will assist the Garda Communications network and meet the objections raised to the erection of these telecommunications masts around the country.</P>
      <P>My concern in raising this matter relates to the fact that the proposal to put East Digifone transmitters on Garda masts is in direct conflict to guidelines issued in July by the Minister for the Environment.  In regard to the sharing of facilities and clustering, the guidelines specifically state: &ldquo;Support structures used by emergency or other essential services are not suitable for sharing with public mobile telephone services&rdquo;.  If the details available on the deal between East and the Garda Síochána are correct, the deal is directly contrary to the guidelines issued by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me on 26 November the Minister stated there was no conflict with the guidelines, but anyone who understands plain English will realise that this deal is contrary to the guidelines issued by the Minister.  This is an example of Government policy that is contradictory and causing confusion.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State explain how this deal is not in conflict with the particular guidelines? According to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 December Esat Digifone is now threatening to pull out of the proposed deal with the Garda unless an agreement allowing its mobile telephone network to use the Garda mast is quickly concluded; I understand Friday was the deadline.  A company, private or otherwise, should not issue veiled threats.  Having already got the licence at what I regard as an undervalued price, with the support of a number of mysterious backers, Esat Digifone has no right to put a gun to the head of anybody in State Departments in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main concern about this deal is that the <Col N="1042" /> planning process is being circumvented.  I understand if this deal goes ahead these receivers can be erected on masts without planning permission.  A previous Government decided that planning permission would be required for the erection of these transmitters but if this deal is concluded Esat Digifone, a private company, will be able to circumvent the planning laws and will be in conflict with the planning guidelines already issued by the Minister.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>If this deal goes ahead &mdash; and there are a number of positive aspects to it &mdash; I want an assurance from the Minister that, at a minimum, Esat Digifone will be required to apply for planning permission to secure the right to erect these transmitters on the Garda masts.  I will be quite happy to get that assurance from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and welcome the opportunity to correct certain misconceptions.</P>
      <P>The position on this matter is as follows.  The Garda authorities were approached by Esat Digifone in September with a proposal to share their radio masts in the context of Esat's planned mobile telephone network.  Upon initial examination by the Garda, it considered the arrangement proposed by Esat technically feasible and could offer significant benefits to it in terms of its plans for the future development of its radio and telecommunications network.  The Garda therefore asked for the Minister's approval in principle to enable it to enter discussions with Esat on the proposal.  The Departments of Finance, Environment, Transport, Energy and communications, and the Office of Public Works were consulted in this regard and raised no objection in principle to the proposal.  Mindful of the benefits which could accrue to the Garda and the general policy on the siting of telecommunications masts which encourages the sharing of existing facilities rather than having a proliferation of masts around the country, the Minister gave approval in principle to the Garda Commissioner to enter discussions with Esat on the basis that a definitive decision to enter such an arrangement with it would be taken only if it could be established that it would represent value to the State, would not impair Garda communications or security and that all legal requirements would be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As yet, final agreement has not been reached or contract made.  Discussions with Esat are ongoing and the various Government Departments involved are being kept informed of progress.  A condition of any agreement which might be reached with Esat would be that its use of Garda sites would be permitted only if it can provide evidence of having obtained planning approval for any developments it proposes to undertake or exemption, as the case may be, under planning legislation.  It would also be a prerequisite that developments at Garda sites <Col N="1043" /> should fully comply with the health and safety requirements set out in Appendix II of the Guidelines for Planning Authorities issued by the Department of the Environment.  Any exemptions or special arrangements which apply <Col N="1044" /> to Garda stations or Garda facilities in terms of planning requirements could not be availed of by Esat or other commercial operators.</P>

      <P>I am happy to be able to advise the Deputy that two very recent authoritative reports on the subject of the possible adverse health effects of electromagnetic fields from overhead powerlines do not in fact support such an association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States National Research Council completed a major study into the health effects of electromagnetic fields in October 1996.  I have been reassured by their findings that no clear, convincing evidence exists to show that residential exposures to electric and magnetic fields are a threat to human health and there is no conclusive evidence that electromagnetic fields play a role in the development of cancer, <Col N="1046" /> reproductive and development abnormalities, or learning and behavioural problems.</P>

They found fewer cases of cancer in the vicinity of the powerlines than would have been expected from cancer incidence statistics for Finland as a whole, although this reduction was not statistically significant.  It was concluded that the results of the present study suggest strongly that typical residential magnetic fields generated by high voltage powerlines are not related to cancer in adults.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department maintains very close surveillance of all developments in this area.  The Department produced major reviews of this subject in 1988 and 1992.  It is hoped to publish a further review during the first half of 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to the operation of services on any rail line are day to day commercial matters which fall entirely within the responsibility of the boards of management of CIE and Iarnród Éireann.  I have no function in relation to such decisions.  Iarnród Éireann's position regarding the future of the Limerick to Claremorris line was outlined by my predecessor in his reply of 14 November 1996 to a Dáil question tabled by Deputy Noel Ahern when he indicated that the company had not taken a decision to close the line and had no plans to do so.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann also confirmed that it is the company's aim that freight traffic on the line should continue, provided that the right business conditions can be created and sustained. However, the company recognises that it faces very strong competition on the Limerick-Claremorris corridor from the road haulage sector, which enjoys advantages in terms of cost and flexibility.  The company has no option but to face up to the commercial realities of the situation.  It must get its costs down if it is to compete successfully in this market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> Iarnród Éireann has indicated that, in the context of the company's cost reduction plan, potential savings of £250,000 per annum have been identified which could be achieved through a transfer of freight traffic on the Limerick-Claremorris line to other rail lines.  This underlines the urgency of making substantial reductions in the cost base of the operation. Iarnród Éireann has stressed that it is anxious to secure the future of commercial freight operations on the line by reducing costs, and especially the costs associated with maintaining the line in full operational order.  I welcome this positive approach and would wish to see the company arrive at a position where the future of freight traffic on this line would not only be maintained at existing levels but could be developed where suitable commercial opportunties could be identified.  In this regard, my predecessor requested Iarnród Éireann to engage in an intensive marketing drive with the aim of realising the full commercial potential of the Limerick-Claremorris line.</P>
    <P>Both management and unions have been urged to enter into meaningful negotiations in a spirit of partnership and co-operation with a view to agreeing on ways and means to achieve the cost savings envisaged by Iarnród Éireann and the other CIE companies in their viability plans.  The aim should be to meet these challenging targets by securing improvements in productivity and efficency rather than by curtailing services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 25 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>Overall, a total of £15 million in European Regional Development Fund support was made available under the 1994-99 Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, EIOP, for the development of indigenous renewable resources.</P>
      <P>The money was originally allocated for the first alternative energy requirement scheme, AER1. However, as it turned out, this support was not required as there was a sufficient number of project applicants who did not require grants to fulfil and indeed exceed our indicative target.  In total, the AER1 initiative secured offers of contract for 111MW broken down as follows: wind, ten projects (73MW); hydro, ten projects (4MW); landfill gas and waste, six projects (12MW); and combined heat and power, eight projects (22MW).</P>
      <P>The current price payable to AER1 renewable energy developers is 4p pr k W/hr, unit, produced. This unit cost is one of the most competitive in the EU and compares very well with the unit production costs of energy from other sources.  For instance, according to the TERES study existing coal plants have a unit production cost of 3p while new coal plants can be 4.4p.  Nuclear can be as high as 6.6p per unit.</P>
      <P>Additionally, if the external costs associated with these other fuels are internalised, renewable energy becomes even more attractive.  For instance, the Bellacorrick windfarm could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by a minimum of 12,000 tonnes per annum, sulphur by 160 tonnes and nitrous oxides by 65 tonnes.</P>
      <P>I will shortly announce a competition to secure an additional 100MW of renewable energy up to the end of 1999, including 90MW from wind.  I have set a price cap of 3.9 per unit for this competition and I expect to receive bids at prices below the 3.9 cap price.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware of the further initiative I took in December 1995 when I launched the competitive tendering scheme, AER2, to secure an electricity generating plant of up to 30 megawatts using biomass or waste as represents 50 per cent of the EIOP, renewables measure, is available in respect of this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bids in respect of this competition are currently <Col N="1049" /> being examined by an independent assessor, who will make a recommendation to my Department shortly.  Subject to the outcome of a socioeconomic cost benefit analysis, I expect to be in a position to announce the successful developer in January 1997.</P>
    <P>In April this year I launched a long-term strategy for renewable energy entitled Renewable Energy &mdash; A Strategy for the Future.  Under the strategy I have set targets for the development of renewables in Ireland up to the year 2010. Included in my strategy is an annual target of 30MW for wind energy.  I have allocated £7.5 million under the Economic Infrastructural Operation Programme to support projects up to the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>As was indicated to the Deputy's colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, in a written answer yesterday, a consortium of consultants are at present working on the detailed arrangements for a competition to be held for the peat station.  The competition will be for the award of a contract for the purchase of electricity from the new power station, the stream of income from the contract will enable the winning bidder to finance the construction and operation of the station, which will be owned by the winning bidder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants are due to report with their proposals for the competition by the end of this <Col N="1050" /> month, and on the basis that their recommendation is accepted, the competition will be held in the new year.  Until the consultants report it will not be possible to say precisely how long the competition will take or when the contract will be awarded.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 16 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answers to Questions Nos.330 and 327 of 26 November last.  To assist in identifying areas at greatest risk of high indoor radon levels, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in 1992 initiated a national geographically-based radon survey.  Recently, the results of the average radon concentrations for houses measured in counties Cavan, Dublin, Louth, Monaghan and Wicklow were published and these are available from the institute.  Data for the remaining counties will become available, on a phased basis, between now and 1998.</P>
      <P>Remedial measures to reduce radon levels are a matter for the householders themselves and an advisory booklet is available from the Department of the Environment.  However, due to the apparent reluctance by some householders to carry out remedial work, despite having a radon level in excess of the minimum reference level, I have sought to have provision made in the 1997 Estimates for a radon grant scheme. However, I must emphasise that any proposals made by me to the Minister for Finance are subject to overall budgetary constraints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>What my predecessor actually said on this subject was that he had &ldquo;no doubt that CIÉ's key markets are already attracting the attention of some very powerful private sector operators&rdquo;.  He added that the &ldquo;large resources and low cost base of these potential competitors should focus the minds of both CIÉ management and unions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>CIÉ has come under increasing competitive pressure from the growing domestic private bus sector in recent years.  Furthermore, deregulation in Britain has brought into being a number of very large private sector bus operators there which are anxious to expand their operations beyond their domestic market.  Ireland is clearly a very attractive market for such operators for a variety of reasons, including our nearness to their home market, the absence of a language barrier and generally similar driving conditions.  Up to now, our restrictive bus licensing regime under the Road Transport Act, 1932, has meant that both domestic and non-national bus operators have been unable to secure entry to the Irish market or to expand operations already in existence.  Approaches made to my Department in recent years by UK interests could not be acceded to under the existing law because the routes in question were already served by authorised operators.</P>
      <P>However, all the indications from Brussels are that gradual liberalisation of public transport, including domestic bus markets, will take place at European level in the coming years.  The Commission's commitment to liberalisation has been clearly stated in documents such as the Green Paper on the Citizens' Network and in other Commission publications and proposals. Public transport is one of the last major sectors in which large scale liberalisation has not yet taken place.  It would be foolish to pretend that this situation can continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>My predecessor's statement was therefore simply a timely reminder to both management and unions in CIÉ of the changing environment in public transport at European level.  The challenge of increasing competition, both domestic and international is a reality, which they will inevitably have to face.</P>
      <P>Finally, my Department is not aware of any meetings between my predecessor and any foreign private sector bus interests.</P>

    <P>At a preparatory meeting for the December <Col N="1054" /> Transport Council, held on 27 November, the former Minister raised the matter of the dispute with Commissioner Kinnock.

      <P>Two exploration wells were drilled in 1996, both in the Slyne Trough by Enterprise Oil plc.  The first well, drilled in block 27/5 and located about 40 miles to the west of Achill, was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole in June 1996.  The second well was drilled in block 18/20 and located about 45 miles west of Belmullet, County Mayo.  Enterprise encountered gas in this well and received my approval to carry out a test programme to assess the discovery.  However, despite its best efforts, it was unable to conduct the test because of mechanical problems arising in the well.  The well was plugged and abandoned in early November 1996.  It is my understanding that they now plan to acquire new seismic data in the area of the discovery to determine the optimum location for further drilling.</P>
      <P>As regards offshore drilling in 1997, at this stage three companies, Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Ltd., Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Total Oil Marine plc. have plans to drill in the Porcupine Basin.  The first well should start in mid March and I expect to receive applications for each well at least 30 days before drilling is due to commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Marathon and Total intend drilling exploration wells under their frontier licences. Statoil hold a lease undertaking in block 26/28 in the Porcupine Basin and will drill an appraisal well, starting mid March 1997, on which an extended well test will be carried out.  They will <Col N="1055" /> then drill a second appraisal well, to be followed by a detailed test.  Should the results of the two wells be encouraging, the company will proceed to declare the field commercial and will move to full production requiring possibly between nine and 11 development wells to be drilled.</P>
    <P>Further exploration wells may be drilled next year but final decisions have yet to be made by the companies.</P>

      <P>At EU level, the optimum exploitation of renewables can only be achieved within the framework of a co-ordinated support strategy.  For this reason, and considering the important role renewable energy will play in meeting future Irish and EU energy needs, the development of an EU strategy for renewables has been highlighted as an energy priority of Ireland's Presidency.</P>
      <P>As a result of this, and following pressure from my Department and me, the Commission presented a Green Paper on an EU Strategy for Renewable Energy to the Council of Ministers meeting which I chaired on 3 December.  Because of the importance which I attach to renewables, the Presidency held an open debate on the topic at Council.  The Commission's Green Paper was generally welcomed by Ministers who recognised that renewables have a role to play in enhancing security of energy supply and in addressing the environmental impact of energy production.</P>
      <P>I believe the strategy must be capable of facilitating the successful exploitation of the European renewable resource and of supporting the development of a strong, self-sustaining and competitive renewable energy industry and technology manufacturing base.  Only in this way can it make a positive contribution to job creation and economic development.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Questions Nos. 86 and 87 of 24 October 1996 which have clearly set out this Government's position in relation to Sellafield.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for nuclear safety, I have availed of all opportunities to highlight the Government's and Irish people's concerns about Sellafield both bilaterally and at wider international level.  My main concerns include the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the THORP plant at the Sellafield complex, the ageing magnox reactors at the site and the facilities for the storage of high level radioactive liquid waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my term of office I have placed strong emphasis on enhancing the international regulatory framework governing the production of nuclear power.  Even if such enhancements do not lead to the closure of nuclear operations in the UK they at least impose more rigorous standards on the nuclear industry.  They also <Col N="1059" /> make operators and regulators more accountable for their activities.  In July of this year, Ireland ratified the Nuclear Safety Convention which entered into force on 24 October last.  Ireland has urged that member states of the EU and the International Atomic Energy Agency should ratify the convention as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation has been prominent during the Presidency in preparatory drafting work for a new international convention in nuclear waste and spent fuel management which should be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>Officials within my Department have recently requested the European Commission to carry out inspections and verifications of the facilities of magnox reactors in the UK under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty so as to ensure that they are in compliance with EU standards.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is widespread opposition in this country to all operations in Sellafield.  The Government is committed to taking all possible action open to it to secure the objective of the eventual closure of the plant.  However, we must be realistic.  Sellafield is a huge employer in Cumbria.  So long as the operations at Sellafield make such a large contribution to the UK's economy there will be resistance to any campaign to close the plant.  We must also bear in mind that nuclear power has a significant share of UK electricity production.</P>
    <P>However, the cessation of activities at Sellafield will remain a priority for the Government and this will be highlighted and pursued in every appropriate international forum. This Government remains committed to using every available opportunity to voice its concerns about safety aspects of the British nuclear industry, especially Sellafield.  We will continue to implement a meaningful strategy to minimise the threat posed by the nuclear industry in the UK.</P>

The purpose of the equity is to eliminate that level of Bord na Móna's debt which is considered to be unsustainable, and, at the same time, to grant an average reduction of around £6 in 1993 prices in the price of milled peat sold to ESB.</P>

      <P>While as Minister for Finance I have overall responsibility for the operation of the national lottery, decisions regarding the disbursement of lottery funding are a matter for the relevant spending Minister subject to the overall allocations decided by Government.</P>
      <P>The most recent period for which detailed information is available in relation to national lottery spending is 1995.  Details of spending by the various Government Departments for that year, including lists of grantees, are contained in the Appropriation Accounts for 1995 which were published recently.  Copies of the accounts are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>With regard to seeking the amounts allocated to particular geographical areas, I would make the point that many of the activities funded from the national lottery do not lend themselves to being disaggregated in this way, for example, in the sports area, grants to the national governing bodies of sporting organisations.</P>
      <P>In the case of my own Department, the only area of activity which is funded by the national lottery is Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí for Irish language training which received £109,000 from the national lottery in 1995.</P>

    <P>(1) Statistics are not available which would enable the precise information requested by the Deputy to be provided in respect of share purchase schemes qualifying for tax relief under the provisions of section 12 of the Finance Act, 1986. It is tentatively estimated that share purchases by employees over the period from 1987 to date, relating to income tax years 1986-7 to 1994-5, were accorded tax relief at an approximate cost to the Exchequer of £1.9 million.</P>
    <P>(2) The estimated cost of the relief is not available.  Cospoir ceased to function in 1995.</P>
    <P>(3) The cost figure relates to the relief for capital allowances in respect of all non-residential urban renewal projects.  No estimate is available for the cost of other aspects of this scheme except for the estimated cost of &ldquo;section 23&rdquo; relief. See footnote (5) below.</P>
    <P>(4) The figures in the table are the tentatively estimated costs of extending the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for shipping companies in respect of accounting periods ending between 1 April 1993 and 31 March 1994 and between 1 April 1994 and 31 March 1995.  The estimated cost of any other reliefs availed of by the shipping trades is not available.</P>
    <P>(5) This is the cost in 1993, the latest year for which the figures are available, for both the nationwide scheme which terminated in July 1992 as well as the urban renewal element of the scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, under the terms of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, entry to the Civil Service must, with a few exceptions of limited application, be by way of open competition.  One of those exceptions provided for the reinstatement to their former positions of women who resigned from the Civil Service for marriage-related reasons and who fulfilled specific criteria.  However, the statutory provisions which provided for reinstatement have been repealed and, consequently, the only avenue of re-entry to the Civil Service now open to the person concerned is by competing in and being successful at an open competition run by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in my earlier reply, to alleviate the consequences of the repeal of the reinstatement scheme, the next two series of clerical assistant and executive officer competitions will include provision for special sub-panels which will be composed solely of former civil servants but will not differentiate on grounds of gender or marital status.  Former civil servants who are candidates in these competitions and who wish to be considered for the sub-panels will, have to reach the required qualifying standard for appointment at the competitions.  Clerical aptitude tests and, <Col N="1065" /> where necessary, skills related tests and interview are a normal feature of the clerical assistant recruitment procedures, while job realted tests and interview are a feature of the executive officer competition.</P>
    <P>Competitions for recruitment to the Civil Service are run by the Civil Service Commissioners and are advertised in the daily papers from time to time.  A competition for appointment as clerical assistant, typist, for Dublin vacancies, which provided for the special sub-Panel arrangement, was advertised in September 1996.  It is envisaged that a competition for appointment as executive officer and clerical assistant will be advertised during the course of next year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is the Government's intention that retired nurses and other public servants will benefit from the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and work </i>pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The energies of the management side dealing with the nurses' claim have so far been concentrated on developing jointly with the nursing unions, a set of proposals designed to bring to finality the nurses' claim under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The <Col N="1067" /> Deputy will be aware that revised proposals arising from the independent adjudication process&mdash;provided for in the framework agreed between the Government and ICTU &mdash; have been rejected by the INO and IMPACT.</P>
    <P>The pay proposals developed to date involve an element of restructuring, as provided for under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement.  This applies to nurses and many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers, gardaí, etc. who have or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and in many cases even within grades. This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions and this questions will now have to be considered in respect of all affected groups across the public service.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions on this issue have yet to take place.  When this general policy issue has been resolved, my Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made to retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed by my Department in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.</P>
      <P>Most health boards have now been successful in recruiting consultant orthodontists.  The Mid-Western, North-Western, South-Eastern, Southern and Eastern Health Boards now have consultants working for them and are consolidating and extending their orthodontic services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.  The Western Health Board had a full-time consultant up to mid-1996.  This full-time consultant resigned to take up a full-time appointment with the Eastern Health Board.  Where health boards have not yet been successful in recruiting consultants they have made arrangements with private orthodontists to provide services.</P>
      <P>A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.</P>
      <P>Where health boards have been successful in recruiting consultant orthodontists the services provided by these boards have been considerably improved.  This demonstrates, very clearly, the success of my Department's strategy of consultant led teams for the provision of orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>I will, in conjunction with the health boards, continue to develop the consultant led orthodontic services over the course of the dental health action plan.  The ultimate objective is to bring the level of service provision in line with the level of treatment need.</P>

        <i>(Mr. Noonan, Limerick East</i>): I presume the review referred to by Deputy O'Rourke is that of the 1978 working party established to examine the grading structure for Physiotherapists in hospitals.  The report of the working party was circulated in 1979.  However, this was not a pay review.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapists, similar to all other Para-medical professions, have benefited in full from all standard and special pay awards under the various pay programmes down through the years. The relative position of physiotherapists, in terms of remuneration, has been maintained with those of their colleagues in other para-medical disciplines.</P>
      <P>IMPACT, on behalf of physiotherapists is currently pursuing a pay claim under Clause 2 (iii)-Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  These negotiations are complex and are ongoing under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency, with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.  In these circumstances I am sure that Deputy O'Rourke will appreciate that any further comment on my part would not be appropriate or helpful.</P>

      <P>The demand for funding under both the recreational facilities scheme and the major facilities scheme has continued to increase in recent years.  In view of the relatively limited funds available for allocation and the very large number of applications received, it was not possible to include the project on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I expect that further funding will become available in 1997 and in that event every consideration will be given to the project when decisions are being made on grant allocations next year.</P>

      <P>The submission to which the Deputy refers related to the school's request for inclusion in the rural phase of my recent initiative aimed at breaking the cycle of disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>The criteria under which schools were selected for inclusion in this initiative and the selection process it self, were devised and carried out by the educational research centre following detailed consideration of a range of possible indicators.</P>
      <P>I understand that the educational research centre wrote to all unsuccessful applicants, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, on 3 October 1996 informing them of their failure to qualify under the selection process.  However, due to the administrative error, a response to a subsequent representation on behalf of the school indicated that the school had not applied for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
      <P>As soon as this error came to light, the author of the earlier representation was advised of the correct position.  I understand that the education research centre also wrote to the school on 28 November 1996 to explain the basis for its non-selection. I very much regret any inconvenience caused by the above developments.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be considered in the context of any further expansion of supports in this area.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the report of the inquiry which was established to investigate the failure to inform Judge Lynch of the Government decision of 1 August, 1996 to remove him from the Special Criminal Court.  This report outlines the consequence of events surrounding this failure.  It deals with the circulation of the Government decision of 1 August, 1996 on pages 3 and 4 and I refer the Deputy particularly to those pages of the report.</P>

      <P>Subsequent to the recommendation made by the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly for a £2 million grant scheme, I established a national advisory committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out Campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána (Neighbourhood Watch) are represented, to advise on a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds are targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money is achieved.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided that funding could be provided for:</P>
      <P>&mdash;small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>It was not intended that the scheme would provide funding towards the cost of conventional burglar alram systems, such as phonewatch, and I have no plans to extend the scheme to cover such equipment.  The strong advice available to me from the advisory committee and the Garda Síochána is that conventional burglar alarms are of limited use to vulnerable elderly people living alone.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together as I understand that both questions relate to the eligibility of widows for participation in Community Employment.</P>
      <P>CE is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or lone parent's allowance.  Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities with training that would enhance the employment prospects of those at whom the programme is targeted.</P>
      <P>The present eligibility criteria for CE only came into effect earlier this year following a detailed review of CE and in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment.  These criteria were designed to target the programme at priority groups and include provision for persons with children who are in receipt of survivor's contributory pension to revert to lone parent's allowance and if awarded same, they would then be eligible to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to widen the eligibility criteria to include additional categories at present.  CE is operating at, or close to capacity, relative to available resources, and to extend eligibility would be at the expense of the priority groups for whom the programme is designed.</P>
