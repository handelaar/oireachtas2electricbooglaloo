      <P>For the first time in 20 years, last night the House rejected a Government Bill on Second Stage.  In the normal course of events under our rules it would be a further six months before the Bill could come before the House.  Deputy Séamus Brennan, on a point of order which the Chair allowed, offered to consult the Government on the basis that we were in favour of light rail but were against the draconian powers that this Bill gave the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing <Col N="1747" /> Orders the Government cannot reintroduce this Bill within six months.  If this House believes in openness, transparency and accountability, the Government certainly cannot do it but it can discuss how the Bill can be amended. Last night we made a decision on behalf of the people whose houses would be knocked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Finance proceed with this Bill in the normal way &mdash; amending it before bringing it back to the House in six months' time &mdash; or engage with the Opposition in amending the Bill substantially and removing the grounds for objection, on which the Opposition won the vote last night, because there was no proper consultative procedure for ordinary people to have a say in how it will operate?  That is what the victory was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government cannot reintroduce a Bill that was negatived by this House under a phoney order, as it is suggesting to the media. The Government has the alternative of waiting six months or dropping the sections and I ask the Minister to confirm the option he will take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a great deal in recent days about democracy.  If democracy means anything, it means that when this House votes in a certain way the Government follows it and does not seek to undermine democracy.  I agree with Deputy Costello that it was a blinkered approach from the Government which should consult the Opposition parties with a view to amending the legislation to ensure we get the most effective and appropriate public transport system for the city and county of Dublin.</P>
      <P>It was not the Opposition who defeated the Government last night, it was the Government's own incompetence. We will not see the rules of this House undermined because the Government has been incompetent.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to the drawing board, to talk to Opposition parties and bring an amended Bill before the House which can win the support of all the parties in the House, not just the parties in Government.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil voted against the principles of no consultation, riding roughshod over the wishes of local communities and draconian measures in a clumsy Bill brought before the House by an incompetent <Col N="1750" /> Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the Government will introduce a new Bill?  It is not good enough for Government spokespersons to say overnight that, because a few people did not <Col N="1752" /> turn up, it can re-run the same Bill.  It cannot do so.  I do not want to engage in criticism, but whoever said this does not understand the Standing Orders of this House.  As pointed out this morning on radio by Deputy Molloy, this would be in breach of Standing Order 52.  The Minister is correct that last night we voted against the principle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;Section 5 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (3):</P>

    <P>(VI)  the person in whose favour the order aforesaid is made dies after payment of the designated benefit has commenced,</P>
    <P>(VII)  the person in whose favour the said order is made ceases to be a dependent member of the family as defined in section 2 of the Family Law Act, 1995,</P>
    <P>(VIII)  in the circumstances specified in subsection (5) of section 12, a spouse makes an application under that subsection,</P>
    <P>(IX)  the trustees of the scheme concerned apply the transfer amount concerned under or in accordance with subsection (6) or (8) of section 12,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(iv)  make such other provision as may be necessary or expedient for the purposes of section 12 and for enabling it to have full effect.</P>
    <P>(c)  In making regulations under paragraph (a), regard shall be had to any relevant principles, purposes or policies of this Act, the Income Tax Acts, the Family Law Act, 1995, any relevant current practices of the Revenue Commissioners in approving schemes, any relevant guidelines, guidance notes or codes of practice of the Board and any relevant guidelines of the Society of Actuaries in Ireland for the time being in force and the desirability of promoting equity and consistency in the treatment of individual cases, minimising any costs incurred under section 12 and conforming with good pensions practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> (d)  In this subsection&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;accumulated value&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the realisable value of the units, shares or securities at a particular date, or averaged over a particular period before that date in which, pursuant to the rules of the scheme, the contributions for retirement benefit paid by or in respect of a member spouse under the scheme are invested, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the realisable value of the contributions for retirement benefit paid by or in respect of a member spouse under a defined contribution scheme, together with the notional rate of interest or other investment return prescribed under the rules of the scheme, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  the amount of the proceeds of any insurance policies in which, pursuant to the rules of the scheme, the contributions for retirement benefit paid by or in respect of a member spouse under the scheme are invested.</P>
    <P>less, in each case, the amount of any of the expenses of the scheme that, pursuant to the rules thereof, fall to be discharged out of the said realisable value or proceeds;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;active member&rdquo;, &ldquo;actuarial value&rdquo;, &ldquo;contingent benefit&rdquo;, &ldquo;defined contribution scheme&rdquo;, &ldquo;designated benefit&rdquo;, &ldquo;retirement benefit&rdquo;, &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; and &ldquo;transfer amount&rdquo; have the meanings assigned to them by section 12;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;residual benefit&rdquo; means the amount of retirement benefit remaining in respect of the member spouse concerned after deduction therefrom of the relevant designated benefit or the amount of contingent benefit in respect of the member spouse concerned remaining after deduction therefrom of the amount of contingent benefit <Col N="1761" /> payable pursuant to an order under subsection (3) of section 12 or the amount of payment made under subsection (7) of section 12;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;section 12&rdquo; means section 12 of the Family Law Act, 1995.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to section 5 of the principal Act which involved the insertion of a new subsection (4) to extend the powers of the Minister for Social Welfare to make regulations in respect of certain provisions of the Family Law Act, 1995, in relation to pensions.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Act, 1995, comes into force on 1 August and is one of the key elements of the Government's programme to deal with the problems of marital breakdown.  Under section 12 of that Act, the court, on granting a decree of judicial separation, has power to order that a portion of the pension benefits of a spouse who is a member of an occupational pensions scheme be earmarked to provide a separate benefit for a dependent spouse and children. Section 12 of the 1995 Act already provides that the valuation of benefits, calculation of transfer amounts and the manner in which benefits ordered by the court are to be applied and paid, shall be in accordance with guidelines made by the Pensions Board under the Pensions Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment will be to enable the Minister for Social Welfare to give full statutory effect to any such guidelines by way of regulation. This will ensure greater compliance by the pensions industry in the uniform application of the guidelines.  It will also allow for greater certainty in applying the provisions of pension adjustment orders both for the trustees of pensions schemes and persons in whose favour a pension adjustment order is made under the 1995 Act.  Subsection (4) <i>(b)</i> sets out the matters which have been taken into account when making regulations for the purpose of calculating amounts and making payments.</P>

      <P>I need hardly refer to the procedures which apply at this time but perhaps it would be wiser for the Minister of State to reply later in anticipation of Deputy Woods or any other Member intervening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment. The Minister is making provision for a variety of circumstances which can arise and empowering himself to introduce guidelines to deal with them. Amendment No. 1 lists the increasingly broad number of circumstances which can arise and the Minister is attempting, by way of guidelines and regulations, to provide cover to meet those circumstances. This amendment is particularly important because it is becoming increasingly urgent and important that we deal properly with the area of pensions.</P>
      <P>It is alleged that by the year 2032 there will be an explosion in the demand for pensions due to demographic and population changes.  I do not subscribe to this theory because, if certain alterations and changes are made in the interim, those circumstances can be met and adequate pensions provided for people who will retire in 2010, 2020 or 2030.  It is not beyond the genius of mankind to deal with circumstances to which I referred.  Policy-makers at a very high level have pointed to the occurrence of a demographic change whereby in the future people will benefit as children, contribute for a relatively short period as adults and live for a long period beyond that contribution period.  It has been stated that there will be great difficulty with regard to pensions as a result of this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This theory is based in a number of assumptions.  The first is that there will be fewer people at work in the middle stage, they will work less and the numbers applying for pensions will be reduced.  Of course there will be changes and, if one considers current <Col N="1763" /> forecasts in relation to demographics, there will be fewer people at work relative to those who have retired.  It is true that people will, on average, live for a much longer time &mdash; we do not know if we will be fortunate enough to be included in those statistics &mdash; and there will be pressure on the pensions system as a result.  This also assumes that those who live longer will make no contribution, which raises many possibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister covers a wide area in this amendment and provides for changing circumstances.  That is to be welcomed as he will have to deal with the changes that will occur in the marketplace. The marketplace is already changing the new pension schemes to defined contribution as opposed to defined benefit schemes.  Talking about the technicalities of defined contribution and benefit schemes is a switch-off, but it should not be.  Pensions are about security and will be an important issue for many years.  The switch in the marketplace to defined contribution schemes means, in effect, that the pension will define the contribution an employee and employer makes.</P>
    <P>In the past defined benefit schemes were the norm and contributors knew they would get approximately half the rate of their salary in the last three years of their employment.  However, the market is changing in this regard.  New defined contribution schemes are being introduced; employees will know exactly what they and their employers have contributed but what happens subsequently will depend on the progress of the fund.  That means all the work done in relation to trustees and ensuring the funds are secure is very relevant.  In addition, workers will need to know that their fund is being invested well to provide a decent pension on retirement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has anticipated these changes and provided for guidelines to be put in place regardless of whether the scheme is a defined contribution scheme.  In that sense he is looking to the future and to the flexibility he may <Col N="1764" /> require to deal with circumstances as they arise within the framework of the general pensions legislation we have introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister is examining the division of pension benefits on the breakup of a marriage, either through separation or divorce, and ensuring he can establish suitable guidelines in that respect.  There is provision in the Family Law Act for the division of pension benefits and there are three options in terms of the way in which the pension will be applied.  In this amendment the Minister will be given the power to put in place some of the arrangements in regard to those developments.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised there are approximately 400,000 people in this country aged 65 or over.  That represents in excess of 11 per cent of the population.  The size of that group of people is increasing, their health is improving as is their general well-being and participation in activities.  That is because of the changes in our society which enable people to live longer and healthier lives.  We must anticipate and meet their requirements in pension terms.  That is becoming increasingly important.  It is predicted that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will constitute 19 per cent by the year 2011, which is not too far away, and 23 per cent by the year 2021.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making provision to deal with future challenges anticipated and is including in this amendment a wide variety of pensions to cover the various circumstances that may arise.</P>
    <P>We welcome the flexibility provided in this measure which has the support of this side of the House.  It is appropriate that the Minister is not only keeping up with the times &mdash; many other European countries have not taken similar action &mdash; but he is ensuring that we keep a little ahead of the times, anticipating the problems which may arise.  I welcome the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite for their constructive contributions. Deputy Walsh wanted to know <Col N="1765" /> if the courts will be required to make a decision.  The courts will be required to make a decision.  The pensions must be paid in accordance with the pension scheme but having regard to the Family Law Act, 1995 the court may decide otherwise in relation to the division of the benefits.  Ordinarily, pensions must be paid in accordance with the scheme; a change is made only in cases decided by the courts.  Accordingly it was deemed prudent in this section to table this amendment to anticipate the type of circumstances that may arise in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods referred to the need to anticipate future requirements in the legislation; that is precisely what is being done in this substantial amendment which provides for eventualities that can and will arise as a result of the courts making an order in relation to division of the benefits of a pension scheme in respect of a spouse.  The guidelines are already in place but they will now have statutory effect.  In the event of a marriage breakdown, there must be an order of the court if the pension is to be effected.</P>
      <P>This is a worthy amendment which will have a far-reaching effect.  It would have had to be introduced at some future stage given the provisions of the 1995 Family Law Act.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall ensure <Col N="1766" /> that, in guidelines issued by the Board, the precise interpretation of the words `misappropriate' and `being contemplated' as set out in section 36, shall be detailed.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage.  There has been an improvement in that the words &ldquo;being contemplated&rdquo; have been deleted and that is desirable. To introduce legislation for what people might think from time to time would be go beyond what we are charged with in this House.  It is important to have misappropriation specified clearly and comprehensively. Will we have a definition of what is meant by &ldquo;misappropriation&rdquo; in the guidelines?  For instance, could a simple query in relation to, say, various levels of self-investment be considered as misappropriation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Walsh proposes that the pensions board guidelines should define precisely the term, &ldquo;misappropriation&rdquo; and &ldquo;being contemplated&rdquo;.  Following consultations with the pensions board, the Office of the Attorney General and the relevant organisations who made submissions to the Bill, as indicated on Committee Stage, the text of section 36 has been amended and the words &ldquo;is being contemplated&rdquo;, are no longer being used, nor is there reference to &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo;, as some concern was expressed about the legality of this approach.  To remove any doubts in this regard the reference to &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; in the Bill was removed.  Facilitative guidelines may be issued by the pensions board under its general powers to make such guidelines.  I do not believe the board would have the right to interpret the precise meaning of the term used in legislation which is not defined in that legislation.  That would be a matter for the courts.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 22, after &ldquo;appropriate.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The trustees of the scheme should be furnished with a copy of any such report or reports, as the case may be.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My concern is that the entire burden of compliance under the pensions Acts rests with the trustees.  In the event of an investigation being carried out by the pensions board and other parties being supplied with a copy of the report of such an investigation, it would seem to be right and equitable that the trustees should be furnished with a copy of such report.  The Bill provides that anybody as appropriate would be furnished with a copy of such a report.  It is important that it be spelt out in the Bill that the trustees would be provided with a copy. It may be argued that this will be the practice of the pensions board but the importance to the trustees of receiving such a report merits reflection in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that any pensions board report prepared in relation to an investigation should be furnished to the trustees of the scheme involved.  The issue has already been discused in detail with the board.  It has indicated that its policy is that, where possible, reports will be available to all relevant parties.  This policy is one with which I am in full agreement.  I am also aware that a case could arise where it would be appropriate for some reason to furnish such a report to the trustees of the scheme. Accordingly, I am reluctant to put such a provision in legislation at this stage.  I acknowledge the intent of the Deputy's amendment and while I oppose its introduction, it is my intention to keep the matter under review.  If it transpired <Col N="1768" /> that reports were not being made available by the board to the trustees, without sufficient good reason, the matter would be revisited.</P>

      <P>Obviously there is a large measure of agreement between the Minister of State and Deputy Walsh.  I understand the point the Minister makes that there could be some circumstances where it would not be appropriate. It is difficult to specify those circumstances and the Minister has not given us examples of what they might be.  It is only when one gets down to giving an example of what they might be that one beings to ask why the reports should not be made available.  Nevertheless, if we thought about where circumstances could arise, it is reasonable to assume there could be such circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said he recognised the point made by Deputy Walsh and would keep the matter under review.  I suggest the Minister of State examines this question with a view to providing guidelines to ensure the trustees get the maximum amount of information possible.  From what the Minister of State said he obviously intends they should receive the maximum amount of information possible and the board would say it should receive the same.  Problems arise in the House or in the media, because we thought certain things were being provided for and the people who were there when it was discussed intended to do it but it did not happen.  When examining the guidelines perhaps the Minister of State would consider the valid point made by Deputy Walsh, which generally he accepts, with a view to ensuring it happens as intended by Deputy Walsh and the Minister of State.  Given that it is not provided for in the legislation it could be covered by normal procedures, such as guidelines, so that everybody is clear about the intention in the House.  If the Minister were to consider that matter it would go a long way towards meeting the genuine concern of Deputy Walsh.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;Section 33 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (4) after `(in this Act referred to as &ldquo;the revaluation percentage&rdquo;)' of `which shall determine the amount'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to clarify the preservation of benefit provisions, particularly having regard to the amendment of the Second Schedule of the Pensions Act, 1990, which deals with the calculation of preserved benefit and which will allow for the revaluation of preserved benefit of a portion of a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle underlying section 33 (2) of the Pensions Act which deals with the revaluation of preserved benefits is that there should be revaluation of preserved benefits where there is a period of at least one year between the date of leaving service and the date of commencement of pension.  The anomaly which amendment No. 33 seeks to correct is that because revaluation is calculated by reference to complete calendar years it is possible that a period of more <Col N="1770" /> than 12 months may elapse between the date of leaving service and the date of commencement of pension.  However, the member may not qualify for revaluation because the period does not include a complete calendar year.</P>
    <P>At present revaluation is applied to &ldquo;the amount of preserved benefit as at the last day of the previous revaluation year&rdquo;.  Where a member has left service since the previous 31 December as of the last day of the previous revaluation year should be nil.  Paragraph (a) of amendment No. 33 provides that in such cases the appropriate amount is to be added to the preserved benefit as of the date on which the member left service. Paragraph (b) amends the formula to provide that where the member has left service since the previous 31 December &mdash; P in the formula will be the amount that is his preserved benefit as at the date on which he left service.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) also amends the formula used in calculating preservation to allow that in respect of a calendar year during which a member leaves service the number of months can be revalued as a percentage of the revaluation percentage &mdash; one-twelfth for each completed month.  For example, if the revaluation percentage was four per cent and the member completed six months he would receive two per cent.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of amendment No. 33 deals with an anomaly where, in some instances, a person remaining in service can be treated less favourably than a person leaving.  In these circumstances it allows that they may revalue the preserved benefit on a different basis but one which they consider to be just and equitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment. It sounds good.  I am aware of a pension scheme in which some individuals were within days of a pension entitlement yet they did not receive it because they did not have a full year's service.  The consideration of portions of a year is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some ambiguity in pension schemes and other investment schemes <Col N="1771" /> in relation to the contribution year and the benefit year.  Many people contribute to the An Post savings certificates through their salaries yet it is only at the end of the contribution year that the benefit year commences.  In other words, they pay for six rather than five years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the clarification in this regard.  This Bill is about ensuring pension schemes are properly funded and run and the members rights are clearly and comprehensively protected.  Any amendment which improves members' entitlements and benefits is welcome.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) Forfeiture of a members' pension in respect of employers&rdquo; claims arising out of criminal, negligent or fraudulent acts shall be provided for.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of employees make their contributions to pension schemes and also contribute to the well being of the company.  At the end of their working lives they receive their pensions.  An employee may not fulfil his or her obligations to a company and may be guilty of fraud, criminal activity or negligence which may have a deleterious effect on the company.  It seems anomalous that such an employee would end up getting a pension, although they may have been <Col N="1772" /> dismissed.  It is important that the workers who serve their companies well are protected and those who do not are not rewarded with a pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to allow for forfeiture of a member's pension in cases arising out of criminal, negligent or fraudulent acts. Up to now under the provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, forfeiture has been totally forbidden.  The provisions contained in the Bill allow for forfeiture only in respect of situations where it would be to the benefit and for the protection of the member that such forfeiture takes place.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 36 of the Pensions Act and this Bill are designed with the interests of the individual members of pension schemes in mind. The Deputy's amendment proposes to introduce forfeiture in instances where it would not benefit the member.</P>
      <P>While it may seem reasonable in the first instance in the type of cases the Deputy has mentioned, I am concerned that it could be used against individual members where disputes arose with employers.  In certain circumstances it could be open to an unscrupulous employer to use such provisions against an individual member of a pension scheme.  The matter the Deputy mentions can best be dealt with through the courts but it should not affect the pension of an individual member which the Pensions Act sets out to protect.  The courts are the final arbiters in this case.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;(1)  It shall be prohibited to deduct State pensions from private scheme benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1773" /> (2)  Where it is the case that pensions (other than State pensions) accrue over a 30 year period, the annual accrual rate shall be increased by a factor of 40/30, that is, from 1.66 per cent to 2.2 per cent, to reflect current labour market conditions.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In virtually all cases the State pension is merged with the overall pension payment and people receive their State and contributory pensions.  However, in many cases the matter is not clarified properly.  When some pension companies produce their glossy brochures stating that on retirement people will be entitled to a certain pension, they fail to clarify that a major portion of that pension will be made up of their PRSI contributions.  I tabled this amendment to ensure that pension schemes that use PRSI contributions to supplement retirement pensions do not give the impression that the pensions they pay to members accrue totally from personal contributions to the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the past the length of the normal working life was generally 40 years which allowed for a maximum pension of 40/60 or two-thirds to be paid to the person at the age of 65.  Nowadays, however, people retire at a much earlier age and do not work for 40 years.  A maximum working life of 30 years is the norm.  Over a 40-year period of pensionable service an employee could earn a maximum pension of 40/60 in remuneration. The Minister of State took account of social change in an earlier amendment.  In this case he should take account of modern working trends and the fact that people generally retire at an earlier age.  Under current employment practices employees lose out on two fronts.  When they retire at 55 rather than 65 they lose ten years service at a time which for many, because of incremental salary increases and so on, would be the most remunerative period of their working lives.  Instead of receiving a rate of 40/60 or two-thirds in pension entitlements they receive a rate of only 30/60.  As the 40/60 rate was devised at a time when people generally <Col N="1774" /> worked for a longer period, a more enlightened pension accrual formula should be devised to reflect modern working practice.  The proposal in my amendment is based on the modern working life of 30 rather than 40 years.</P>
    <P>Pension schemes are important. Rather than taking a full salary on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, people should be encouraged to contribute to retirement schemes.  When people retire at 55 rather than 65 it provides an opportunity for younger people to come into the workforce.  Rather than remaining in a job merely to make up full pension entitlements, people should be encouraged to retire earlier and not be penalised for doing so.  That is the import of my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to prohibit deducting State pensions from private scheme benefits and to change the annual rate of accrual where pensions accrue over a 30 rather than a 40 year period.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the final report of the National Pension Board, it is now a common feature of most defined benefit schemes that they are co-ordinated with the social welfare pension.  This type of co-ordination is generally aimed at giving the member two-thirds of final salary, based on social welfare pension topped up by an occupational pension.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggested by the Deputy is radical and in this regard it should be noted that occupational pension schemes are voluntary arrangements and employers do not have to introduce or implement such schemes. This proposal would result in a change in the rules of each individual pension scheme, reducing occupational pension entitlement.  Ultimately the position would remain unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major survey of occupational pensions currently being undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute on behalf of the Department and the Pensions Board, which will be available later in the year, will be significant in considering the development of pension <Col N="1775" /> systems and informing us of the current level of cover and other issues arising.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy's amendment, I am informed that there is nothing to prevent such a rate of accrual currently applying.  It would be a matter for the rules of each individual pension scheme Again I emphasise the voluntary nature of such schemes.  We do not legislate for benefits in individual schemes, which would be the effect of the Deputy's proposal.  Once an employee has ten year's service there is nothing in the Revenue Commissioners' rules to prevent such a person from qualifying for a full pension subject to the rules of the individual scheme to which he or she has contributed.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Walsh in regard to clarity.  It is the policy of the Pensions Board to make available as much information as possible.  I am sure Deputies opposite are aware that pension schemes vary considerably and to apply legislation across the board, which would be necessary under this amendment, could create difficulties for some schemes.  Therefore, unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of Deputy Walsh's amendment is clearcut.  He wants to ensure that people have adequate pensions.  The Minister of State said it is the practice to use the State pension to make up a two-thirds pension, but people on low wages would still be entitled to a low pension.  The difficulty with percentages or proportions is knowing to what they relate. While a percentage of two or three is very little, a percentage of 1,000 is a considerable amount.  That is the problem that arises.  Deputy Walsh is particularly concerned to ensure that people on lower incomes have an adequate pension at the end of the day.  Many people on less than the average industrial wage end up with a meagre pension which, with a top-up State pension, gives them only a reasonable income. Last Saturday a man who attended my clinic had spent his lifetime working in <Col N="1776" /> a good job and now receives the equivalent of the social welfare pension.  That man, who retired at 65, cannot afford to keep his car on the road.  Unlike some people who may have suffered from illness, he is fully fit, intelligent and capable of working, but his whole life has been turned upside down because his pension is inadequate.  That is the type of case Deputy Walsh spoke about and against which we must guard.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty. I accept that many of the schemes, which are voluntary, provide an adequate income &mdash; two-thirds of salary is reasonable and in some cases even 50 per cent, based on a decent salary, is reasonable &mdash; TDs receive 50 per cent of salary rather than two thirds, and perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will take note of that.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about people on lower levels of income.  The Minister is right, but what Deputy Walsh said about people on lower incomes is also right.  The Minister said that this problem cannot be resolved readily in the legislation, although if he reconsidered the matter he might find a way of resolving it in that way.  Perhaps it should be brought to the attention of the social partners so that it is taken into consideration in voluntary agreements. Workers on low incomes are not adequately catered for, and without a social welfare pension they have very little to live on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must ask whether the Minister's proposition should apply to the defined contribution schemes.  In those circumstances the employer has no responsibility other than to make a contribution and ensure the scheme is properly operated. In some cases a social welfare pension may be necessary to ensure the amount is adequate.  We accept the Minister's point but we are anxious to outline the difficulties for those on the lower end of the scale who, unfortunately, are too often forgotten in legislation, whether for reasons of cost or whatever.  They are the people who will experience problems in the future and <Col N="1777" /> for whom Deputy Walsh, in his proposal, is trying to cater.  I suggest that the Minister, and perhaps the board, bring these matters to the attention of the social partners so that in future negotiations the position of people at the lower end of the scale, in terms of pension as well as salaries, is given due consideration.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately many younger people, particularly up to 40 years of age, do not give much thought to pensions.  Those who are fit and healthy and living a very full life realise when they reach retirement age that they should have given greater consideration to the matter.  It reminds me of a friend who smoked for years and whose attitude was that another five or six years would not make much difference, but when he reached 65 his attitude changed and he realised the importance of an extra few years.  Young people do not appreciate the importance of pensions, and the younger the person the more important the pension will be because, according to demographic statistics, people are living longer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh is anticipating some of the problems for people on lower incomes, and I think the Minister recognised that, but we also recognise his difficulty. Greater consideration of this matter by those involved in pensions generally and by the social partners might be helpful.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(i) making a payment to another funded scheme which provides or is capable of providing long service benefit and of which he is a member or a prospective member, or&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment brings the wording of section 48 into line with section 34 and clarifies that any transfer effected by the <Col N="1778" /> trustees must be to a scheme of which the person is a member of a prospective member.  As currently worded, section 48 could technically allow the transfer to be made to any scheme, even if no link existed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will provide additional information on this amendment.  The greatest difficulty in practice in terms of transfers arises where a person is a member of a &ldquo;with-profit&rdquo; scheme.  He may suddenly leave his job, as there is now great mobility in employment.  Some of us are lucky enough to have near-permanent jobs but that does not apply to everyone.  On one day, a person could be in a high risk job which may be relatively secure but on the following day he might be in another employment, in which case he would have to bring his portable pension with him, but the pension scheme for the new job may be of a different type &mdash; for instance, a unit-linked rather than a &ldquo;with profits&rdquo; scheme.  Many people are extremely concerned about such new schemes and there should be greater clarity.  A similar effect is seen in mortgages.  People find that, having contributed for 20 years the unit funds are inadequate to fund the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this Bill is to protect the rights of scheme members and to ensure they know exactly what is in the small print.  All transfer arrangements should be clear to them, so I ask the Minister to clarify the position on this amendment.  A normal pension scheme will inform its members that a certain fund will have been built up after 20 to 30 years to provide for a pension of two thirds or a specified proportion of salary, however, that is not the case in unit linked schemes.  If the units grow adequately and do well, there will be a surplus in the fund but that is no use to someone who retires and finds his scheme is inadequately funded.  He needs information at the beginning to ensure he is adequately protected, particularly given changing job requirements and the tendency to change <Col N="1779" /> employment.  Will the Minister of State clarify this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy about the need to provide for the future. I fully appreciate that a contributor to or member of a scheme must have an adequate degree of confidence in it. Deputy Woods referred to a similar case.  This is a technical amendment to bring section 48 into line with section 34.  It provides that, in the event of a transfer effected by the trustees, it must be to a scheme of which the person is either a member or a prospective member. In other words, it provides simultaneously for both the continuing or ongoing benefit and the link.  It was felt that, if this amendment were not introduced, sections 34 and 48 as currently worded might be in conflict with one another and as a result, a contributor to or member of the scheme could be disadvantaged. In any event, this proposal does nothing more than enhance the security of the individual's investment and future.</P>
      <P>I take into account the points raised by Deputies opposite the contributors' continuing confidence in the pensions and the necessity to safeguard their interest, as they are the main people who will be affected.  I also bear in mind Deputy Walsh's point about changes in the marketplace from an investment point of view.  The market may vary greatly over a period of years and could dramatically affect benefits accruing where investments were made.  I reassure the House this proposal is merely to enhance the confidence and security of contributors.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 16 provides that the principal employer should agree any expenditure on trustee training in excess of £500 per head per annum.  Section 21 allows the trustees of a scheme to pay for trustees training from the resources of a scheme.  It is not a mandatory provision and it is open to employers to pay for such appropriate training or for an arrangement to be reached between the union, the trustees and the employer.  I understand that employers usually pay for such training.  The rules of a schemes normally refer to &ldquo;reasonable costs&rdquo; incurred by the trustees and I have brought forward an amendment to include the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  Specifying an amount in the legislation is not a suitable method for dealing with this. The disclosure of information regulations will be reviewed and amended after the enactment of this Bill.  Requiring in those regulations, mandatory disclosure of the amount spent on trustee training to all members of the scheme in the annual report might be the best way forward in conjunction with the amendment I have introduced.  I must therefore oppose that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 provides that time off for an employee during working hours for the purposes of attending appropriate training should be provided <Col N="1782" /> for on a statutory basis.  I strongly support time off for trustee training but most employers realise it is in their best interests to have trustees trained properly and would accordingly make whatever provisions are necessary, including paid time off, to ensure this happens.</P>
    <P>I am advised there are no problems in this area and, therefore, I do not see the need to put this arrangement on a statutory footing. However, I will keep the matter under review and changes will be introduced in due course if they are considered necessary.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his amendment which will insert the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;costs&rdquo;.  This meets my objective to a great extent.  It is important that adequate training be given to trustees in the complex area of pensions and pension schemes.  We do not want people who wish to retire being told by the scheme operator that their contributions are inadequate.  The 1990 Act was landmark legislation and this amendment to it is extremely important. The amendments tabled on Committee and Report Stages are extremely important in that they endeavour to take us into the next century and take into account social and demographic changes.  They have been tabled in good faith and will be seen in years to come as enlightened improvements.</P>
      <P>Many universities, regional colleges and other bodies provide training in the financial area, including pensions.  The IMI also runs specialist courses which are very valuable.  It is important that trustees are allowed time off to attend these courses and are paid whatever reasonable expenses they incur.  We have sought to ensure that trustees do not go on trips to exotic parts of the world and incur large expenses which are paid out of the funds.  This sort of activity reduces the credibility of the entire operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;costs&rdquo; meets the objective we all wish to achieve, that is <Col N="1783" /> to have adequate, proper and continuous training courses for the trustees of pension schemes.  As this objective is adequately met by the Minister's amendment I will not move my amendments Nos. 16 and 17.</P>

I deplore the fact that punctuation in modern English is not given the same attention it used to be given. Colons and semicolons are seldom used in modern literature and I urge the drafters to ensure that commas, colons and semicolons are not allowed to fall off the paper, so to speak.  Teachers in primary and second level schools and third level colleges must also give greater attention to punctuation.  At times I am amazed at reports of the proceedings of the Dáil and other events which are not properly presented or easy to read.

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;27.&mdash;Having regard to the <i>Barber</i> decision in the European Court, the ownership of all existing and future fund assets and surpluses shall be defined as belonging solely to the members of the scheme and such surpluses shall be apportioned between the members by increasing their benefits, subject to revenue limits and any balance shall be treated as a contribution holiday over a defined maximum period of 5 years.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I said I attached great importance to this amendment and asked the Minister of State to give further consideration to it before Report Stage.  I feel strongly about it as the Barber decision was a landmark one and we are dealing with their protection of the interests of members of pension schemes.  At times cases in this and other jurisdictions are brought to our attention where contributions are pilfered and the unfortunate members are left high and dry.  Predators, asset strippers, who see a surplus of several million pounds in a scheme acquire the company and pass the surplus on to the new company.  These surpluses rightly belong to the contributors, and the decision in the 1990 Barber case made that very clear by affirming that pensions are deferred pay which belongs exclusively to the workers.  Instead of taking home all their pay many workers put part of it aside for their retirement and or other reasons.  This pay is withheld by employers and put into a separate pension fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision in the Barber case stipulated that, even if all contributions were <Col N="1785" /> made by employers &mdash; most companies make certain contributions in addition to their workers &mdash; and none by workers, the fund represented deferred pay and was owned by workers.  Being the owners of the fund the workers have a right to distribution of the fund's surplus. They are the only people who have a right to that surplus since it was they who made the contributions, it was their deferred pay that went into the fund and formed that surplus.  The sole purpose of pension contributions should be to provide pension benefits for members, not to accumulate surpluses to attract predators; in other words, to protect the interests and assets of scheme members.  Pension surpluses are the exclusive property of members, as was made absolutely clear by the decision in the Barber case.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there were instances of pension funds and surpluses having gone astray.  There was a case of an ICI surplus which, when that company was acquired by another, went to the new company.  In any case of a take-over or privatisation members' contributions, the fund built up by them, must be protected and guaranteed against any such eventuality.</P>
    <P>My amendment would guarantee that.  There are several precedents for such a guarantee, specifically the decision in the Barber case which made it abundantly clear that the funds and surpluses belong exclusively to its members.  There is a fear or sense of insecurity on the part of ordinary rank and file workers who defer their pay and generally meet their PAYE commitments. Since we are in the course of passing legislation to take us well into the next century, it is incumbent on us to be extremely careful and prudent in the manner in which we frame it.  Everything we do should be in the interests of members and contributors to pension schemes.  This is true more especially when not alone do members make their contributions but the Exchequer contributes very largely and supports pension schemes and their contributors.  It <Col N="1786" /> is estimated that between the tax advantage of making pension contributions and the tax concession when one draws one's pension and lump sum, approximately £250 million in tax is deferred or foregone annually.  The State is extremely helpful and generous in relation to pension funds and encourages people in every way to provide for their retirement, at considerable cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in the drive by the State to make contributing to pension schemes attractive through deferred pay, any surplus funds might be siphoned off or confiscated in some other way.  With the favourable improvement in the investment climate in recent years, workers are opting to retire earlier but there will need to be adequate funds available to guarantee them an adequate pension.</P>
    <P>I intend to press my amendment for the very good reason that members' rights and contributions must be fully protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we discussed this issue on Committee Stage I have taken considerable advice from a number of parties, including the Pensions Board. The one issue that has emerged very clearly from those discussions is that one has to be very clear about the definition and nature of a &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; and exactly how it can arise.  One needs to understand the nature of funding in a defined benefit pension scheme to understand how excess assets build up in a scheme year.</P>
      <P>Once moneys or other assets have been transferred into a trust fund they cannot be withdrawn except in so far as authorised by the trust deed or by law, unless all the beneficiaries agree or the trust is wound up.  There is a fundamental distinction to be drawn between a continuous fund and one being wound up.  So long as the fund is continuous no beneficiary has any interest in particular assets.  These are vested solely in the trustees and cannot be withdrawn by an employer or members unless authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> In a continuous fund, the surplus is the amount by which the actuarially estimated value of the scheme assets at a given time exceeds the actuarially estimated value of its liabilities.  Valuation on an ongoing basis involves a number of long-term projections and assumptions. The actuary compares the present value of an estimated stream of future income with the present value of an estimated stream of future liabilities.  On this basis, a surplus exists at any time when the present value of the future income exceeds the present value of the future liabilities.</P>
    <P>In calculating these values, the actuary must employ a wide range of actuarial assumptions.  These include financial assumptions as to the earnings increases, price increases and investment returns and demographic assumptions as to mortality rates, rates of entry into and withdrawal from pensionable service and rates of early retirement in good health and in ill health.  Since these are long-term assumptions, it is highly unlikely they will exactly match assets to liabilities at any given time.</P>
    <P>It follows that a surplus cannot be accurately identified by a valuation on an ongoing basis.  For reasons of prudence and given the uncertainties involved, actuaries tend to be conservative in their assumptions, a factor which can lead to over-funding on an ongoing basis.  What may be shown as a surplus using one actuarial method or set of assumptions may appear as a deficit if a different method or set of assumptions is used.  Moreover, since the value of a surplus or deficit normally is small in relation to the value of the assets and liabilities, it can require only a modest variation in a particular assumption to make a substantial difference to the asset-liability equation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it follows that from a legal viewpoint any surplus in an ongoing fund is purely notional.  The existence of a surplus cannot be finally determined except at the point at which the scheme is wound up and beneficiaries' rights are crystallised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> Unless otherwise provided by the scheme rules, or authorised by all the beneficiaries, a trust fund must be maintained intact for the purpose of the scheme until it is wound up.  An employer cannot withdraw assets from the fund.  A scheme member becomes entitled to benefit only on retirement or having fulfilled other conditions laid down in the scheme rules or documentation. Therefore, in relation to a continuous fund, ownership of a surplus does not arise in legal terms.</P>
    <P>Ownership of the pension fund in the true sense arises only when the scheme is wound up.  At that point the rights of members crystallise, the assets comprising the fund must be sold and members' entitlements under the scheme documentation secured from the proceeds. The distribution of any surplus assets remaining after members' entitlements have been fully paid or secured is determined by the trust deed and rules.  This can be in a variety of ways as follows: (i) it may be mandatory for trustees to augment member benefits; (ii) any augmentation of member benefits may have to be done with the consent of the employer or in consultation with the employer and (iii) after augmentation, if so permitted, any surplus then arising may revert to the employer.</P>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, the issue is complex and before we decide on the need for legislation in this area the Pensions Board should examine the matter in detail.  The original National Pensions Board discussed this topic, but did not consider it a live issue as pensions in Ireland, unlike in the UK, were not developed to such an extent that significant real surpluses arise and that is still considered the position.  Therefore, there is no need to rush into legislation, the best approach is as I have proposed.</P>
    <P>Deputies should be clear that any proposal along the lines suggested by Deputy Walsh in this amendment could have adverse effects as it could lead to a reduction in the level of funding by employers or have implications for the development of occupational schemes generally, given their voluntary nature. <Col N="1789" /> In its examination the Pensions Board would address the present position and all the likely knock-on effects.  Given the composition of the board, all interests would be considered in the review.  For that important reason I must oppose the amendment.</P>

I disagree with the claim that Irish pension schemes are not well developed.  They are quite well developed and we have a total fund of £16 billion, which, by Irish standards, is a considerable amount of money.</P>
      <P>A balance of advantage still rests with the employers in regard to the composition of the board.  For all those reasons and emphasising the importance of protecting scheme members I will press this amendment.</P>

The obligation to submit a short written report would discourage somebody from dropping into a telephone kiosk and making a call which could necessitate a substantial inquiry and perhaps an unnecessary investigation and it would save time.  That reports must be submitted in writing should not deter a person concerned about the manner in which a scheme is being administered from communicating his concern to the Pensions Board.

Will a concentration of investments in a small number of quoted companies be considered an inappropriate investment, because it does not adequately diversify risk?  A high concentration in equities might be considered inappropriate for a mature pensions scheme and it is not clear how the Pensions Board will form its view as to what constitutes an inappropriate investment for a specific scheme.</P>
    <P>In Ireland there are fairly limited opportunities in equities and we do not have a large number of quoted companies. Nonetheless, the publicly quoted companies are sound.  There is a general belief that a far greater proportion of pension funds should be invested in Irish equities.  The total pension fund available for investment is of the order of £16 billion and it is regrettable that only 23 per cent of that fund is invested in Irish equities.  I cannot understand how fund managers invest the contribution of the ordinary workers, the PAYE sector and others who pay into a pension scheme, because it surely would be in their long-term interest to support Irish companies by investing in them rather than having fund managers take the funds to various parts of the globe for investment.</P>
    <P>There are many suitable investment vehicles and I use this occasion to exhort fund managers to invest a greater proportion of funds in Irish equities.  In the past number of years some Irish companies have been wholly or partially privatised giving ordinary people an opportunity, especially through pension <Col N="1796" /> funds, to make solid investments in them.  It would be preferable to have contributions from Irish workers going to Irish companies rather than to multinational company fund managers making investments in Irish companies.</P>
    <P>A number of our co-ops are now publicly quoted.  In recent weeks the limit of 51 per cent has been breached which will make it possible for foreign fund managers to invest substantial sums in our co-ops and the food industry.  It would be more desirable to have Irish pension funds invest in the development and modernisation of those companies. This would be a more stable investment than the investment of moneys by fund managers in a company solely for profit.</P>
    <P>In the case of Telecom Éireann in which we are asking multinational companies to invest up to a certain percentage, I can see no good reason ordinary workers should not be encouraged to make an investment in its modernisation and development to ensure employment is maintained and the most modern technology is available to it.</P>
    <P>The ratio of investment of pension funds outside Ireland and in fixed interest schemes is far too great and not proportional.  I make a plea to fund managers to invest a greater proportion of pension funds in Irish companies as they will get a good return.  We have a good economy and a good economic performance by indigenous Irish companies.</P>
    <P>Approximately 75 per cent of pension funds are of no value to the economy in terms of the creation and maintenance of jobs.  It is right and proper in a discussion on pension funds that we should allude to where investments are made. Is there a good reason fund managers have not invested greater sums in Irish companies?  Is it considered an inappropriate investment?  Is that the reason only 22.8 per cent of pension funds have been invested in Irish companies?  I have not received satisfactory answers to these questions.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the board should publish guidelines as to the methodology it will employ to form the view <Col N="1797" /> as to what constitutes an inappropriate investment for a specific pension scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>A report on pension fund investment in Ireland has been commissioned by the Minister for Finance and should be available shortly.  It will address most of the concerns expressed by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to provide that the board must publish guidelines on the methodology it will employ to form the view of what constitutes an inappropriate investment for a specific pension scheme.  These provisions deal with applications to the High Court and it is my hope and expectation that they will be used only in extreme cases.</P>
      <P>It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to set out in advance what precisely would constitute an inappropriate investment, except in obvious circumstances. It was agreed on Committee Stage that one could say it would be inappropriate to put funds on a horse at a race meeting, even at the right odds. In most cases it may not be possible to be absolutely precise.</P>
      <P>The trustee handbook, which will be published in the near future by the Pensions Board, will deal with the proper investment of funds by trustees and should, therefore, be helpful in relation to the suggestion made by the Deputy in the amendment.  This provision gives the board the right to seek a High Court order in relation to an investment. Before the court grants such an order it will have to be satisfied that the investment concerned is inappropriate and likely to jeopardise the rights and interests of the members of the scheme. This is a reasonable precaution in the circumstances.  Unfortunately, I have to oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>(c) one additional ordinary member shall be a representative of the investment management industry,</P>
      <P>(d) one additional ordinary member shall be nominated on the recommendation of the Consumers' Association of Ireland,</P>
      <P>(e) one additional ordinary member shall be a pensioner trustee,`,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I asked the Minister of State if he would consider including a provision to provide that one additional ordinary member shall be a representative of the investment management industry, that one additional ordinary member shall be nominated on the recommendation of the Consumers' Association of ireland and that one additional ordinary member shall be a pensioner trustee.  I do not know if he has had an opportunity to consider this reasonable request in the meantime, but given his attitude so far today it will probably to turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to my request that one additional ordinary member should be a representative of the investment management industry, it is the investment managers who manage investments. We are talking about large sums of money and an industry which receives substantial support from the taxpayer.  As we are aware, those who contribute to pension funds can avail of attractive tax rates.  A person may contribute up to 15 per cent of his or her salary to a pension fund and avail of full tax relief.  A further improvement was made in the Finance Bill.  A person aged 55 years or over may now contribute up to 20 per cent of his or her salary to a pension fund and avail of full tax relief. This was an enlightened amendment.  I hope the age limit will be reduced to 45. <Col N="1799" /> In relation to my request that one additional ordinary member should be nominated on the recommendation of the Consumers' Association of Ireland, in this Bill we are seeking clarity to ensure that those who contribute to a pension fund know what they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes to Detective Garda McCabe.  The assassination of any member of the force is shocking and, before addressing the principle of this measure, I would like to be associated with the various tributes that were paid in connection with this outrageous episode.  I also take this opportunity to wish a speedy recovery to Detective Garda McCabe's colleague.</P>
      <P>I understand why the Minister for Justice must introduce this legislation.  It is an attempt to resolve a long-standing dispute which has brought no credit to the force.  The Minister can relax because Fianna Fáil will not divide the House on this issue.  The measure will not be defeated at the conclusion of this debate.  Fianna Fáil supports the Minister on this issue.  It is important to note that this side of the House takes a constructive and responsible approach in relation to the administration of criminal law.  Harsh criticisms have been made on this side of the House about that subject which relates to the failure of the Government to come to grips with some aspects of the extensive problems of crime, drug abuse and lawlessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering this matter from first principles, in that context the Minister quoted the words of Mr. Justice Walsh in the Aughey case, it is essential that there should be one representative body with which the Minister can negotiate. Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on justice made it clear that the party is of the view it is desirable that there should be only one Garda representative body.  As a matter of first principles, there is no obligation on anyone to join a body. Members of the Garda Síochána are not obliged to belong to the Garda Representative Association.  It is not being <Col N="1801" /> suggested that there is such a duty on any member of the force.  However, the Minister must be in a position to deal with some group or body of persons.  I take it that is why the necessity has arisen to introduce this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a constitutional right not to belong to a body but it is important to state that the federation has a constitutional right to form an association. However, this legislation is not about the formation of associations, it is concerned with the right to negotiate with the Minister.  It involves the bodies with which the Minister can deal.  It would be impossible for the Minister for Justice to deal with a multiplicity of associations representing one rank in the force.  A body is entitled to form an association; what is at issue is the question of negotiation rights.  Short of reforming the ranks structure, there is no other way forward for the Minister than the course she has adopted.</P>
    <P>The regrettable feature of this Bill is that it may not necessarily solve the problem it seeks to address.  There is a substantial continuity in the Bill between the Garda Representation Association and the body, as reformed and revised by this measure, which will exist following the implementation of the Bill.  This leaves the problem of the dissatisfied members who opted to form an alternative body.  The Minister has sought to bring these people on board by reforming the structure of the Garda Representative Association.  I appeal to all sides, at the conclusion of this debate, to look again at whether it would be possible to reach a satisfactory agreement on this matter through mediation.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to reflect on the Minister, but it is disappointing that the dispute must be brought before this House for resolution.  I urge her to provide time, following the conclusion of Second Stage, to allow the parties a final opportunity to resolve their differences in an amicable way.  In recent days there have been signs of further divisions within the alternative body which was established after the initial dispute that arose in the <Col N="1802" /> Garda Representative Association.  I appeal to the Minister to consider whether the Committee Stage of the Bill could be delayed to allow the parties a final opportunity to resolve their differences. If that is not possible, the measure must proceed.  From the point of view of the representation of the membership of the Garda Síochána, it is important that representative structures exist which are viable, function and enable representations to be made through proper, orderly channels to the Department and the Minister in connection with the conditions of service of members of the force.  If that machinery is not present, there is a definite gap in the system of orderly relations between the Minister for Justice and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>From reading the Bill, I understand that the essential compromise the Minister has struck is that she is prescribing a new rule book for the association.  This provision is set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  The Minister is also providing an appeals mechanism to deal with the cases of those disciplined by the association. Those disciplinary measures were a substantial part of the dispute between the Grada Representative Association and its dissatisfied members.</P>
    <P>With regard to prescribing a rule book for the force, questions can be asked as to how much independence a representative body retains when the Minister must lay down the rules and regulations governing its administration. In her reply will the Minister deal with the extent to which consultations were held with the different bodies on the precise contents of this Schedule, which sets out a mandatory rule book for the representative association?  A point that arises on the Schedule is that the Garda College at Templemore will no longer have a representative on the executive of the association.  The statute provides that the Garda College at Templemore shall be deemed to be a district of the Tipperary division and I understand that to mean there will no longer be direct representation from the training <Col N="1803" /> college on the executive of the representative association.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine that matter again because it relates only to one representative, and while the number of persons engaged at the college is quite small, the number of persons there at any one time is quite substantial and they will have numerous representations to make in connection with their conditions.</P>
    <P>Another matter the Minister might clarify relates to the question of the appointment of a president and a vice-president at the annual conference.  On reading the Schedule, apart from anything the Minister said in her contribution, it is unclear to me exactly what the procedure will be under this proposal on the election of a president and a vice-president of the association.</P>
    <P>I agree with a point raised by Deputy Dukes on the question of the general secretary.  I take it the reason for the general secretary being a member of the force was that he was under the same discipline as the other members whom he represented.  It seems unobjectionable that a person outside the force could be appointed general secretary of the representative association.  I do not see any reason that appointment should be subject to the approval of the Minister who may attach such conditions to such approval as he or she thinks fit. This seems to be a rather cumbersome, bureaucratic intrusion on what should be a matter of internal choice for the representative association.</P>
    <P>There is provision in paragraph 10 (8) of the Schedule that persons appointed to be the general secretary, deputy general secretary and assistant general secretary may attend meetings of the central executive committee by leave of the committee but they shall not be members of the central executive committee, shall not vote on matters submitted to the vote of the central executive committee and shall not propose or second motions at a meeting of the central executive committee.</P>
    <P>That provision is unworkable because <Col N="1804" /> it envisages that the central executive committee and the permanent staff side of the association should be in a position to separate themselves.  While I accept that the staff side in the association should not propose or second motions or have a vote at meetings of the executive, the provision is unworkable unless they at least have the right of attendance at executive meetings.</P>
    <P>Any person appointed to the position of general secretary, deputy general secretary or assistant general secretary must have the right to attend and speak at meetings of the executive.  It is difficult to see how a harmonious relationship could exist between the executive and the staff side in the absence of such an express provision in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I raise these somewhat detailed matters in relation to the Schedule because we are laying down detailed rules and regulations for the internal operation of the representative association.  There is an onus on us to examine them with great care.</P>
    <P>In section 2 it is provided that an association established under the Act for the rank of garda should have the support of such majority of the membership of that rank as satisfies the Minister that in matters which concern that rank as a whole, the association can speak and make agreements on behalf of that rank as a whole.  There is no specified per centum or majority set out in that section and it gives the Minister a far-reaching power in relation to the recognition of the association.  It is improper to give a Minister such a vague, wide-ranging power to in effect refuse to recognise a representative association established under statute.</P>
    <P>If we, as a body, believe the Garda Síochána is entitled to have a representative structure, it should not be left open to the Minister to decide that a representative association does not speak for or make agreements on behalf of that rank as a whole on the basis of a somewhat vague criterion that she must be satisfied it has the support of such majority of the membership as satisfies her that it is representative.  A <Col N="1805" /> more definite criterion than that would have to be laid down in the Bill if any credence or respect is to be had for the association which, as amended, will operate under this legislation.  I appeal to the Minister to re-examine section 2 to see whether a more definite criterion can be laid down.</P>
    <P>On the question of the review of certain disciplinary decisions referred to in section 6, it is envisaged that a statutory procedure should be established enabling a review of internal disciplinary decisions arrived at by the representative body.  On reading the section one can see it applies to decisions made by the association since 1 January 1994 in relation to the member or former member as may be specified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify in her reply whether the review procedure envisaged by the legislation will apply to proceedings already before the courts because, as I am sure the Minister is aware, a number of court cases are pending in relation to the exercise of disciplinary powers by the representative association.  Any attempt through this legislation to interfere with those proceedings might be found by the courts to be unconstitutional.  It would be unfortunate if a measure, carefully balanced though it may be, enacted by us for the purpose of establishing a representative body for the rank of garda infringed the Constitution and became unworkable as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take care with regard to section 6.  It is not open to us to simply appoint a committee to review a disciplinary decision which may be the subject matter of a judicial review or judicial proceedings elsewhere.  I ask the Minister to deal with this matter in her reply.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil does not propose to divide the House on the Bill.  There is a technical point in relation to section 1 where it is provided that, for the purpose of representing members of the Garda Síochána in matters affecting their welfare and efficiency, there may be established one association and one <Col N="1806" /> association only for each rank of the Garda Síochána.  I always understood that sergeants and inspectors had an association representing two ranks and I am not sure whether that practice is correctly comprehended in the measure as drafted in section 1.  That is another matter the Minister might consider when replying to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the people were shocked, saddened and reminded yet again of the vulnerability of members of the Garda Síochána as they struggle every day to maintain law and order on our behalf.  In certain areas society is beset by social disintegration, increasing levels of violence and the ever present threat of violence from paramilitaries, be they the IRA, the INLA or others on the unrepresentative lunatic fringe.  The cold-blooded slaughter of Garda McCabe and the attempted murder of his colleague shocked all of us and reminded us of the debt we politicians and society owe the Garda Síochána. Garda McCabe's murder was directed not only at the serving police officer and his comrade &mdash; both men with outstanding records of service &mdash; but was an assault on all of us and on society itself and must be condemned wholeheartedly.  In a civilised society there can be only one response to outrages of this kind &mdash; wholehearted, unequivocal condemnation and a determination to pursue those responsible with the full force of the law.  Anything less would compromise all of us.</P>
      <P>We need to recognise the deficiencies in our policing system.  I would argue most strongly that we need to provide innovative and constructive responses to the new challenges facing us as a society.  We need to recognise that society, particularly urban society, has changed drastically since the establishment of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party welcomes this Bill.  At a time when many parts of the country are facing a mounting crime wave it is unacceptable that the energies of the Garda Síochána should be diverted into such an unseemly and unhelpful internal <Col N="1807" /> police squabble.  The provisions of this Bill will ensure that the situation we have confronted in recent years is not repeated while also ensuring that members of the Garda have recourse to democratic representation.  No one would wish to deny them that important democratic right.  Most of us will have read the statement by the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Patrick Culligan, who called for a wider debate on the changing role of a the Garda Síochána.  I am happy that we should have this opportunity to address that issue.  He expressed particular concern that the crime problem &ldquo;has been exaggerated by members of both the political establishment and the media&rdquo;.  I realise that much of the debate has been anything but flattering to the Garda Síochána.  I appreciate the frustrations felt by the Garda as it attempts to tackle the problem without the necessary financial or material resources, and in some cases judicial resources, at its disposal.</P>
    <P>Mr. Culligan is undoubtedly right when he points out that Ireland as a whole has a low crime rate compared with other developed societies. However, dealing in averages is misleading. Some areas of Dublin City are battling with a drugs and crime problem which is almost impossible to overestimate, while at the same time within Dublin there are communities, areas and postal districts that have little or no local crime.</P>
    <P>In Dublin's south inner city there are an estimated 1,000 intravenous drug users as well as the frightening and alarming fact that approximately 500 young people, some as young as 12 years, are engaged in the smoking of heroin which ultimately will lead to intravenous drug use, addiction and increased crime levels for those communities.</P>
    <P>Juvenile crime, much of which is associated with drugs, has reached alarming proportions.  In 1994 a total of 14,720 juvenile cases were reported nationally.  Over half of those involved were aged between 13 and 16.  Of the <Col N="1808" /> 14,720 juvenile cases reported, 7,500 crimes were committed by young men and young women between the ages of 13 and 16.  That augurs badly for the future.  A disproportionate number of these crimes would have occurred in inner city areas and in the sprawling local authority estates on the outskirts of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>In this context it is inevitable that public representatives as well as the media should question the organisational and operational efficiency of the Garda Síochána as it attempts to fight crime.  It is disappointing that the Garda Síochána has been singularly unsuccessful in making arrests of those gangsters &mdash; romantically known as hitmen &mdash; who roam not only Dublin but other parts of the country and who can shoot down in cold blood, often unmasked in the capital city and in my constituency, be it in the Drimnagh Road, Weaver Street or wherever.  I am not aware of the arrest of any of these hired killers. That disturbs me and my constituents.  I am disturbed to the extent that I question the organisational and the operational efficiency of the Garda Síochána in tackling this type of modern criminal.</P>
    <P>The questioning we must engage in should not focus exclusively on the Garda Síochána.  As Mr. Culligan pointed out, we need an integrated approach involving not only the Garda but the statutory and voluntary agencies. It is incredible that we do not have an effective and statutorily-based system of co-operation between the Garda Síochána and Revenue Commissioners to target the drug barons, many of whose names and business interests are well known.  I would welcome the establishment of a task force involving the relevant agencies and Departments with the specific aim of targeting drug profits and drug barons.</P>
    <P>It is not only at national level that we need an integrated approach to the crime and drugs epidemic.  Such an approach is equally vital at local level.  I suggest we need to examine and implement options such as community policing councils, together with <Col N="1809" /> expanded community drugs teams, fast track treatment facilities and accessible drugs education programmes.  I appeal to the Minister to examine urgently the provision of extra resources for the forensic science laboratory to ensure that evidence collected in respect of drugs charges can be processed with the minimum delay and that suspects are not released, as they are today, for up to six months pending examination of the drugs that have been found on the person.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met Chancellor Kohl in Bonn on Tuesday 4 June.  The meeting was most successful and afforded me the opportunity of a wide-ranging exchange of views with the Chancellor.  We discussed the major items on the agenda of the European Union against the background of the forthcoming Florence European Council and the Irish Presidency. The issues we discussed included employment, internal security matters, in particular the fight against drugs and organised crime, the Intergovernmental Conference, economic and monetary union, European security, the situation in former Yugoslavia and the external <Col N="1810" /> relations of the Union notably with the applicant countries, Russia and the US.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the BSE crisis and agreed that the main concentration should be to support the efforts of the Italian presidency and the Commission to bring about a resolution to this problem. We agreed that the key issue was restoration of European consumer confidence in beef and that this can only be forged on the basis of measures taken in accordance with the best scientific advice available.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased with the strong support the Chancellor gave to Ireland's presidency priorities, notably in the crime and drugs area.  We agreed to keep in close contact during the Irish presidency.  I also look forward to receiving Chancellor Kohl on an official visit to Ireland on 2 and 3 October this year.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Florence European Council, as the member state currently holding the EU presidency, it is for Italy in the first instance to propose the matters for discussion at the Council.  The Italian presidency has not yet finalised its proposals in this regard.  I had a short meeting yesterday with the Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Romano Prodi, in Brussels and we had a preliminary discussion of the likely agenda for the Florence Council.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is likely that the main items on the Council agenda will be employment, the Intergovernmental Conference, economic and monetary union and the fight against drug trafficking and organised crime.  In addition, a wide number of external relations issues will arise including the situation in former Yugoslavia and in Russia.</P>
    <P>The BSE issue is also likely to be on the agenda for the Council.  The Italian Presidency and the Commission are engaged in intensive efforts to try to resolve this issue before the Florence Council.  It is my strong hope that these efforts are successful thereby enabling the Florence Council to address fully the major items on the EU's agenda to which I referred to earlier in my reply.</P>

      <P>The British Government needs to stop its policy of non co-operation and that will happen if it is accompanied by agreement to a framework of procedures for a staged removal of bans on the export of commodities based on scientific and other evidence being presented in a structured way in accordance with an agreed framework.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree there was no agreement between him and the Chancellor on how the BSE problem should be approached?  Will he also agree there is a grave danger the BSE crisis will overshadow the Irish Presidency priorities?  Will the Taoiseach give details of his discussions on policing the drugs problem?  Apparently, the budget for the relevant EU agency based in Amsterdam has been blocked for this year and it may have to close.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my discussion on the drugs issue with various European colleagues I stressed the need to ensure that adequate budgetary provision is made at Community level for Community action.  It is not sufficient to adopt measures unless the financial means are made available to realise the measures.</P>
      <P>In my discussion with the Chancellor there was a large measure of agreement on the approach to be adopted to resolve the BSE crisis.  There are deep concerns in Germany on this matter. The consumption of beef in Germany has fallen to a fraction of its previous levels.  Indeed, beef consumption in continental countries has fallen more than in Britain.  This is a great problem for Germany and other continental countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a desire to deal with the issue in a structured way without emotion and <Col N="1812" /> table thumping.  It is on that basis, relying on science and properly monitored and enforced procedures, that the issue may be resolved, rather than through high profile political gestures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the British Government's veto on EU business unrelated to BSE? Does he agree it is bad for partnership in the EU and makes a quick resolution of the matter all the more important? Does the Taoiseach see any merit in the suggestion that the UK could be divided into regions so that areas such as Northern Ireland, which do not seem to have the same BSE problems, could be treated separately?  I understand it costs the Department of Justice more than £400,000 per week to prevent people smuggling cattle across the Border.  Is there merit in the suggestion that Northern Ireland should be isolated in terms of the BSE issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the first part of the Deputy's question is concerned, I publicly indicated my strong disapproval of Britain's approach in blocking unrelated business in response to this matter.  That is not the way to transact business in a Union based on the concept of community.  That approach must not continue and must not be rewarded.  On the other hand, it is important that the Union demonstrates an ability to deal with issues of difference in a structured manner.  For that reason I indicated my strong support for the approach of the Commission President and the Italian President of the Council &mdash; both of whom I met yesterday &mdash; who want to reach agreement on a procedure for dealing on a staged basis, on receipt of adequate reassurances, with the gradual removal of the ban.  It is important that this is based on science and not on political pressure.  Segmentation of the market in various ways is a possible ingredient in any framework for a gradual easing of the ban, but we must bear in mind that the consumer must be satisfied that he or she is buying a safe product.  This can <Col N="1813" /> be achieved only if the Union is seen to act in accordance with properly enforced and researched scientific procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What specific initiatives has the Government proposed to deal with crime and drugs during the Presidency?  What is the Taoiseach's view of the expressed preference of the German Government for the creation of an inner dynamic core of member states in the European Union?  Does he favour the concept of an inner and outer tier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not favour an approach which would divide members into categories of insiders and comparative outsiders.  In doing its business, the Union should proceed as a union. Under the Maastricht arrangements for economic and monetary union, it is possible for some countries to proceed to economic and monetary union before others.  That reality was established in the Maastricht Treaty, under which we are bound to operate.  However, I do not favour the concept of a two or three speed European development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of crime, one of our priorities during the European Presidency will be to bring into effect the Europol convention, if that has not already been done during the Italian Presidency.  In regard to the question of drugs, we are anxious to agree arrangements on co-operation and information exchange between forensic laboratories. We want to agree procedures for higher and more uniform penalties for drug trafficking so that there will not be any country in the Union where the penalties are so low as to make it an attractive location for people managing a European trade in drugs.  We also want to enhance the existing controls and means of detection on external land and sea boundaries of the Union to interdict the importation of drugs.  Furthermore, we will seek to use Community funds to support a programme of prevention of drug dependence and the enhancement of Community budget provisions in that regard.  We will also seek the use of <Col N="1814" /> Community funds for the provision of alternative crops in producing countries outside the Union whose most profitable means of living at present is the production of crops which are subsequently used in the manufacture of drugs.  We have agreed a programme of action for a range of issues and I have put these proposals to my colleagues when I have had occasion to meet them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his information, but I am sure he will appreciate that many of those issues have been on the agenda for a number of years.  What does he propose to do about non-European countries, such as Afghanistan, where opium is grown and transported in half tonne lots, mainly through south eastern Turkey, into the Community?  While people can co-ordinate actions, legislation and penalties, for almost 20 years criminals based in Turkey have been successfully transporting drugs into Europe.  They brought one and a half tonnes of drugs into the Community from two separate locations last year and those locations and the people involved are known in Europe.  What does the Taoiseach propose to do about countries that survive on producing such substances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The key to action in this area is the exchange of information between police and customs authorities in Union and non-Union countries. Apart from the establishment of Europol, one of our priorities during the Presidency will be to promote closer co-operation between customs authorities, the police and trade bodies so that conventional trading methods may not be used as vehicles for transporting drugs and those masterminding drug traffic through such methods are brought to book on the basis of good information sent to the authorities who are in a position to interdict such trade.</P>

      <P>On Friday 31 May 1996, I met the chairman and secretary of the Constitution Review Group when a typed copy of the final report of the group was presented to me.  Further typed copies of the report were made available by the secretariat of the group to my Department on 7 June for circulation to members of the Government. I have forwarded copies, on a confidential basis, to the leaders of the Opposition parties.</P>
      <P>The report is now being prepared by the secretariat for printing and I expect to receive copies for publication later this month.  The secretariat is also assembling background material which will be placed in the Oireachtas Library and made available to the proposed all-party committee on the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chairman, Dr. Whitaker, the members of the group and the secretariat for their hard work in completing their complex and difficult assignment in such an excellent manner in a very short time.</P>

      <P>When is it proposed to publish the report?  Will it be published by the end of the month?  If so, when will the all-party committee on the Constitution comprising Members of this House be set up and when will it hold its first meeting to consider the recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy's party for nominating one of its members to serve on the committee and for its indication of willingness to take part.  I am awaiting names from other parties and as soon as they are received we will proceed with the committee.  The committee can be established straight away because a number of interim reports from this body are already in the public domain and will be available to the committee.  I assure the House that the full report will be published before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> A logistical task remains to be done of preparing an index to accompany the printed copy &mdash; the copy the Deputy's leader received does not contain an index.  That index is being prepared and the document is being printed.  It is a very long and substantial document consisting of 654 pages and there are some printing delays, but it will be available before the end of the month.  I would like the committee to start work as quickly as possible and I hope to receive names from other parties.  A number of parties have not yet nominated members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach suggest a timeframe for completion of the committee's deliberations?  Perhaps the date of 31 December next might be fixed, otherwise the matter could drag on interminably and none of the necessary changes to the Constitution will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision will be made for the body to produce interim reports.  When the all-party group meets it will be free to determine its own procedure and if it wishes to set a deadline of 31 December it may do so.  In matters on which the all-party committee agrees, action should be taken quickly and it will be possible for it to produce interim reports on those matters.  The document prepared by the Whitaker committee is a very comprehensive one. It is a massive piece of work dealing not only with the aspects of the Constitution that are most frequently the subject of public controversy but also with a range of issues in the Constitution, some of a technical character, which deserve to be addressed.  Against the background of the size and breadth of the Whitaker report it is unlikely the committee will have completed all the work on it by the end of the year.  To set a deadline for all the work to be completed within that timeframe would not do justice to the task undertaken by the Whitaker committee. No problem will exist in regard to the presentation of interim reports.</P>

A member of my party was on the committee, which devoted an extraordinary amount of time, including at night and weekends, to compiling the report and I thank them for that.

I have in mind in particular the urgent and sensitive question of the possible amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.

      <P>The question of the matters we indicated to the committee were being dealt with separately has been adverted to in correspondence I received about the report from Deputies Ahern and Harney.  I responded to both Deputies indicating that the all-party committee is not precluded from dealing with these matters. The most appropriate way of dealing <Col N="1818" /> with Articles 2 and 3 is in the context of the all-party negotiations taking place in Belfast at present, at which the Government is represented.</P>
      <P>The Government indicated in the Framework Document and in earlier statements that we are willing to promote amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution as part of an overall settlement of other issues that are also being discussed in the all-party negotiations. That is the best way to deal with that matter rather than attempting to deal with it separately.  The all-party committee is not precluded from expressing a view on that matter if it so wishes, although the best use of time by the all-party committee might be to address other Articles of the Constitution first.</P>

      <P>The only contact between the Prime Minister's office and mine was the following: on Saturday, 13 April following the conclusion of the District Court proceedings, an official of the Prime Minister's office was in telephone contact with an official of my office to ensure that the appropriate arrangements were in place on the Irish side in relation to the sending of a further warrant.  The official from my office was able, following consultation with the office of the Attorney General, to confirm to the Prime Minister's office that the relevant law officers from both sides were already in contact about the matter and that the appropriate arrangements were in place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last Question Time on this matter I asked the Taoiseach whether, to his knowledge or that of the Attorney General, the detective superintendent, on the occasion of the court case, was interviewed by representatives of the State as to whether he physically handed over the warrant to the Garda Síochána the night before the case.  The Taoiseach indicated that he was not aware of what happened in that regard.  Subsequently I put down a question to the Minister for Justice to which she replied that not only was there contact subsequent to the court case but on the date of the court case the detective superintendent was interviewed about his involvement in the transport of the warrant.  In view of that information, does the Taoiseach accept that representatives of the State, that is, he and other members of the Government, were aware from a very early time that the fault lay not on the British side but on the Irish side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I already indicated my answer to that question in extensive replies to this House on two days.  I said quite clearly that the Irish Government was not in a position to make any decision as to where the fault lay in this matter until it had received the report from the Garda Síochána authorities, which it did not receive until 21 May, and any suggestions to the contrary are not true.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept what the Minister for Justice has already confirmed &mdash; that the British superintendent was interviewed on <Col N="1820" /> the occasion of the court case and subsequently? On a related issue, in view of the way this case has been handled, given that under the amended extradition legislation the Attorney General and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor deliberate on the freedom of an Irish citizen, and given that the documents transmitted to the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice are merely photocopies of original documents, does the Taoiseach not accept that there is need for change in the procedure for handling these extradition cases?</P>

      <P>If on Saturday, 13 April there was consultation between the Office of the Attorney General in Ireland and the equivalent office in England about the delivery of a further warrant, does that not demonstrate that both those offices accepted that the original warrant was not available to them in either London or Dublin and hence had been destroyed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was consultation between the Office of the Attorney General and that of his counterpart in Britain on the day in question.  As I indicated at some length on previous occasions, this focused on the issue and acceptance of a further warrant.  It was not possible, as I have explained on many occasions at great length in the House, to come to definitive conclusions at that time about where the fault lay as to the reason the original document was not available in the court on the day in question, as it ought to have been.  However, conclusions were reached in the report <Col N="1821" /> presented to the Minister for Justice which she in turn presented to the House in answer to a Deputy on 21 May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go back over the questions I asked the last day as that would probably be out of order.  Since the last Question Time on this issue, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 2 June outlined that a report carried out by Detective Superintendent Pat Murphy was begun on Saturday, 13 April, the date of the court case, and was presented to his superiors the following Monday, 15 April.  The article further states categorically that the Garda informed the Department of Justice on that date that they accepted responsibility for the error.  Does the Taoiseach still categorically deny this ever happened &mdash; that is, that the Garda acknowledged responsibility for that error to the Department of Justice on Monday 15 April?  After all this time, when it has been proved beyond doubt that the Department did know on that date, is it not time for the Taoiseach to come clean and state that, although he may not have known, it was known? Anyone who checked would have found that on Monday 15 April the Garda had accepted there was an error, although they had not stated whether the document was shredded or lost or something else had happened to it.  We are playing the game of &ldquo;final report&rdquo; because that is still not available &mdash; the Garda still believe the warrant may be found in a file or behind a cabinet.  The reality is that the Government knew on 15 April that it was a Garda error but the Taoiseach and the rest of the Cabinet pretended they were waiting for a report. The Taoiseach should tell the truth.  No one believes his position on this.</P>

I regret that Deputy Ahern is not accepting my word on this matter, in view of the fact that I have stated it categorically.

      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that if on Saturday, 13 April the Office of the Attorney General and its British counterpart were in contact on the subject of providing a further warrant, it must follow that those two offices were satisfied that an original was not available to either of them in Dublin or London and it must therefore follow that they were satisfied that, whoever was responsible, the original <Col N="1823" /> had somehow been destroyed or mislaid.</P>

      <P>Of course it was obvious that the original was not available in the court but once that was discovered and as there was a limited time available, the priority was not to engage in a discussion as to who was to blame, where the original had been mislaid or by whom.  The priority &mdash; in the limited time available, because of the person in question &mdash; was to deal with a further warrant, and that was done.  The subsequent inquiry into what had happened to the original warrant and who was responsible was not dealt with substantively at that time.  However, it was so dealt with subsequently in a report presented to the Minister for Justice which was presented to this House on 21 May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I participated, with the British Prime Minister, in the formal launch of negotiations in Belfast on 10 June.  Copies of my address on this occasion have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Governments have created a unique opportunity for all concerned to accomplish good for the people of this island and of our neighbouring island.  I was glad, as I trust were all members of this House, to learn that the negotiations took a significant step forward early this morning with agreement on an approach to resolving procedural difficulties. In my opening address, I called upon all concerned to enter the negotiations in a positive spirit.  The agreement reached this morning gives solid <Col N="1825" /> ground for encouragement in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am circulating in the Official Report the statement that issued from the negotiations, after the opening Plenary with Senator Mitchell in the Chair, which sets out this agreed approach.</P>
    <P>I also understand that, as of this morning, the Democratic Unionist Party and the United Kingdom Unionist Party have been added to the list of participants who, in the context of the negotiations, confirmed their total and absolute commitment to the Mitchell Principles.</P>
    <P>I look forward to agreement being reached among the participants on the rules of procedure for the negotiations next week.  Clearly, it is important to move to deal with the substantive issues at the earliest date.  In the meantime, I again call on the IRA to restore unequivocally its ceasefire of August 1994, thus enabling Sinn Féin to participate in what it has sought for so long, direct dialogue with all other relevant parties.</P>
    <P>While in Belfast I had a discussion on European Union issues with the British Prime Minister.  We discussed the BSE issue, the agenda for the Florence European Council, the priorities of the Irish Presidency, the Russian Presidential election and the situation in former Yugoslavia.  We both agreed that every effort should be made to resolve the BSE issue prior to the European Council in Florence.  I underlined that one of the priorities of the Irish Presidency will be action at European level on the drugs issue and I am pleased to report that the Prime Minister expressed support for this priority.</P>
    <P>I have not had any formal consultations or discussions with the Northern Ireland parties since 4 June 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the former Senator Mitchell has been confirmed by a majority of the parties as chairman, is the Taoiseach satisfied that his chairmanship is on a basis as originally proposed by the two Governments or have his powers been significantly diluted to <Col N="1826" /> get, in particular, the Ulster Unionist Party on board and to accept his chairmanship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Senator Mitchell has assumed the chair and the participants are meeting to discuss procedural issues.  Obviously they will address the role the chair will play in the context of those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only assume from what the Taoiseach said that he does not disagree with the proposition that there is a very distinct possibility the powers of the former Senator Mitchell are diluted from what was originally intended and not as full or plenary as originally intended.  In view of what happened in Adare last Friday and the failure of Sinn Féin to condemn that murder and the attempted murder associated with it, will the Taoiseach suspend discussions between his officials and Sinn Féin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first part of the Deputy's question, it has always been the case that the talks will work on the basis of the parties being willing to agree.  The Government, in consultation with the other parties last night, made it clear it recognises that ultimately agreement in procedural and all other issues in these negotiations is a matter for the participants.  That was always the case but the reassurance that it would remain the case was an important contributor in obtaining the agreement to proceed this morning.  There is no change in the underlying reality that at the end of the day the participants must agree on what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second part of the question, I have indicated in the strongest terms my disgust at the attitude of the Vice President of Sinn Féin in his failure to condemn the killing of a member of the Garda in Adare.  His statement that he is not involved in what he called the politics of condemnation is patently <Col N="1827" /> false.  As demonstrated in the newspapers, the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; is frequently used by Sinn Féin in regard to all and sundry, including trivial matters it chooses to condemn.  However, it would appear it is not willing to condemn the killing of a member of the Garda and that, quite frankly, disgusts me.  I find it very difficult to understand the mentality of an individual who stood for the Dáil who cannot bring himself to condemn the killing in Adare.  This causes me deep unease.  However, I have worked a long time, as have others, to achieve a situation where there can be an IRA ceasefire and Sinn Féin can participate in the political process and I would not lightly abandon any course which could be constructive in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present for any discussions at official level with Sinn Féin.  It is now a matter for Sinn Féin to make up its mind to go to the IRA and ask it to call a ceasefire.  It is as simple as that.  We have had enough violence in this land for long enough.  It achieves nothing and never achieved anything. When one considers what the bereaved family in Limerick have suffered and will suffer until the end of their lives and reflects on the fact that 3,000 other families have gone through the same experience thanks to campaigns of paramilitary violence, surely it is time for even the most hard hearted and cynical person in politics to realise that violence achieves nothing, contributes nothing and should be stopped once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I welcome the eventual appointment in the early hours of the morning of the former Senator Mitchell as chairman. The spectacle over the past few days has not been very encouraging, but I will leave that issue in the hope that matters will improve when the talks begin on the more substantive agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify how the plenary session will work <i>vis-á-vis</i> the strands which deal with the North-South dimension?  Will they be dealt with by a <Col N="1828" /> subcommittee under General de Chastelain which will report back to the plenary session chaired by the former Senator Mitchell or will they be handled in another way?  We all would like to see the IRA ceasefire restored immediately, particularly having regard to the events in Adare last Friday.  Are we to take it from what the Taoiseach said that no Government officials are assisting Sinn Féin to bring its thinking to a conclusion on trying to convince the IRA to reinstate its ceasefire?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge no official meetings are planned at present but I have indicated no definitive view in regard to any request that might be received beyond saying that it is time for Sinn Féin to make up its mind.  It has been provided with extensive consultation and information in the lead-up to the talks that commenced on Monday last.  Every question the party asked was answered. At this stage we need no further procrastination. The appropriate course for Sinn Féin is to take the decision to go to the IRA and ask the IRA to reinstate its ceasefire.</P>
      <P>We have seen more than enough violence on this island for there to be no further procrastination in this matter.  If people cannot see that violence should stop now, they have a problem in understanding the feelings of the Irish people. The Irish people clearly wants this to stop and no organisation has any right to continue in the face of the clear opinion of the Irish people on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy has questions about the other issues, some of which are important, technical ones, I suggest he table them separately.  My understanding is that they will be reporting to the plenary session on Strand II issues, as they will be on other aspects of the discussions, regularly.  As I understand it also, this is set out in the ground rules paper but, if there is any matter on which the Deputy wants further information and he tables separate questions <Col N="1829" /> they will be answered by the Tánaiste or me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming what the Taoiseach said, that meetings are not taking place between Government officials and Sinn Féin, and none are planned, would he go slightly further and say that all such discussions are suspended until such time as there is a condemnation of the events in Adare on Friday last and the reinstatement of the ceasefire by the Provisional IRA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received any and am not aware of any request for a meeting.  Obviously, I would not want to make a decision on any such request until I saw the terms in which it was couched.  It is important that we maintain some margin for discretion to ensure that anything that can reasonably be done in respect of the principles to which a civilised Government must adhere is done to achieve a reinstatement of the ceasefire.</P>
      <P>As I said, all questions of Sinn Féin might wish to put have been put and answered comprehensively.  It is now a matter for the party to make up its mind to go to the IRA on the matter.  I cannot envisage exactly what request I might receive or its nature.  Therefore, I do not want to make categoric statements without any possibility of qualification at this juncture.  I am sure Deputy O'Malley understands that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Taoiseach's position to be that he does not wish any such talks to take place between officials and Sinn Féin?  While I understand the need at times for what the Taoiseach called discretion to be exercised, Detective gardaí McCabe and O'Sullivan did not get much opportunity to exercise any discretion on Friday morning last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy needs to remind me of that.  I know what happened and do not consider I require any enlightenment by the Deputy.  However, I have been working, <Col N="1830" /> like my predecessor, on what is a difficult task, that of having a ceasefire reinstated by an organisation which, without any justification, has used violence over the past 25 or 27 years.  It is not particularly easy to engage in the consultations that are necessary to get the decision but, at the same time, it is important to make the point that, without contact, without offering some information as to what might be available if there is a reinstatement of the ceasefire, it is less likely that a reinstatement of the ceasefire will be obtained. That is a practical consideration the Deputy will understand.</P>
      <P>I have authorised my officials to make available any information sought or that is reasonable.  All that was done prior to Monday last, 10 June.  Unfortunately, Sinn Féin did not go to the IRA prior to 10 June but a relatively short time has passed.  The party can still do so; I hope it will.  I asked it to do so.  The party has all the information it needs to do so but I am not going to rule out, without qualification or any possibility of discretion, any accession to any conceivable request I might receive for further information or contact.  I will look at any such request on its merits.  However, I find it quite appalling that Mr. Pat Doherty was unable to condemn the killing of a detective garda in Adare.  I find it appalling that a man who was willing, had he been successful, to take his seat in this House which is guraded by members of the Garda Síochána could not use the words &ldquo;I condemn&rdquo; in regard to the killing of a member of the Garda Síochána.  I find that deeply troubling.  I find it particularly troubling as I am someone who sat in the same room on many occasions with Mr. Doherty and passed many pleasant conversations with him during the IRA ceasefire. Therefore, I find it all the more upsetting that he could not say the words &ldquo;I condemn&rdquo; in regard to this.  In saying that, I believe I share the feelings of every Member of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on this side of the House appreciate more than most <Col N="1831" /> the difficult position in which any Government will have found itself in recent years in regard to contacts with persons on both sides of the political divide.  On the all-party negotiations and the three stranded process, would the Taoiseach say whether the maxim used at the start of these talks, from the early 1990s on, that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, still applies?  When it is possible that parties may frustrate progress on one strand and not on others, is it the position of the Government and of the British Government that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to open up questions here into an <i>ex tempore</i> interpretation of the ground rules document or of all the other documents available as forming the basis for these talks.  However, my understanding is that no agreement can be reached, other than a comprehensive one, because it is a comprehensive agreement alone that can be put to the people North and South prior to implementation. Obviously, one has to have the entire package before one can do that.  On the way the talks will proceed, in practice there may well be agreements on various topics contingent on other things being agreed subsequently.  In the nature of any discussion, that is the way to proceed.  Certain issues are dealt with, left in place, or agreed contingently as people proceed to deal with something else.</P>
      <P>Nothing is implemented until an overall package is agreed and in put to the people.  That is the way I understand it will work.  If the Deputy wants to put down questions on the specific nature of paragraphs of the ground rules for these talks, he should do so and answers will be provided.</P>

    <P>Tuigim ó RTE go bhfuil £14.54m caite acu i ndáil le Teilifís na Gaeilge go <Col N="1833" /> deireadh mí Aibreáin.  Baineann thart ar £7.95m den tsuim sin le caiteachas caipitil &mdash; go príomha ar tharchuradóirí, ar nascanna agus ar an gceanncheathrú i mBaile na hAbhann.  Baineann thart ar £6.59m le caiteachas reatha, i.e. cláir a choimisiúnú nó a cheannach, foireann agus costais riaracháin.  Meastar go mbeidh an tseirbhís nua ar an aer faoi Oíche Shamhna 1996.</P>
    <P>Beidh fhios ag Teachtaí go raibh gealltanais i gCláir an Rialtais seo agus an Rialtais dheiridh maidir le bunú Theilifís na Gaeilge mar chainéal náisiúnta ar leith.  Beidh fhios ag Teachtaí freisin gurb é an costas caipitil measta don tseirbhís nua ná £16.1m agus go bhfuil socraithe, i gcomhréir le cinneadh an Rialtais den 20 Nollaig 1995, go gcuirfí soláthar de £10m in aghaidh na bliana ar fáil ón Státchiste ar bhonn leanúnach i leith costas reatha na seirbhíse nua.  Mar a cuireadh in iúl go minic cheana féin, cuirfidh RTE uair an chloig amháin de chláir in aghaidh an lae ar fáil saor in aisce do Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Is ceist do RTE féin, i gcomhairle le Comhairle Theilifís na Gaeilge, cén costas a bhainfidh leis an ngné sin den scéal.</P>
    <P>Is ceist do Theilifís na Gaeilge féin an méid fógraíochta a ghnóthóidh sí.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a cuireadh in iúl cheana féin i i bhfreagraí a tugadh ar Cheisteanna sa Teach seo, tá RTE freagrach as bunú agus feidhmiú tosaigh an stáisiúin go dtí go mbeidh struchtúr reachtúil ar leith bunaithe do Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Tá súil agam na moltaí reachtúla riachtanacha a chur i láthair an Rialtais i rith na bliana mar chuid de mo bheartas i ndáil le reachtaíocht craolacháin nua a eascró- idh ón bPáipéar Glas ar thodhchaí na craoltóireachta.  Is ar éigin go mbeidh na moltaí sin curtha i bhfeidhm sula dtiocfaidh an stáisiún nua ar an aer.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a bhí i gceist sa chomhaontú polasaí dar teideal &ldquo;Rialtas chun Athnuachana&rdquo;, beifear in ann an bunstruchtúr craolacháin a úsáid ar mhaithe le cuspóirí seirbhíse poiblí eile cosúil le cianoideachas nó craoltóireacht bhreise ón Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> Beidh fhios ag Teachtaí gur tugadh le fios ag an am a cuireadh cinneadh an Rialtais den 20 Nollaig 1995 maidir le costas agus cistíócht do Theilifís na Gaeilge in iúl d'Údarás RTE agus do Chomhairle Théilifís na Gaeilge, go bhféadfadh an Chomhairle, i gcomhairle le hÚdarás RTE, moltaí a dhéanamh maidir le húsáid an líonra craolta nuair nach mbeadh sé ag teastáil ó Theilifís na Gaeilge d'fhonn maoiniú, nach ón Státchiste é, a ghiniúint don tseirbhís nua.</P>
    <P>Go dtí go mbunófar struchtúr reachtúil ar leith do Theilifís na Gaeilge, ní mór go mbeadh moltaí dá leithéid d'úsáid an líonra craolta i gcomhréir le forálacha na nAchtanna um Údarás Craolacháin, 1960 go 1993, agus faoi ollsmacht eagarthóireachta Údarás RTE.

      <P>My priority question was in English, but the reply is in Irish. In case the Minister thought that we on this side of the House could not follow the reply, I am disappointed that he did not answer my question.  We had the information outlined by the Minister.  I tabled this question to ascertain how the remaining 21 hours on the Teilefís na Gaeilge channel will be utilised, the criteria for issuing licences, how applications will be made, which groups will decide on this matter, if advertisements have been placed and, if so, who has come forward.  When will legislation on Teilefís na Gaeilge be introduced or does the Minister intend to directly franchise private stations?  This is very like State control of licensing.  What is the point of the Government's mantra of openness, transparency and accountability when the Minister is not prepared to give us vital information on how the remaining 21 hours on Teilefís na Gaeilge will be utilised?  We have always been tremendously supportive of Teilefís na Gaeilge and a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance gave the go-ahead to that project.  Given our interest in and commitment to it, we want to know how the remaining hours will be used, the criteria for issuing licences, the groups <Col N="1835" /> that will decide on this matter and whether this will be decided behind closed doors or in a proper open and transparent way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer Deputy de Valera's question.  It appears the Deputies opposite wish to exhibit a great sensitivity about the language.  I never imputed that Deputy de Valera did not understand what I said in Irish. It is not and never has been my practice before or since I became a Minister to use the Irish language as a means of being bad mannered or of abusing people.  That is for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will answer the Deputy's question directly.  It has been said from the beginning that the spare capacity for transmission on Teilefís na Gaeilge could best be used in a public service broadcasting way for matters that have not been covered before.  Various suggestions were made when the matter was debated in his House, including its use for coverage of the Dáil proceedings and for training and long distance education. Such proposals for use of that channel's spare capacity are matters in the first instance for Comhairle Teilefís na Gaeilge which would discuss it with the RTE Authority.  At that stage the <Col N="1836" /> Authority, if it proposed the use of broadcasting hours, would consult the Minister.  There is no proposal for State control, the State handling out private licences or for any unaccountable mechanism. From the beginning it was stated that from the establishment of Comhairle Teilefís na Gaeilge it would operate with the RTE Authority as the interim body responsible for getting it up and running.  When legislation is introduced matters will be specific.  I have said I will include legislation on Teilefís na Gaeilge and its autonomous existence in the broadcasting legislation I will introduce later this year.  The matter is as clear as that.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is also very clear.  The only power the Minister has in terms of broadcasting in regard to this matter is provided under section 19 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960, as amended by section 14 of the Broadcasting Act, 1976, namely, to approve the hours of broadcasting suggested by the Authority.  On a different occasion I approved the extension of radio broadcasting hours on the Authority's recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister is not prepared to answer my question directly as to how he considers the remaining 21 hours on the channel will be used, having regard to possible applications for broadcasting hours from interested parties.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to legislation. Will he indicate if a White Paper will be introduced on broadcasting?  I was told by the Taoiseach in response to a question I raised on broadcasting legislation a week ago that it would be introduced at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.  Will it be introduced before the next election?</P>
      <P>Is there a breakdown of consensus among the Government parties on Teilefís na Gaeilge?  Are some Ministers withholding their support for it and, if so, does the Minister anticipate any difficulties concerning the Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> A letter from the RTE chairperson is published in today's national newspapers, the day the Minister is answering questions.  I find it difficult to believe concidences occur in politics.  Did the Minister or any of his advisers request that declaration of unswerving loyalty to the Minister from the RTE chairman?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;against the chairman of the RTE authority, Professor Farrel Corcoran.  There was no suggestion from me, or anybody on my behalf, that Professor Corcoran should write such a letter.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's first point, she may be perfectly assured that I have ideas as to how public service broadcasting might use spare capacity on Teilifís na Gaeilge.  What she and her advisers would like me to do is to make a list of suggestions which would be immediately construed by her supporting hacks as interference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to introduce the legislation in the second half of this year.  The Green Paper on the future of broadcasting generated a large number of submissions; the ground has been well covered, and there were a number of seminars.  It will be possible, because such a thorough discussion took place, to introduce legislation.  I intend to prepare legislation and introduce it later this year.  It will cover, among other matters, Teilifís na Gaeilge, with which this question deals.  The legislation will also deal with most of the other issues that have been dealt with in the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion of a division in relation to Teilifís na Gaeilge does not serve Teilifís na Gaeilge well.  I have expressed my gratitude not just to <Col N="1838" /> members of this Government and the previous Government but to the parties in Opposition for the unanimous support they have given to Teilifís na Gaeilge from the beginning.  It is simply mischievous to make this suggestion which is without basis.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the cessation of funding for the Irish Women's Archive and Resource Centre; and the specific initiatives, if any, being taken by his Department to advance, record and emphasise women's contribution to history.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The most careful consideration of all the issues involved was undertaken before arriving at any decision on funding of the Irish Women's Archive and Resource Centre. Apart from examining in depth the core strategy papers promoting the concept of the creation of a separate women's archive, I looked at the operation of the IWARC venture, particularly in the context of my priorities within the limited resources available to me in 1996.  I concluded the interests of access to women's archival material for the future would be best served within the current framework, staffing structures and accommodation provided for the National Archives and National Library.  I informed IWARC of my conclusion in a letter dated 11 January 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to this it had been made clear to IWARC that further grant-aid could not be assumed.  In addition I had already stated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 20 September 1995 from Deputy Noel Ahern that I had made no commitment to funding IWARC on a continuing basis, but that <Col N="1839" /> I was committed to examining any funding requests within the overall framework of the funds available to me, taking into account the proposed work programme concerned and the broader context of policy in this area, including the role of State collecting institutions, and other institutions collecting cultural items.</P>
    <P>There is a reasonable commonality of opinion among professional archival experts, that an archival body devoted to the records of women, would be antithetical to basic archival practice &mdash; a practice which seeks to avoid the physical break-up of sources.  Women's archives, having being identified, deserve their equal treatment in institutional provision for National Archives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Within an estimate of £70 million, which is the Estimate for the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, what we are talking about is less than half of one per cent in the context of the allocation of £50,000 for the National Women's Archives.  In looking at the Estimate, it was obvious that the women's archives would be first to be hit.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred in his reply to the National Archives.  Does he agree the National Archives is grossly underfunded at the moment with only £1 million, and from existing resources could not deal with the women's archives in a way they would consider to be appropriate?  The National Archives does not propose to do any substantial work on women; the responsibility to correlate specific information would rest with the National Women's Archives.  I understand the Minister is launching a strategic plan for the National Archives tomorrow, and the plan does not refer to a specific women's archives because it was believed when drawing up that plan that work would be taken in hand by the National Women's Archives which, unfortunately, has been eradicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for a period of time without a commitment for continual funding.  I would be pleased to hear from IWARC or any other group or individual with an interest in women's issues of any specific proposals on how the main collecting institutions might improve access to archival material relating to women.  I am examining suggestions made to identify sources on women, to facilitate access to them within the norms of mainstream archival structures and practice to highlight such material, and to explore what is achievable within the ambit of collecting policies. While being obliged to reiterate the central conclusion that any funds should be expanded by the main collecting institution concerned, I readily understand that the position and funding for IWARC must come as a major disappointment to people who had committed energy and time to that venture. Being familiar with it from the beginning and having got money for it, I know in many cases, what was involved was the identification of the women's material.  However, the professional view, for example, of the Association of Women Historians, was that women's material deserved the same kind of service at the centre of archival practice in relation to conservation, to training of staff, and in relation to good practice as anything else.  Having identified that, and having been willing to see how it might be sourced into the national institutions it then belongs, as an equal body of material, with other archives.</P>
      <P>As to the point on the National Archives, I have had quite enough of Deputy de Valera's party, day and night, when speaking on finance, arguing for cuts in public expenditure and Deputy de Valera having a free half day every six or seven weeks suggesting increases in expenditure.</P>

      <P>Thug an méadú is fearr fós i bhfás na <Col N="1842" /> fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht i 1995 an fhostaíocht i ngóthais a fuair cúnamh ó Údarás na Gaeltachta go buaicphointe de 6,835 phost ag deireadh na bliana sin. Baineadh amach an glanmhéadú is airde riamh de 539 bpost sa bhliain sin mar thoradh ar 1,251 phost nua a chruthú.  Is fíor gur cailleadh 712 phost scaipthe thar 293 ghnóthais ar leith agus is cúis mhór bhuartha é sin domsa, mar Aire a bhfuil freagracht air i leith na Gaeltachta, agus don Údarás féin.</P>
      <P>Cailleadh na poist sin mar gheall ar an iliomad cúiseanna éagsúla agus i raon leathan de thionscail éagsúla.  Tá anailís á déanamh le tamall anuas ar an gceist sin ag an Údarás d'fhonn tuiscint a fháil ar na cúiseanna go n-éiríonn lena n-iar- rachtaí i gcásanna agus nach n-éiríonn chomh maith sin leo i gcásanna eile.</P>
      <P>Cé nach maith liomsa ná leis an Údarás go gcaillfí aon phost in aon chor tá an tÚdarás ag díriú go sonrach le blianta anuas ar fhadhb na gcaillteanas sin a laghdú.  Aithnítear ar fud an domhain go gcailltear poist i ngnóthais de réir, mar shampla, mar a thagann meath ar thionscail agus ar earnálacha tionscail agus go laghdaítear méid na bpost le feabhsú teicneolaíochta.  Is í an aidhm, mar sin, ná poist le buanadas a chruthú oiread agus is féidir sa chéad dul síos na gnóthais atá ann a shíorspreagadh le bheith ag obair chun iad féin a chur in oiriúint don saol gnó, laigí a leigheas agus deiseanna nua a thapú.  Gné tháb- hachtach de ghníomhaíochtaí an Úda- ráis d'fhonn caillteanais post a laghdú is ea tacaíocht iarchúraim a sholáthar do chomhlachtaí agus cabhrú leo in uasgh- rádú, scileanna agus i bhforbairt margaí nua, táirgí nua agus gaolmhaireachtaí stráitéiseacha.</P>
      <P>Ar an taobh dearfa de, tá toradh fónta ag teacht ar na hiarrachtaí le blianta beaga anuas (cé, ar ndóigh, go bhfuil baint ag an bhfeabhas ginearálta san eacnamaíocht leis an gcás freisin) chun líon na gcaillteanas post a laghdú.

      <P>Before the adjournment I was dealing with the specific question of the cultural and social changes occuring in society, particularly in urban areas.  Changes are occuring in the criminal world also.  As can be seen from newspaper headlines, hitmen can be engaged, apparently for <Col N="1943" /> a small fee of £5,000, to &mdash; in street slang &mdash;&ldquo;take out&rdquo; individuals.  A number of murders have been committed by hired killers in my constituency of Dublin South-Central, on the Drimnagh Road, at a Halloween party at a site on Weaver Street in the Coombe and on Harold's Cross Road, among other locations.  The Garda Síochána must be equipped to counteract the sophistication and the brutality of these violent criminals.</P>
      <P>It is acceptable that many drug dealers and addicts found with illicit substances in their possession are quickly released because of the shortage of personnel in the forensic science laboratory to carry out analysis. This is a source of great annoyance for local communities, particularly in the south inner city, fighting a rearguard action against drugs.  They are mystified as to why known drug pushers are back on the streets so soon following a successful raid on their flat or home by the Garda Síochána.  It is not easy for a politician to explain that the reason they are walking the streets so soon after being arrested and charged is that the forensic science laboratory does not have sufficient time to analyse the substance found in their possession before being taken to the courts.  It would be good PR for the Garda Síochána if cases could be processed quickly.</P>
      <P>While it is important to examine the problem on a national scale and devise a national policy, we have to examine even more closely how we handle policing issues at local level.  Given the nature of society we must be more innovative. On the one hand, the Garda Síochána must be the protectors of local communities and, on the other, law enforcers on their behalf.</P>

    <P>I have called for the establishment of community policing councils.  Everybody realises that the Garda Síochána is centralised and based in headquarters and stations throughout the country.  If one leaves community gardaí assigned to neigbourhood watch schemes out of <Col N="1944" /> the equation, there is a democratic deficit in the relationship between the Garda Síochána and local communities, particularly in densely populated public housing schemes and flats complexes in the city and county of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Any vacuum in urban areas will be quickly filled by vigilantes, most of whom follow a different agenda.  They make their services available to hard pressed residents concerned about the welfare of their families and neighbours. Many ordinary decent citizens living in deplorable housing conditions and environmentally unfriendly estates patrol the streets and flats complexes with the best of intentions with a view to keeping the dealers in death at bay. In many instances they work closely with the Garda Síochána, but there are other elements who present themselves, like the Magnificent Seven, as their protectors and attempt to impress them with their ability to disregard the law and physically throw out the furniture of a suspected drug addict, pusher or dealer.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a new concept of policing in vulnerable communities.  The Garda Síochána should be culturally and socially attuned to their demands and fears.  This would allow them to merge in a structure which would make it more difficult for vigilantes to present themselves as the protectors of local communities and do the work the Garda Síochána should be doing for them.</P>
    <P>I have called for the establishment of locally based community policing councils. This is crucial to the success of the integrated approach I have advocated. They should be established on a pilot basis in vulnerable estates and flats complexes, particularly in the south inner city of Dublin.  They should comprise not only members of the Garda Síochána and local residents but also other professionals in the areas of health and education.  Under a revamped housing department structure in Dublin Corporation, housing estate management which has been sadly lacking should be targeted as a key factor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> In essence, the establishment of community policing councils would mean devolving responsibility for policing and associated activities from the centre to the lowest level.  The Garda Síochána must be culturally and socially attuned to the needs of marginalised communities. That is the fundamental principal which must inform our approach to policing as we develop new and innovative policing mechanisms to meet the challenges facing us.</P>

      <P>There has been a tendency to widen the scope of the debate on the Bill into a general debate on crime.  The Bill deals with the more narrow issue of representation within the Garda Síochána.  Members should address themselves to what is and what could be put in to it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  I extend sympathy to the family and colleagues of the late Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and I wish a speedy recovery to Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan, a native of my constituency. I hope he will be back on duty soon.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the differences between members of the Garda Síochána have become public.  Since the foundation of the State, the force has covered itself in glory.  Individually and collectively, members of the Garda Síochána helped to build and develop this State and, by and large, they acted in a very common-sense manner in resolving problems.  The high standing in which they are held in each locality is evidence of people's trust in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of Garda stations in villages was seen as a great loss.  The Minister, and the Government, should reconsider the structure of the forces. At the very least, each Garda station should be provided with a patrol car and gardaí should be given mobile phones. Every Tom, Dick and Harry has a mobile phone and there is no reason gardaí should not be provided with what has become a common facility.  With the increase in drug abuse, we should also <Col N="1946" /> consider training more sniffer dogs and using dogs to control the wilder elements in society.  In parts of my constituency, the use of Garda dogs sometimes discourages boisterous members of the community engaged in late night disturbances.  Gardaí are not injured as a result.</P>
    <P>The present impasse is not doing anything to further the good name of the Garda Síochána or maintain respect for its members.  It is important that this matter be resolved soon.  There is a problem and it must be dealt with.  It concerns the equitable representation of all sections and age profiles in the force. Many gardaí were of the opinion that there was not such representation and, as a result, two bodies represent gardaí &mdash; the GRA with 6,500 members and the Garda Federation with approximately 2,500 members.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister for Justice would face difficulties attempting to deal with both bodies on pay and working conditions of gardaí engaged in similar work.  In my party's view it is desirable that there should be one Garda representative body.  That would be in the best interests of the gardaí and the public.  A strong, unified body representing all gardaí would be in a stronger position to negotiate the best deal for its members, rather than two or three such groups.  There is no doubt that compromise is required on all sides to resolve this dilemma.  I hope that the common sense displayed by members of the Force will help to solve this problem. Mediation, not legislation, will bring forth an amicable settlement; you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink.</P>

      <P>In the past year there has been a great reduction in the morale of members of the force, and the dispute between the representative bodies has been given as the reason.  However, this has more to do with the lack of <Col N="1947" /> resources available to the force.  Confusion as to the future direction of the Garda Síochána is also to blame for this lack of morale.  The Conroy Commission in 1972 and the Louden Ryan Commission in 1979 outlined the direction of Government policy towards the force.  It might be a good idea to establish a new commission to plan for the future.</P>
      <P>Another problem which has lead to a lowering of morale is the reduction in the number of serving personnel.  During the BSE crisis almost 300 gardaí were moved to the Border region depleting numbers in other areas.  The Minister should consider extending the retirement age to 60 to retain experienced gardaí to fight drug abuse and attacks on elderly people in cities and isolated areas.  Due to the new training structures, there is a gap which must be filled between gardaí resigning and new members joining the force.</P>
      <P>Lack of resources is causing a problem. Proper facilities must be provided to help members of the force carry out their duties.  It is interesting to note that in a reply to a parliamentary question recently, the Minister stated that the Government had reduced funding to the Department of Justice on a percentage of GNP basis in recent years.  In 1993, 1.85 per cent of GNP was expended in the Department of Justice.  That figure was reduced to 1.84 per cent in 1994, 1.76 per cent in 1995 and 1.7 per cent in 1996.  Those reductions occurred at a time when there was an increase in crime, attacks on the elderly and drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful that there has been a reduction in the funding to the Department of Justice.  In light of this evidence it is very difficult for the Government to convince people it is really interested in fighting and reducing the level of crime. The Government should reconsider the level of funding to the Garda Síochána to allow its members carry out their duties, as they have in the past, to the highest possible standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is apt that a debate on the Garda Síochána should take place in the House soon after the retiring Garda Commissioner indicated that a wide-ranging debate should take place on the role of the force in modern society.  Commissioner Culligan's comments, reported in last week's newspapers, were a great insight into the difficulties facing gardaí and should give rise to a much wider debate. Such a debate should consider the function of the Garda Síochána, the merits of establishing a Garda authority and operational, administrative and other matters.  In this regard I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Eric Byrne.  It is important also that such a debate should form a position where the important role played by the Garda in the history of the State is recognised. With the tragic death last week of Garda Jerry McCabe, we were remained of the bravery and dedication to duty of our police force.  We owe it to the rank and file members of the Garda to ensure they are in the best possible position to tackle the nature of crime which has developed in recent years.</P>
      <P>While Commissioner Culligan rightly pointed out that the overall levels of crime have not increased greatly in the past decade, I am pleased he recognised that the changing nature of crime, such as the prevalence of loutish behaviour among some sections of the community and the greater prevalence of violent crime has created a perception among the public of a greater level of crime. That perception &mdash; and it is not only perception &mdash; goes a long way towards explaining the reason that, despite the burgeoning economy and the peace process, there is no &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor among members of the public.  What is the benefit of having a few extra pounds in our pockets if we are afraid to let our children play outside in the evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say the media and some politicians have talked up the crime problems in an unjustified way but they have been able to do so only because of <Col N="1949" /> the underlying fear among communities. As Deputy Byrne pointed out, the main source of that fear in Dublin is the problems caused by drugs.  We have spoken about the drugs problem in this House on numerous occasions and, while it is appropriate to discuss measures to tackle it, we must also recognise the effect it is having on our communities. In short, it is sapping the life from them.</P>
    <P>People living in communities who work with gardaí to tackle the problems experienced in their estates are being subjected to the most awful form of intimidation.  As Commissioner Culligan pointed out, this is the environment in which the Garda is attempting to work and while I would welcome the allocation of additional gardaí to tackle this problem directly, I recognise the difficult situation in which they are currently working.</P>
    <P>This is the type of debate we should be having in this House.  If Commissioner Culligan is correct in saying that since 1960 there has been a breakdown in the consensus underpinning Garda operations, that issue must be urgently addressed.  A commission should be established to re-examine the role of the Garda as we approach a new century in which all interested parties, including gardaí, are allowded to play their part.  Low morale among members of the Garda is potentially dangerous.  A well motivated and vibrant Garda force is critical to public safety and democracy.</P>
    <P>Today's debate is of a limited nature. It has arisen in response to the collapse in support for the GRA, principally among gardaí in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, and the emergence of the Garda Federation.  I share the Minister's view that it is in the interests of gardaí and the public to have gardaí represented by one representative organisation. Moreover, I have the greatest sympathy for the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who finds herself confronting this problem in what is already a difficult period in which the Opposition has done all in its power to <Col N="1950" /> prevent a rational discussion of the difficulties facing not only the Minister but her predecessors and any potential successor.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt morale in the Garda Síochána is currently very low. The reasons for that are known to us all but they have been compounded by the split in the Garda Representative Association.  The cause of that split is clear; Dublin members of the force feel unrepresented by the representative structure of the GRA and are particularly bitter about the pensions deal agreed some years ago on the pensionability of allowances.  This bad feeling is compounded by the fact that almost £0.5 million per week is currently being spent on Border duties in response to the BSE scare.  That has involved the transfer of resources from hard-pressed Dublin stations to the Border areas.  It is further compounded by the existence of allowance such as the Gaeltacht allowance whereby gardaí working in Gaeltacht areas are paid an automatic bonus of 7.5 per cent of their basic pay, despite the fact that their workload and conditions are probably far better than those of younger gardaí working in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Given my experience of the tremendous work done by gardaí in very difficult Dublin communities, there is a strong argument for abolising the Gaeltacht allowance.  Gardaí working in difficult areas of Dublin are literally taking their lives in their hands when they go out to work, and it could be argued strongly that they should be given an additional allowance as opposed to gardaí working in Gaeltacht areas where the level of crime is considerably lower than in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister's motivation in bringing this Bill before the House is clear.  Having done all in her power to bring the respective factions together, she has decided to play hardball.  That is understandable. The normal industrial relations machinery was used in this dispute and a highly respected person, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, was brought in to arbitrate, but when his report was presented <Col N="1951" /> to the Minister the GRA rejected it.  It is difficult to know what other course of action is open to the Minister, having tried the usual channels.</P>
    <P>It is questionable whether this legislation will prove successful.  The recent walk-out by members of the Garda Federation over what they perceive as a lack of militancy on the part of their own organisation is an indication of how deeply the current split is felt among its members.  The dispute on the substantive issues is also being compounded by the intense personal bitterness which has embodied it so far.</P>
    <P>Some of the issues in this dispute might best be dealt with by a commission on the Garda in the context of an overall review of its functions and role.  Issues to be addressed should include management structures, promotion prospects and the pay and conditions of various ranks of the Garda.  It is important also to consider the possibility of establishing a separate Garda authority.</P>
    <P>One of the factors relating to the difficulties currently being experienced by the Garda Síochána is the perception that there is an extremely close association between the Garda and the political system.  That is particularly unhealthy and unhelpful in relation to the development of a Garda force. There is no doubt that at certain levels in the Garda there is a perception that unless one is supportive of the right political party, it is difficult to be promoted beyond a certain rank.  That perception is extremely damaging to morale.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to defer Committee Stage and make one last effort to resolve this dispute.  The nub of the issue is pay and the pension package negotiated some years ago.  If the Minister indicated her intention to reopen negotiations, she might not have to proceed with this legislation.  I believe she is reluctant to do that, which is understandable. If she indicated a willingness to reopen negotiations if the Garda presented as a united body, it would do much to help bring people together.  If <Col N="1952" /> that challenge is put to the Garda I hope they recognise that at last the nub of the issue is being tackled and it is in their best interests to work together.  A clear signal has to come from the Minister that she is prepared to open up negotiations on pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>The other issue to be addressed which is at the heart of this dispute is the need for a fair system of representation within any Garda representative association. To date there has been a serious imbalance in the representation of the Dublin members which is less than a third of the representation for members in other parts of the country.  The Bill goes some way towards addressing it but it does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>We should consider allowing one member one vote in electing the executive committee.  Many of the other representative associations and unions operate on that basis.  Resolution of that matter would help to address some of the concerns of members, principally in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
    <P>We are in difficulties when there are serious problems with morale in the Garda.  We already have serious problems relating to crime and the breakdown of law and order as well as the growing drugs problem which we seem incapable of tackling.  The proposals put forward by Government are not adequate to make an impact on the problem.  In that atmosphere, unless the Garda Síochána is united, well motivated and enthusiastic about what it is doing and is valued and treated fairly, a potentially dangerous situation will emerge.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think again on this matter and seriously consider establishing a commission on the Garda. There are fundamental problems within the Garda which should be examined by a commission.  I am not confident legislation will solve the problem because it does not deal with the issue at the nub of this dispute.  Following Second Stage and before Committee Stage will the Minister consider inviting representatives from all the political parties to come up with proposals to resolve this <Col N="1953" /> serious dispute?  Will the Minister bring the parties together, to examine the problem and see how we can advance the matter with a view to restoring morale to the Garda Síochána?</P>

      <P>In dealing with this Bill one would have to take cognisance of the role of the Garda in the development and maintenance of democracy and express appreciation for the role it has played since its inception.  The standards it sets are an example for other forces.  It plays a role requiring commitment and expertise and the courage of gardaí is unquestionable.  The public squabbling which we all witnessed surprised and disappointed us.  It was unseemly, unedifying and totally contrary to our perception of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that a force that has seen its numbers depleted, its effectiveness in combating crime reduced and has been attributed blame, through a lack of commitment by the Government to law and order, would have a low morale.  It has been set an impossible task by this Minister for Justice. Given all the circumstances I praise the thoroughness of the approach by the Garda to solving crime.  When the force sees it is not making headway in enlisting ministerial support to rectify primary defects through its representative body it is logical that elements in it would turn on itself.  This is what has happened.  A certain amount of blame can be attributed to previous administrations and major blame can be attributed to this administration.</P>
      <P>There are two elements which need to be addressed in this complex deep-seated dispute.  Putting a legislative formula in place does not mean it will work.  Somebody recalled the old maxim: &ldquo;you can take a horse to water but you cannot make him drink&rdquo;.  That this Government does not have a criminal justice policy is especially sad when one considers what the Fine Gael Party used to stand for &mdash; the just society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as if the Minister has a millstone <Col N="1954" /> tied around her neck and every aspiration she harboured is negatived and every move she makes is scruppered. Among the public, law and order is the number one issue.  There is a perception that crime pays, particularly petty crime, which inevitably leads to serious crime. Everyone in this House accepts that people are sick to the teeth of the spectacle of panels, committees, subcommittees and commissions all contemplating what to do, knowing full well their remit is a holding operation and any conclusions involving cost will be shot down by elements of this Government. When they privately claim they sacrificed the Minister on the altar previously and that she accepted it because of the lure of the trappings of office, elements in the Government are asking if there is any reason for them to believe she will not accept the tight budgeting that has been part and parcel of the Department since she took office.</P>
    <P>We recall the Minister's support for a referendum on bail and we all know the U-turn she had to make.  We recall the decision to build additional prison spaces and we know how, in her absence, that was postponed.  We recall the packages of reforms to fight crime and lawlessness and we set that against the paltry increase in spending in the Estimates for this year.  How can a Minister for Justice hope to gain or maintain the confidence of the Garda in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue has been the real Minister for Justice in the Dáil for the past 18 months given the number of Bills he has introduced and the number of Bills the Minister introduced subsequently based on the rock solid foundation in the Fianna Fáil Bills.  I acknowledge the difficulties the Minister for Justice faces, but she should acknowledge the reduction in Garda numbers &mdash; it is unimaginable that there are now 100 fewer gardaí than three years ago.  A conclusion of the Garda sergeants and inspectors at their conference was that under this Government there was a run down of the force.  That was a significant <Col N="1955" /> statement which has to be taken into account by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also address the age profile of the Garda.  The same difficulty has had to be addressed in the Army.  We also have to ask serious questions about the management and operation of the Garda given the sophistication of modern crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conveney, shares my concern about the number of gardaí in south Cork.  A random survey I carried out indicated that Ballincollig is short four gardaí; Bishopstown is short three; Douglas and Blackrock-Mahon area are, respectively, two short and Carrigaline three short.  Given the crime levels how can one expect a depleted force to combat it?</P>
    <P>The way in which the Garda deals with crime must also be examined.  Is the approach as sophisticated as it might be?  Is the present recruitment policy and the level of expertise demanded as up-to-date as it might be?  Perhaps we should consider recruiting people with a higher level of expertise.  The training of gardaí has been upgraded and improved significantly.  However, other levels of expertise will have to be seriously considered. To show the Garda the Government is serious about crime the Minister will have to demand the extra resources for tackling crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall's references to pay rises and allowances were wide of the mark.  I hope the dispute between the two bodies is not just down to pay and conditions.  I credit the Garda with a genuine belief they are indequately represented.  There should only be one representative body.  Although Fianna Fáil will not oppose the Second Stage of the Bill, we will propose the amendments we consider necessary on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Recent statements display a certain optimism that there is room for manoeuvre.  It would be better for the two groups to get their affairs in order rather than to party legislation to impose a solution on them.  I would encourage <Col N="1956" /> dialogue to give a purpose to the optimism. It is in the interests of the organisations to get together to examine the agreed elements of this Bill and to forget the enmities of the past.  They should apply a sense of purpose, unity and decorum to come up with a formula which will satisfy all involved.</P>
    <P>The long-term benefit of this legislation is questionable.  There is enough legislation on the Statute Book which is not being implemented without adding to it.  However, the two organisations have a duty to ensure the image and decorum of the Garda is protected.  It is up to the two groups to grasp the opportunity to avoid this legislation being forced through.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister had no option but to introduce this unwanted legislation.  We would all prefer if the Garda was able to conduct its own business and the GRA should be able to do that.  However, I take with a grain of salt the comments of Opposition speakers who said that every effort should be made to bring together the three warring factions.  This problem did not arise in the past few days or weeks; the previous Minister for Justice was involved in the matter.  I understand from Kieran Mulvey and others in the Labour Relations Commission that everything possible has been done but there has not been a break in the deadlock.  It appears that irrespective of what is proposed it is rejected by some group.  While any division in the representative status of the Garda Síochána is regrettable, the current bitter squabbling among the rival factions in the force is disgraceful. Those who watched the 1984 GRA congress in Galway on television were disheartened by the unexpected scenes. <Col N="1957" /> Like all Members, I support law and order and the efforts of the Garda to resolve the problems in our society, but there comes a time when somebody must shout stop.  Most of the representatives do not want this public row to send out a wrong signal.  They want the public to know their efforts to combat crime and maintain law and order is still a priority.  I hope the hierarchy in the Garda hold a similar view.  Public perception is very important and many citizens cannot understand why a Garda force, charged with the responsibility of maintaining law and order, should publicly squabble on television every other night.  Neither the public nor individuals in the force want this to continue, but it appears some people are not prepared to retract.  This is a common difficulty in industrial relations matters.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas has been asked to resolve the difficulties in the force but I will be the first to admit that this legislation may not be successful in doing so. This is not an issue any Government would want to bring before the House. It is similar to asking the Dáil to give a direction to, say, the IFA or the ICMSA, something we should not be asked to do.  However, for the benefit of the public something must be done to resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's efforts in this regard and concur with some of the comments of Members from all sides.  It appears that, while some have doubts about certain sections of the Bill, Second Stage will be agreed unanimously. When this is communicated to the warning factions perhaps they will realise there is no place for any more foot dragging.  Perhaps this will be the spark that will make them do what they should.  They will know the Dáil is not divided on the matter, and I presume the same will apply in the Seanad.  They will know we want them to do what is right for the force, the prevention of crime and maintenance of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always been blessed with an excellent police force which has had to <Col N="1958" /> meet ever-changing demands.  Worthwhile changes have been made.  With the new training schedule for Garda recruits in Templemore we can look forward to a better trained force that will be able to deal with its ever-changing role in society.  The leadership in the force and the Minister for Justice have taken positive steps in this regard.  Law abiding people believe the Garda Síochána should provide leadership.  In most parts of the country, particularly in my constituency, gardaí are held in high esteem.  However, in some of our cities there are &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; areas and those negative vibes tend to spread.  It is important that the electorate maintain confidence in the Garda Síochána and that the force continues to earn that high esteem.  Its case will not benefit from two or three groups in the association squabbling on television.  That sends out the wrong signals.</P>
    <P>I understand there are good law people on all sides in this dispute, but their views are entrenched. While I do not wish to predict Members' actions, it appears the 166 Members will send out a signal tonight that the Dáil supports the Second Stage of this Bill and that we want the factions in this dispute to put their house in order immediately.  No amount of speaking out of the said of the mouth on television will overcome the next step.  The people involved must accept that the Dáil is at one on this matter.  This is an ideal opportunity for them to take on board some of the recommendations, which will satisfy the vast majority of the membership.</P>
    <P>Despite what has been said for political reasons by Members of the Opposition, a great amount of spending is undertaken &mdash; it is ever-increasing &mdash; regardless of which party is in Government. For as long as I have been a Member of the Dáil, irrespective of who was in Government, I have heard political talk to the effect that the Garda force is under-funded.  As a Government we must ensure that the Garda is <Col N="1959" /> given the necessary funding and technology because the people who commit crime move with the times.</P>
    <P>In the first instance it is very important that the feud between the warring factions be settled.  We debate many issues here relating to bail and so on, but I hope that as a result of this debate the gardaí who have served us well down the years will solve this problem, which is simply a blip in the force but is potentially very dangerous.  I hope when the Bill is passed &mdash; I think it will be passed unanimously on Second Stage &mdash; the people involved will take note of the thinking of all elected representatives. If they do, they will be seen to be able to put their own house in order and they will be stronger as a result.  There are many issues I would like to refer to on this occasion but I will allow my colleague to contribute.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me. He finished his contribution on an important note in that he referred to the expectation of the House and the public that the problem of the division within the Garda representative associations will be resolved.  The extent of the problem became clear from reports of a Garda conference last year, which was almost in a state of anarchy.  One would not expect such a display at a Garda conference.  I accept that in the heat of the moments things are said and done which might not be on another occasion, but that presented a very negative and damaging image to the public and the Minister for Justice had no choice but to act as she did.  There must be a demand from Government that the representative associations get their act together, resolve their differences and fight crime rather than fighting each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to the fact that we regularly debate law and order in this House.  Practically no day passes when on the Order of Business a question is not asked of the Taoiseach or Minister for Justice about the need <Col N="1960" /> for further legislation, amendments, extra money and so on.  I congratulate the victor in the Dublin West by-election, Deputy Lenihan.  My efforts were obviously unsuccessful on behalf of the Fine Gael candidate &mdash; I had expected, from reports in the papers and on television and radio, that the main issue on the doorsteps would be crime.  I was in the Dublin West constituency for only five or six days and did not get a representative sample of the views of the entire constituency, but the law and order issue was not as profoundly debated as I would have expected.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the statement last week by the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Culligan, that the media paints too black a picture of crime and the breakdown of law and order is not far removed from reality.  I accept that there is a problem in that regard, which needs to be tackled, but perhaps we should not take matters out of context.  The problem can be contained and a united, effective Garda force can play a major role in that regard.  It is important that this legislation, which the Minister has introduced reluctantly, is passed so that the Garda is forced to get its house in order.</P>
    <P>The attitude today to law and order is significantly different from that adopted when the Minister introduced this Bill. The dreadful events of last weekend, the murder of a detective garda and the injuries inflicted on his colleague, brought home once again to all of us the dangers faced on a daily basis by the Garda and the fact that there is a very thin dividing line between democracy and anarchy.  It reminds us that gardaí on the beat are the protectors of democracy. I wish to be associated with the many expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Detective McCabe.  As co-chairman of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body I had dealings with him in the run-up to the meeting of that body in Adare last April.  His assistance and that of his colleagues on that occasion was greatly appreciated by all members.</P>
    <P>The injured garda, Detective O'Sullivan, is a native of the Mallow area <Col N="1961" /> which I represent as part of the Cork East constituency, and I wish him a speedy recovery.  The events of last weekend have caused us to reflect deeply on the role played by the Garda. While we are critical from time to time of the Garda and demand the impossible from members of the force on a daily basis they put life at risk to uphold democracy and protect the freedom we take for granted.</P>
    <P>I hope the difficulties and arguments which led to the introduction of this legislation &mdash; the Minister said she had no option but to introduce it &mdash; will be resolved.  It would have been preferable to do so without legislations, but other options failed and the Minister had to respond by way of legislation.  I support the Bill which is not complex and we expect it will have the full support of the House.  I hope the message will go out from the Oireachtas to gardaí of all ranks that we are not cracking the whip or being overly critical of them; we are simply responding to the need for a united Garda force so that it will be more effective in the battle against crime.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The outpouring of sympathy and horror felt by the people of Limerick and of the country in response to the shooting dead of Garda Jerry McCabe and the wounding of Garda Ben O'Sullivan shows the high esteem in which the gardaí are held.  I wish to be associated with the words of condolence to both families on a horrible and cowardly act, carried out by people who should have learnt that such violence is no longer acceptable.  The achievement of peace is now uppermost in the minds of all right thinking Irishmen and women, North and South, and the cowardly killing of gardaí cannot be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we now discuss a Bill which tries to bring different factions within the Garda together.  Various Ministers for Justice have tried to resolve this dispute, which has left us with two representative bodies.  Judging from media reports at the weekend, a <Col N="1962" /> third body may split from the breakaway organisation.  This is regrettable because the gardaí are much respected and any organisational break-up or infighting will lead to a public lack of confidence.  If a serious crisis in the State should occur, the gardaí, regardless of what representative body they are in, will undoubtedly react and will not decline to go to certain areas because of the body to which they belong.  However, perception is highly important &mdash; the public must see that everything is right within the Garda Síochána and that it is acting in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I am not sure the legislation will work.  Even at this late stage, we should appeal to the various Garda representative associations to put their differences behind them and prove that they can work together.  The Minister should perhaps row back and allow the gardaí more time to resolve their differences. In this Bill she may be taking too many powers to herself and devaluing the role of the Garda representative bodies.</P>
    <P>Morale within the Garda Síochána is at an all-time low and the Government does not help this by seemingly making up a justice policy as it goes along and reacting to issues as they arise.  We live in changing times and today there is less respect for authority, irrespective of what it may be.  Parental control has never been weaker &mdash; young people are allowed to walk streets, highways and byways late at night and no one seems to care where they are or what they do. We are faced with serious crime and drugs problems which are escalating by the minute.  Murders are on the increase and contract killers and vigilantes are the order of the day.  The Department of Justice, the Minister and the Government seem to be doing little to deal with these problems.  All these issues affect the public, who expect the gardaí to protect them as they did in the past. However, how can they deal with escalating problems of these proportions in crime, drugs, etc. if there are fewer gardaí than in 1993 and there is no <Col N="1963" /> leadership from the Department of Justice?</P>
    <P>The time has come for an urgent review of the operations of the Garda Síochána.  Gardaí from my area, particularly the older officers, had great respect for the Conroy commission of 1972 and the Ryan commission of 1979. They felt their reports were of tremendous value, as they looked into the workings of the force and made recommendations, many of which were implemented.  This gave gardaí the satisfaction of knowing that the Ministers for Justice of those times &mdash; whether from Fianna Fáil or the Coalition &mdash; had a definite interest in looking after the welfare of gardaí and responding to the changing times.  The force was far happier then.  Now, 17 years after the Ryan commission, gardaí feel a new commission is necessary to review or give an overview of Garda operations.  Gardaí have far more issues to deal with and it is time to consider how the force should proceed into the next century.</P>
    <P>The Garda lacks resources at present. Regardless of which Government is in power, it spends a great deal of money and we should see whether we are getting value for it.  Are the gardaí operating in the areas where they should?  Should they have priority areas?  Are they operating efficiently and as best they can on behalf of the public?</P>
    <P>My town, Enniscorthy, probably has adequate gardaí to deal with its problems, if the officers were left there. However, they are sent on special operational patrols or are called away on Boarder or explosives duty, which means that at times a minimum of resources is left to police the local area.  Up to this week, two gardaí remained all day in a local quarry to look after explosives. That is a worthwhile job but as one garda said to me recently, while the officers were there to ensure the explosives were not taken, bomb experts could be wiring them to the moon.  The Army, which has expertise in this area, could be doing this job to allow the gardaí <Col N="1964" /> who have been in the quarry for weeks or months to go back on the streets to deal with crime, vandalism, etc. and get to know the local people.  The handling of explosives is an important task but it should be hived off to the Army, who have experts in this area.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I am making the point that gardaí were removed from stations and transferred to Boarder duty, up to Deputy McGahon's area. That is worthwhile work but at the same time, Army personnel are sitting in barracks. Soldiers could be doing this duty while the gardaí deal with the crime problem, not just in Dublin but in rural Ireland.  The escalating crime level in all areas needs to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The split in the Garda representative associations was unfortunate.  Successive Ministers have tried to solve the problem and it should be possible even at this late hour for the associations to amalgamate into one effective body. This would enable members to continue the effective work they have carried out for many years, that is protecting citizens. The Garda Síochána who have given a tremendous service to the State since its foundation are held in high esteem by the public and it is a pity this problem has been allowed to drag on.  I am not being critical of the Department of Justice but someone in the force should have had the ability and power to say, &ldquo;enough is enough, it is time to deal with this problem&rdquo;.  Obviously no one was sufficiently strong or dedicated to resolve the problem within the force. <Col N="1965" /> There seems to have been a power struggle among individual members who regard themselves as greater than the force.  I would remind those individuals that the continuation of the Garda Síochána as we have known it is much more important than any individual or power struggle.  The level of crime is at an all time high, people are being murdered on a daily basis in Dublin and vigilante groups are being set up.  I do not agree with these groups and if we hand over the streets to them then we will be in serious trouble.  It is very important, therefore, that the Garda Síochána resolve their problems among themselves and that they close ranks and set up one strong and vibrant association which will represent the interests of all members.  A splintered force will not serve any purpose and will not be in a position to fight its case with the Department of Justice in terms of pay structures, better working conditions and increased manpower.  Their best interests can only be served by having one strong representative organisation. The confidence the Garda have built up among the public over many years can only be restored by the setting up of one representative organisation which is unified in terms of purpose and the desire to deal with the criminal elements in society.</P>
    <P>Even at this late hour it is important for the members of the Garda Síochána to get their act together and set up one organisation so that the Government does not have to introduce legislation to bring them together.  I am not sure this type of legislation is in the best interests of the Garda or of the public whom they serve.  I appeal to the representative associations to bury the hatchet, pull together and ensure that one strong organisation represents all their members and that they are seen to implement strong safety measures on behalf of the public whom we represent.</P>

      <P>The Chair understands my position.  Before I deal with the Bill, I wish to extend my sympathy to the family of the garda who was murdered last week.  In doing so I also extend my sympathy to the families and relatives of the 29 gardaí who have died while on duty since the foundation of the State.  Fifteen or 16 of these gardaí were killed by the IRA, the enemies of the State.</P>
      <P>Despite a few personal hiccups with one or two of them &mdash; this is understandable as there are difficult people in every walk of life, even in politics &mdash; I have always been a strong supporter of the Garda Síochána.  However, I have not been very happy with them in recent years.  The split in the representative associations is an absolute farce and the near riot at the annual jamboree in Galway some years ago was a disgrace to the force and the very good men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I congratulate the Minister on having the savvy to take steps to end this farce between the two organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent case involving the young garda in Cyprus exemplified the problems being experienced by the Garda. Respect and discipline have disappeared quickly from our society.  A society which prevents a young father or mother from gently chastising his or her child cannot expect obedience in society <Col N="1967" /> in general.  The behaviour of this impertinent young policeman who has been on a holiday for 13 months on a sun-kissed island and told Brendan O'Carroll type jokes to the Minister is an indication of the lack of respect, obedience and discipline in the country.  The Garda generally do a very good job but I would like to see a reinstatement of the community policeman or garda.  No matter how many sophisticated or technological aids are put at their disposal, there can be no substitute for the presence of a garda in an area.</P>
    <P>When I was young there was a famous old garda, Joe Gaffney, the &ldquo;Lugs&rdquo; Branagan of Dundalk, who was feared by its criminal element.  Whenever there was a small robbery &mdash; they were all small in those days &mdash; Joe would have known the likely culprit, and apprehended and effectively dealt with him in his own way.  Almost single-handedly he kept the criminal element in Dundalk under control.  The replacement of community gardaí, by three of four gardaí sitting in squad cars, has allowed small and large time crooks to move around more freely and knocked on its head the old adage that crime does not pay because crime today very definitely does pay.</P>
    <P>The answer lies in the speedy reinstatement of community gardaí; they should be equipped with hobnailed boots and put out on the streets. They should live among the community and establish roots there rather than be continuously transferred.  That would constitute one method of effectively apprehending emerging criminals, and nipping them in the bud before they graduate into big-time criminal activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister has logically proposed one Garda representative association. This was also suggested by Deputy Lenihan this morning.  Nobody wants to deny the Garda their legal entitlements and the Minister's proposals were advanced in the best spirit and in the Garda's best interests.</P>
    <P>On the remarks of Commissioner <Col N="1968" /> Culligan on crime levels, I take no comfort from his claim that statistically crime levels are down.  We should remember that the devil can quote scripture to suit himself.  The overall levels of violent crime are at an unprecedentedly high level.  While those levels may be somewhat higher in the past 18 months than when Deputy Lenihan's party was in office, nonetheless, by the time his party return to office they will have climbed inexorably; that is the reality of life.  Until draconian measures are taken to deal with law and order, crime levels will not fall.  Present bureaucratic measures, with bureaucratic, desk-bound Garda are totally useless and insufficient.  The Garda, the barometers of crime, can guage its level. In that respect some comments of members of Garda representative associations over the years have been spot-on.  Unfortunately, because of the bureaucratic system which stymies all of us, no cognisance has been taken of them.  To a large extent the Garda have been tied by bleeding hearts, people who advocate civil liberties, who talk about a Utopian society, when there is none.  In today's world there is developing an ever-increasing criminal mentality, a criminal society.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I read reports of a 21 year-old man who had committed 20 crimes against tourists.  I feel sorry for anybody who talks of rehabilitating such a person because there are some incapable of being rehabilitated. Equally we should remember that people are not born into the criminal classes; they class themselves through their involvement in criminal activities.</P>
    <P>The current crime position here is appalling.  Some short time ago four women were murdered in one weekend, the most recent being in Glasnevin. There is real fear among women generally. In addition, the crime of rape, virtually unknown when I was young, is now rampant, statistics showing there were approximately 2,000 reported incidents last year.  What about those that have not been reported?  That is a heinous, despicable crime on which my <Col N="1969" /> views are fairly well known.  I firmly advocate the use of the knife for persistent offenders.  There should be mandatory sentencing for anyone who descends to that level, with no parole for &ldquo;good behaviour&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I come now to the callous murder of Detective Garda McCabe last Friday.  I was amazed at the Taoiseach expressing surprise that the IRA did not apologise or express any sympathy for that appalling act.  The Taoiseach's surprise took my breath away.  We should remember that organisation has taken the lives of 64 per cent of the 3,800 people &mdash; these are their own figures &mdash; butchered in the North.  They have taken the lives of 15 Garda, three Irish Army officers over the past 15 years and the life of a young County Louth farmer, the late Mr. Tom Oliver, who left seven children, the youngest of whom was only three or four years old.  They will continue to take life because of the ambivalent, appeasement policies pursued by the British and Irish Governments against the greatest terrorist gang the world has known since Adolph Hitler.</P>
    <P>Indeed the numbers of gob-shites in this country who believe in the peace process beggars description.  On the very evening the ceasefire was declared by the IRA I spoke in this House and expressed my reservations saying I did not believe it.  The most revealing contribution here was that of the late Deputy Neil Blaney, who was probably closer to the republican movement than any other Member in recent times.  He did not believe it either and I still do not believe it.  I do not believe one can marry unionism with republicanism, they are worlds rather than poles apart. I would not believe even a remark like &ldquo;God save you&rdquo; coming from the IRA who, having declared a truce, callously took the lives of two newsagents in Canary Wharf and the life of the late Mr. Kerr, a Newry postal worker, within six weeks of declaring peace.</P>
    <P>The latest atrocity has been the butchering of Detective Garda McCabe in Adare and the serious injury of his colleague, Detective Garda O'Sullivan, in pursuit of money, but tickets to <Col N="1970" /> American and Armani suits must be purchased. These atrocities will continue indefinitely because the IRA has no intention of observing peace.  They declared a ceasefire as a PR stunt for the gullible public.  I found it difficult to take the spectacle of the Irish Dr. Mengele, Gerry Adams, coming into the Dáil Chamber when Yankee Doodle Dandy, Bill Clinton, was here looking for Irish votes.  What was Gerry Adams doing poncing around this Assembly on that day, a man against whom Leinster House has been guarded day and night by the Garda and the Army for the past 25 years.  He was brought in here on that day, but he had no right to be here and I bitterly resent it.</P>
    <P>I hold Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness guilty by association of the murder of hundreds of people.  The biggest weakness in a democracy is the inability of Governments to tackle terror at the level it has reached here during the past 25 years.  The only man who could deal with terror here in recent times was Eamonn de Valera who put them up against a wall, shot them and quickly nullified the threat in the 1940s. We have wasted too much time and the people are fed up with the problems in the North.  Many of them want to build a wall around it and sent it floating into the sea.  I am a Dáil Deputy representing Dundalk, which is a couple of miles from the Border, and nobody has ever come to me with a problem about the North.  The people of Dundalk and other parts of the South do not want any involvement with that tragedy.  We are now taking tea with the people who are guilty by association of last week's murder of Detective Garda McCabe.  As the Supreme Court decided some years ago, there is absolutely no difference between Sinn Féin and the IRA.  It is a farce that we allow a difference to exist. Any known supporter of Sinn Féin or the IRA should have been rounded up and put in the Curragh Camp last week following the awful murder of Detective Garda McCabe.  Ritual condemnations are all very fine in this House, but we need action.  The only way to deal with terror is for the State to counter it.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon's contribution was characteristically forthright. I liked it because too many Members make unctuous and bland speeches while others are the product of script practice.  I do not work from a script, I have been unambiguous in speaking out against the IRA and Provisional Sinn Féin and, therefore, I have no hesitation in speaking today. However, Deputy McGahon was over the top in regard to some areas.  There is no proof that internment would in any way eliminate Sinn Féin-IRA from our society.  I am opposed to the reintroduction of hanging.  Retributive justice is no good.  How would we feel if the Birmingham Six, the Guilford Four and many others had been hanged?  We would feel we had been part and parcel of that injustice.  I know Deputy McGahon's views and I will not go down that road.  A hangman could not be found in Europe, one would have to be brought in from a repressive South American regime, which would be unacceptable to our people.  I agree we have tried the olive branch and that people have thrown it back in our face.</P>
      <P>The incident of which the Deputy spoke took place in Adare not too far from Limerick city, of which I am Mayor.  I know some of the people concerned in the IRA there.  There are not hundreds of people involved in the IRA there.  It is not a nest of terrorists or a no-go area.  A small number of hardened IRA activists are there and they have a small number of supporters. They have given Limerick city and county a bad name, but are not representative of Limerick people.  As Mayor of that city I can say openly and honestly that we are ashamed of what has happened.  A dog would not be killed in the same way Detective Garda McCabe was shot last Friday.  It was dreadful and should never have happened in our society, especially given that the people concerned are preaching peace.</P>

      <P>Sinn Féin is preaching about injustice, discrimination and victimisation. What more victimisation or discrimination can there be than to take somebody's life in cold blood?  It has no right to take anybody's life or to act as judge and jury.  Two wrongs will never make a right.  Irrespective of what has happened to Nationalists in Northern Ireland, it has no right to kill people in cold blood.  Deputy McGahon is correct about the number of the innocent people who have died needlessly, killed by bombs or guns.  That cannot be justified. No cause can justify such killings or give people the right to take lives.</P>
      <P>I said in the House before that ideology must serve people, not the other way around.  Any ideology, communism, nationalism, capitalism or any other &ldquo;ism&rdquo; must serve people first, not the other way around.  That incident was a terrible tragedy and, like Deputy McGahon, I extend my condolences to the late Detective Garda McCabe's widow and family and other families of gardaí who have been killed, to whom he referred.</P>
      <P>Since last week's atrocity I have thought of previous injustices, public officials who were killed in the course of their duties.  To my knowledge Detective Garda McCabe was the only detective Garda to have been killed in Limerick. The late Pat Nugent, a public official, was killed in Bunratty some years ago.  He was a banqueting manager of Shannon Development Company which held medieval banquets in Bunratty Castle.  He was 23 years old, a teetotaller who was given the job of trying to stop the pilfering of food and drink from Bunratty Castle after banquets and other functions.  His life was taken needlessly and I have felt for his family because nobody was brought to justice for his killing.  I hope that the killers of the late Detective Garda McCabe are brought to justice and full justice is applied, but I would not go down the road advocated by Deputy McGahon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be madness to have 25 more years of killing in Northern Ireland and <Col N="1973" /> for those troubles to spill over here. Who wants that?  An attempt has not been made to appease Sinn Féin-IRA, but a balance had to be struck between keeping them out in the cold and attempting to bring them in.  The involvement of President Clinton was well meaning.  He did what he could as President of the strongest, largest and wealthiest country in the world to endeavour to bring pressure to bear on IRA-Sinn Féin to bring them back into the democratic process, and that was worth doing.  It is easy to talk with the benefit of hindsight.  There was euphoria and some ambiguity to which Deputy McGahon referred.  Issues were swept under the carpet at that time, but they have come out from under it now in a disgraceful way.  We are not squeamish either about facing up to those things.  The Deputy is right in what he said about the difficulty of finding a formula or a panacea that will bring militant Unionists on board.  I am not talking about the former para-militaries on the loyalist side.  They are making the most sense in the tower of Babel that is Northern Ireland today. They are endeavouring to speak in a practical way and to have an open mind about the future and I support what they are saying.  Other people, for example, the DUP, are going in the opposite direction from Sinn Féin-IRA. There is an attempt being made to bring them towards the centre.  That is the only way to find a solution to the problem, not by extreme Unionism or extreme nationalism, but by endeavouring to find a common mean, a common ground between the two.  There must be room for good will and compromise. That is the only way forward.  To say one is in favour of compromise does not mean one is a weak person.  It takes a strong person to know when to compromise and to act accordingly.  We need somebody to act in that way now on both the Nationalist and the Unionist sides, people who will put themselves above narrow, sectarian, sectional interests and say the time has come to cry halt to the bloodshed, to go forward <Col N="1974" /> together and work out our future on this part of the island.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong for this House to support any concept of two rival Garda groups, because one group would up the ante or try to outmanoeuvre the other. The public spectacle of that could not be tolerated in a democracy.  We have seen enough of recrimination and bitterness among gardaí.  Even though we have heard some unctuous statements about the Garda Síochána, they have not done themselves justice by their squabbling and internecine differences that have surfaced nightly on television and radio and in the press.  It should never happen that rival groups in the Garda Síochána should fight it out in the public domain.  I am old-fashioned enough to believe that we look to the Garda Síochána to give an example in our society.  We look to the Garda to uphold the law and to be seen to uphold the law among themselves as well as everybody else.  We will not go down the road of more recrimination and more bitterness.  We have had enough squabbling among the Garda Síochána.  The time has come for them to behave as <Col N="1975" /> mature human beings and to give an example to all of us by sitting down together and working out their differences.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to some of the people who attempted to mediate, for example, Kieran Mulvey and John Horgan, the former chairman of the Labour Court. It is a can of worms and if it were opened up fully the Garda Síochána would not come out of it very well.  It would be better if the dispute were ended before it goes further.  It is a disgrace to everybody concerned that the Minister should be forced to put a Bill before this House to knock sense into the Garda.  It should never have got to that stage.  There are experienced people in the Garda and sophisticated machinery is available to them to sort out their differences.  I appeal to them to pull back from the brink because they will not come out of it very well if everything is brought into public view.</P>
    <P>There have been differences between the groups for some time and no attempt has been made to bring them together.  The rift has widened and the parties have become far more bitter, to the detriment of democracy and goodwill towards the Garda and to the detriment of law and order.  We are living in a time of unprecedented crime.  The Garda can learn from other western democracies where a similar growth in crime has occurred, where there has been similar development in drug taking with ancillary theft, crime and so on.  We can learn from those countries.  The Garda must learn to become a modern sophisticated force as the Army is trying to do.  The reform of the Defence Forces should take place in parallel with the reform of the Garda.  I support the call for a commission to look into the role of the Garda in our society and bring about a modern, honest, efficient, intelligent, united Garda force.  People might say that is a pipe dream, given the difficulties. However, there is no reason not to strive towards that.</P>
    <P>The leaders of both groups in the Garda must learn to subordinate their <Col N="1976" /> own personal, private, narrow, sectoral interests in the interests of the public they serve.  We are all public representatives. We are public representatives in this House.  The Garda Síochána are public servants.  They must learn to behave as such.  It would be wrong if the Garda Síochána thought they had unrivalled liberty and licence to do as they wish in our society or exert pressure because there is too much overtime. If there is a need for more gardaí, we can take them on.  There must be control of overtime &mdash; it should not be entirely at the discretion of the force when overtime shall apply.  There must be balance, and the rules that apply to other workers in our society should apply to the Garda Síochána also.  The Garda are not a law unto themselves. They must behave in a democratic way that is acceptable to ordinary people and, above all, to this House.</P>
    <P>It is a sad day that we have to discuss this Bill just a week after Detective Garda McCabe was killed in cold blood in Adare, County Limerick.  Having had a large funeral and tributes paid to him in the House, he should not be forgotten. There is a human dimension to that tragedy.  His wife and family will never forget him or how he was killed. Nobody deserves to die in that way. Nobody has the right to take innocent life.  It must be condemned unreservedly. It is not to the credit of the people in Sinn Féin that they have been ambiguous about this.  An Post went to Limerick with cheques for old age pensioners and people on the dole.  I see nothing patriotic or good about taking money from unemployed people and pensioners, as the perpetrators of this crime were intent on doing that day.  Let us think deeply during the course of our discussions on this Bill.  Let us think about Detective Garda McCabe, that he will not have died in vain.  Let his heroic death and the sacrifice he made be an example to his colleagues in the Force, and let them act accordingly in an intelligent and democratic way by coming together to sort out their differences in a way that is acceptable to all of us. <Col N="1977" /> We are pointing the finger at the Unionists in Northern Ireland and saying that their stance of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; is a disgrace to democracy, that they have an obligation to sit down with other constitutional politicians to look at the future of Northern Ireland in a fair and just way.  The Garda themselves are no example to the Unionists or anybody else while they behave as they are behaving now, in a petulent, childish and aggressive way towards each other. They cannot point the finger at anybody, certainly not at the Unionists, while they behave in this way themselves. In a small country with a small population and many problems endeavouring to maintain a high standard of living on the fast superhighway that the modern world is, there is no going back to the old days.  We cannot have our loaf and eat it in terms of accepting the good points of our society and ignoring the bad.  The Garda have a duty, a responsibility and an obligation to put their past differences behind them, to come together before this Bill goes through this House in its five stages, before they are forced and dragooned into one body.  Those recriminations could still fester, no matter what the legislation. The Garda have the solution in their own hands.  I appeal to them to use common sense, to put their past differences behind them and give an example not only to their members but to society as a whole and bring about a solution to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this Bill had to be brought before the House.  I am sure nobody regrets it more than the Minister who, given her background and the history of this country, is a great champion of the Garda Síochána. Before I speak on the Bill, I want to publicly offer my sympathy to the wife and family of the late Garda McCabe from Limerick who was cold-bloodedly murdered on Friday morning last by the IRA.  Let there be no pussyfooting about who was involved.  There should be no ambiguity.  It should be clear to people what is happening in this <Col N="1978" /> country.  It was a brutal, callous, cold-blooded murder of a member of the Garda Síochána.  I did not know Detective Garda McCabe and his name had never been mentioned to me but strangely his son is a Garda in my constituency, on Border duty in County Monaghan as a result of the BSE scare.  The son is following in his father's footsteps.</P>
      <P>From what I have read of Detective Garda McCabe he was a fine family man.  He has gone to his eternal reward far too early.  Any man would be proud of his fine family.  Thousands turned out for his funeral to pay tribute to him and to support his wife and family. The attendance showed the public abhorrence of his callous, cold-blooded murder by parasites, a slur on our country. Those who murdered him are nothing less.  I compare them to murdering dogs in the dark of the night after sheep on the side of a mountain.  I hope this will never be repeated.</P>
      <P>I am appalled and disappointed that Sinn Féin could not join in the condemnation of the murder.  That shows the road that party is travelling.  The members of Sinn Féin are at a crossroads, they have not made up their mind and time is running out for them.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has served the country well.  Coming from a Border constituency I pay tribute to them for preventing the overspill of violence in Northern Ireland during the past 25 years, although some difficulties were experienced in towns such as Belturbet and Monaghan.  The gardaí were there when they were needed and were prepared day in, day out to give their life to defend the people and uphold democracy.  That can never be forgotten. That was the reason the force was established and it has upheld that great tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become more difficult in recent times for a garda to do his duty.  The drugs scene and the type of crime has changed the way gardaí operate.  They have succeeded in adapting in many instances but they encounter major problems with well armed and equipped <Col N="1979" /> mobile criminals and drug pushers. Given the support they deserve, the Garda will overcome those problems and deal with those involved in activities that contaminate the youth, the next generation.  For that reason it is sad that the Minister should find it necessary to introduce this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried various means to bring together the groups involved in this dispute.  It is understandable that difficulties would emerge in such a large organisation but it is sad that the members of the force could not reconcile their differences and organise themselves properly to be able to negotiate on behalf of their members, which is what the Bill is about.  I do not doubt that the various sections of the Bill address that problem.  The role of the Garda Síochána is so vital that we cannot take this Bill lightly.  After its enactment I ask the Garda to rally together and accept the provisions in the Bill that address their problems.</P>
    <P>I have the highest regard for the work of the members of the Garda Síochána. At this historic stage of our development following Monday's all-party talks on North-South relations, the role of the Garda Síochána will be extremely important.  There are mavericks in society who want to exploit the difficulties in Northern Ireland for their personal gain which has nothing to do with national unity.  It is simply a disguise for armed robberies of banks, post offices or, as Deputy Kemmy said, robbing the old and those on social employment schemes, as was their intent in Adare, County Limerick.  Those people are ruthless.  They masquerade under the umbrella of the Tricolour and will parade on Easter Sunday and Easter Monday but have little reverence for the flag and use it simply as a cover to allow them continue in their callous ways. They have no respect for life and the Garda force is well aware of that. Detective Garda McCabe and Detective O'Sullivan were simply doing their duty on Friday morning last when they got in the way &mdash; Detective Garda McCabe <Col N="1980" /> was murdered.  I wish Detective Garda O'Sullivan who was seriously injured a speedy recovery to health on behalf of the people of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The day Irish people lose respect for the Garda is the day we go down the road to anarchy.  It was emphasised by the vast turnout at the funeral of Detective Garda McCabe that 99 per cent of Irish people respect the Garda Síochána and appreciate the work its members do to protect their interests.  At times we may get annoyed with the Garda but its members go about their duties in a very professional manner.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, no more than any other organisation, has black sheep. It is to be expected that occasionally the force will be infiltrated by those intent on passing inside information to illegal organisations.  Fortunately this rarely happens.  Ninety-nine per cent of the people respect the Garda Síochána and 99 per cent of the members of the force deserve that respect.  Long may it continue.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the gardaí to reconcile their differences and come together as a force that can be the pride of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in welcoming the Minister's overdue initiative.  I compliment her on the introduction of this very comprehensive Bill.</P>
      <P>I beg the indulgence of the Chair to stray a moment from the specific purpose of the debate to join in the expressions of sympathy to the wife and family of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and the members of the force on his brutal, senseless and futile assassination.  I also send my good wishes to the family of Detective Sergeant Ben O'Sullivan and wish him a speedy recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of support among the community for the Garda Síochána became apparent after the shocking events in Adare last week.  The thousands who filed by to pay their respects, attended the funeral service and lined the streets in Limerick for the cortege is testimony to the widespread support latent within the community for the Garda Síochána <Col N="1981" /> and the invaluable service it provides. Many of us on occasion have reason to grumble about particular actions, but the bond of trust and the recognition of the service the Garda Síochána has diligently provided since the foundation of the State is an essential cornerstone of our democracy.  This has enabled it to flourish and prosper and reach the level of maturity it has reached.  No one epitomised this more than Detective McCabe and his colleague.  I did not know the Garda personally but from the tributes paid to him by his colleagues and friends he appears to have been an exemplary member of the force.  As Deputy Boylan said, this is the hallmark of practically every member of the force.  I pay tribute to the gardaí in my own constituency for the courteous and diligent manner in which they go about their duty.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, regrettable that we find ourselves having to legislate to force a reconciliation on the representative side, all kid glove attempts having failed.  The Bill is over due because the dispute was beginning to have an effect on public confidence which is essential if gardaí are to carry out their duties effectively and speedily.</P>
    <P>The option of having two representative organisations has been mentioned in recent weeks.  This could not be countenanced in any circumstances as there would be a tendency to engage in oneupmanship and competitive bidding for members while public confidence in the Garda Síochána would be undermined. The GRA conference broke up in awful circumstances, as we saw on our television screens.  In one fell swoop that served to bring the force into disrepute.</P>
    <P>There is a need to preserve public confidence in the Garda Síochána.  A number of recent incidents have served to undermine it.  The rural policing regime has not served the interests of either the public or the Garda well.  It is important that gardaí are accessible and known to the community they serve. While they may be more mobile and cover a greater area the element of personal contact has been lost with the <Col N="1982" /> result that they are not picking up the titbits of information that are so essential to resolving and preventing crime. Therefore, the Minister should give serious consideration to making it compulsory for gardaí to live in the community they serve.  The chief superintendent has not been resident in the region I come from for well over a decade. Most of the people who have filled this position have been sent from Dublin and whisked back after a period of eight to ten months.  There has been no continuity.  The Minister should seriously consider this aspect by way of helping to cement the bond between gardaí and local communities.</P>
    <P>Every day of the week gardaí are in court.  Some time ago there was an incident in Cyprus involving a member of the force and the Minister for Defence. In the court hearings which followed, sworn statements were made by members of the force.  It is vitally important that we can retain confidence in members of the force when they make statements before the courts.  I would consider it a serious breach of the code of conduct of members of the force should it be compromised by the incident in question.  If that is the case further action on the part of the Minister will be necessary.  The Garda Síochána and the courts are an essential cornerstone of our democracy and that should not be jeopardised in any way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue. The festering row which has continued for close on two years has not profited the Garda Síochána in general. One tends to have at the top of organisations such as political parties, trade unions, the GRA and the Garda Federation personnel who are removed to a certain extent from the people they represent. There is an anxiety among rank and file members of the Garda that the arguments being fought out in their names are not in their interests.  It is important that there should be a properly constituted democratic body to represent their interests.  To a certain extent the GRA and the Garda Federation have been hijacked for reasons <Col N="1983" /> which do not serve the best interests of the members they purport to serve.  This legislation will resolve once and for all the infighting and squabbling which have done little either for members of the force or the community.  It should, therefore, be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a personal interest in the Garda Síochána.  I must inform Deputy Lenihan that I come from a family with strong republican traditions. It has been annoying to listen to members of other political parties referring to their organisations as the only republican parties.  My grand-uncle, Joe Ring, was the first assistant commissioner of the police force.  Not many people are aware that he helped to establish the Garda Síochána.  If the Ring family had been supporters of Fianna Fáil, I would probably be in President Robinson's position in the Phoenix Park.  That is not how things are, however, I am proud that my grand-uncle helped to set up the Garda Síochána.  I have always been a supporter of the Garda Síochána.  I believe in law and order and the need for a strong police force.  From the first day a Government was formed in this country, the Garda Síochána supported it.  I compliment the present Garda Commissioner and his predecessors for the service they have given.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to sympathise with the McCabe family.  I wish a speedy recovery to Detective Garda O'Sullivan and I also sympathise with his family who have undergone a stressful time during recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had believed that the day of the ballot in one hand and the armalite in the other had passed, but this is not the case.  Murder is murder.  The murder of a member of the Garda Síochána must be condemned by everyone.  Regardless of the side of the Border on which they live, politicians must condemn this act. If they refuse, they should not be permitted to enter the democratic process. The day of the armalite and the bullet is ended.  The people have spoken and <Col N="1984" /> they want to be represented by democratically elected politicians who will support those who protect the citizens of the State on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, did not want to introduce this Bill.  She brought it forward because there was a major disagreement among members of two splinter groups.  It is not right that we should see people on whom we depend to protect us, and who do a good job on behalf of the State, appearing on television to wash their dirty linen in public. The people of Ireland have become nervous about this because they have always supported the Garda Síochána. The Minister gave the gardaí every opportunity to reach an agreement, but this did not happen.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of certain parishes in the west where parish priests and curates need separate houses.  On Sunday mornings they stand on the altar and preach to people about how they should live together and be loving and kind. However, they cannot live in one house. The Garda Síochána must live in one house, support each other and have one organisation to represent them.  The Minister for Justice has more important things to do than come before this House to put the Garda's business in order.  She does not want to interfere with their business.  She wants gardaí to have an association to represent them in negotiations on pension rights, wages, etc.  I support the Minister because she is right.  It is not right that we should see the people we respect and support fighting on television.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána have my full support.  There are gardaí in my constituency who do not like the way I voice my opinion on rural stations or my view that they should reside in the area in which they work.  I strongly believe this should be the case.  Deputy Creed stated that the local chief superintendent has never resided in his area.  I live in Westport where three superintendents were trained during a period of twelve months.  Trained for what?  They <Col N="1985" /> travelled from Dublin, were given promotion and spent time fishing.  The people got to know these gardaí and gained confidence in them, but they returned to Dublin when a crime occurred.  I believe that legislation will come before the House in the future which will oblige prospective gardaí to sign a form stating that, on joining the force, they will reside in the area in which they work.  The State will encounter trouble when gardaí lose contact with people in rural communities.</P>
    <P>The gardaí have done a wonderful job since the inception of the State.  Last year a serious situation arose when a number of murders occurred in a short space of time. Not many representatives of the media, who are critical of politicians at times, are present in the House this evening.  A number of television programmes such as &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; focused on the murders to which I refer.  I compliment the Garda Commissioner, who is retiring on 19 July, and the members of the force for the marvellous job they did during that time.  Most of the murders that took place were solved. However, the gardaí did not receive the same publicity or media coverage in this regard as they did when the crimes took place.  The media merely referred to that fact that people were arrested for particular murders.  There was no &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; special to congratulate the gardaí on the great job they did.  They have the support of the State and every Member of this House and should keep up the good work.</P>
    <P>We live in a State where people must be protected.  When they go to bed at night, people want to know that the Garda Síochána will protect them.  To the men of violence and the people who could not find it in their hearts to condemn the murder of a garda I say, &ldquo;Shame on you&rdquo;.  They have an opportunity to enter the democratic process and have been given a mandate to represent the people who elected them at the peace talks.  They will be able to express their views and could perhaps suggest how the Garda Síochána might <Col N="1986" /> assist the RUC in protecting people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my support for the Garda Síochána and my belief in law and order.  There is no place in this State for those who do not support the Garda.  I have a long association with the Garda Síochána.  My grand-uncle lost his life in the service of this State and, were he alive today, he would not like to see internal squabbling in the Force.  As I stated earlier, he helped to establish the Garda Síochána.  I suppose it would be called political bias now but an unprecedented number of people from the west joined the Force at that time.  I am glad that many people from that part of the country remain anxious to become gardaí because they believe they have something to offer this State.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not want to introduce this Bill.  She gave the gardaí every opportunity to resolve their problems.  I call on all organisations representing gardaí to get their act together.  This House, the State and the people support the Garda Síochána.  The people showed their support when Detective Garda McCabe was murdered and showed that they will not tolerate such actions.</P>
    <P>We support the organisations representing the gardaí, and the public demonstrated their support when they turned out to pay their respects to one of its members who lost his life last week.  The public will not tolerate such action.</P>

Mar tá súil agam go mbeidh na gardaí ar fud na tíre níos ciallmhara ná mar atá siad faoi láthair agus go mbeidh deireadh leis an squabble atá eatarthu faoi láthair.  Ní dhéanann sé maitheas ar bith do na Garda agus ba mhaith leis na daoine a bheith cinnte go raibh na gardaí ar obair lena chéile agus nach raibh aon troid ann.  Ní thugann sé sampla ceart don gnáthphobal, go mbeadh daoine atá ag <Col N="1987" /> tabhairt aire dóibh ag troid eatarthu féin.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam nach mbeidh aon ghá leis an mBille seo mar go mbeidh na Gardaí ag éisteacht agus go ndéanfaidh siad rud éigin chun go mbeadh ceardchumann amháin acu nó federation nó pé rud é &mdash; beidh ainm faoi leith ag an Aire dó &mdash; agus go mbedih siad le chéile sul i bhfad.</P>
      <P>Like many previous speakers I express my admiration for the work of the Garda since the foundation of the State.  Gardaí have always been respected by the decent people of this country.  I join other Members in expressing my sympathy to the families of Detective McCabe and Detective O'Sullivan in their time of sadness.</P>
      <P>The people who turned out for the funeral of Detective McCabe in Limerick were expressing the views of the majority of people who show great respect for members of the Garda and abhor the callous murder of Detective McCabe.  As Deputy McGahon said, one would not kill a dog in the manner in which Detective McCabe was killed.</P>
      <P>The criminals who murdered Detective McCabe were not caught unawares, they did not fire their guns to defend themselves.  They shot in cold blood a decent man who was doing his duty and who had served his country well. Nobody can console the families of these two detectives in their trauma but it must be some consolation that so many people turned out for the funeral of Detective McCabe.  In fact, the removal of his remains was delayed by almost four hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public depend on gardaí to maintain law and order and they believe they should be a united force.  I find it difficult to understand the current dispute. It would be easier to understand if the Garda were at loggerheads with the Minister over pay or conditions, but one wonders what motivates a group of people to split in such a bitter way, considering their position in society.  What is the reason behind such a bitter dispute? If it were a question of power, <Col N="1988" /> that would be an unusual cause of the dispute.  I am sure people have lost money as a result of the dispute in travelling around the country, despite their expenses, and that makes it more difficult to understand the reason for all this bitterness.</P>
    <P>The public must wonder how members of the Garda can concentrate on their duties with this dispute in the background.  Because of the type of work in which they are engaged, they must be alert and clear-thinking at all times when trying to solve crimes and apprehend the criminals who are doing so much damage across the country.  If the public suspect that gardaí are spending their free time planning ways to overcome the opposition in this dispute, they will lose respect for them and that would be unfortunate.  If the gardaí are held in low esteem, the co-operation and help they need from members of the the public will not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It is vital that this dispute does not continue.  As Second Stage of the Bill is almost complete, I hope gardaí around the country will read extracts from this debate and agree to some form of arbitration, thereby bringing an end to the dispute.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not want to bring in this Bill.  Nobody likes to have to tell a group of people to unite and from one union.  As a former teacher, I know the Minister for Education would find it difficult to introduce a Bill forcing teachers to form one union.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice must take action and if she is forced to proceed with the Bill, it will be a reflection on all gardaí who will be seen to dig in their heels on this issue.  That is not welcome in the present climate where people attending the negotiations in the North are digging in their heels and holding to their extreme views.  If the Garda force the Minister to act in this dispute, it will be a serious reflection on the force, which would be unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I have no relations in the Garda Síochána but I wonder if we are reaching the stage where certain standards will be introduced in the recruitment of <Col N="1989" /> gardaí that may not be helpful.  Young people fortunate enough to achieve high marks in their leaving certificates are expected to study medicine, veterinary medicine or pharmacology in college. They are so intelligent when they graduate they do not want to work with people but engage in medical experiments, research, etc.  That is not a wild statement.  If the points system continues to attract students into medicine, problems will arise in future.</P>
    <P>Similar problems may arise in terms of Garda recruitment.  There was a time when a well built man from the country with sixth class primary school education could pass the Garda college entry examination.  Many of them did pass it and went on to rise in the Garda ranks in later years.  They were good men who were prepared to become involved with the local people.  They played football and other games with them and they knew what was happening in their communities.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that new members of the Garda, who may have honours leaving certificates or even degrees, will find the life of a garda a little mundane and unrewarding.  If so that should be examined.  In the long term we want one representative body for a happy united Garda force which is prepared to patrol the streets.  Since I came into the House every TD talks about this on a regular basis.  Squad cars are the greatest scourge since the Famine.  They are great vehicles for getting from one place to another quickly but if somebody wants to break into a house and knows when the Garda car will pass he has the next six hours to do it.  It is still important to see the Garda on the beat but that does not find favour with the Garda authorities.  One will always be shot down on that matter and will be told we are in modern times.  That is the reason I worry about the standard of education.  If the garda would prefer to deal with computers, hi-tech cars and so on, is that why he is not prepared to go on the beat.  In the past they all seemed to be on the beat and when one passed through a town one always saw gardaí <Col N="1990" /> on the beat?  I am told now it is a waste of time but.  I am not so sure.  If they are on the beat they know and are known to the people and young people see them in a friendly atmosphere and will develop respect for them.  The squad car makes no impression.  It is ideal for getting quickly to the scene of a robbery or an accident, but patrol duty in a squad car serves little purpose.</P>
    <P>I regret this Bill had to come before the House although I could talk about falling standards, the increase of crime levels which is questioned by those in charge and the fact that so many old people are in danger in their homes. People would feel safer if they had a united Garda body prepared to give its time to protecting and caring for them. They do not want to think the Garda force does not have its mind on the job, particularly a certain group which is leading the fight in this division.  It would be much better for the Garda if it became a united force in every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that regardless of what happens the Minister will not have to implement this Bill.  I hope the Garda throughout the country will realise it is not good if it, as the upholder of law and order and high standards, has to be forced to unite.  For the good of the country and the force I hope it will agree to unite.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice I, like other speakers, wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the late Detective Garda McCabe.  I wish to associate the House with condemnation of the tragic reprehensible incident whereby Garda McCabe's family has been deprived of the breadwinner.  We attended the obsequies on Sunday evening last and it brought home to us in graphic and stark terms the magnitude of the death of the breadwinner of a large family, a man who was highly respected.  It serves to renew our resolve that there is no place in this society for <Col N="1991" /> people who carry out such deeds.  Likewise we send our best wishes to Garda O'Sullivan for a full and speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  There has been broad acceptance by all parties of the need for this legislation to resolve this damaging dispute.  The Government appreciates that the Opposition do not propose to divide the House on the issue.  That will give a clear message from this House concerning the serious and damaging nature of the dispute which has affected the force for some time.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the Garda Federation's wish to have the Mulvey report implemented and failing that, that the federation be afforded recognition.  I am pleased Deputy O'Donoghue and other Deputies accept there should be only one representative body for the Garda rank.  A number of recommendations of the Mulvey report are incorporated in the Bill.  These relate to the appointment of a president, vice-president, general secretary, trustees, the adoption of standing orders and the reconstitution of the Central Executive Committee to give more proportional representation to DMA gardaí.  The other recommendations in the Mulvey report are essentially matters which are not appropriate to this legislation.  His recommendations concerning the establishment of subcommittees by the GRA on various topics, the appointment of an external ombudsman to sort out internal disputes, the exhortation to avoid legal recourse and instead avail of the ombudsman services, that existing officers and officials in paid employment should have the option of having their contracts bought out are all matters which can only be acted on by the association itself, if it so chooses.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue also referred to the Minister's alleged failure to meet the GRA.  The Minister met all three parties in the dispute, including the GRA, on four occasions: 22 February <Col N="1992" /> 1995, 20 March 1995, 24 July 1995 and 21 May 1996.  The Minister's efforts at reaching agreement with the bodies could be described as exhaustive.  The attitude of Fianna Fáil, as indicated by Deputies O'Donoghue and Lenihan, is that it will support the Bill &mdash; I appreciate the support from the Opposition &mdash; but that the Minister should meet all parties again to attempt a resolution before the Bill reaches Committee Stage.  As the Minister indicated, this Bill came about precisely because exhaustive efforts aimed at reaching a consensus have failed.  Nonetheless, I am sure the Minister will consider what Deputies have said.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned the GRA criticism of the power in section 4 to disestablish a representative body, the suggestion being that this is excessive. The power to disestablish is a power which, as the Minister said in her opening remarks, a Minister would be slow to exercise.  It is the last resort option which will carry the full authority of the Oireachtas, but if a representative body refused to implement the changes required, that would be a serious situation and would require a serious response.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the view, which she does not share, that the Bill is contrary to the Constitution. Article 40.6.1 iii. of the Constitution guarantees the right to form associations and unions subject to public order and morality but it also provides that laws may be enacted for the regulation and control of the exercise of that right in the public interest.  In the 1988 Haughey case, the Supreme Court acknowledged that a reason for public concern and public interest was the possibility of multi association agitation or industrial action by the Garda in the sensitive areas of pay, pensions and conditions of service.  In that case section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, was deemed constitutional in so far as it permitted refusal to establish more than one association with the objects of pay, pensions and conditions of service. There is no reason to believe the court <Col N="1993" /> would look at the matter any differently when it came to consider this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell and Lenihan also asked how the Minister could satisfy herself that section 2 has been complied with, saying the Bill should not specify the extent of the majority required to be deemed sufficient.  The purpose of the Bill is to reconcile the different groups in one organisation and if this is achieved the provision would be superfluous.</P>
    <P>A number of factors must be considered by a Minister in determining whether such a majority exists.  There is, for instance, no obligation on any member to join the representative association and the extent to which members voluntarily choose not to join an association will have to be assessed.  Thus, a certain flexibility is needed which would be lost if a precise figure was specified. The Minister will be concerned whether the association is one with which she can negotiate deals that will please the rank as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked what an order establishing an association would achieve and pointed out that there would be no official representative body to negotiate.  If an association was disestablished it would be open to gardaí to come together to found a new organisation, truly representative of the rank and file, for recognition.  The disestablishment of the GRA would not of itself directly dissolve the association, although that could be the ultimate effect.  Disestablishment would, of course, mean the loss of negotiating rights, the revocation of secondment arrangements from the force, the loss of direct funding from the State and the removal of payroll deduction facilities for the organisation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dukes and Lenihan raised doubts about the need for the provisions of section 10 of the Schedule which require that the appointment of a general secretary shall, in certain circumstances, be subject to the approval of the Minister who may attach such conditions to such approval as he or she thinks fit.  These circumstances are when <Col N="1994" /> the general secretary is a member of the force but not a member of the association or when he or she is not a member of the force.</P>
    <P>Under the existing regulations the Minister already has such power in relation to non-association members of the force becoming general secretary. This power is being extended to cover the new situation created by this Bill, that is, the appointment of a general secretary who is not a member of the force.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the establishment of the GRA in 1978, an agreed report on the Garda conciliation council and a memorandum of understanding with the Garda associations were drawn up which deal with, among other things, the prohibition in the Garda conciliation scheme on public agitation regarding claims, the confidentiality of negotiations, affiliation with outside groups and discipline.  Those agreements are with the relevant representative bodies, membership of which in the case of the Garda association is confined to members of the force at Garda rank.  It would be necessary for the Minister for Justice to satisfy herself that a general secretary who is neither a member of the association nor the force is subject to these agreements.</P>
    <P>Moreover, a general secretary of a body representing gardaí would, of necessity, be in possession of information of a sensitive nature, some of which would pertain to the security of the State.  Therefore, it is appropriate that such a person would be subject to some constraints in relation to public utterances, dissemination of information and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eric Byrne spoke generally on crime, including the drug problem. Deputy Michael Ahern and Deputy Shortall made general points about crime levels.  I will have the points made conveyed to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan raised the issue of the independence of the association whose rule book, so to speak, is set out in detail in the Schedule to the Bill.  The fundamental rules of procedure and <Col N="1995" /> organisation of all the Garda associations are already set out by way of regulations made under section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, which allows for establishment of Garda associations and under section 14 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, which allows the Minister to make regulations in relation to the formation of such representative associations.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated, the reason these provisions are being made by way of legislation and not by regulation as heretofore, is that she has been advised the detailed provisions enshrined in the legislation carry with them the full authority of the Oireachtas and are less open to court challenge.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the level of consultation on the Bill. By definition this Bill comes about because of a failure to reach a consensus. Elements of the Mulvey report are included in the provisions of the Bill and other provisions come about as a result of the detailed discussions with the dissenting parties.  As recently as 20 February 1996 the Minister circulated a document to all gardaí setting out the intended provisions of the Bill.  On publication the Bill was sent to the three groups and on 21 May 1996 the Minister met the three groups to discuss the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan also raised the issue of the right of the general secretary and deputy and assistant general secretaries to attend meetings of the Central Executive Committee.  It will be a matter for the elected CEC to decide whether these officials can attend its meetings.  If their absence will cause administrative difficulties this is within the power of the CEC to remedy.  They may give the officials leave to attend and speak as required.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also queried the appointment of the president and vice president under section 9 of the Bill.  This section provides that these posts shall be filled by members of the CEC upon election by the annual conference.  It provides that candidates must be nominated by at least two divisions and where only one <Col N="1996" /> person is nominated, that person shall be deemed to have been elected by the annual conference.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan referred to the operation of section 6 of the Bill dealing with the review of disciplinary decisions where there are current civil actions on such disciplinary measures.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister stated in respect of this section that one of the considerations she cannot ignore is the current legal proceedings and that will inform all her actions in relation to this section.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the Garda college in Temple more continuing to have an entitlement to a seat on the CEC.  One of the most contentious issues in this dispute was the perceived imbalance in the make-up of the GEC to the detriment of members in urban divisions.  The revised CEC will total 30 members and the Minister does not see how a section of the force containing only 60 members could continue to retain a seat on the CEC.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  The level of participation is an indication of the interest in the Bill.  Although some Members took poetic licence to extend the realm of the debate, it has served to focus attention on an issue that has aggravated the administration to the Garda Síochána for some time.</P>

      <P>I support the motion put to the House that there should be an extension to the deadline for claims to the hepatitis C tribunal.  The importance of this issue was demonstrated by the level of interest shown by the public, the medical profession and those affected by hepatitis C.  It behoves the Minister to act in an even-handed way in the resolution of all the problems associated with it.  The request for an extension should be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of hepatitis C is complex and the prognosis is still dubious in most, if not all, cases.  Approximately <Col N="1998" /> 700 applications have been received to date but we know that 1,300 or 1,400 people have contracted the disease.  The time limit for receipt of applications should be extended to give everyone involved a chance to apply.  Some people are still hesistant to come forward because of a lack of knowledge on some issues.  The case before the High Court could have implications in terms of negligence.  This is another reason people should not be rushed into making decisions before having all the necessary knowledge.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accede to this request because the Blood Transfusion Service Board is at fault.  It did not adhere to its previous high standards when it accepted blood for transfusion purposes from people with a previous history of hepatitis.  That is how the problem arose.  While I accept that the Minister previously extended the time limit for receipt of application by three months, there are sufficient reasons for extending it further.  This is a reasonable request because of the lack of knowledge about hepatitis C.  Extending the time limit by a few months would not place an additional cost on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Many people, through no fault of their own, contracted hepatitis C and the Government has a responsibility in this regard.  The Minister is a caring man and he facilitated that diagnosis of hepatitis C and its treatment at primary, secondary and tertiary level.  However, in the final stages of this matter he is quibbling about the minor issue of giving people an extra few months to make up their minds about whether to go before the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal or the High Court. He should lean towards those affected and accede to Fianna Fáil's request to extend by at least three months the time limits for receipt of applications to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13 December 1995 I spoke on a Private Members' motion on the question of hepatitis C and the compensation to which victims were entitled <Col N="1999" /> and I outlined the medical background which led to the problem.  Women who had received anti-D immunoglobulin in 1977 developed clinical jaundice.  Blood samples taken at the time tested negative for hepatitis B and were retained until a new test for hepatitis C was developed in 1991.  A reliable test was not available for the condition which had been recognised only two years earlier.  If that were the whole story we would not be talking now of culpable negligence.  Three vital years were lost through gross negligence on the part of a State agency.  A warning letter was received from a Middlesex hospital in 1991 about which no action was taken until three years later.  Obviously, the victims of this mismanagement are entitled to fair compensation.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister was angry when he stated that he personally was not responsible for what happened some years ago.  No Member on this side of the House is making that suggestion. I am sure the Minister, as an individual, is genuinely concerned about these people, but by at his own admission he is at the mercy of the accountants in the Department of Finance.  I wish he had the courage to say to them that we are not dealing with an ordinary accounting matter which must add up to a certain figure, but with people whose health has been ravaged through no fault of their own and who must be compensated properly, irrespective of the cost.  If the Minister were seen to address the problem in that manner no Member on this side would use the necessary expenditure as a stick with which to beat the Government at budget time next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night Deputy Hughes compared the Minister's decision to the choices facing competitors in a television game show and he used the example of &ldquo;Take Your Pick&rdquo;.  The Minister's refusal to accept the motion can be dictated only by financial constraints.  This is not a case where prudent management demands cost cutting, any more than a parent would adopt such an attitude <Col N="2000" /> when deciding whether a child could have an expensive operation.</P>
    <P>I was shocked to hear that approximately £1 million was spent by the Minister's Department on an advertising campaign directed at people whose names were known and who could have been easily contacted by post.  For a fraction of that cost each of them could have been contacted by telephone.  This is similar to a mass hypnosis programme designed to brainwash as many people as possible to opt for the tribunal and accept what it offers, but in saying that I am not casting any reflection on the personnel of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In my contribution last December I quoted from a letter I received from the Department of Health which stated that the tribunal would assess compensation on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  In other words, the State would not accept liability but would give a few quid away.  The tribunal could be the most generous of the two alternatives but those concerned are entitled to their day in court if that is their wish.  The Minister has laid down a rule that if a victim accepts an award in the tribunal he or she must waive the right to go to court later.  He is telling these people they are not entitled to their day in court because he says so.  I asked the opinion of a well-known lawyer on this matter and he said that if he had such a client and the High Court subsequently gave higher rewards for a similar case, he would go to court and challenge the State's right to prevent his client from having her case heard.</P>
    <P>Nobody could accuse the Minister of being responsible for the condition of these women, but he is charged with the responsibility, on behalf of all of us, to ensure that fair compensation is available, even if it is necessary to make adjustments to the budget or to introduce a supplementary budget which nobody in this House would have the nerve to oppose.  I appeal to the Minister to have the generosity of spirit to change his mind and accept the motion as it would do no harm to his reputation.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of hepatitis C is one of the recurring nightmares experienced <Col N="2001" /> from time to time by most people involved in the practice of medicine. Like most areas today, medicine has been greatly enhanced by the addition to its resources of high technology. However, it is also a science which depends more than most on the application of human resources and, therefore, is subject to human error.  Sometimes what might appear to be a small error, either in the performance of physical duties or the correct keeping of records, can start a chain reaction which could eventually result in something like the hepatitis C tragedy which is the subject of this debate.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the families of hepatitis C victims. I know of one such family in Donegal where the person involved died some months ago.  There is no indication of how the families of these people will be treated.  This infection has existed for years.  In the case I mentioned the husband had to give up work to look after his wife.  It is not the responsibility of the tribunal to deal with these families specifically, but I hope that when these cases go to court the families of victims will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis A and hepatitis B were prevalent in 1977 and it was deemed acceptable to use the blood of a person with clinical jaundice.  If the person involved had been male, the blood would not have been used.  At that time physical tests and X-rays would have been taken and if no cause was found for clinical or environmental jaundice it was automatically categorised as non-A or non-B viral hepatitis.  This infection came under a viral category at that time and, therefore, culpability lies with the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider our motion, which requests only the postponement of this matter until after the High Court case that is pending.</P>

      <P>Many of us begin our contributions by saying that our sympathies lie with the women affected by this virus and their families, but I genuinely sympathise with them and know exactly how they feel.  I will never forget the morning it was reported on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the blood bank had announced that all women who received anti-D in the 1970s should go for a blood test.  Having received five doses of anti-D in the 1970s, two in the period in which women were most at risk, I was one of those involved.  I do not consider myself a very timid person, and those who know me would agree, but I was practically paralysed with fear when I recognised fully the consequences. I realised there was also a possibility that my children would be affected and I recalled times when they had flu and other illnesses.</P>
      <P>I was the first woman to be tested in Cork and I was very lucky in that I tested negative, but that does not take away from the fear and horror I felt at the possibility of being positive.  I have always been very healthy and perhaps that contributed to the result.  Because of my involvement in this matter I always read in detail documentation relating to hepatitis C.  One tends to consider issues from a personal viewpoint and react accordingly.  Having read the statements by the Minister, the Department and Positive Action and attended various committee meetings, I believe that a balance has not been struck in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three of the most saleable commodities are love, which is very easy to peddle, envy and fear, which is probably the easiest to peddle.  The fear element of this argument has been sold extremely well.  In circumstances such as this I wonder how I would react if I were in the other person's shoes, and since I was involved in this case I know how I would react.  I would expect that I and my family would receive full health care, that I would have the option of <Col N="2003" /> going to court or the easier option of appearing before the tribunal and putting my case to that group of people, that I would have a month to decide whether to accept an award made by the tribunal and if I decided not to accept it that I could go to court and that, even if I applied to the tribunal and decided not to go ahead with the case for whatever reason, legal or medical, the tribunal would not force me to do so.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I was involved in a campaign in circumstances where the State owed money to women over a ten-year period.  I realise the work involved in going to Europe with petitions, employing solicitors and so on to uphold people's rights.  Following publication of Dr. Hederman-O'Brien's report on this matter last April a system was put in place to provide for the victims of hepatitis C.  That is recognition that an arm of the State was criminally negligent.</P>
    <P>I have four extremely healthy children, and that might not be the case were it not for anti-D.  I am, therefore, very grateful for its development.  The manner in which the Blood Transfusion Service Board operated in this instance was disgraceful, but I find it difficult to blame it entirely in view of the fact that my children are healthy.</P>
    <P>To peddle fear and misinformation, particularly among women who are vulnerable and are concerned not only about their health but about their families' future, is unacceptable.  There are people who have a different agenda from the women involved &mdash; they see the possibility of another beef tribunal. It is appalling that women who have been treated disgracefully by an arm of the State will now be treated equally disgracefully by a section of society that should know better.  I ask every woman involved to look at what is on offer, the speed at which it will be available, the care provided, the written contract for the future and the ability to return if they are not satisfied.  Of the more than 60 women who have received awards, not one has been refused.</P>
    <P>It is essential that this should not be <Col N="2004" /> a temporary measure and that the contract with the State should be continuous. Not all Governments will be as open as this one and not all have been in the past on various issues.</P>

      <P>Anyone who has followed this issue over the last year cannot but have the greatest sympathy for women who are infected with hepatitis C or its antibodies.  In common with other colleagues, I have met women in my constituency who have been infected.  They feel a profound sense of injustice; they feel they have been let down, primarily by a State service in which they had previously placed unquestioning faith.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his predecessor have been unambivalent in accepting that the State will pay compensation to the women infected.  This is as it should be but we are morally, if not legally, obliged to go further.  We must do everything in our power to put all available information into the public arena. In so far as blame can be equitably allocated, it must be done.  Whoever was responsible for supplying the infected product, it is clear that the women are blameless, they cannot and should not suffer for the negligence of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The women concerned have been well served by their representative groups and legal advisers.  They have <Col N="2005" /> worked effectively to maintain the public profile of this issue and to ensure that it receives the attention it deserves from the Department and this House.  People who are victims of an unfortunate incident such as this sometimes have a feeling of helplessness, of being alone.  The existence and activities of Positive Action have given them a powerful moral and political voice and in that, the representative groups have performed a valuable and indispensable service.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Lynch said, many of the points raised by Positive Action have been dealt with by the Minister and I am glad this has been possible. However, some outstanding matters of detail have not been agreed.  I do not intend to go into them at great length, as the Minister has already done so, but I join others in hoping these matters can be dealt with, even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker that the framework put in place by the Minister is essentially good.  It would be, to say the least, unfortunate if the atmosphere were soured because it was not possible to reach agreement on relatively minor details.  The Opposition has continuously sought to portray the Minister's response to this crisis as inadequate and mean-spirited.  I reject this line.  Both he and his predecessor are to be complimented on the speed and flexibility with which they approached the issue and on the extensive consultation procedure in which they have engaged.  As he pointed out, the deadline for application by infected women to the tribunal has been extended to six months, after a detailed consultative process with the representative groups.</P>
    <P>I am a legal practitioner, although I do not practise as much as I used to before I entered this House, and I am convinced of the advantages which tribunals, arbitration, mediation and other essentially non-confrontational settings have over legal proceedings.  As a politically active person at the time I had some direct experience of the Stardust tribunal, held over a decade ago.  There are worthwhile parallels between that tribunal and the current one.  To the <Col N="2006" /> best of my knowledge, no award made by the Stardust tribunal was turned down.  The matter was dealt with speedily and with relative informality.  Most importantly, it spared the individuals and families involved, who had already experienced severe trauma, the further trauma of reliving the tragedy and the extraordinary expense which would have been involved in proving liability.</P>
    <P>It cannot be overstressed that the terms of this tribunal are extremely flexible. For instance, the decision to go to the tribunal is not irrevocable &mdash; it can be withdrawn at any time to pursue the legal avenue to the High Court.  Every citizen in this State has a constitutional right to redress through the courts.  They cannot be prevented from exercising this right and of course the Government is not attempting to do so.  The option of redress through the courts remains even after an offer of an award is made and the entitlement to reject an award is affirmed.</P>
    <P>Under the tribunal there is no obligation to prove the case against the State, so victims are spared the onerous obligation of going to court to produce sufficient evidence to prove the State's liability.  This is no small point.  Even if victims took a class action, the costs involved would be considerable.  Given the tecnical nature of much of the evidence, it is probable that the costs would be all the higher.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be seriously accused of not publicising the existence of the tribunal or not encouraging affected women to come forward.  As he said last night, extensive advertising of the closing date for applications to the tribunal was placed in the national and provincial press and it is clear from the figures that this has had its effect.</P>
    <P>Deadlines are a crude mechanism but there is no doubt they work.  They serve to concentrate the minds of potential applicants and their legal advisers and allow Government and the tribunal to make appropriate arrangements.  Also, the tribunal itself has the right to waive the closing date in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2007" /> One further advantage of the tribunal system is that the High Court personal injuries list in Dublin entails a delay of at least three years and the lists outside Dublin are almost equally long.  Many of the women affected by hepatitis C require urgent assistance.  To an objective observer, it appears the tribunal offers the better way.</P>
    <P>It is neither for me as Member, nor for the Minister, to tell women that they must go to the tribunal and eschew the courts &mdash; that is beyond what we are entitled to say.  However, we may say that the Government has responded generously in circumstances where other Governments might not have.  I urge the people infected to give every consideration to what has been put on offer by the Government.</P>

      <P>As I am constrained by time, I will confine myself to a few points.  It was a privilege to have worked closely with Positive Action over the past three years.  I got to know many of its members and it has been rewarding to experience their determination to confront their illness and its effects on them and their families with realism and extraordinary acceptance.  Even though many of them suffer from ill health they nevertheless are devoting all their energies to ensuring that an adequate health service will be available and fair and reasonable compensation will be paid to all who contracted hepatitis C from anti-D or other blood products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been, and continue to be, a sympathetic supporter of many of their requests.  With some of my colleagues I negotiated on their behalf; we were successful in some cases but unsuccessful in others.  I wish to state strongly that Positive Action should never be regarded as agitators or as a pressure group.  The first choice of these women is to continue with their work, whether inside or outside the home, to care for their families and to continue with their lives. The road they have taken over the past two years was not one of their choice <Col N="2008" /> but one which circumstances dictated to them.</P>
    <P>The motion requests the Minister to extend the deadline of 17 June so that no claimant will have his or her case heard before the final court judgment is delivered in the first hepatitis C compensation case.  It is no secret that I also believe &mdash; I have stated this publicly and privately &mdash; no claimant should be compelled to have his or her case heard before the outcome of the final court judgment.  Last night the Minister said he had been assured that no applicant would be compelled to have his or her case heard without agreement on the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing. I discussed this statement with him and he assured me that no applicant will be compelled to have his or her case head before the final court judgment if that is their wish.</P>
    <P>Last week I was concerned when I heard that two recent applicants would have their cases heard in July.  However, I was relieved to learn that requests had been made for an early hearing in those cases.  I hope the Minister's statement will reassure the members of Positive Action that, even though they have to apply before 17 June, none of them can or will be compelled to have their case heard before the final court settlement, if that is their choice.  This will have the same effect as extending the closing date.  Many people believed the easy solution was to extend the closing date, but I am glad the Minister has met the requests made by me and many others to comply with the applicants' wishes in this regard.</P>
    <P>Anti-D was a great drug for those people for whom it worked but it was a tragedy for those for whom it did not work.  While it saddens me that this issue has had to be debated in the House on so many occasions these women can never be adequately compensated by the tribunal or court for what has been stolen from them, their health and future.</P>

      <P>The women who have been affected by this appalling scandal are suspicious.  This suspicion is well founded given their experience of having been given contaminated blood. I understand their suspicion, outrage, anger and mistrust.  Some of their outstanding questions about what really happened will only be resolved at the end of the court cases, while further clarification on other matters will only be forthcoming when the cases are heard in court.</P>
      <P>Positive Action has articulated serious questions as to who knew about the infected plasma and when.  If I had been infected then and found I had been given blood even though somebody in the system knew there was a possibility of an infected source I know how I would feel today &mdash; I would also be sitting in the public gallery feeling outraged and unconvinced.  I pay tribute to Positive Action for the strong case it has made on behalf of these women.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Ahern said, nothing can compensate the people who have been infected with hepatitis C.  This morning the husband of one of the women said on radio that no tribunal or court could compensate them for what happened. Lessons must continue to be learned from this saga.  Apart from this scandal, women's experience of the health services has not been good.  It is to the Minister's credit that he has begun to change this in a real way &mdash; he is the first Minister in Europe to do so &mdash; through the women's health consultation document and the more structured consultation process on the development of women's health services in all health board areas and the National Women's Council.  This issue is related to that being debated here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have not experienced this awful nightmare must ask themselves how they would feel if their wives were in this position.  As legislators and policy makers we must look at how we can rebuild trust in the health service among the women who have been infected. Some of my colleagues and I have been <Col N="2010" /> trying to rebuild some of that trust and deal with some of the outstanding issues of concern to representatives of Positive Action, for example, the oral presentation of evidence at the tribunal and representation by the women's doctors at the tribunal.  They are very fair points.  It was encouraging to hear the Minister say that, in the cases heard so far, all those who wanted to give oral evidence had been able to do so and that solicitors had been told claimants would be entitled to give oral evidence.</P>
    <P>The changes in practice in the tribunal in regard to the concerns expressed by interested groups should be acknowledged.  It has also been clarified that all claimants who sought a provisional award in the tribunal have been granted such an award and that any proceedings before the tribunal can be subject to judicial review.  I ask Positive Action to examine the Minister's statement that a date has to be agreed between the claimants and the tribunal. This will give flexibility to those who put forward their names at this stage to take account of whatever may emerge from the High Court hearing or the Supreme Court hearing, if it reaches that point.</P>
    <P>I wish it had been possible to avoid this debate as I seriously question whether it is helpful to the women who are dealing with this issue in a personal way.  Nothing can compensate these women for what happened.  The Government has put in place a comprehensive health care package and introduced legislation to ensure that it is made available.  I understand that there are positive feelings about this package. A tribunal with flexibility offers a better alternative than the legal system for these women.  I understand that the women involved want to be absolutely clear on the out come of court cases before they take definitive decision. While Positive Action continues to represent the majority of them, all the women involved have an intensely personal decision to make about the route they and their families will take.  I hope all relevant information and advice, <Col N="2011" /> legal and otherwise, will be made available to these women.  While acknowledging that much work has been undertaken within the Department, I ask them to take an extremely open, accessible approach and make a very special effort to be responsive to any inquiries and requests for meetings, perhaps even set up a special facility between now and the final date to deal with any claimants' queries.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have even these three minutes to say a few words about this major tragedy.  This Chamber is not a very appropriate or sensitive arena for discussion of an issue such as this but, like Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I do believe it should be discussed here. I predict that it is not the last time this issue will be discussed here.  Rarely has a tragedy of this magnitude affected such a large group of people through an act of negligence, or worse, of this State. I hope it will be helpful to acknowledge that fact publicly and put on record the huge sense of obligation we all feel towards those affected.</P>
      <P>The first groups of women I met were examining their immediate health needs and talking about medical card cover. Compensation awards were being dealt with separately.  I remember the awful day additional papers were discovered and many women faced the reality, fear or shock that there might have been an extra degree of negligence over and above anything anticipated at that point. That is one of the issues that has led to this request for an extension of the application deadline.  I know the depth of shock, the almost double injury felt on that day.  I understand why applicants have pressed for this extension and why this issue should be taken one stage further in our discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look back on what has been achieved by Positive Action in that period, we find it has been substantial and the Minister's progress in meeting 98 if not 99 per cent of victim's demands is significant.  We started out with <Col N="2012" /> demands for a totally statutory provision for health care and compensation. We now have a full statutory package for health care.  The issues of provisional awards and oral evidence, two of the remaining critical issues in relation to the compensation tribunal, have been clarified in writing and now by case law established by the tribunal to date.</P>
    <P>There remains merely the question of whether women should have the time to hear the judgment.  As many of my colleagues have said, the Minister expressly clarified that issue last evening.  While I would have preferred that the requested extension of the deadline could have been granted, I am satisfied that, bearing in mind the number of applications before the tribunal, none would have been heard unless an early hearing was requested.  The Minister has doubly clarified that issue.  With that assurance I encourage all women considering making an approach to the tribunal to submit their applications before the closing date.  That will not preclude their following the legal avenue.  It will afford them plenty of time and leave them that option.</P>

      <P>Hepatitis C is a fright-ening condition.  Its victims face an uncertain future, unable to plan for the contingencies of life with any degree of certainty.  We must judge this motion in the light of that basic fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of informed consent is not exclusive to medical practice but applies also to the law.  I suggest that what is being requested here is an opportunity to allow victims of this condition to make an informed decision about their options &mdash; not a surprising wish on their part.  This is why my party spokesperson tabled this motion.  If agreed it would <Col N="2013" /> afford victims an opportunity to make a full decision having examined all the facts, determined by the courts established under our Constitution, determined by the High Court, where procedures by way of discovery are available, where cross-examination of evidence is available in open court, where the publicity and openness of those proceedings is guaranteed by the Constitution itself.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested from the other side of the House that the option is always available to a hepatitis C victim to have recourse to the courts, but what the victims seek in this instance is the option or opportunity of making an informed decision having seen the facts exposed in the courts.  This is not an unreasonable request.  We all like to know the facts before making a final decision.  It is understandable that many victims believe they are being rail-roaded into a conclusion by Government proposals and not being given an opportunity to consider all the facts.  It goes without saying that we are all striving to ensure that proper compensation is paid.  I am not endeavouring to make an issue of that with the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>The motion is an appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision, announced yesterday, not to extend the deadline.  While he announced that the time limit would not be extended, he did say that the tribunal would not entertain any case, if that was an applicant's wish, until the conclusion of the proceedings before the courts.  I found that a rather peculiar suggestion because, if one examines the scheme, which is the foundation of the system of compensation put in place by the Minister, one finds that the Minister for Health may amend it.  I should like to know whether it is proposed to amend the scheme in the light of the Minister's utterance yesterday that cases can be deferred.  As I understood the scheme, its whole basis rested on the independence of the tribunal. Yesterday we heard a ministerial utterance in this House suggesting how the tribunal should conduct its affairs.  If <Col N="2014" /> the Minister wishes to secure or build up confidence in this tribunal, it is difficult to see how that can be done if an utterance of his can amend the very terms of the scheme.  It was also stated that the tribunal shall determine its own administrative procedures, its members to be appointed by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how the Minister, through a statement in this House, can even purport to direct the tribunal to hear or not to hear certain cases.  This is not a mere lawyer's quibble.  It goes to the heart of the point made at the very inception of this scheme that it would have been desirable to have these matters hammered out in legislative form.  Had that been done in the first instance, this type of problem would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>This Government talks a great deal about openness.  Essentially what victims are seeking is a degree of open Government, the kind that is administered in our judical system through the High Court.  They are not seeking it on an individual basis but rather on the basis of a case in respect of which proceedings have already been instituted which will afford them an opportunity to ascertain exactly what are the facts. It is not an unusual circumstance in human affairs that people are anxious to know the facts before taking important decisions in their lives.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister and his colleagues are so determined to oppose this motion, which is really an effort to ensure fair play, no more and no less, for hundreds of women who have been struck down by a condition which, in some cases, can endanger their lives and in most will curtail their lives and well-being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Moffatt and McDaid, both <Col N="2015" /> medical doctors who are better placed than most of us to understand and grasp the full consequences of this tragedy, gave the stark medical facts about these cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid referred to the plight of the families of some of the victims, something many people would not have considered.  He referred to a case with which he was acquainted, where the victim died before she could go before the tribunal and her husband had given up his job to nurse her.  His loss of earnings, not to mention the infinitely greater loss of his wife, do not appear to have been taken into account in the scheme of things.  What would be the High Court's view of this type of case?  If that man's wife had been killed by a motorist driving negligently, the damages awarded would have been substantial.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to this type of case.</P>
    <P>The Government is robbing victims of their rights and the truth has been heartlessly shown numerous times during the past two and a half years. Women who issued writs in court proceedings had letters from the Chief State Solicitor stating that if they chose to ignore the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal, their cases would be fought by the State right up to the Supreme Court.  That was blackmail and intimidation of the highest order.</P>
    <P>A June date was sought in a High Court action and turned down despite the serious ill health of the plaintiff.  The judge in giving a date of 8 October said the woman could go to the tribunal if she became more seriously ill and wanted an earlier hearing date.  The State contested that woman's right to anonymity probably in the hope that forcing her name into the public arena would dissuade her from taking court action.</P>
    <P>The Government tried to shove a tribunal at these victims without giving any commitment to health care.  Even at this stage, the health Bill for the hepatitis C victims appears more aspirational than practical given that the Minister for Health is unable to outline to the Dáil <Col N="2016" /> the specific funding he provided or the agreements he reached with the health professionals on the details of that Bill. In recent months the Dáil debated the hepatitis C issue on different occasions and those debates were singularly marked by the Minister for Health's refusal to make what he calls &ldquo;any concessions&rdquo;. His refusal of concessions is totally inappropriate considering the circumstances of this tragedy, the worst ever in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>His Fine Gael colleagues pleaded in the House for the Minister to reconsider the issues.  The Fine Gael Parliamentary Party appointed three mediators to ascertain if common ground could be reached between both sides on this issue.  Those mediators failed to secure even one change to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal scheme.  They did not even get a detailed certificate of authority to seek the right for the tribunal to ask details from an employer, the Department of Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners and others.  They were not dealt with fairly by the Minister and their lack of success is a testament of the iron will with which hepatitis C victims were confronted.</P>
    <P>The Dáil was told last week that the average compensation payment made by the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal in 62 offers was £106,000.  The cases before the tribunal differ in terms of ill health and future prognosis, but does the House believe an average total payout of £106,000 is adequate compensation for a life-threatening illness, considering that figure most probably includes loss of earnings, travel, other costs and takes account of future worsening ill health and associated problems.  I am sure the House does not consider that is adequate.  I am also sure history will judge the Minister and Government and show that average award is not adequate or just.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to make the victims of this tragedy believe that applications to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal meant people had confidence.  They mean nothing of the sort.  If hepatitis C victims had confidence that the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal <Col N="2017" /> was a fair means of pursuing their compensation claims, the Department would have been flooded with applications from early this year, but that was not the case.  The Minister is now using the threat of the closing date and the rigid adherence to the 17 June deadline as a means of trying to instil a false confidence in his flawed tribunal.  If he is so confident, why is this tribunal seeking application forms without supporting documentation?  The Minister should not be mistaken in believing that a pile of forms in Arran Quay on 17 June spells confidence.  The confidence of which the Minister speaks must also be expressed in the light of more than 500 High Court writs that have been issued by hepatitis C victims.  Surely that is a clear indication that the people suffering from hepatitis C do not have confidence in the tribunal.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats support the Fianna Fáil motion.  I listened carefully to the Minister's speech last night when he defended the Government's decision not to extend the deadline beyond 17 June as called for under the terms of the motion and by the women affected by this scandal.  He advises it is in the best interest of the claimants to get early legal advice as to which course of action they should pursue.  To that end he argues that this, like all deadlines, focuses the mind and galvanises lawyers acting for those who have been positively diagnosed with hepatitis C.  He argues that the indefinite extension of the date within which a claimant must apply would lead to uncertainty for potential applicants.  He further argues that a deadline ensures administrative efficiency from the State's point of view. He gave an important assurance to the House and to the women concerned that he had been assured by the tribunal that no applicant will be compelled to have his or her case heard without agreement to the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing.  He made the case in defence of his position that the <Col N="2018" /> Government must have a reliable picture of the full financial implications of the tribunal for budgeting purposes.</P>
      <P>Those arguments might seem reasonable from the point of view of the Minister representing the State.  His advice represents a different and conflicting perspective from that being strongly given to potential applicants to the tribunal. Even after 8.30 p.m. the question as to whether the Minister has convinced the persons concerned that he is right and they are wrong about their fears concerning the deadline for the receipt of applications will still not have been positively answered.  The conflict of legal advice given to the Minister and to potential applicants to the tribunal is at the heart of this debate.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that throughout the debate on this issue the Minister is representing the State.  He is a defendant in these proceedings and therein lies the conflict and the difficulty.  If the Minister is the defendant and the women are the plaintiffs, who is advising the best course of action in the public interest as distinct from the State's interest in this affair?  That is where the role of the Dáil comes into play through the efforts of the Opposition, particularly Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who pursued this matter on behalf of her party.  On 12 occasions we pressed the agenda on behalf of the women concerned because there is nobody else to press their case in the public interest. The Minister is a defendant in these matters and inevitably he will put the best case forward to protect the State's interest.  The role of the Dáil in an elected democracy is to advocate the public interest on behalf of the women concerned.  Was it in the public interest that the persons who had responsibility for the Blood Transfusion Service Board between the years in question should have been given golden hand-shakes in a deal negotiated by the Government?  Is that level of accountability for presiding over maladministration on such a scale satisfactory in this democracy or in this House?  It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> No Member of this House felt happy that that was an end to the matter in relation to accountability for maladministration, but that is what is offered by the Government.  Following earlier negotiations on deadlines the Minister, by agreement, extended from three to six months the time limit within which a claimant must apply during the course of the earlier negotiations.  Since then, a discovery of documents in a case before the courts has transformed the situation from the perspective of the victims and the State.  It changes utterly the nature of the potential claim against the State. That is why their request in this motion that the deadline be changed is reasonable. They are advised, and I agree, that the decision in the Roe case could transform the nature of the State's liability to other infected women.</P>
    <P>The fact that a court order of discovery revealed facts by way of a file which were not evident, despite the Minister's claim to the contrary in the expert group report, has necessarily heightened the suspicions of the women concerned.  The Minister claims this was not new information.  In other words donor X, the woman whose blood donations caused 90 per cent of the women treated with anti-D product to become infected, had a clinical diagnosis, from 1976 of infective hepatitis. This was before any of the plasma was used by the BTSB to make anti-D.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this issue it must be remembered that these women have understandably lost confidence and are inherently suspicious of the State and of public administration generally.  There is an ongoing fear of being sold short, of being misled.  This may be unjustified and from the Minister's point of view may appear unreasonable.  However, each victim has to be taken at face value, and from a subjective perspective, do not trust what is currently being offered to them.  They are understandably suspicious of proposals.  Their subjective view is one of unhappiness and suspicion, and they are being urged <Col N="2020" /> to take a particular course by their lawyers. It is inevitable and human that they will do as their lawyers advise.</P>
    <P>One of the particularly unfortunate aspects of this method of dealing with compensation by tribunal is that the women are being dealt with as a group. Dealing with individual victims as a group and referring to them as a cohort inevitably diminishes the individual's sense of individuality.  That goes to the heart of the matter.  It may be tidy from the point of view of both sides to deal with the women as a group.  However, in dealing with women who have suffered so badly in their own individual way, given their families, their psychological condition and their individual ability to cope with the levels of stress caused by this injury, one has to understand that it is very hurtful for them in the long term to be treated as a group because they all have their own stories, hurts and abilities to cope with this disaster. Each has a unique set of circumstances, a unique family profile, a unique health profile, a unique capacity to work through the tragedy which has befallen them.</P>
    <P>It is sad that it has taken so long for the tribunal to be established and for the medical services to be put in place, and that everything has had to be extracted slowly and negotiated painfully by women who are sick.  It is understandable that they are worn out and bitter.  The State and the House must be appreciative of that.  The use of language generally is very important in dealing with this matter.  There is among the women a backlog of bitterness and disappointment fuelling the present debate.  Deputies on all sides of the House are so sympathetic towards the individual women and their families that it is difficult to express their fury at how long it has taken for their negotiations to extract all the concessions they needed to have fair compensation and fair medical services.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that none of us knows the full truth.  None of the women knows the full truth.  They have reached the conclusion that the Bridget <Col N="2021" /> Roe case will finally extract the truth. That is the reason for the request for the deadline to be changed.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that there is such a low level of truth between the women and the State at this point.  I acknowledge that a full range of medical services has been put in place to the satisfaction of the women.  However, the issue of compensation goes to the heart of the taking of responsibility by the State.  The State has decided to accept responsibility.  It promises fair compensation, to provide medical services, offers the tribunal and waives the obligation to prove negligence. Ordinarily this would be a very generous waiver by a defendant, because proving medical negligence is extremely onerous for a plaintiff.  When there clearly is negligence, it is obviously in the interest of the State to waive the obligations to prove it, because a finding of negligence or a greater degree of negligence would not be in the interest of the State.  If there is a finding of culpability or recklesss negligence, that changes the liability of the State.  It will also make it difficult to retrospectively justify the manner in which the negotiated deal was done with the persons who presided over the maladministration in the first place.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister made a rather unworthy accusation of irresponsibility against Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  This is the classic case of shooting the messenger. It is only through this House raising the issue, for the twelfth time, that the limits have been stretched and concessions extracted.  Only last night we received assurances from the Minister on very important points which were still worrying the women.  It is thanks to pressure from Deputies in tabling motions and amendments, and from the women outside the House, that the concessions were given, among them that no applicant will be compelled to have her case heard without agreement to the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing, that in all cases heard so far oral evidence has been heard &mdash; it has been <Col N="2022" /> confirmed in writing to the lawyers acting for parties at the tribunal, that proceedings before the tribunal will be subject to judicial review and that all claimants who have sought a provisional award have been granted it.  The Minister still holds out against extending the deadline.  He says that it will make no difference, that the women will not be jeopardised or will not be detrimentally affected because of it.  If that is the case, why not extend the deadline?  The Minister has not made the case for not doing so.  He has not made the case sufficiently from the point of view of the subjective perspectives of the victims individually. That is what matters.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats will support this motion.  Perhaps there is still time, even at this late stage, for the Minister to reconsider the extension of the deadline.  I note he says that the operation of the tribunal is subject to review, and that at any time in the future, if he is given evidence and is convinced that the workings of the tribunal are not serving the best interests of the claimants, he can use his powers to have it reviewed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has good will, but everything has had to be extracted painfully by way of motions in this House.  It is a vindication of Dáil Éireann that we have succeeded, as best we can &mdash; I include Deputies from the Government side &mdash; in negotiating with the Minister, in pressing the boundaries, in extracting concessions which are very important to this group of victims, individually and collectively.</P>

      <P>The closing date for the receipt of applications to the Compensation Tribunal is next Monday, 17 June.  The tribunal is situated in Arran Court on the quay adjacent to the Four Courts and was newly furnished, equipped and designed to the highest specification for the comfort and convenience of claimants.  Features of the tribunal include: no person is compelled to apply to the tribunal; it is a matter for each person to decide <Col N="2023" /> whether to pursue his or her claim through courts or through the tribunal; application forms unsupported by medical data-records are accepted by the tribunal to comply with the closing dates as indeed are &ldquo;letters of intent&rdquo; to apply.  This is indicative of the flexible and understanding approach being adopted by the tribunal; the making of a claim to the tribunal does not involve a waiver of any right of action; the time within which a claimant must apply to the tribunal was already extended from three months to six months; all claimants who have sought a provisional award in the tribunal have been granted a provisional award; claimants shall be entitled to give oral evidence; no tribunal award has been rejected; payment of an award is made within 28 days of receipt by the tribunal of notification of acceptance of an award; the tribunal has given an assurance that no applicant will be compelled to have his or her case heard without agreement to the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing; the tribunal received an additional 51 applications today to bring the number of applications to date to 817.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn levelled serious charges against me both inside and outside this House in relation to particular information concerning the expert group report.  It was suggested, both inside and outside the House, by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that as the expert group did not see a particular file, which had been discovered under a Court Order, it was therefore not fully informed on the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis of the donor to the plasma pool used in the manufacture of the anti-D product in 1976-77.  At the time of the establishment of the expert group, the Department of Health, the then Minister for Health and the members of the expert group were in no doubt that the donor to the plasma pool had an episode of infective hepatitis.</P>

      <P>Certain sections of the media bear responsibility for the dissemination of misleading information through their lack of research and careless coverage &mdash; The Irish Medical News of 9 April 1996; &ldquo;Today at 5&rdquo; on RTE Radio 1 of 9 April, 1996; <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 April, 1996; The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 26 April and 3 May, 1996; <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of 5 May, 1996; the &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo; programme on RTE 1 on the 5 May, 1996; and <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 12 May, 1996.</P>
      <P>This is particularly serious given the sensitivities of the issues involved. Despite Dr Hederman O'Brien's letter on 27 May 1996 having been circulated to the media, there has as yet been no real effort by the offending media to set the record straight.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to urge all Members of the House in particular Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn to be responsible in their approach to all matters relating to hepatitis C to ensure that the stress and trauma being experienced by many of these people who have been diagnosed as having hepatitis C is not increased unnecessarily by misleading and imprecise information.  It is of the utmost importance that the correct information is presented in all discussions on this matter.  It is despicable to seek to gain political advantage from the tragedies of other people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that at all times I have been responsible when discussing this issue in this House. <Col N="2025" /> It is largely due to the responsibility shown by Deputies on this side of the House that we have got concessions from the Minister for victims of hepatitis C.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment last night to the Fianna Fáil motion on extending the deadline for the hepatitis C tribunal describes the compensation tribunal as an alternative to court proceedings. By any definition an alternative means an informed choice.  That is not what applies if the Minister maintains the deadline of 17 June.  If the deadline stays, victims will have to take one route or the other.  This will not be a choice based on all the facts, it will be an uninformed gamble.  If victims had a real alternative they would have the full facts and they could then choose to take their case to the tribunal or the High Court.  As it stands they will have to gamble on not applying to the tribunal and waiting for the outcome of a High Court case and probably a Supreme Court case and instead going to the tribunal without the full facts and before the High Court and the Supreme Court have ruled.  While the Minister said last night that victims would not be forced into a hearing on a particular day, provision is not made in the tribunal's terms of reference for postponement of hearings.</P>
      <P>Based on what the Minister said last night, which was limited and carefully worded, there is no guarantee that a claimant can postpone his hearing indefinitely. Otherwise the tribunal would probably not have any cases and that is not what the Minister envisages.  What the Minister said during a Private Members' debate is hardly legally enforceable by victims.  Based on the Minister's refusal to change the deadline or enshrine indefinite postponements as part of the terms of reference of the tribunal, victims have to make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision is one that victims should not have to make and is unfair in the extreme.  As we state in our motion, we want the deadline extended until three months after the final court <Col N="2026" /> judgment is delivered in the first hepatitis C compensation case.  This is the fairest way forward and this is a reasonable request.  Having listened to the Minister for Health last night, I have not heard any good reason for keeping the deadline of 17 June.  All the reasons given by the Minister were for his own considerations with no regard for what the victims want.</P>
    <P>Our reason for seeking this extended time frame is that the full facts of the hepatitis C contamination of victims have not yet emerged and the Minister for Health has failed to reconvene the expert group or establish an inquiry into the ongoing revelations about the hepatitis C contamination.  The Bridget Roe court case has effectively become the only vehicle by which the truth can come out.  It is unfortunate that a case taken by a citizen has effectively become the tribunal of inquiry for the 1,600 victims.  This does not appear to influence the Minister for Health or the State's law officers.  They seem intent on being as awkward as possible about this sick woman's case.  That case will begin three and a half months after the current closing date for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons to believe other facts will emerge in the court case and that at last we will begin to strip away the layers of the cover-up that has been perpetrated.  The preliminary hearings in the case have already disclosed that the Blood Transfusion Service Board knew in 1976 that donor X had infective hepatitis rather than just jaundice or environmental hepatitis.  It was disclosed in the preliminary pleadings that donor X's plasma was used to manufacture anti-D without her permission and without the permission of her clinician.  The work for the court case has also uncovered files that up to now have been hidden away.  Those files were not shown to the expert group that investigated the hepatitis C controversy, a fact which has been confirmed by the Minister, by the Minister of State tonight and by the chief executive <Col N="2027" /> officer at the Blood Transfusion Service Board before a Dáil committee.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan what he planned to do about withholding information from a Government-appointed inquiry team but he has not replied.  Those files show that in 1976 the Blood Transfusion Service Board knew that the woman's plasma was not infected with jaundice but with the much more serious infective hepatitis.  As many as six different tests are shown in the file all clearly marked infective hepatitis.</P>
    <P>Victims have endeavoured unsuccessfully to get answers to the question posed by Deputy Frances Fitzgerald tonight as to who knew then about infective hepatitis plasma and what they knew about it.  There has been a significant development in the courts in the hepatitis C test case yesterday which would point to further revelations in how the contamination occurred.  The High Court yesterday gave the woman at the centre of the case the right to find out which officials of the Blood Transfusion Service Board had information on hepatitis in 1976.  The woman's lawyers are now entitled to get what they could not get from the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the names of every employee who might have information on a plasma exchange donor who had been suffering from infective hepatitis in 1976.  The court ruled that the woman was entitled to seek information as to the identity of each and every servant or agent of the Blood Transfusion Service Board who became aware of the quantization reports concerning donor X and the date on which each individual became aware of them.</P>
    <P>I will take up a number of other points made by the Minister.  He issued a thinly veiled threat to Positive Action, one of the groups representing victims, warning it that its Department of Health funding could be in jeopardy unless it toed his line.  Positive Action and Transfusion Positive have been effective lobby groups and it is their role to be a thorn in the Minister's side.  Without <Col N="2028" /> their presistence many of the facts of this scandal would not have been established.</P>
    <P>They have also represented the public interest in this affair.  Deputy O'Donnell agrees the Minister appears to have dropped this dimension and the sole hat he now wears is that of the defendant. The greatest failure of the Government in its response to the ongoing revelations about the Blood Transfusion Service Board and how this appalling scandal happened is that it has been part of the conspiracy and cover-up rather than revealed information.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play of the fact that he has made considerable concessions in the scheme of compensation and cited ten examples.  For him to claim that these inclusions are signs of his flexibility is a joke.  The exclusion of transfusion victims and standard legal provisions for minors from the first scheme was a massive oversight.  For him to claim that including them in the scheme is a great deed is typical of his attitude to this affair.  He seems to be able to regard the tribunal and the compensation scheme only as a charitable act by him.  This is demeaning to victims.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been expansive in describing how well the tribunal is working.  I was surprised to hear that cases are scheduled up to 31 July only as he has claimed for some time that there are enough applications to keep the tribunal going until 1998.  What will happen if every claimant seeks a deferral based on his comments last night?  As Deputy Lenihan rightly asked, what is the legal basis for these utterances?</P>
    <P>The provision for the deferral of cases seems to be minimal.  Is it yet another ruse to get victims into the tribunal? Will the Minister include it in its terms of reference?  Will an applicant be able to postpone his or her case for months on end or will there be a limit?  Can all cases be postponed until after the final judgment in the Bridget Roe case has been delivered? <Col N="2029" /> That the Minister did not elaborate on all these points &mdash; this is critical information &mdash; leads me to believe this is a half baked notion to get some Government Deputies off the hook. Throwaway remarks in a Private Members' debate do not have legal status and will not be worth the paper they are written on when it comes to the crunch.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave reasons as to why he will not agree to an extension of the deadline.  None of them was convincing. I was surprised to hear him yet again use the inefficiency of solicitors and lawyers and his own departmental concerns as reasons for riding roughshod over the demands of victims.  Surely, the convenience of the Department of Health is less important than what those infected want.</P>
    <P>The Minister was keen to play up the significance of the letter from the expert group.  Unless he has a different letter, that correspondence is most significant because it confirms that the expert group asked for all relevant documentation. Surely, the file discovered is relevant, yet, the chief executive of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the Minister and the Minister of State confirmed that it was not given to the expert group.  How many more relevant documents are there which the expert group asked for but did not get?</P>
    <P>The Government is asking the victims to whom it has a responsibility, to give up their rights in the courts, to accept a non-statutory tribunal which does not guarantee them even basic fair play. What is fair about a tribunal which does not guarantee an individual the right to have a doctor or consultant heard in a case if this is important?  What is fair about a tribunal which does not have the power to compel a witness to attend before it?  What is fair about a tribunal which does not guarantee an individual the right to a provisional award or a contract if they accept an interim award?</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donnell rightly said, it must always be remembered throughout this debate that the victims of hepatitis <Col N="2030" /> C are sick people.  They are women, men and children whose lives have been altered by contracting a virus through the negligence of others.  They will become more seriously ill in the months and years ahead.  The main drug in use will only halt the progression of the virus; it will not kill it.  Many will die prematurely and, for most, the quality of their lives has been changed by hepatitis C.  It is these sick people to whom the Government has refused to listen and make concessions and is now bullying to a tribunal without even the simple comfort of knowing the truth.</P>
    <P>My concern in relation to missing records continues.  The Minister tried to suggest that only a small number of people are affected by missing records. However, when he was given ten cases as a start, records could only be found in two of them.  Surely, he was not suggesting that only ten victims' records were missing.  That would be a serious charge to make.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Deputies have told victims privately they support the extension of the deadline.  This was confirmed tonight by a number of Government Deputies.  At the Select Committee on Social Affairs several Government Deputies unanimously supported the extension of the deadline and co-operated with sending a letter to this effect to the Minister. Many Government Deputies know this is the only effective way for victims to have options and alternatives.  They should not bury their heads in the hope that hepatitis C and this controversy will go away.  They should take a stand and communicate to the Minister the dissatisfaction they have expressed to the victims about his handling of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Goodwill is something we often talk about in this House.  It is something hepatitis C victims have seen little of from the Government.  This is an opportunity for Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Deputies to show their goodwill towards the men, women and children in their constituencies who have been infected with hepatitis C.  I ask them to have the courage of their <Col N="2031" /> convictions and support the extension of the deadline.  They should take account of the promise in the programme, A Government of Renewal, to provide fair treatment and compensation to the victims <Col N="2032" /> of a State agency.  Victims have a right to know all the truth.  We as democratic politicians have a duty to ensure they know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the greatest scandals in our health services is the lack of orthodontic treatment for the great majority of Irish citizens.  Since I was elected to this House I have received countless complaints from the anxious parents of teenagers and from teenagers themselves.  I found the progress made by the Department of Health and the health boards to be inexplicably slow or at times non-existent.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic treatment is accessible only to the rich and better off families. Working parents, the unemployed and their children are effectively told to get lost again and again by the Eastern Health Board and particularly those in my area of the north side of Dublin. There is the charade of categories one. two and three waiting lists in the Eastern Health Board Region.  Being placed on categories two, three or further down is a polite way to fob off parents and their teenageers.  It is frustrating.</P>
      <P>While I am certain the Minister for Health will sympathise with sensitive young people who have badly formed, or crooked teeth or a very crowded mouth, he will surely appreciate the extreme anxiety of a young boy or girl who may be jeered by classmates from wealthier families or who is deeply embarrassed by this problem at the first discos or teenage social gathering of their young lives.  When young adults are at the most difficult and vulnerable stage of their development this problem occurs and has often had a detrimental impact on them</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case study from my files is typical of what children and parents suffer.  The parents of an 11 year-old boy, category three on the waiting list, was placed on <Col N="2037" /> this list in 1988 and is still waiting eight years later for much needed treatment. The boy is in full-time education and there had not been a hint from the EHB when he will be treated.  One must ask why there are such categories.  This boy's parents could not afford the £3,000 necessary for private orthodontic treatment in the State or the cost of treatment in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another young boy has been assessed as a category two case, which should have high priority for treatment, but he has been waiting almost five years.  A girl on the same list has waited for the period of her second level education for treatment without any response from the EHB.  She urged her father to contact me; I contacted the Minister and the EHB, yet nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister, in his typically vigorous fashion, has tried to redirect resources to cope with this problem.  During 1995 the EHB increased its number of orthodontists from two to five and the appointment of two consultant orthodontists has been approved by the Minister for the EHB. However, there has been a problem filling these posts, apparently because dentists and contultants seem to prefer the lucrative private market.  As a result, the first of the consultants will only start work on 1 July next.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also allocated funding for the construction of two new orthodontic units at Beaumont and St. James's hospitals.  He has also indicated that EHB categories one and two will be reduced and that category three patients will be treated.  I respect the good faith of the Minister's determination but while his plans are taking effect slowly our working class teenagers and children are suffering.  They demand urgent action.  If that means shaking up the lucrative dental profession, then so be it.  Let us solve this problem as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of orthodontic treatment services for eligible <Col N="2038" /> children in the Dublin area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  Children requiring treatment are assessed by the board in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department to which the Deputy referred.  The guidelines ensure that those most in need of treatment receive it.  The organisation of services within the Eastern Health Board's region is a matter for the board having regard to the principle of equity as set out in the National Health Strategy.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has agreed with my Department a framework for the development of its orthodontic services. This framework provides for a shared consultant orthodontist with the Dublin Dental Hospital; two full-time consultant orthodontists based at Beaumont and St. James' hospitals; eight qualified orthodontists &mdash; one per dental area; ten dentists working under the direction of the two full time consultant orthodontists and support staff &mdash; dental surgery assistant and administrative staff.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has made the following progress in implementing this framework: the shared consultant with the Dublin Dental Hospital is in place; a consultant orthodontist will take up duty with the board on 1 July. The board plans to re-advertise the second consultant post, with extensive advertising abroad and additional dentists with orthodontic qualifications have recently commenced employment with the board.</P>
      <P>Pending the full implementation of a consultant led orthodontic service the board has also entered into arrangements with a number of private orthodontists for the provision of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funds have been provided by my Department over recent years specifically for the development of orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board region.  Since 1995, under the Dental Health Action Plan, I have increased the annual allocation to the Eastern Health Board by £650,000 to enable the board to provide additional orthodontic treatment services.  This <Col N="2039" /> extra funding will allow for the recruitment of additional dentists together with support staff to work under the overall direction and supervision of consultant orthodontists to provide an increased level of orthodontic treatment services.</P>
    <P>In addition, I allocated £250,000 in capital funds to the Eastern Health Board in 1995 to provide additional facilities and specialist equipment to assist in the provision of secondary care orthodontics.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problems faced by the Eastern Health Board in developing its orthodontic services and the lenghty waiting times faced by many families in securing orthodontic treatment for their children.  I accept that such waiting periods are undesirable.  The main problem is not, however, one of resources.  It is the problem faced by the board in securing the services of consultant orthodontists, who can develop its services in accordance with the strategy outlined in the Dental Health Action Plan.</P>
    <P>Where health boards have been successful in recruiting consultant orthodontists it has considerably improved the services provided by these boards. This demonstrates clearly the success of my Department's strategy of consultantled teams for the provision of orthodontic services, I am hopeful that, with the appointment of a full-time consultant orthodontist to the Eastern Health Board, there will be a substantial improvement in the board's services and a reduction in the waiting times for treatment.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that a primary task of the consultant orthodontist is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and one of high quality.  I will, in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board, continue to develop the orthodontic services over the course of the Dental Health Action Plan so that the level of <Col N="2040" /> service provision will be brought to the level of actual treatment need.</P>

      <P>It is with regret that I raise again the issue of the care of patients in the Woburn House nursing home in Cork and the operation of the nursing home under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act.  An independent inquiry was carried out into this nursing home and it found there was inadequate patient care, inadequate insurance, an absence of registered nurses and overcrowding.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the inquiry, a nurse manager was appointed and the inadequacies outlined in the report of the inquiry were said to have been put right. The health board management indicated its satisfaction with the arrangement. We were informed that if there was another breach of the regulations severe action would be taken.</P>
      <P>On 7 June the nurse manager was dismissed and wrote a letter alleging serious breaches of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act.  Had the nurse manager not been sacked I am not certain whether he would have written the letter. The allegations dealt with the adequacy of patient care, the prescribing of drugs by an unregistered nurse and medical treatment Protocols being carried out by an unqualified person &mdash; all of which issues arose in the findings of the independent inquiry.  There were also allegations of the re-use of nappies, another issue in the findings of the previous inquiry.  The possibility of overcrowding was also mentioned.  By and large, the allegations are a restatement of the previous ones made about this home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board proposed, with the agreement of the owner, the appointment of a member of staff of the health board while an internal inquiry proceeded.  However, the issue has gone further.  I am anxious that natural justice would be seen to be done and I am conscious I have received only <Col N="2041" /> one side of the story.  The letter written by the individual concerned was sent to the chief executive officer of the health board duly signed.  Therefore, I felt it appropriate to bring this to this Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in association with the chief executive of the health board, to appoint the members of the previous inquiry team who are familiar with the nursing home to investigate these serious allegations.  They did a superb job on the previous occasion.  Therefore, in conjunction with the chief executive officer of the health board, will the Minister consider reappointing that ready-made team?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I was pleased to launch the code of practice for nursing homes last year.  The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly recommended that the Department, in consultation with the health boards and representatives of nursing home proprietors, should draw up a code of practice for nursing homes.  Work on the code took place in parallel with the preparation of the regulations to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the code is to give nursing home proprietors and staff, officers of the health boards and the general public a better understanding of what is involved in providing high quality care to residents of nursing homes. The code attempts to define what is currently considered to be good quality nursing home care.  It builds on the best practice in nursing homes at present.  I am satisfied most nursing home proprietors are attempting to implement the recommendations of the code to the best of their abilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 31 March 1996 a total of 354 private and voluntary nursing homes had been registered by the health boards.  Of these, a small percentage were found to be in breach of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations, 1993.  I can assure the Deputy that the health boards view any breach of the Act and <Col N="2042" /> regulations in a serious light and all complaints are investigated without delay.  The health boards inform me that where breaches have been identified the nursing home owners concerned have, in general, co-operated fully in meeting the standards laid down by the Act and regulations.  This is borne out by the Southern Health Board's detailed investigation into Woburn House nursing home.</P>
    <P>The inspection and registration of nursing homes are essentially functions of the health boards.  I received the Southern Health Board's report on Woburn House nursing home in February last.  As the Deputy will be aware the inquiry team found that in the operation and management of Woburn House nursing home, there were some serious breaches of the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993. Arising from the inquiry, the chief executive officer of the board directed that revised administrative procedures be implemented, particularly in relation to complaints and the functions of the board's nursing homes inspection teams. The board has since appointed a designated officer to act as nursing homes complaints officer.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that further allegations have been made in the last few days regarding the operation of Woburn House nursing home. The Southern Health Board inform me that it immediately referred these allegations to the nursing homes complaints officer for investigation under the new procedures.  Pending the outcome of this investigation, and in view of the allegations made against the home and the previous inquiry, the board proposes, under section 9 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, to assign one of its employees to take charge and manage the home on behalf of the board for a period of one month.  This has been agreed by the home.</P>
    <P>With the appointment of the board's representative as temporary manager of the home, the investigation of the allegations by the complaints officer under the new procedures and visiting of the <Col N="2043" /> home by the inspection team, the board is satisfied the matter will be addressed. I can assure the Deputy that officials of my Department will remain in close contact with the board to ensure a speedy resolution to this matter.</P>

Is masla é ní domsa ach don phobal atá ag déanamh an iarratais seo, nárbh fhiú leis an Aire teacht isteach, ní don chéad uair, leis an cheist seo a fhreagairt.</P>
      <P>Tógadh Scoil Chuimsitheach Chiaráin ar an gCeathrú Rua sa bhliain 1966 &mdash; i mbliana tá sé 30 bliain d'aois.  Scoil chuimsitheach í agus ceann de na fadhbanna atá éirithe ná nach bhfuil aon tuismitheoir ar an mbord agus b'fhéidir da mbeadh, go mbeadh caoi curtha ar an scoil fadó.  Tá idir thuismitheoirí agus múinteoirí tar éis teacht ag na Teachtaí Dála sa cheantar agus agamsa go minic faoi cheist na scoile a bhfuil fíor-dhrochbhail uirthi.</P>
      <P>Ar ndóigh, is scoil Ghaeltachta í agus nuair a tógadh í sa bhliain 1966, ní hé an oiread sin de mhuintir na háite a bhí ag freastal ar an meánscoil.  Idir an dá linn, tháinig méadú as cuimse ar líon na scoláirí atá ag freastal ar an scoil.  Ar an eolas atá agam anois, tá suas agus anuas le 400 scoláire ag freastal go lánaimseartha ar Scoil Chiaráin ar an gCeathrú Rua.  Sin os cionn dhá oiread an uimhir a bhí ag freastal ar an scoil chéanna i 1966 agus níl aon chosúlacht ar an scéal ach oiread go dtiocfaidh laghdú ar líon na scoláirí a bheidh ag freastal ar an scoil seo, amach anseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá drochbhail ar an scoil ó thaobh struchtúir de agus níl dóthain áiseanna ann ach oiread.  Ó tógadh an scoil is beag obair a déanadh uirthi iriamh: rinneadh roinnt bheag oibre tamall beag ó shin ach is beag san.  I láthair na huaire tá fadhbanna móra ann maidir le díon na <Col N="2044" /> scoile, leis na leithris, fadbh taiseachta, agus nil aon rud déanta fós mar gheall orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá easpa áiseanna ar an scoil, freisin. Tá seomra an-bheag ag an múinteoirí; níl aon leabharlann ann anois mar an áit a bhíodh mar leabharlann tá sé anois ina seomra ranga.  Is beag áiseanna saotharlainne atá ar fáil agus is bocht freisin iad na háiseannna spóirt atá ar fáil sa scoil. Níl dóthain spáis ranga ann ach oiread: an cás is tromchúisí uilig, b'fhéidir.</P>
    <P>Mar fhreagra ar cheist Dála scríobh mé ag an Aire i mí Bealtaine 1995 agus fuair mé admháil ar an litir ach freagra ní bhfuair mé.  Chuir mé ceist Dála faoin scoil, tá cúpla mí ó shin ar an 6 Márta. Sa bhfreagra a fuair mé dúirt an tAire go raibh fiosrúchán agus suirbhé déanta ar an scoil ach diabhal cinnidh nó scéala a fuair na tuismitheoirí ó shin faoi céard atá sé i gceist a dhéanamh leis an scoil.</P>
    <P>Bheadh mé ag súil agus beidh mé ag súil anocht go bhfaighidh mé dea-scéala, go bhfuil sé i gceist an Roinn gníomhú maidir le cúrsaí tógála na scoile, cur leis na háiseanna agus déanamh cinnte go bhfuil an chóiríocht chéanna ar fáil sa scoil seo agus atá ar fáil i mbunáite scoileanna na tíre.  Níl aon chúis go mba cheart go mbeadh ar an dream is faide siar bheith ar an ndream is measa as ó thaobh áiseanna scoile.</P>
    <P>Tá muintir na háite ag iarraidh le fada go ndéanfaí rud éigin leis an scoil.  Beidh mé ag súil, ainneoin easnamh an Aire féin anocht, go mbeidh dea-scéala ag an Aire Stáit dom anocht.</P>

    <P>I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom gearrchuntas a thabhairt ar chúlra an cháis seo. <Col N="2045" /> Osclaíodh Scoil Chuimsitheach an Cheathrú Rua sa bhliain 1966.  Tá rollacháin ceithre céad daichead's a ceathair (444) dalta ag an scoil fé láthair.  Mar chóiríocht tá príomhfhoirgneamh trí urlár ag an scoil, comh maith le clochar trasna an bhóthair uaidh.</P>

    <P>Cheana féin, tá oifigigh ón Roinn tar éis cuairt a thabhairt ar an scoil chun an réiteach is sásúla ar a riachtanais chóiríochta a aimsiú.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this topic for discussion and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, for coming in to reply. I would have liked the Minister for Justice to reply, but I am aware that she is in Northern Ireland on very important Government business and I respect that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charities are now big business. Despite an estimated annual turnover in excess of £300 million, the sector is totally unregulated and any group that appears to be concerned about a particular cause can set up as a charity and embark upon a programme of collecting money.  Inevitably, the lack of regulation will lead, and I fear has already led, to sharp practice, trickery and <Col N="2046" /> fraud.  Accordingly, I call on the Minister to put in place as a matter of urgency a proper national system of regulation and registration.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight a case which causes me grave concern and which was reported in a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on RTE about three weeks ago.  I speak of the fundraising activities of what is called the All Ireland National Children's Hospice.  To date that organisation has raised in excess of £1 million. It operates out of two premises in Cork city, one in Limerick, one in Kilkenny and one in Dublin.  It has applied for and been issued with collection permits in each of these areas.  The promise is that a hospice for sick children will be built to provide care for seriously ill and dying children.  There is, however, no evidence that such a building has been put in place or is about to commence, nor is there evidence of any such building in the course of planning or preparation. Despite that fact and that it has never been recognised by medical authorities here, permits have been issued to that organisation up and down the country.</P>
    <P>In the case of Cork city, 58 collection permits were issued, an average of one every five days.  I understand from speaking to the chief superintendent in that city that all future permits are frozen.  Why was that organisation issued with such a large number of permits when there was no evidence to demonstrate that a hospice was being put in place or that a hospice-type service was in the course of delivery or preparation.  Was no one responsible for checking that the collectors represented a bona fide charity?  Are those who organise charity collections accountable to anyone?  What happens the donations they receive?  What has been done with the £1 million collected by this organisation? I call on the Minister to initiate a full investigation into these matters and report back to the House.</P>
    <P>There is a legitimate hospice in Cork city, St. Patrick's established by the Irish Sisters of Charity.  That hospice has given, and continues to give outstanding <Col N="2047" /> service to people in the Cork city and surrounding areas.  Some 40 per cent of its funding is raised on a voluntary basis. Can anyone imagine what it could do with the £1 million in question?  How can this very worthy charity or any other legitimate charity continue to fund-raise successfully if groups such as the All Ireland Children's Hospice Organisation are allowed to continue collecting money while delivering nothing to the public.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for raising this issue.  Indeed I understand that she has been attempting to raise it on the Adjournment for some considerable time and I am glad to respond to the concerns which she mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it is not open to me to comment in any detail on allegations of wrongdoing in relation to particular fund-raiding projects.  It is, though part of my responsibilities to ensure that the legislative framework within which fund-raising takes place is as effective as possible in avoiding abuses.  This is clearly an area which must be kept under constant review because when abuses take place &mdash; in other words where funds donated are misappropriated &mdash; not only are the notional beneficiaries deprived but that abuse gives rise to circumstances where the willingness of the public to donate to other charitable causes is called into question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of course, aware of the case which has led the Deputy to raise this issue.  Indeed, I have studied the initial report which my Department received from the Garda about the charity in question.  A further report is awaited. The House will appreciate that I am constrained in what I can say about the case while that further report is awaited. I assure the House, however, that, if the Garda investigation at issue concludes that there has been a breach in the law, then, as a matter of course, the DPP will <Col N="2048" /> be consulted as to whether a prosecution should be initiated.</P>
    <P>I can, however, inform the House about the approach which is being taken to the wider issue of charities legislation generally.  There is a commitment in the Government policy agreement to overhaul existing legislation in the light of what has become known as the Costelloe report.  I was very pleased on my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Justice to be given specific responsibility in this regard.  It is an area of social policy which I have examined in detail and it might be useful for me to outline in broad terms the type of issues which are being examined carefully in the context of the proposed legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Putting it simply, we want to achieve a situation where members of the public have confidence when they donate to charities while, at the same time, avoiding needless demands being placed on charitable organisations in terms of record keeping and so on.  It is in this context that we are examining relevant areas of the law including: registration, accounting requirements, licensing of the various forms of fund-raising, professional fund-raisers and supervision and investigation by the registration authority.</P>
    <P>In an effort to assist the process of bringing legislation in this area to fruition, some time ago I established an advisory group on charities.  This group is made up of representatives of various charitable organisations and they will report to me very shortly.  When that report is available to me, I hope to refer the matter to the Dáil Select Committee on Legislation and Security to allow Members of that committee to consider the issues involved.</P>
    <P>The House will be well aware that there are clearly complex issues involved, but I think it will be clear from what I said tonight that the Government is determined to tackle these issues and, equally, it wishes all Members of the House to contribute to their resolution.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 June 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Transfer pricing is a hidden internal practice within a multinational organisation and as such cannot be measured directly.  If it exists, it would increase the profits of the multinational in Ireland, and thereby Gross Domestic Product which records the income generated from production activity in the country.  However, as most of the profits of multinationals are remitted abroad, they are netted out in calculating Gross National Product which is a measure of the income actually accruing to Irish residents.  Thus, any impact of transfer pricing has been largely removed in the calculation of GNP.  For this reason, GNP is generally considered to be a better indicator of the economic well-being of this country. <Col N="1845" /> There are a number of factors which suggest that the practice of transfer pricing, to the extent that it exists, is declining in Ireland.  First, the move from total export sales relief to a 10 per cent rate of tax reduced the attraction of engaging in the practice.  Second, most of the capital exporting countries have in recent years become more vigorous in the policing and detection of transfer pricing.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office recently announced that in this year's national accounts, it will introduce a new treatment of profits/retained earnings of multinationals.  At present, only the profits remitted by foreign owned enterprises to their owners are netted out of GNP.  As a result, their retained earnings remain part of Irish GNP. Under the new treatment all profits will be attributed to their foreign owners when earned i.e. on an accruals basis. Consequently, all the profits of multinational companies operating in this country will be removed from the Irish GNP.  There will be counter-balancing adjustments, arising from the inclusion of overseas profits accruing to Irish residents, and preliminary estimates suggest that these changes will have little effect on the rate of GNP growth, as currently measured.</P>
      <P>In an information note published on 29 May 1996, the CSO also outlined a number of other changes in methodology resulting from the implementation of new EU national accounting standards.  It is estimated that the net effect of all changes, some of which are unrelated to the transactions of multinational enterprises, will be to increase GNP levels in aggregate.  At the same time, GDP levels in recent years will decrease and the gap between GNP and GDP will be substantially reduced.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office has prepared detailed proposals for the introduction of a quarterly multipurpose household survey, covering the labour force as well as a range of social topics.  A canvass of over 100 users of statistics during 1995 indicated widespread support for the introduction of such a survey.</P>
      <P>The cost of the proposed survey is a matter which requires careful consideration. What is being proposed is a continuous survey of households throughout the year; with data collection using laptop computers and the publication of quarterly employment and unemployment estimates within three months of the end of each quarter.</P>
      <P>Options to meet the cost of the new survey are being examined so as to minimise the additional cost to the Exchequer.  A number of other mandatory statistical requirements are emerging at EU level and an integrated approach to the collection, processing and publication of this data is being developed.  Given the complexity of the task, I would hope that the first of the proposed quarterly surveys will take place in the first half of 1997.</P>

      <P>The passenger movement figures cover all travel into and out of the State by air and sea as well as cross-Border rail and scheduled bus services.  In total, up to 7 million journeys have been recorded annually in each direction.  Migrants make up approximately 0.5 per cent of the total movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the gross passenger figures are considered reliable as regards monitoring total movements, the difference between them is not a reliable measure of net migration.  This is because a relatively small discrepancy in the passenger <Col N="1847" /> movement figures could have a substantial impact on the net migration figures which have been estimated, on average, at around 5,000 per annum, that is less than 0.1 per cent of the gross passenger flow in recent years.</P>
    <P>In the absence of administrative controls on the movement of persons into and out of the State, the Central Statistics Office makes full use of a range of information sources when estimating annual migration flows.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN and EU systems of national accounts define a number of indicators for measuring the performance of a country's economy but there is no generally recognised single measure of national living standards or economic well being.  The three most widely used indicators are: (1) gross domestic product which measures the income generated from productive activity in this country irrespective of whether producer units are Irish or foreign owned; (2) gross national product which measures the income from productive activity which actually accrues to Irish residents; GNP is calculated by deducting from GDP the income made <Col N="1851" /> in Ireland that is paid to foreign investors and adding income made by Irish residents on their overseas investments; (3)  gross national disposable income which is defined as GNP plus net current transfers from overseas including in particular EU current transfers.  All three measures can also be calculated on a net basis to exclude depreciation.</P>
    <P>GNP, rather than GDP, is a more appropriate measure of the economic well being of this country because it excludes the repatriated profits of foreign owned companies and other net factor income outflows including national debt interest.  However, national disposable income is a more comprehensive indicator of the income available to the nation because of the substantial amounts of transfers received from the EU.  Household disposable income, which is compiled after the deduction of direct taxes represents the income available to households for consumption or savings and is therefore an appropriate measure of trends in personal living standards.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for international comparisons to take account of the different price levels of goods and services in each country.  Currency exchange rates are influenced by several factors and are not considered a good indicator of relative price levels.  Because of this, for international comparisons, the national accounts aggregates are usually converted using the so called &ldquo;Purchasing Power Standards&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a table to Deputies giving the relevant Gross National Product <i>per capita</i> for Ireland and the EU.  The data are presented in &ldquo;Purchasing Power Standards&rdquo; the most usual measure for international comparisons.</P>

      <Quest>whether it is possible to reconcile the GNP and GDP per capita figures given on page 80 of the Forfás report entitled Shaping our Future with the figures given to Deputy Ahern in his reply to a parliamentary question of 14 February 1996 and figures published by the EU Commission; and the reason for this discrepancy.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12047/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures given in reply to the parliamentary question by Deputy Ahern on Tuesday, 14 February 1996 were based on official Eurostat data for Gross Domestic Product published in <i>Statistics in Focus &mdash; Economy and Finance 1996 &mdash; 1.</i></P>
      <P>The data in current prices were presented in &ldquo;Purchasing Power Standards&rdquo; which is the most usual measure for international comparison.  The data for Ireland were based on the latest official estimates compiled by CSO and remain unchanged.  Some updating may since have been made to EU15 data: nothing further has been published however, and any revisions should not materially affect the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by Forfás that data given on page 80 of the report <i>Shaping Our Future</i> are derived as follows: GNP and GDP per capita figures for 1995 in Table 1.6 are derived from official 1994 figures and projected forward using ESRI estimates of growth in 1995 and are expressed in constant 1990 prices to <Col N="1853" /> allow comparisons over time.  Figures in Table 1.6 for GNP and GDP <i>per capita</i> for the early 1980's are official CSO estimates for the year 1980 at constant 1990 prices.</P>
    <P>The figures in Table 1.7 are derived from EU estimates of GDP in current prices (published in European Economy) which were adjusted using ECU exchange rates and, in the case of Ireland, adjusted <i>pro-rata</i> to reflect the difference between Ireland's GDP and GNP.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, while the Forfás report has adopted CSO figures as a base, the authors have applied a variety of assumptions and transformations to those figures, in line with their view of current economic trends and, accordingly, they cannot be directly compared with the published official statistics.</P>

    <P>As has been indicated on several occasions in this House, the Minister for the Environment and I established, in February 1995, an interdepartmental working group made up of officials of our Departments and of the Office of Public Works to examine and report back with recommendations in improving the protection for listed buildings, including placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis, introducing incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings and undertaking a full national architectural audit, pursuant to commitments in the <Col N="1858" /> policy agreement for Government of December 1994 entitled A Government of Renewal.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the working group has now completed its work and that it expects to submit its report to the Minister for the Environment and myself within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>The working group has not been asked to prepare a report for publication but to report the recommendations of the officials for my consideration and that of the Minister for the Environment.  When we have considered the recommendations and consulted where necessary with other Government Ministers a programme for implementation, which may include amending legislation, will be prepared and published.</P>

    <P>While local authorities are exempt from these provisions, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) has issued a letter to all county councils and corporations drawing their attention to the potential damage caused to nesting birds by hedge cutting and requesting them to refrain from this activity in so far as is possible during the breeding season.  Where there is evidence that <Col N="1859" /> such activity is being undertaken by individuals in contravention of the 1976 Act, the matter should be reported in the first instance to the Garda Síochána and-or the NPWS where it will be investigated.</P>
    <P>I am also hopeful that the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, will play an important part in contributing to the protection of these types of habitats. Measures are provided in that scheme to maintain existing features that make up farmland habitat &ldquo;mosaics&rdquo;, such as hedgerows, field edges, areas of scrub and unmanaged vegetation, drainage ditches, etc., which are so valuable to farmland birds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be recalled that in the spring of 1995 there were media reports concerning the wreck of the <i>Lusitania,</i> to the effect that a number of valuable paintings had been taken on board the ship for transport to Ireland by Sir Hugh Lane, the then Director of the National Gallery.  It was speculated that these paintings &mdash; which were named &mdash; had survived intact on the seabed in lead cylinders. I immediately initiated an investigation into the matter.  Some circumstantial evidence exists to indicate that a painting, once attributed to Rubens but later assessed as a workshop production from the &ldquo;School of Van Dyck&rdquo; may have been on board the <i>Lusitania</i> but, if so, this would have been the property of another passenger, a Mr. Williamson. The main evidence available is a copy of the ship's manifest indicating that Sir Hugh Lane had a case of oil paintings on board.  No evidence could be found to substantiate the claim that the paintings were stored in lead cylinders.</P>
      <P>The investigations which I initiated show that there is no foundation in fact for the media reports concerning named paintings.  All were found to have been sold to persons other than Sir Hugh Lane.  Several are currently in public collections, including a painting by Titian entitled &ldquo;Man with a Hawk&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Underwater Heritage Order was placed by the Commissioners for Public Works in respect of the <i>Lusitania</i> on 25 January 1995 &ldquo;on account of its historical importance&rdquo;.  The order requires, without prejudice to the rights of the <Col N="1866" /> owner of the wreck, a licence to be obtained first to dive within the site of this wreck.  Should any item from the wreck be retrieved the find must be handed over to the receiver of wreck under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 7993.  In the event that any cargo items are recovered, the State would have the option of making a claim for them at that stage.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy has alluded to, the Irish High Court decided in May 1996 that a particular individual is the owner of the wreck of the <i>Lusitania.</i> The State did not contest this claim but has made a counter-claim asking that the individual in question not lay claim to any items of cargo that might be retrieved in the future.  While the position is technically <i>sub judice,</i> I would like to take the opportunity to express the hope that outstanding legal issues can be resolved by agreement and to the satisfaction of all those who have shown such a close interest in the subject of the <i>Lusitania.</i></P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  41 agus Uimh.  47 le chéile.  The first new proposal I should cite is the extension of a new section 35 package up to mid-1999. Deputies will be aware that, last autumn, having regard to the fact that <Col N="1867" /> section 35 was due to expire this year, I commissioned INDECON Economic Consultants to carry out an indepth review of section 35 and to make recommendations on the form which future State support for the film industry should take.  The INDECON Report concluded that section 35 should be continued, notwithstanding the fact that the consultants concluded that it was very costly to the Exchequer.  They recommended the introduction of a revised form of section 35 which would place a particular emphasis on support for the indigenous industry, reduce the cost to the Exchequer and increase the investor pool in the economy.  The new section 35 package addresses these three objectives, and the final package provided for in the Finance Act 1996, involved significant improvements from that announced in the 1996 budget.  These new elements involve: an attractive &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; for production in off-peak periods, with a view to providing greater continuity of employment and greater use of the facilities available in the State; and an increase in the limit on investments by companies from £1.05 million to £6 million per annum, with the proviso that £4 million of this £6 million must be invested in films with budgets not exceeding £4 million, subject to a maximum investment of £2 million per project.</P>

    <P>These new elements are designed specifically to maximise the direct and indirect potential of Irish employment in the industry, given that films with budgets under £4 million generally have a higher Irish employment content. Other recent or forthcoming measures serving to support film production in Ireland in the years ahead include: the establishment of the National Training Committee for Film and Television to implement the training measures recommended in the STATCOM report entitled &ldquo;Training Needs to 2000&rdquo;, with the support of £2.58 million under Ireland's Operational Programme for Industrial Development, up to 1999, with supplementary mainstream funding <Col N="1868" /> from FÁS of up to £250.000 per annum, subject to demand: the intention is that the training initiatives which the National Training Committee is about to embark upon will address the skill shortages in the industry over the period to 1999; the continued interventions in the years to come by STATCOM, the Committee of all relevant State agencies involved in the film industry here: STATCOM has been instrumental in, for example, developing the training initiative for the industry and ensuring an enhanced presence by Irish producers at film and trade festivals, notably at Cannes, Berlin and Venice; the establishment of the new Teilifís na Gaeilge service which has already had a significant impact in commissionings from the independent sector and will continue to do so in the years to come; the establishment of a Screen Commission to promote Ireland as a location for film at the earliest possible opportunity; Ireland's participation in the new EU Media II Programme to the year 2000, which has a budget of 310 million ECU and which will provide support for the European film industry under the key headings of training, development and distribution; during the negotiation of the Media II Programme.  I made strong interventions at meetings of the Council of Culture Ministers to ensure that the needs of small countries and regions of low audiovisual production capacity would be taken fully into account, and I am happy to inform the Deputies that the texts of the Council decisions reflect these priorities; my continued support, in principle, for proposals emanating from the European Commission for the establishment of a European Guarantee Fund to promote film and television co-productions; and given the importance for Irish producers to advance their projects by securing co-production partners, my intention to conclude a co-production treaty with Australia before the end of the year and to examine the potential for further such treaties with other countries.</P>
    <P>Bord Scannán na hÉireann/the Irish Film Board granted production loans to <Col N="1869" /> 15 film projects and seven documentaries in 1995.  All of these projects also availed of section 35.  In the same year I certified 50 projects under section 35, 33 of which were feature films, the remainder being television productions and animation.</P>
    <P>The central database on employment in the film industry is held by IBEC, which produces an annual report on the economic impact of film and television production, including direct and indirect employment.</P>
    <P>The Annual Reports of the Audiovisual Production Federation of IBEC for 1993 and 1994 on the <i>Impact of Film Production in Ireland</i> indicate the following figures for full-time job equivalents in each of those years:</P>

    <P>The 1995 figures for direct and indirect employment will be available later this year.  Finally, on a more general point, I can inform Deputies that, on 31 May last, Bord Scannán na hÉireann embarked on its tenth application round since its re-establishment in 1993.  From that round, the board received 17 applications for production support; 83 applications for development support; 36 applications for its &ldquo;Real Time&rdquo; initiative of one-hour dramas in conjunction with RTÉ; nine applications for animation development support; and 17 applications for documentary support. These figures are slightly ahead of the trend in the board's previous application rounds and I believe they indicate the continued potential for the development of a sustained level of film and television production in the State.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to provide a statutory basis for natural heritage areas in a Bill to amend the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The Bill is at present being drafted and I hope to introduce it in the Oireachtas in the autumn.  It is Government and EU policy to grant-aid only developments which are compatible with protecting the environment.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service &mdash; NPWS &mdash; of my Department advises grant-aiding bodies as to whether or not particular developments, such as forestry, are compatible with protecting the environment.</P>
      <P>Under the rural environment protecttion scheme, implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, farmers are paid to farm their land in an environmentally friendly way. They receive a top-up on the basic payment if they have land in a proposed natural heritage area provided it is managed according to NPWS prescriptions.</P>

      <P>The report entitled &ldquo;The Employment and Economic Significance of the Cultural Industries in Ireland&rdquo; commissioned by Temple Bar Properties and prepared by Coopers and Lybrand Corporate Finance, assisted by a consortium of State agencies including my own Department, and published in October 1994, was the first analysis on a national scale carried out to establish the economic significance &mdash; and especially the employment content &mdash; of the cultural industries in Ireland.  The research of this report was carried out over the 12 month period October 1993 to October 1994 and the <Col N="1872" /> findings showed that the cultural industries in Ireland give employment to some 33,800 people.  Like many other sectors, cultural industries provide a mixture of permanent and temporary employment on both a full-time and part-time basis and the figure of 33,800 which was identified by the Coopers and Lybrand and research in October 1994 represented 21,500 full-time equivalent posts or 1.9 per cent of the employed workforce at that time.</P>

      <P>Tuigim ón Údarás go mbíonn coinníollacha faoi úsáid na Gaeilge (i bhfógr aíocht, comharthaíocht, etc.) agus faoi fhostú daoine le Gaeilge i ngach comhaontú deontais a dhéantar le comhlachtaí a fhaigheann cúnamh uathu.

Ní foláir, mar sin, laistigh de choinníollacha comhaontuithe deontais, an cinneadh críochnúil maidir le post a thairiscint a fhágáil ag bainistíocht gach comhlachta ar leith.

      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to his parliamentary questions on 8 May last, the allocation of £2.3 million is intended to provide improved or in some cases <Col N="1875" /> new facilities for visitors at sites managed for nature conservation by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).  These facilities will range from the provision of information signs and interpretative panels to the improvement of, or in some cases the provision of new visitor facilities such as nature trails, car parking areas and toilets.</P>
      <P>Expenditure to date amounts to some £10,000 which related to the design and manufacture of a series of sample signs and interpretative panels.  Proposals for the remainder of this year involve the manufacture and supply of a series of general signs for all nature reserves and conservation sites managed by the NPWS and the supply of interpretative panels for sites in Counties Donegal and Sligo.  The combined estimated costs of these two contracts is £80,000.  The provision of interpretative panels for the other selected NPWS sites will be dealt with on a phased basis over the following three years and will cost in the region of £0.5 million.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the improvement and/or provision of other visitor facilities are being formulated at present. Initially, these proposals will concentrate on improving facilities available to visitors at existing centres.  A number of existing centres, such as those of Wexford Wildfowl Reserve, Coole-Garryland Nature Reserve, County Galway, and Glendalough Woods Nature Reserve, County Wicklow, have been identified as requiring further improvements to cater adequately for visitors' requirements.  The provision of facilities such as car parking areas and paths/trails can also be provided at some sites without impacting adversely on their nature conservation value.  I hope to finalise these proposals later this year.  Work will be carried out on a phased basis up to 1999.</P>

      <P>Tá na comhráithe a bhí ar siúl ag mo Roinnse le tamall anuas d'fhonn teacht ar an mbealach is fearr chun athbhreithniú cuimsitheach a dhéanamh ag teacht chun críche anois agus, cé go bhfuil socruithe áirithe le déanamh fós, tá súil agam go gcuirfear tús le taighde i ndáil leis an athbhreithniú go luath.</P>

      <P>The Government strongly condemns the killing of Mrs. Kudirat Abiola, wife of political detainee Chief M. K. O. Abiola, on Tuesday, 4 June 1996 in Lagos.  The circumstances surrounding her death must be investigated thoroughly and credibly and those responsible must be brought to justice.</P>
      <P>The Nigerian Government has publicly denied any involvement in the killing and has expressed its determination to bring the perpetrators to justice.  It has established an investigation team, under the supervision of the Deputy Inspector-General of the Federal Investigation and Intelligence Bureau, to trace and apprehend those responsible. Nigerian human rights and pro-democracy organisations have called for an independent panel of inquiry.  A previously unknown group which claims to support the release of Chief Abiola from prison has also claimed responsibility for the murder of his wife and threatened further violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The murder of Mrs. Abiola has taken place close to today's third anniversary of the 1993 elections which were annulled by the military government following her husband's successful presidential campaign.  Her husband has been in prison since he restated his claim to be democratically elected President of Nigeria on the first anniversary of those elections.  Both the death of Mrs. Abiola and her husband's continued detention highlight the urgent and ongoing need for the Nigerian <Col N="1880" /> regime to take specific steps towards an early transition to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law.  This cannot take place if the authorities cannot win the confidence of all sides.  A prompt and impartial investigation into the death of Mrs. Abiola would be an important measure of their commitment in this regard.  The Government will therefore, along with our EU partners, be paying close attention to the conduct and findings of the official investigation and on its implications for human rights and the unhindered participation of Chief Abiola and other political figures in the democratic process in Nigeria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Action to deal with criminals is primarily a matter for the gardaí.  The Revenue <Col N="1882" /> Commissioners do, however, have an important part to play within their overall remit of assessing and collecting taxes and implementing import and export controls.  I am satisfied, on the basis of my discussions with, and assurances from, the Commissioners that they are using their powers as best they can in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The primary role of the Revenue Commissioners in combating drugs trafficking is played by the Customs Service, which is responsible for deterring and preventing smuggling of illicit drugs.  The Revenue Commissioners have devoted very considerable resources to this area and, in particular, they set up the Customs National Drugs Team in 1992, with specific responsibility for detecting and preventing drug smuggling.  Since 1993 over 50 people detected by Customs smuggling drugs at ports and airports have been detained and transferred to Garda custody.  So far, there have been convictions in 23 cases, with jail sentences ranging from three months to ten years, being imposed.  Some cases have yet to be heard, while sentencing is due in further cases.  There have also been prosecutions under Customs legislation for other illegal activities.</P>
      <P>As regards taxation, section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983, allows the Revenue to bring unexplained profits, whether derived from illegal activities or otherwise, into charge to income tax as &ldquo;miscellaneous income&rdquo;.  The challenging of an unexplained build-up of capital has traditionally been the route used by Revenue's Investigation Branch in tackling many of the serious tax evasion cases.  Section 19 has been brought into play on occasions where no satisfactory explanation was offered by a taxpayer as to the source of the capital.  A number of those cases concern persons suspected of being involved in criminal activities such as drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To successfully apply this section, however, evidence of ownership of assets or of lifestyle has to be available. Where criminals are concerned such <Col N="1883" /> evidence is frequently very difficult to obtain, as these people tend to distance themselves from their assets, and properties or bank accounts with which they may be associated will not necessarily appear in their names.  While Revenue will use their powers to investigate alleged ownership of assets they would frequently be dependent on the Garda to provide information or evidence of asset ownership which will have been derived from Garda investigations into the underlying criminal activity including drug trafficking.  The Garda is the nominated authority for disclosure by financial institutions of suspicions of money laundering under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and will also have the right to serve Orders under section 63 of that Act on financial institutions for further information as regards bank deposits of this kind.  Revenue have assured me that they are committed to following up all cases where they receive information from the Garda and will deploy the necessary resources for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The fact that Revenue have the facility to tax certain profits under section 19 does not make it any easier to prosecute and obtain a conviction in cases of offenders detected as having unexplained asset accumulation.  The burden of proof on the authorities will be the same as for any other criminal prosecution.  Where evidence is available that would support a criminal prosecution for tax evasion, Revenue have indicated that they will do everything possible to advance such a prosecution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have been made aware by Wicklow County Council and by local elected representatives of the periodical flooding which occurred in recent years at the Parkmore estate, Baltinglass, County Wicklow, arising from the River Slaney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the many areas around the country which suffer such periodical flooding and which have been specifically notified to the consultants recently commissioned to advise the commissioners on the criteria to be used and the relative weightings to be given to each of these in determining the areas that will be included on the priority list which will form the national flood relief programme.  A preliminary report which will firm up on the criteria, etc. to be used is due from these consultants at the end of September 1996.  Pending completion of the consultants' commission it will not be possible to give any indication if the flooding problems at Baltinglass, County Wicklow, might be <Col N="1885" /> included for early consideration in the priority list.</P>
    <P>The current flood relief programme on which the resources of the Office of Public Works are being concentrated comprises consideration of schemes for Carlow, Cappamore-Newport, Duleek, Dunmanway, Gort, Kilkenny, Sixmilebridge and Williamstown, all of which suffer extensive periodical flooding and which are likely to absorb available resources for some time yet.</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing there are no immediate proposals to undertake any flood relief works in Baltinglass, County Wicklow, nor could there be without full investigation of all aspects of the problems there, which will be dependent on its place on the priority list to be drawn up.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have the question of staff resources dedicated to drug detection work under constant review. There are, at present, six assigned to the Customs National Drugs Team (CNDT) located in Rosslare.  These staff consist of Operational, Intelligence and Sniffer-Dog Units.  These specialist CNDT officers in Rosslare are supplemented by the general cadre of Revenue staff who are responsible for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are fully alert to the dangers of drug smuggling along the coastline, including the smuggling through ports in the southeast of the country.  Experience has shown that intelligence gathering and <Col N="1886" /> surveillance, rather than a static presence, are the best measures of combining drug smuggling.  All CNDT units are mobile and employ the most modern means of communication and have access to aerial and sea surveillance.</P>
    <P>The Customs Service has also enlisted the assistance of the public in the fight against drug smuggling through the drug watch programme, which was launched in 1993.  Under this programme, the assistance of coastal communities, maritime personnel, as well as people living near airfields has been enlisted to report unusual occurrences to Customs.  Over 15,000 calls have been received from the public in response to that programme.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the present measures taken by Customs in co-operation with the other enforcement agencies concerned provide adequate protection against the illegal importation of drugs along the south-east coast.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have informed me that they will keep the question of the deployment of Customs Officers in the Wexford-Rosslare region under constant review, having regard to Government policy on staffing numbers and budgetary controls.</P>

There are, in addition, considerable public health benefits, with a reduction in the risk of <Col N="1892" /> spreading HIV and hepatitis C.  The level of drug-related crime also reduces.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Western Health Board is responsible for the management of services and deployment of staff at the hospital referred to by the Deputy.  Any proposed increase in staffing levels must be considered in the context of the level of resources available and the Western Health Board's priorities for the development of services. Funds were allocated in 1995 for the recruitment of four non-nursing staff at the hospital concerned.  In addition, the board approved two nursing posts, to be filled by internal redeployment.  In 1996, the Western Health Board has received funding for a number of new posts in long-stay homes for the elderly and expects to make a decision shortly as to where these posts will be located.</P>

      <P>The level of funding that will be available to An Chomhairle for the years 1997-1999 will be decided in the context of the budgetary situation pertaining in each of those years.

      <P>I am committed to the development of our inland <Col N="1900" /> waterways to the maximum extent possible. To that end I have allocated a total of £22.65 million from EU Structural Funds in 1994-99 to meet the cost of capital works for the improvement and restoration of inland waterways.</P>
      <P>The possibility of restoring the Ulster Canal has been the subject of talks for some time now between the Waterways Service of my Department and their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the Watercourse Management Division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  In 1994, a scoping study of the canal was undertaken and this identified the main engineering and other difficulties which will have to be overcome should it be decided to proceed with restoration.  This was prepared for internal use and not for publication.</P>
      <P>Consideration is now being given to undertaking a joint full scale feasibility study with the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture which would endeavour to identify solutions to the difficulties and would include also a cost benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment of the project.  A brief for this study is being finalised and I expect tenders will be sought shortly from consultancies interested in undertaking it.</P>

      <P>The design and construction of all new buildings, and material alterations to or changes of use of existing buildings, including houses, must comply with the building regulations.  The regulations include detailed requirements relating, <i>inter alia,</i> to fire safety, and advice as to how these may be met is contained in a separate technical guidance document published by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of the technical guidance documents which accompany the regulations are at an advanced stage of review within my Department; revised documents will improve the minimum standards of many aspects of new buildings, including the level of fire detection and window design in new housing. <Col N="1906" /> The National Safety Council undertakes a range of measures, including annual publicity campaigns, lectures, posters, leaflets, installation of smoke alarms on a pilot basis for certain classes of persons, etc. which are aimed at promoting greater awareness of the dangers of fire across the community.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Question refers to the annual joint meeting of the Oslo and Paris Commissions which will be held in Oslo from 17 to 21 June 1996. The Commissions, made up of representatives of each of the contracting parties, including Ireland, are responsible for supervising the implementation of the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972 and the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources, 1974.  The convention have as their objective the protection of the marine environment of the North East Atlantic and the agenda for next week's meeting reflects this regional concern.</P>
      <P>Ireland's participation in these conventions, together with 12 other countries and the European Union, provides a valuable means to co-ordinate strategies to prevent pollution and protect the North East Atlantic.  The provision of £13,000 included in the Department's Vote for 1996 is intended to meet this country's share of the annual operational budget of the Paris Commission, including administrative costs of the convention secretariat which is based on London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards French nuclear testing in the Pacific, the Government has consistently raised this matter on a bilateral and multilateral basis, including at EU and UN levels.  We welcome the ending <Col N="1911" /> of the recent series of tests and look forward to France's participation in a comprehensive test ban treaty.  The Government has also expressed its concern about current nuclear testing by the Chinese authorities and urged adherence by all countries to the test ban treaty which is currently being finalised in Geneva.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127, 128, 131, 132 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to primary schools.  Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector. A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>The substantial improvements I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.  However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.  During the period 1994-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases. In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  My Department does not have the information required by Deputy Keaveney readily <Col N="1914" /> available.  However, I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>I have received a submission from the school in question in support of its application for assistance under the breaking the cycle scheme. On the basis of the information currently available to my Department, this school in question would be eligible for consideration for support under the scheme.  As such, I would expect that the school will have recently been invited by the Education Research Centre to submit an application for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre will prioritise all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted and will advise my Department of the outcome.  Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five year development plans. Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and to put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage over the period of the plan.  Qualification for support under the initiative will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this is an application for first registration lodged in the Land Registry on 22 March 1996.  I understand that, due to their complicated nature, these dealings can take some time to process.</P>
      <P>The Registrar has informed me that the position in relation to this dealing is that queries were issued by the Land Registry to the applicant's solicitor on 30 May 1996 to which a reply is awaited.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that, on receipt of a reply to the queries issued, the matter will be expedited by the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>The old Kennedy Bakery in Parnell Street has been leased by the Department of Justice and is presently being renovated for use by my Department's Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
      <P>The Bridge Project, which is operated by the Probation and Welfare Service will be housed there.  The project provides a programme which addresses the lifestyle of offenders on supervision to the service, aimed at diverting them from crime and finding them employment or other meaningful occupations. A substantial number of referrals to the project are offenders from the north inner city.  The centre will be non-residential and will operate only during office hours.</P>
      <P>The Bridge Project has a management committee comprised of representatives of criminal justice agencies in the community, business people who are members of the Irish Youth Federation, City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, FÁS, ICTU and research interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme has operated since 1991 in the Resource Centre of the Probation and Welfare Service, Marlboro Place, also in the north inner city.  This building is currently being purchased by Dublin Corporation, making it necessary to relocate the activities elsewhere. What is involved, therefore, is not the <Col N="1924" /> addition of a Probation and Welfare Service facility to the north inner city area, but the relocation of an existing facility within the area.</P>

The Garda authorities report that the results have been positive and encouraging in both low-key and high profile operations carried out to date.</P>
      <P>Attempting to assess the direct cost of each such operation would be a very time-consuming exercise because of the fact that there are regular changes in personnel involved and so on.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to ask the Garda authorities to divert resources to any specific costing exercise.</P>

      <P>Article 51 of the EEC Treaty provides for the adoption of such measures in the field of social security as are necessary to provide freedom of movement for workers.  The Treaty also provides for the right of EU nationals to become established and to provide services in any member state of the EU (and the European Economic Area arising out of the European Economic Area Agreement).  In addition the Treaty of the European Union has as one of its objectives the abolition of obstacles between member states to the free movement of persons and services.</P>
      <P>Arising out of Article 51 of the Treaty, Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 was adopted.  It provides for co-ordination of social security schemes for employed and self-employed persons and members of their families moving within the European economic area. Under this Regulation an employed or self-employed person is generally subject to the social insurance system of the member state in which he is employed both for the payment of contributions and the payment of benefits.</P>
      <P>Special rules apply to workers who are posted by their employer in one member state to work for a period of less than one year for him in another member state.  Similar provisions also apply to persons who are normally self-employed who perform work, again for a period of less than one year, in the territory of another member state.  Any extension of such periods of work in another member state beyond 12 months is subject to the agreement of the member state in which the person works.  These special provisions do not apply to workers who emigrate to another EEA state to seek work on their own account.  Such workers are subject to the social security legislation of the member state in which they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the Treaty provisions and objectives guaranteeing free movement, <Col N="1926" /> these provisions of the EU social security regulations are designed to ensure that the social security rights of the workers concerned are protected during such temporary periods of work in another member state workers and that workers are subject only to the legislation of one member state at a given time.  It would not be in the worker's interest if he or she had to switch between national social security systems for such short periods.  It would impose a heavy bureaucratic burden on enterprises and the national administrations concerned.</P>
    <P>Ongoing co-operation between member states takes place at both the European level and on a bilateral basis.  At European level, the Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers, which consists of representatives from each member state and is serviced and advised by the European Commission, deals with all administrative questions and questions of interpretation arising from the provisions of the EU social security regulations and works to develop co-operation between member states in relation to the application of the provisions of the regulations.  My Department has met with representatives of competent institutions from both Germany and Holland in the recent past to discuss co-operation in relation to posted workers and other issues.  There are regular contacts with the UK Department of Social Security.</P>

      <P>An Post is the principal agency through which payments are delivered to social welfare customers. At present, An Post delivers approximately 755,000 weekly and 520,000 monthly payments to social welfare customers. The total value of payments made by An Post each week amounts to some £52.4 million.  It is estimated that An Post will deliver about 46 million payments to social welfare customers during 1996.  Details of the scheme types and volumes involved are given in the table attached.</P>
      <P>In addition to payment services, An Post also provides special savings bank deposit accounts into which social welfare customers may opt to have certain pension and child benefit payments transferred electronically.  At present, 1,370 pensioners and 6,159 child benefit customers avail of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post also provides a household budgeting facility for unemployed customers who may opt to have deductions <Col N="1929" /> made from their weekly payments and remitted on their behalf to a range of utilities.  These include 46 local authorities and the St.  Pancras Housing Association in respect of housing rents, Telecom Éireann in respect of telephone charges and the Electricity Supply Board and Bord Gáis in respect of energy charges.  At present over 9,500 unemployed customers avail of the household budgeting service.  It is <Col N="1930" /> planned to extend this facility to the lone parent customer group later this year.</P>
    <P>An Post provides a collection service to certain categories of self-employed people who pay their self-employment contributions through the post offices.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to refund moneys paid after 1988 by way of PRSI contributions by self-employed persons, who, in view of insufficient contributions did not qualify for a contributory pension on reaching retirement age.</Quest>

      <P>In order to qualify for an old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961, and its objective is to link entitlement to pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund.  It applies to all <Col N="1931" /> insured persons, including the self-employed.</P>
      <P>All persons who enter social insurance after age 56 are entitled to a refund of the old age pension part of their contributions provided that they are not entitled to or in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension or a pension based partly on these contributions. Accordingly, self-employed people in this category, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988, are normally entitled to a partial refund of contributions.</P>
      <P>Where a person has less than ten years self-employment contributions paid, but has earlier insurance as an employed or voluntary contributor for any period before reaching age 56, both forms of contribution may be combined for purposes of assessing entitlement to pension.  As these people first entered the social insurance system prior to age 56, they are not entitled to a refund of contributions in the event of failing to qualify for pension.</P>
      <P>Also, social insurance contribution paid in an EU member state can be combined with contributions paid here to qualify for an old age contributory pension.  Social insurance contributions paid in a country outside the EU, but with which Ireland has a bilateral social-security agreement can be combined with contributions paid here to qualify for a special pension under the agreement. This latter situation arises only when the applicant does not have an underlying entitlement to a pension under existing social security legislation in either State.</P>
      <P>The existing legislation governing refunds of contributions has been reviewed recently with particular reference to the position of self-employed persons who were over age 56 in 1988, and whose only previous contributions were prior to 1953 when the unified system of social insurance was first introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, it has been decided that such persons may be entitled to a refund <Col N="1932" /> of the old age pension portion of their self-employment contribution provided they do not qualify for an old age non-contributory pension or a pension based partly on these contributions.  On this basis, approximately 400 people will be entitled to refunds which will be made by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The average time taken to process appeals which were finalised during the first five months of 1996 was just over 17 weeks.  Appeals involving oral hearings would tend to be above this figure whereas those where the appeal can be determined on the basis of the documentary evidence would be below the average figure.  This average period includes all phases of appeals and is inflated by additional time involved in the determination of a number of appeals where, for example, adjournments have been sought or <Col N="1933" /> where questions affecting the estates of deceased claimants are at issue.  When the slowest 10 per cent of cases is discounted the average falls to 14 weeks. A survey of appeals completed in 1995 found that approximately one third were disposed of within two months of being registered in the appeals office.</P>
      <P>The provision of a prompt service is an ever-present objective of the social welfare appeals office.  It is important, however, to ensure that this objective is achieved in a manner which is consistent with the demands of fair and proper treatment and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all of its merits.</P>

      <P>Work permit policy is based on the need to ensure that job opportunities which arise in the State are, as far as possible, reserved for Irish or European economic area nationals.  Work permits are not granted unless the employer can show that, despite all reasonable efforts having been made, there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available for the position in question.  Applications for work permits in respect of sheep shearers would be unlikely to be granted as the Department would be of the opinion that these posts could be filled from within the Irish or EEA workforce.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for his second year payment under the REP scheme.  However, under revised monitoring and control procedures implemented by my Department recently, compliance checks are required to ensure that farmers have completed the specific works outlined during the first year of the plan before second year payments can be made.</P>
      <P>A compliance check will be carried out on the applicant's farm shortly and assuming all is in order payment will issue as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>I have had this matter investigated, and there are a number of reasons why the townland of Ballyfliugh was not proposed for designation as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P> 1.  The townland exceeded the stocking density limit of 0.99 livestock units per forage hectare.</P>
      <P>2.  All of the townlands in the district electoral division of Mallardstown, in which this townland is located, together exceeded not only the stocking density limit but also the income limit of 80 per cent of national average income and the tillage limit of 7.8 per cent of agricultural land.</P>
      <P>3.  No part of the district electoral division was contiguous to any existing or proposed disadvantaged areas boundary. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all of these reasons, it was not possible for the Disadvantaged Areas <Col N="1940" /> Appeals Panel to recommend the inclusion of Ballyfliugh in the proposal for extension of the disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>Based on the current knowledge of the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton gas fields it appears unlikely that their economic termination will occur before the year 2003 at the earliest. It is difficult to indicate precisely what the life span of these fields will be as it depends not only on the amount of gas remaining in the reservoirs and how much of that it is technically possible to extract but also on the economics of producing and selling gas. <Col N="1941" /> Estimation of gas reserves is a complex technical exercise based on interpretation of available geological and engineering data.  On the basis of new data that becomes available as production continues from the fields the estimates of reserves may need to be revised.</P>
