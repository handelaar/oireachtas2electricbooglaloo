      <P>There are nine matters to put to the House.  I respectfully suggest that we deal first with Expressions of Sympathy on the tragic and untimely passing of our dear friend and colleague, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Liam Naughten.  Can I take it that this is agreed?  Agreed.  We proceed sadly with the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The funeral of Senator Liam Naughten was one of the saddest it has ever been my misfortune to attend.  The loss of a young father of a young family in these circumstances is truly appalling.  The gravity of this blow only really comes home to one when the person killed is known and liked as much as I and other Members of the House knew and liked Liam Naughten.  The impact of this appalling tragedy has been felt throughout the country in recent days.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons people feel this loss so deeply.  One reason is that in his political life Liam Naughten respected the dignity of all those with whom he came into contact.  Despite the very competitive political environment in which he had to work, he was able, through his courtesy, to make no enemies.  He was in the truest sense of the term a man of extreme courtesy and kindness to others; he respected people.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that he performed his duties as Cathaoirleach with great dignity.  I remember the speech he gave here on the occasion of the address by President Clinton to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I know that you, a Cheann Comhairle, will feel his loss in particular as he was your close colleague and performed a similar function in the other House to the one you perform here.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that he attained high constitutional office because the people who knew him best, his immediate colleagues in the Seanad, had confidence in him.  It is great to have the confidence of large numbers of people who do not know you well but it is difficult to attain the degree of confidence Liam had from the people who knew him really well.  His colleagues on both sides of the Seanad had confidence in him, relied on him and knew him to be a man of great character.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Government and Fine Gael, Liam's party, I extend sympathy to his widow Mary and to his children Denis, John, Liam Óg, Joseph, Seamus, Dermot, Marian and Áine.</P>

Is mór an chailliúint dúinn go léir talann an fhir uasail sin san Oireachtas, agus is brón linn a imeacht obann. I extend the sympathy of the Fianna Fáil Party to Liam's wife and family.  The past few days have been sad and the weather in Drum yesterday reflected the gloom felt by politicians, the general public and local people whom Liam served so well.  I also extend sympathy to the family of Toni Laznibat who was killed in the same collision.  I convey our best wishes to Tom Duignan, Liam's driver, and Liam and Mary's son, Dermot.  I hope they make a quick and full recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> It is a sad coincidence that we have lost two Cathaoirligh of the Seanad within the past 16 months.  Both of them came from Athlone and had much to offer to the Oireachtas.  They were highly thought of by colleagues and were not controversial political figures; they were gentle people.  When Liam was unanimously elected Cathaoirleach in July last year there was universal agreement in the Houses that it was an excellent appointment which would bring honour and distinction to the Seanad.  This proved to be the case.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and others who paid tribute to Liam attributed to him characteristics with which we all agree &mdash; courteous, good humoured, patient, hard working and gentle.  He brought all these attributes to bear in his management of the business of the Seanad and the other activities in which he was involved, for example, the Council of State, the Presidential Commission and local organisations.  From the time he was elected to the Seanad he represented the heart of Ireland. He was a farmer and an experienced county councillor of 22 years' standing.  He was involved in the local vocational education committee and served as chairman of the Western Health Board. He had an in-depth knowledge of the major challenges facing rural communities.  He contributed much to rural life and always emphasised its importance.</P>
    <P>No one can say that Liam had it easy.  He managed to battle through many situations in his life and his determination to serve the public cause was never dimmed by the many hard fought elections in which he took part.  He served his constituents well as a Deputy from 1982 to 1989 and he began a notable parliamentary ascent when he was appointed Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  The people of Roscommon, whom he served well on Roscommon County Council, were rightly proud of Liam's rise to stardom, while the people of Athlone were pleased when he took over this key position in public life which had previously been held by another one of their distinguished sons.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I offer my deepest condolences to Liam's wife Mary, six sons, two daughters, extended family and friends. We were shocked by the tragic events of last Saturday evening.  His loss is a calamity; its impact on his family is immense and has caused deep regret and sadness among his colleagues.  Liam brought much honour to his life of public service. Today we say farewell and thank him for bringing honour to this distinguished House.  Slán a Liam, agus ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh do anam uasal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is another sad day in the history of this House.  In a dreadful accident on Saturday last we lost our friend Liam Naughten, who was the distinguished holder of the office of Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and who served as a Member of this House for seven years.  He was a <Col N="1250" /> warm, loyal and friendly colleague and we will miss his companionship.  Liam was a hardworking and honourable public representative, he was deservedly popular among his colleagues in Fine Gael and with his political opponents.  Whatever political differences marked us apart, Liam Naughten never let them stand in the way of friendship.  He never bore grudges and he earned the respect of all colleagues during his time in this House.  Those who shared service with him during his years in the Dáil and Seanad equally mourn his passing.</P>
      <P>Yet again we mourn the sudden and untimely death of a colleague.  Liam's death is a most severe blow to his wife Mary, his six sons and two daughters.  They will grieve for him in a manner known only to those who lose a husband or father in such shocking circumstances.  We must remember that Liam Naughten died as he spent most of his life, in the service of the people of County Roscommon.  As a councillor and as a Member of this House and Seanad Éireann, Liam Naughten's career was marked by selfless dedication to the political system and to the people who consulted him in his capacity as a public representative for help and advice.  They would never have found him wanting and he was still working for the people he had represented for more than 22 years in public life when he met his death on the roads of his native county.</P>
      <P>Liam's efforts on behalf of the people of County Roscommon were not always rewarded by the kind of success we all seek.  His political career had its peaks and valleys but even in the dark days of apparent failure his belief in our political system was never diminished.  It is to his credit that he was an active and hardworking politician and he was fulfilling his role as a public representative on Saturday evening.</P>
      <P>Ours is a demanding profession and the wear and tear on individuals and their families can be enormous.  Liam Naughten never shirked his duties or responsibilities and he, his wife and family have paid a high price.  He will be missed by his party colleagues in the Seanad and the Dáil, who valued his sound advice and unassuming nature.  I am aware that he enjoyed his period as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and his fairness and even-handedness in that office was evident on a daily basis.  He managed the business of the House in an efficient and effective manner and his loss will be felt by colleagues from all political parties.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer my sincere sympathy to his wife Mary and to his sons and daughters.  Go ndeanfadh Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>

      <P>The death of any young man in these circumstances is always a sad occasion. However, the circumstances surrounding Liam Naughten's death are particularly sad.  The father of eight young children and a loyal colleague and friend of many in both Houses, above all else Liam Naughten will be remembered as a very warm and likeable person.  The Taoiseach stated <Col N="1251" /> yesterday that he will be remembered as a loyal friend and someone who displayed courtesy on all occasions.  That is how I will remember him.</P>
      <P>Last year, I had the honour to participate in a parliamentary delegation to Australia which was led by Liam Naughten.  Despite the fact that he spent 24 hours travelling to Australia, he insisted on waiting for over an hour at Sydney Airport until I arrived on a later flight.  I was astonished and embarrassed but he informed me that it was the least he could have done.  I found it quite extraordinary, and it sums up the kind of person he was, that after 24 hours of tiring travel he would wait over an hour for a colleague to arrive. Everyone involved with that visit to Australia was proud that he led our delegation.  He took his duty seriously and he was dignified and showed respect.  Whether we were meeting business people, politicians or the Irish community in Australia, Liam Naughten came across as a serious politician and someone who showed great warmth and friendship and a great insight to the issues he discussed.  It is fair to state that wherever we travelled in Australia we encountered someone from County Roscommon. Liam met many friends, their children and his relations.  No matter where we visited, someone contacted our delegation to inquire whether they could meet him.  He was a lovely person in every sense.</P>
      <P>The tragedy faced by Liam's wife Mary is almost unbearable because she has eight young children, the oldest of whom is only 22 years of age.  She will never forget her husband who died in such unusual and unhappy circumstances. Ireland has lost an outstanding politician; County Roscommon has lost a great public representative; Leinster House has lost a very special colleague and many people have lost a close friend.  Above all, Fine Gael has lost a very dedicated and loyal member who was proud of his association with that party.  I never heard him say a bad word about anyone, which could not be said about most of us.  To his party, his friends but particularly his family, I extend deepest sympathy on my own behalf and on that of the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>I wish to associate my party with the sentiments expressed on all sides of the House regarding the untimely death of Liam Naughten.  A terrible tragedy has befallen his family.  We can only hope that the high regard in which he was held in this House and the manifest affection in which he was held among his own people will contribute to somehow easing the loss experienced by his family.  On behalf of my colleagues and myself, I extend my condolences to his wife and family.</P>

      <P>As a colleague of the late Senator Naughten, I join the expressions of sympathy to Liam's family on the occasion of his sad and <Col N="1252" /> untimely death.  Liam and I served in the Oireachtas since 1981.  He died at 52 years of age and he was involved in public life for 22 of those years, almost eight of which he spent in this House.  He contributed on many issues and always did so with dignity, without rancour and always with the common good in mind.  Liam's death is a terrible shock to me, the constituency, our party organisation and, above all, his wife and children.  I join the expression of sympathy to his wife Mary and his eight children.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent group, I express our sincere sympathy to the wife and family of the late Liam Naughten on his untimely passing.  I knew Liam before we entered politics and we used to meet at race meetings and football matches. Generally speaking, such meetings concluded in some hostelry or other.  Liam had a great capacity for enjoyment and he was a very happy and sincere individual.  His local club, Clann na Gael, will be playing in the Connacht club championship against the champions of County Mayo on Saturday evening next.  As much as I would like to see them win, I believe Liam will be obliged to use the influence of his new position if they are to emerge victorious.  My sincere hope for his wife and family is that they attain what Liam would have wished for them. May he rest in peace.</P>

I pay a special tribute to a lovely person but, more particularly, an exemplary father and public representative.

      <P>In regard to No. (v) of No. 12, for the past two days we endeavoured to ensure that the questions we tabled to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice on this issue would be allowed remain intact but, unfortunately, at every twist and turn yesterday, we were stymied by the Government in this regard.  We propose the following amendment to No. 12:</P>
      <P>That the words, &ldquo;When the last speaker's statement has concluded, the Minister for Justice shall take questions; such questions to be brought to a conclusion within one hour&rdquo;, be deleted and substituted by the following: &ldquo;When the last speaker's statement has concluded, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice shall answer Members' questions for a period of at least two hours on matters relating to the delisting of Judge Dominic Lynch and the findings of the inquiry and, given that those who conducted the inquiry felt that the timeframe was extremely limited, the matters above shall be referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security for the purpose of questioning all Members, officeholders and persons required by the committee, as they deem appropriate, and that the committee shall meet at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 November and shall report to the Dáil as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>At last week's Whips meeting it was agreed by all the Whips present that the report of the inquiry should not be scheduled if it affected the admissibility of the questions relating to the matter that were tabled.  There are more than 60 questions tabled to the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach which are two weeks overdue for reply.  Will the Taoiseach agree, as a matter of courtesy, as he has done in the past, that those questions should be allowed today? Does he agree that the primary vehicle of accountability is the parliamentary question and that any procedure in the House which obstructs the right of Deputies to information sought by way of parliamentary question should be waived in this instance?  The replies sought to parliamentary questions are crucial to the deliberations.  Those questions were not responded to in the inconclusive report published last night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the rules of procedure, admissibility of questions is decided by the Ceann Comhairle, not by the Government. It is a long standing rule of procedure that questions which anticipate debate &mdash; this debate <Col N="1254" /> is scheduled for this afternoon and tomorrow &mdash; are not allowed on the day of the debate.  That has been the case since the House was founded. If those questions are not fully answered in the debate they can be tabled next week when they will be taken in the normal way if they are otherwise in order because they would then not be anticipatory of a debate and, therefore, would not fall on that ground.</P>

      <P>The scheduling of Dáil business, and in particular the scheduling of this report and the debate thereon, is a matter for the Government.  The matter was raised specifically at the Whips meeting where it was agreed by all the Whips that it would not be scheduled if it had the effect of obliterating Dáil questions to which replies are expected today.  Did the Government Whip explain that to the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>In regard to the disallowing of questions today, the application of Standing Order 34(6), is clearcut.  Once my office received official written notice of a proposal to take statements, with a question and answer session, on the inquiry, the anticipation rule had to be applied.  The Chair has no discretion in that matter.  It is in strict accordance with long standing practice and precedence.</P>

The Taoiseach stated in the Chamber last week that the Government would answer questions on all these issues for as long as was necessary.  With that in mind I asked the Government to set aside Standing Order 34 to allow those questions to remain intact, but I was refused.  The Order of Business allows questions for only one hour to the Minister for Justice who, in effect, is not responsible for the Attorney General, who has a part to play in this matter.  Not only are questions to the Minister for Justice being ruled out of order because of the anticipatory rule, but the questions relating to the Attorney General, who has played a central role in the matter, have also been ruled out of order.  That defies logic.</P>

      <P>Not only did we seek an assurance at last week's Whips meeting that this report would not be scheduled so that questions could not be ruled out of order, but I raised the matter last Thursday with the Minister for Finance, who took the Order of Business.  The issues at stake are serious, particularly those which relate to the roles of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The second letter from the Attorney General was not published in the report.  The report goes as far as the letter &ldquo;N&rdquo;, the next letter is &ldquo;O&rdquo; which would relate to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen. It is clear from the report that the matter has been dealt with in an unsatisfactory manner and we need answers to the questions about the DPP and the Attorney General, which I have tabled to <Col N="1255" /> the Taoiseach, before we can begin the debate. Unless those questions are answered by the person accountable to this House for those officeholders, who is the Taoiseach, my party is not prepared to participate in a charade today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting to see if the Taoiseach would respond to the Fianna Fáil amendment, which refers to a number of issues.  I accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling that if there is a debate questions should be ruled out.  That is not the issue and I have no dispute with the Chair.  The issue is that the Taoiseach stated last week that there would be full and complete answers to questions.  If those questions were ruled out then it automatically follows that the Ceann Comhairle was ruling out the questions because there was a debate and that the Taoiseach has to answer them.  The matter is not whether the Attorney General wrote letters, was proactive or was not active.  The Attorney General is the guardian of the Constitution and defender of the public interest and has a key role to play in this issue.  The person who answers for the Attorney General in this House is the Taoiseach.  We cannot have a meaningful debate about this report which was hurriedly put together by two eminent people, and for which the House I am sure is grateful, without getting the answers on the issues from the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>We do not have the letter of 1 November and I raised that matter last week with the Minister for Finance.  Will the Taoiseach tell us why he misled the House last Wednesday &mdash; I am sure inadvertently &mdash; when he told the House that never has a Government published the advice of the Attorney General?  Apart from the advice published in 1994 and 1995 by the sub-committees of that period, the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, on 13 December 1988 read into the Dáil record a statement by an Attorney General on the reasons for a decision in the Patrick Ryan case.  A Fine Gael Attorney General, Mr. Peter Sutherland, publicly defended and commented on his advice to Government in the public debate on the pro life amendment in the 1980s.  Will the Taoiseach clarify his misleading of the House and tell me where stands the Attorney General's letter of 1 November and respond to the two issues in the Fianna Fáil amendment?  Will he answer questions at the end of a debate on what is an inconclusive report? The gentlemen involved made it clear that they did not have the time to carry out the investigation properly.  In page 16 they state:</P>
      <P>We are satisfied that, because of the short duration of the Inquiry and the speed with which it necessarily has had to be prepared, this is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask that a committee of the House be set up, perhaps under the Committee of Procedures and Privileges as on 2 July 1982 when Deputy Bruton and his colleagues sought an inquiry which would <Col N="1256" /> examine matters relating to telephone issues in the House concerning the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.  Alternatively we could follow what happened in autumn of 1994.  Before we can move any further, we need answers to these questions.  I am not going to participate in a charade by debating matters that are of no benefit to the House.</P>

      <P>The Chair has allowed some discussion, especially since an amendment has been tabled to a matter on the Order of Business.  That discussion must of necessity be brief.  Before I put the amendment in the name of Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Taoiseach wishes to reply.</P>

      <P>The Government, as all Governments, is collectively responsible and the Minister for Justice will be answering on behalf of the Government in regard to any matter arising in this debate that affects any component of the Government.  Regarding the Attorney General's role as guardian of constitutional rights independent of his role as adviser to the Government, this is a function which the Attorney General exercises independently and he is not answerable to the House through me or anyone else for the exercise of that aspect of his function.  In regard to any questions requiring an answer at the end of the debate, I will answer questions in the normal way next week and the week after and every other week subject to my schedule.  As I said last week, and the Deputy is correct on this, I will institute further inquiries to get information following questions raised in the debate today or tomorrow that we are not able to answer.  There is no problem in providing the information to the House.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Progressive Democrats seem to want to postpone this debate.  I believe that the approach of the Government in having the debate in the House as quickly as possible is the correct one.  Let us have the full report debated and if there are questions arising from the debate that are not fully answered in the question and answer session they can be tabled for next week and can be answered.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Ahern for raising last Thursday, although I was not here, an issue in regard to the debate.  Exchanges took place during Question Time on questions about the Director of Public Prosecutions where I was asked about the publication of advice by the Attorney General.  I said what I believed to be the case at the time, that there were no precedents for the publication of such advice to the Government.  I have since checked the <Col N="1257" /> records and there are precedents in regard to the publication of advice in a very limited range of circumstances, but there are no precedents for publication of the advice of the Attorney General in regard to a matter which is a subject, or potentially the subject, of a current court case.</P>

      <P>I urge the Taoiseach to publish the letter of 1 November.  He did not confirm that he is accepting the Fianna Fáil amendment to move this matter to a full committee where it can examine various witnesses at the end to business tomorrow.  In fairness to the gentlemen involved, they did not have adequate time.  There are more questions unanswered and there are areas which they did not look at.  A committee of the House, as has happened many times in the past, can usefully examine various witnesses and call the Attorney General and Minister for Justice before it and go through this matter extensively.  It seems reasonable that this House should investigate comprehensively a matter of urgent importance. I ask the Taoiseach to accept that amendment.</P>

At the end of that debate she will take questions for a period of an hour.  The Minister will be answering fully any questions that are put to her.  I believe that meets the case adequately.  The Minister will be announcing steps that she and the Government are taking to deal with this matter to ensure there is no recurrence of such events.</P>

      <P>The best way to proceed would be for the Whips to meet to discuss the matter.  I am sure the Labour Party Whip who was present last week will confirm that an assurance was given that the report would not be scheduled if it ruled out questions.  The Taoiseach talks about precedents.  He promised that he would not follow precedents in many respects and that he would run his Government as if behind a pane of glass.  The Taoiseach must be aware that we need to see the second letter of the Attorney General because it is clear from the report that even when the Minister for Justice got that letter she inquired about the wrong judge.  That is crucial to the question of accountability and responsibility. It is clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is clear from the report that nothing happened until the Director of Public Prosecutions made contact.  Last week when Deputy Ahern asked the Taoiseach if the inquiry would report into what happened in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General, he said it would, but it clearly did not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason questions must be answered not by the Minister for Justice, but by the Taoiseach as the person responsible for those officeholders in this House.  The Taoiseach must answer questions about what those officeholders knew and when they knew about matters before we begin to debate the report.  It is crucial we have those answers in advance of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that straightaway.  The position is that I quoted from the terms of reference of the Cromien-Molloy inquiry which allowed them to investigate all potential procedures that might be remedied or changed to avoid a recurrence of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> That did not preclude them from dealing with the issue of the Director of Public Prosecutions and his involvement in the matter.  The decision as to what they inquired into was, in the final analysis, a matter for themselves.  I said last week, and I stand over it, that if further matters not dealt with adequately in the report need to be inquired into, they will be inquired into.  In so far as questions asked relating to any other office, including the ones mentioned by the Deputy, where inquiries are relevant &mdash; Deputy Dermot Ahern raised relevant questions about that matter &mdash; are not dealt with adequately in the report, they will be dealt with adequately otherwise.  I can give the House an assurance on this matter.  It is important that this matter should be dealt with in a normal and orderly way but there is a difficulty.  The Deputy is demonstrating the wisdom of the Ceann Comhairle's rulings on this matter because she is clearly anticipating a debate in which the Minister will be speaking, giving answers, answering questions and so forth.  That is the best and most responsible way to deal with this matter.  I ask Deputy Harney, in turn, to allow this debate to proceed, to allow the Minister to speak in it, to allow her to be heard, to allow Members on the other side of the House to make their contributions, to then allow the Minister to be asked questions and to answer them and to allow the matter to proceed over the next two days, as is being provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reasonable way to proceed.  Any attempt to make the matter an issue of division at this stage when the Minister for Justice has not been heard yet on the subject is unfair to the House and to all those concerned. We need to have this matter presented in a full, comprehensive and responsible way before any judgments are reached of the type reached by the Deputy last week when she tabled a motion of no confidence.</P>

      <P>It is a point of order that goes to the root of this issue.  The point the Taoiseach is seeking to outline is that it will be possible to give full accountability as a result of debating a report that does not have all the answers.  Is it within the remit of the rules and procedures of this House and the Taoiseach's understanding of them that the House can organise by way of a committee to ensure that all the questions are answered and all the witnesses concerned are called for the purpose of ensuring full accountability, or is he suggesting to the House that we require the prior agreement of the Executive for that to happen? That is a pretty basic question as regards our rights and obligations as Members of this House. Will the Taoiseach not reply?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is claiming privilege for the Attorney General's letter of 1 November 1996.  In normal circumstances that would be an acceptable argument, but since we already know the essence of the advice the Attorney General gave to the Minister for Justice through public statements made by her and through replies from the Taoiseach to this House, it is clear that all we are asking for is the terminology used in conveying the advice.  Since we already know the advice it could not possibly be privileged, so the argument does not stand up. In those circumstances it is incumbent on the Taoiseach and the Government to let us have a copy of the second letter.

      <P>This matter requires an in-depth examination and analysis.  There is no point in the Taoiseach saying he is anxious to get to the end of the matter, to have detailed questions on it and not to allow a proper debate including the questions tabled by the Opposition.  I accept that the Chair ruled them out of order, but they are not part of the debate today.  The Taoiseach is not answering on behalf of the Attorney General. We have no guarantee that the matter will be transferred to a committee.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for four essential amendments to the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Act, 1994.  That Act cleared the way for the abolition of the former Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards, the sale of their ancillary businesses to private sector interests and the establishment of the National Milk Agency to regulate the supply of milk for liquid consumption throughout the State.  By and large, the Act has worked very well.  The old boards have been abolished, their business sold as going concerns and the National Milk Agency is now well established and operating effectively. In other words, the objectives set out in the Act have been achieved.  There is a need at this stage to make provision for the resolution of a few outstanding matters and it is for this reason I am putting forward the proposed amendments to the Act.</P>
      <P>The first of these concerns the disposal of the business and assets of the former boards. Consistent with the policy of protecting employment in so far as possible, it was decided at the outset that the ancillary businesses of the former milk boards should be sold as going concerns, with the majority of the staff transferring to the employ of the new owners rather than making them all redundant and selling off only the business assets.  Deputies will recall that the Act provided for the establishment of an interim board which would have responsibility for the management of the business in the period leading up to the sale.  The interim board sold by tender the business interests of the former Dublin Milk Board to Progressive Genetics Co-operative Society Limited in April 1995 and the following May the Cork business was sold to Pendine Investments.  However, the board was advised that it would achieve a better return for the State if it sold the headquarters building of the former Cork Milk Board separately from the ancillary business and decided to act on this basis.  A small technical amendment to the Act is necessary to allow the sale of the property as an asset rather than as part of a going concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the Act, the work of selling the business and assets of the former milk boards and of running such business until the time of the sale was carried out by the interim board established for this purpose.  The board consists of two senior civil servants from the Departments of Finance and Agriculture, Food and Forestry respectively and an outside chairman.  The vast bulk of its work is now completed and the board members are of the view that the time for its dissolution is approaching.  I share this view.  However, there remain certain apparent assets which the board <Col N="1265" /> has not so far been able to realise, as well as the possibility of contingent liabilities or certain residual business matters for the completion of which a time scale cannot be established.  In the nature of things, this could take some time.  The Act already provides for the dissolution of the board, but does not make any provision for the conducting of any business the board may leave unfinished.  In order to clear the way for its dissolution, I wish to amend the Act to provide that any business the interim board may leave unfinished, any assets unrealised or any liabilities undischarged shall become the responsibility of my Department.  The interim board has discharged its functions very satisfactorily and the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that a vacuum does not arise after its dissolution.</P>
    <P>The election of producer representatives to the board of the agency is also a matter which, in the light of experience, calls for some minor amendment of the Act.  Deputies will recall that the Act had to be amended last year to allow for the postponement of an election because a sufficient number of producers had not yet been registered to facilitate a fair election.  When the contracts came to be registered it emerged that some of them named more than one person as being the milk producer and all parties to the contract were registered by the agency in the register of producers.  Thus, in some cases, there would be more than one person entitled to vote in respect of a single contract.  This is manifestly unfair.  Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the Act to provide that, where more than one producer is a party to a contract, the person first named on the contract shall be regarded as the principal producer and shall alone be entitled to vote in an election of producer representatives. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure a totally fair election.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of ensuring regional balance among the producer representation on the agency.  As the industry is structured, there are a small number of large scale pasteurising dairies, mainly in the east of the country, and a considerable number of relatively smaller scale establishments in other regions.  The agency itself has expressed a fear that, if the electorate is not divided into constituencies, the suppliers to the larger eastern establishments will dominate the agency to the virtual exclusion of all others.  To forestall such an eventuality I propose to amend the Act to permit of the division of the electorate into two or more constituencies.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill are essentially minor and technical in nature.  They do not represent any radical change in policy or any major change in the existing pattern.  Rather they are small but significant adjustments necessary to allow the initial objectives to be achieved effectively and efficiently.  They do not represent any radical change in policy or major change in the existing pattern.  They are small but significant <Col N="1266" /> adjustments necessary to allow the initial objectives to be achieved effectively and efficiently.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill the principle of which I have no difficulty in accepting.  It deals with the sale of property in Cork as real estate rather than as the going concern provided for in the 1994 Act.  I am glad the Government has converted to the idea that it might sell some real estate in Cork.  There are also necessary provisions dealing with the election of producer representatives.  The election has had to be postponed and the Bill makes legal provision for this.</P>
      <P>My difficulty is in the intended composition of the board of the National Milk Agency.  The Minister's intention is that the composition will continue to be five producer representatives, four processors, one retailer, one distributor and one consumer.  The virtual exclusion of direct consumer representation is unacceptable.  I have tabled an amendment to ensure the number of consumer representatives will not be less than three.  It has the support of the Consumers Association of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The 20 March announcement in the House of Commons and the continuing BSE crisis have completely changed the atmosphere in which the food industry operates.  The customer is king, tokenism will no longer do.  If the issue of the credibility of the dairy industry is to be treated seriously and in a pro-active way, the interests and concerns of consumers must play a central role in the affairs of the National Milk Agency from the beginning.  When a crisis comes, it is too late.  The lesson of the BSE crisis is that the belated assurances of official agencies which have hitherto ignored the consumer are of no use.  It is for this reason the credibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is at rock bottom.  Characteristically, information has had to be dragged from the Minister and, invariably, within a short time there is another revelation which undermines the veracity of the original disclosure.  Only this week on the front page of one of the national newspapers there was another damaging revelation about pigmeat.</P>
      <P>The unnecessary damage to the industry could have been avoided if the Minister had revealed the facts about antibiotic residues in pork when he first learned about them.  Instead, it was only after weeks had passed and a survey by the Consumers Association of Ireland had forced his hand, that the Department released the information in its possession.  The mishandling did not end there.  We now know the supposed full facts were not the full facts.  The issue was again put in the spotlight this week with the revelation that carcases had passed into the food chain, even though they had tested positive.  With friends like this, the food industry will never need enemies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is an effort to deliver the National Milk Agency at birth from the approach <Col N="1267" /> that has already caused other food sectors incalculable damage.  If we are serious about the customer being king, we must put customers on the throne &mdash; royalty does not take kindly to being left outside the door.</P>
    <P>Although this is a technical Bill, the debate gives us an opportunity to take an overview of the dairy industry.  In that respect, it is timely given the mounting difficulties in the industry. The number of milk producers is likely to decline from about 41,000 in 1994 to 30,000 by the year 2000.  The policy of strict control of milk output through the superlevy regime, while maintaining the incomes of those lucky enough to have a decent milk quota, is ultimately leading to a declining and stagnating industry.</P>
    <P>Since the quota regime was introduced in 1984, the national milk production quota has been reduced by 9 per cent, despite a recognition of the special position of Ireland, its dependence on dairying and a promise of priority access to future quota allocations at the time the quota regime was introduced.  In the meantime the Italian quota has increased by 11 per cent while the Greeks have increased their quota by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Increasing milk quality standards and the near impossibility for small producers or new entrants throughout the main dairy areas of increasing production to make a viable enterprise will result in a halving of the number of milk producers between 1984 and the year 2000.  The dynamism which for so long was the hallmark of the dairy industry has been replaced by a virtual closed shop.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the processing industry is being starved of important raw material to develop its markets and has been forced into overseas acquisitions to grow and develop.  Immediate delivery on the promise of special consideration for Ireland in the allocation of future milk quotas is the number one priority.</P>
    <P>Irish milk production has a competitive advantage in Europe.  We must be allowed to exploit this advantage.  Low cost milk production, based on naturally produced grassland, suits most areas of this island.  Because of its relatively high labour demand spread throughout the year, dairying is particularly suitable for small to medium-sized family farms.  Milk can be produced just as efficiently on small to medium-sized farms as on large units.</P>
    <P>Opening up the opportunity for production to a new generation of dynamic young dairy farmers would allow the transformation of the industry and equip it to meet the competitive environment it is undoubtedly facing.  To be in a position to produce milk competitively, it must be possible for these people to expand and enter the business without incurring high capital costs in the acquisition of quota.</P>
    <P>Small dairy farmers, especially those in the most disadvantaged areas, will continue to need support at the end of the current quota regime. <Col N="1268" /> This income support must be an integral part of any new policy proposals.</P>
    <P>As regards the superlevy and the major problem with temporary leasing, this year's superlevy fine for dairy farmers is heading for a record £33 million.  Production levels to the end of October were running at an unprecedented 30 million gallons or 3.5 per cent over quota. Producers are facing the highest ever levy, over twice last year's figure.  There is serious concern that the butter fat level is also likely to be breached.  Small scale producers will be worst hit.</P>
    <P>The impact of the looming superlevy is directly related to the desperate need for more quota. The failure of the Minister to pursue the issue of extra quota, given the plight of small dairy farmers' is a scandal.  Not only did he fail to seek any long-term solutions he also failed to exercise the controls already at his disposal.  His handling of the temporary leasing issue has been as incompetent as it has been costly for small farmers.  His decision not to give priority to small or category A producers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons was a disgrace.  His subsequent U-turn under pressure demonstrated as much.</P>
    <P>The Minister's claim in June, when the revised rules were put in place, that the problems caused for small producers were not foreseen is not credible.  The only basis for that threadbare claim is that the monitoring capacity of the Department is seriously deficient.  Perhaps, we had another systems failure.  The reality is that the needs of small farmers have been consistently ignored. The clawback, introduced by the Minister as an eleventh hour attempt to stave off disaster, will not produce an extra gallon of milk in the current milk marketing year.  The failure to include existing leases will rob the measure of most of the impact it might have had in future years.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Minister to address the concerns of consumers and the needs of small farmers was vividly demonstrated by the quick cancellation of the dairy hygiene scheme at zero notice.  The announcement was tactically timed late on a Friday evening after the close of the ploughing championships.  The Minister slammed the door on small producers in spite of the fact that more than 75 per cent of dairy farmers failed strict new EU milk hygiene controls.  On that occasion his spokesperson was quoted as expressing &ldquo;serious concern&rdquo;.  A crackdown was promised that would include forcing farmers to update their facilities.  The Minister vowed to have 20,000 farms assessed this year.  I refer to a report in <i>The Examiner</i> of 24 November 1995. What he did was to shut down the scheme which would have allowed many farmers, particularly small and medium-sized producers, to make the investments they need to make to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>This is not only a farm development issue, it is a consumer confidence issue.  Confidence in food begins with the Protocols and standards observed on farm.  In this neglect of dairy farms, the <Col N="1269" /> Minister has sown the seeds of future serious problems.</P>
    <P>The most positive development in dairying during the past ten years has been the development of a range of first class farmhouse cheeses and other dairy products.  These have the potential to add enormously to the value of milk production and to keep jobs in local areas.  They must get the full support they require for their continued success and development, including access to milk supply, training, marketing and quality assurance support systems.  They are now a vital national resource.</P>
    <P>The key criterion for development of the food industry in terms of rural development is additional value in the areas where the raw material is produced.  An Irish dairy policy that will lead to a dynamic industry after 2000 must be developed and put in place immediately.  The industry needs a decent lead-in time in order to respond.</P>
    <P>With the proviso that consumers are brought in out of the cold as far as the National Dairy Agency is concerned, I have no problem in principle with this Bill.  The agency must have consumers in the boardroom in meaningful numbers.  A failure to do this now will rob the agency of its credibility at a future time when the industry may depend on the credibility of the agency's assurances to consumers for its survival.</P>

      <P>In addition to my other disadvantages, I am at the additional disadvantage of not having a copy of the Minister's script.  It is a great pity that he or his Department will not provide it to Members, as it is the normal practice when a script is delivered by a Minister that it is circulated at once. Unfortunately I must work from memory of what the Minister said &mdash; I did not take notes because I assumed the script would be circulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how one looks at this Bill, it would have to be described as rather unimportant.  When I consider the other matters currently consuming this House and the inability or unwillingness of the Government to give time for their debate or to answer questions on them, it is remarkable that several hours can be devoted to this topic.  The legislation is largely a rerun of an Act which went through this House in December last year but was not acted on by the Minister and the Department.  It is necessary to re-enact last year's legislation plus another provision to make up for an error in the 1994 Act. Remarkably, we are dealing with the third Bill in two years on a matter as relatively peripheral as <Col N="1270" /> this.  There are other problems in agriculture which more urgently need legislation &mdash; I can name them for the Minister if he is not aware of them, but I think he is.</P>
      <P>There is a marked contrast between the dairy industry on the one hand and the beef and pigmeat industries on the other.  We should ask ourselves why there is so little fraud or improper practices in the dairy sector when they are so widespread in other parts of agriculture.  If we can answer that question, we might learn lessons for the other areas.  The major difference is that the dairy processing industry is dominated by co-operatives, most of which are now in the midst of changing themselves into public limited companies &mdash; in some cases that is a gradual rather than an overnight process.  To use the in word, there is accountability in the dairy industry, by and large; there is no accountability in either the beef industry or in much of the pigmeat industry.</P>
      <P>The result is that the industry which has accountability to shareholders, producers, consumers, etc., has suffered no long series of scandals, nor are people constantly on the fiddle as they are in these other areas.  The only form of financial malpractice in recent years in the dairy industry occurred in one or two super-levy cases and where the Department, the Commission or both were able to intervene to stop it and to impose penalties.  This is a great contrast to what is happening elsewhere &mdash; EUCLAF, the EU anti-fraud section, is constantly involved in trying to get to the bottom of what is happening in other areas of Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>Part of this Bill is a direct rerun of the Act passed last year, simply substituting the year 1997 for 1996.  The other part &mdash; as far as I can ascertain from reading the Bill and listening to the Minister's speech &mdash; relates to clearing up drafting errors in the 1994 Act, which did not allow the disposal of all the assets of these dissolved boards unless they were sold as a going concern.  It was an error in the 1994 Act not to allow the disposal of assets in the normal way and this mistake must now be corrected.  The House will be perfectly happy to do so and to make these amendments, but I hope we will not need a further correctional Bill next year.  The old and interim boards should now be wound up, the new agency should take over, and that should be the end of the matter.  This prolonged transitional period, which seems to have continued for ages, should cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the 1994 Act, the 1995 Act nor this Bill refers to the numbers of people on the new agency representing different interests &mdash; that was fixed by ministerial order under the 1994 Act. It is interesting that the agency is completely dominated by producers and processors with a lone, nominal consumer at the end of the list of members.  That accurately reflects the thinking of the Minister and his Department, who have always regarded consumers with contempt and felt they were there to serve the producer and the <Col N="1271" /> processor.  Consumers have given good service to producers and processors over the years, frequently at their own expense, which I regret.  I fully support Deputy Cowen's proposed amendment, which tries to redress the balance, but increasing the mere numbers of consumer representatives will not make a major difference. That can only come about when the Minister and his Department fundamentally change their attitude that the producer and processor are kings and no one else matters.  This country has paid a high price &mdash; including fines of £71.9 million in one year, £8 million and £9 million in others &mdash; for the failure to recognise the rights of consumers and to regulate processors in particular adequately.</P>
    <P>I cannot let the opportunity pass without expressing my profound regret about something which happened in the last few days but has not received much media coverage in this part of the country. One of the major dairy processing co-operative societies has been ordered to pay compensation of £130,000 for practising religious discrimination <i>vis-à-vis</i> its employees.  It is the largest award ever made by the Fair Employment Commission for Northern Ireland, because it was regarded as the most serious case of religious discrimination it had ever come across.  It is deplorable that happened under the auspices of a large co-operative, now a quoted public liability company. It is a great pity it has been so little commented upon and is regarded almost as the norm, just another business expense.  It goes much deeper than that.  I deplore what happened.  I am aware it does not relate directly to this Bill but it relates to the processing and distribution of liquid milk and is a matter about which all of us should express our profound regret.  The Minister should intervene to ensure there will not be a repetition of what happened in the company concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill is largely of a technical nature to make up for defects in the earlier Act and the fact that last year's Act was not implemented.  I have no objection to it, but I contrast the fact that we have a relatively large amount of time to debate this rather unimportant Bill while we will have only half an hour to debate 38 amendments from the Seanad to the Family Law (Divorce) Bill.  It seems those who order business in this House have an extraordinarily strange sense of priorities.  In addition, the debate on the latest adventures of the Minister for Justice is deliberately put back until after Question Time today so that 70 questions would be disallowed by the Chair in anticipation of that debate.  Since questions to the Minister for Justice will not be taken again for a month, those questions cannot be asked until then.  If that debate had started this morning those questions could have been allowed this afternoon and the debate would be much more meaningful.  It is a great pity that cover-up is taking place and a Bill of this kind is inserted to facilitate it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> I do not oppose the Bill, there would be no point in doing so.  It is a very minor Bill and I look forward to hearing the Minister deal with some of the provisions in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Cowen and O'Malley for not opposing the Bill.  I will respond to some of the points they made.  If this debate concludes before the designated time I am not sure whether the order of the House provides that other legislation may be taken, but there is no attempt on my part to filibuster or delay matters.  Since this legislation is required for the electoral process to be cleared before the Christmas recess I have brought it forward with some urgency.</P>
      <P>On the general critique of the Department and myself <i>vis-à-vis</i> the consumer, I acknowledge that the Department must be seen to be pro-consumer. The dependence of producers on the consumer has been understated in the past.  I will come back to the composition of the board.  My predecessor was responsible for the primary legislation and I have not altered that basic structure.  The numbers were determined at that time and we are dealing here with the method of election.</P>
      <P>I have started dialogue with the Consumers Association of Ireland, the Director of Consumer Affairs and other interested bodies to see how the Department can improve its relationship with consumers and their representatives.  I intend to set up structured dialogue on a regular basis in the form of an advisory group so that all aspects of the Department are subject to quasi audit by consumers.  This is not something I am doing with fanfare but it needs to be included in the workings of the Department.  During Question Time last week I announced that every report <i>vis-à-vis</i> pesticides, residues and so on will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and when reports are made available to the Commission they will be available here.  There will be dissemination of all the information at the earliest possible date and quarterly specific documentation on residues will be published.</P>

      <P>On the changes I have made in regard to pigmeat, there is a new industry agreement whereby a producer must give a written declaration that he has not fed antibiotics to animals and has observed the withdrawal period.  Every consignment of pigs is to be tested at processor-factory level, which is significant. Incidents have been reduced from an appalling level of 21 per cent to about 3 per cent, but we must aim for complete elimination.  New publication methods are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to random testing as referred to in this week's lead story in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> carcases are now being retained for random <Col N="1273" /> testing.  In virtually every European state there are two types of testing: random screening and testing of suspect cases.  In the event that there is a 1 per cent incidence and a factory or producer is identified, a second level of testing will be carried out on the basis of suspicion.  A whole range of testing may be carried out without notification.</P>
    <P>In most member states carcases are not retained for random testing.  We are introducing a system of retention to give an indicative analysis which may be pursued with vigour to find the culprits.  A system of random and screen testing is being introduced as opposed to direct suspicion-related testing &mdash; that information has been somewhat lost sight of.  Under this system the thousands of carcases tested on a random basis will be retained and, where found to exceed the maximum residue limits, condemned.  The public, consumers' representatives and Members of the Oireachtas will be accommodated if they want increased food safety standards.  In regard to pigmeat in particular, I recommend that the Food Safety Board, which has power of binding recommendation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Protocols, study this area in conjunction with the interim board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen raised a number of points on the milk sector generally.  An expert group is studying the future of quotas beyond the year 2000.  The year 1997 will see the first steps of reform of the dairy sector.  I have received mixed advice to date, first, that there is an inevitability that quotas will be abolished and, second, that it is not in Ireland's interest that there be a free market in milk.  The prevailing price of milk to producers, at £1.05 per gallon, is subsidised to the tune of 40p per gallon by Europe.  The market for dairying has deteriorated rapidly in 1996 as against 1995.  In 1995 production in the southern hemisphere dropped, with increased buying by Russia.  In 1996 130,000 tonnes of skim milk powder went into intervention while 30,000 tonnes of butter went into intervention.  That downturn will probably continue into 1997.</P>
    <P>Farmers want the best of both worlds, they want unlimited production at the higher prices, but they can only have higher prices with fixed production.  I take the point that in the long-term Europe cannot continue to lose market share and whether it is an A and a B quota, we need to evolve change in that regard.  I want expert advice, however, and there is still some time remaining for that.</P>
    <P>On the question of the super levies, I am concerned that in addition to a record super levy last year of £14 million, there is a prognosis that we will have a super levy in excess of £30 million this year.  I am totally mystified as to the reason some farmers cannot accept that they own and manage their quotas.  I have not introduced any change in quotas since 1983.  Whether farmers have 5,000 gallons or 105,000 gallons they know how much they can produce every month, or pay a super levy.  The rules have not changed.  Some people are obliged to live within their quotas.  I <Col N="1274" /> have sympathy for the people who got temporary leased milk but for those who have not culled cows because there is a bad price for them, there is no avoiding the fundamental reality that there will be super levy payments which will place an additional burden on them.</P>
    <P>The first problem is there are two types of quotas given to small farmers, flexi-milk and temporary lease milk quotas.  Flexi-milk has effectively evaporated because when producers did not produce the quota in a given year, that went into the flexi-milk pool in the co-op and it was reallocated to small producers.  It dawned on people that if they could not produce milk up to the quota, it was worth money to lease it to someone else privately or to opt into the temporary leasing scheme.</P>
    <P>The second problem was that the commercial price of leasing milk was much higher than the 30p per gallon in the temporary leasing scheme. The combination of these factors meant that milk given to small producers dried up.  More milk quotas will be given this year to small producers than ever before.  Even in the first allocation which Deputy Cowen criticised, a greater proportion was given than in the two previous years.  The intention of the 10 per cent clawback is not to create a pool of milk but to avoid penalty and move milk into the temporary leasing scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not see any prospect of getting more quota.  Other than an agreement on CAP reform I am not aware there is provision for the Commission to propose a 2 per cent quota cut. No other member state is seeking extra quota. There was some mention of the peace dividend from a cross-Border proposal which I would support but that requires the support of the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The dairy hygiene scheme was suspended on the exhaustion of Structural Funds.  If we had alerted people that we intended to suspend the scheme, there would have been a flood of applications when the money was already exhausted.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies have tabled Committee Stage amendments on consumer representation.  The consumer representative on the agency monitors price trends, not food safety.  The National Milk Agency does not have any remit in relation to food safety.  The protection of the health and safety of the consumer is covered under other legislation, Statutory Instrument 9 of 1996, which gives full effect to EU directive 92/46 on the hygienic production of milk and dairy produce. The National Milk Agency is concerned with the control of supply.  We can come back to this topic on Committee Stage.  My mind is not totally closed on the matter.  I understand a balance was agreed with producer and processor representatives.  I am prepared to consider the question of an additional consumer representative, but I will return to this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> Deputy O'Malley raised a number of points.  I agree the dairy industry is the most exemplary element of the food industry other than food ingredients and prepared consumer foods.  For example, ten years ago there was a great deal of publicity about antibiotics but in a matter of weeks the matter was permanently rectified.  The somatic cell counts, the RBIs, the antibiotic and other residue testing of milk are to a very high standard.  That is something to do with the nature of the product and the discipline involved in it, but the Deputy's general comments in that regard are justified.</P>
    <P>I have been in Brussels for the past two days and I am not aware of the religious discrimination referred to by the Deputy.  I abhor any discrimination and I would find it regrettable if a company in the Republic was involved in it.  I do not have the details on this matter but I do not condone any such activities.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I agree with what has been said.  This is a technical measure.  I hope it will be the last such technical legislation required in this matter; they will simply have to get on with the elections.</P>
    <P>I bring to the attention of the House a Committee Stage amendment I will propose which I understand has been circulated.  One issue remains to be addressed on which I want to amend the Bill.  Legal advice given to the Department suggests that to hold the elections between now and the end of the year could involve taking an unnecessary risk.  Regulations governing the elections must, of necessity, be both comprehensive and detailed.  These are near finalisation.  Accordingly, I will put down on Committee Stage a further amendment to the Act which will extend the mandate of all the current members of the agency into 1997.  This means both the producer members and those representing the other categories will have their term of office extended to maintain the synchronisation envisaged under the principal Act.  This involves amending two sections of the Bill.  In section 3 two new subparagraphs are introduced to replace subparagraphs A and B in paragraph 5 of the Schedule of the principal Act to extend the mandate into 1997.  The paragraphs being replaced were inserted by the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Act, 1995, in this section referred to as the Act of 1995.  For legal reasons this Act must be defined and therefore section 1, which contains the definitions, must be amended accordingly.  It is the intention of the agency to make arrangements for the election of producer representatives and to obtain fresh nominations of representatives for other categories as early as practicable in 1997.  On this basis and on the basis that this will be the last deferral of these elections, regardless of the consequences of that, I ask the House to support these amendments.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I am referring to the Principal Act.  The rules of the agency are set out in the Schedule to the Principal Act.  Paragraph 5 relates to appointment provisions.  Subparagraph <Col N="1278" /> (1) deals with nominees of different interests and it concludes that a processor nominee must be a registered processor.  Deputy Cowen's suggestion, with which I agree, is that a further sentence should follow that which would read: &ldquo;The number of consumer representatives will be not less than two&rdquo;.  That should be inserted after the words &ldquo;registered processor&rdquo; in subparagraph (1) of paragraph 5 of the Schedule to the Principal Act.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 6: In page 9, after line 47, the following inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister may make regulations to allow for the establishment of a Register of Professional Organisations whose members are qualified to assist the parties involved in effecting a reconciliation, such register to show the names of members of those organisations and procedures to be put in place for the organisations involved to regularly update the membership lists.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Seanad amendment which was agreed on Report Stage enables the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to make regulations establishing a register of professional organisations in the field of counselling.  In recent years much work has been done by organisations involved in counselling to regulate the profession, including <Col N="1281" /> the establishment by the Irish Association for Counselling and Therapy, which is the accrediting body for counsellors of the national register of individual counsellors.  This is one important way to establish standards among counselling agencies and the hope and expectation is that counselling organisations will continue to develop expertise and standards among their members in the future. It is against that background that it may be possible at some stage to establish, in consultation with the counselling organisations, a form of register of the various organisations which are involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is accepting this amendment.  I cast my mind back to the time we debated the Bill initially when I had tabled a similar amendment.  Unfortunately, the Minister was not then able to accept my amendment regarding the establishment of a register of professional organisations.  We should refocus our attention on the matter of reconciliation in all its aspects.  It is important that proper procedures for counselling and mediation are in place and that the organisations involved are recognised by the State.  From that point of view it is most important that there is a register of professional organisations.</P>
      <P>I assume that the same procedures apply here as to Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely what steps does the Minister intend to take to ensure the establishment of such a register?  Will he specify which organisations he expects to come within the remit of his Department and, if not, precisely who would have ultimate responsibility?</P>
      <P>The amendment also specifies that procedures will be put in place for the organisations involved to regularly update their membership lists.  Who will monitor these procedures and what will be the remit of the Minister's Department in relation to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is merely an enabling one, enabling the Minister to make regulations for the establishment of a register of professional organisations.  It is not something I would contemplate doing in the short term because I do not think the evolution of the profession has progressed sufficiently.  The role of my Department is to process grant applications for counselling, which has been done.  Funding for that purpose amounting to £900,000 has been provided in 1996 compared with £300,000 in 1993. In addition, the range of services counselling organisations provide has been substantially extended.  When progress has been made in the organisation of the profession I will consult them to ascertain effective ways of setting standards and having a register prepared appropriate to the <Col N="1282" /> use by me of the power which the Dáil, if it accepts this amendment, will vest in me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy the Minister has gone along with this amendment, as there has been a great deal of discussion in the House on the issues involved.</P>
      <P>When does the Minister propose to establish this register?  He has just told us he does not intend to do so in the very near future, which will be a great disappointment to those involved in the various organisations concerned, a number of whom will have already prepared lists of counsellors and authenticated those they include in their register.  It is important that everybody should know precisely who is registered because, when the provisions of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996, are implemented early in the new year, a substantial number of applications will be submitted.  It is crucial that all such applicants receive good advice, are well counselled and know precisely who is qualified to do so in advance of the anticipated considerably increased demand.</P>
      <P>In the context of the referendum on divorce, the Opposition clearly understood it was the Government's intention to apply extra resources and undertake every effort to ensure that people are well advised and that professional mediation and counselling are available so that everybody knows precisely where to find such expanded services to cater for the anticipated sizeable increase in demand for them in the very early stages.</P>
      <P>I recommend that the Minister compiles such a register of professional organisations as soon as possible.  In the event of the Minister having a limited number of professional people and organisations available for this purpose, let that fact be known, let us be open in that respect.  If the numbers of professionally qualified people are inadequate, let the public know and then identify the precise problem.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister said, it appears he is of the opinion there is room for much development in that area, with which I agree.  Nonetheless it is important to state clearly the numbers of qualified people available and their professional standard.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that many of those who offer advice through ACCORD, which has been improving the quality and standard of its services, especially in recent years as it has been allocated additional resources, are not professionally qualified.  That organisation has established training courses for its members and done everything one would expect of it.  Presumably they will have staff who might be described as paramedics, who are not fully qualified counsellors, who would work under the supervision of counsellors within a system controlled and managed professionally to ensure a consistently high standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be concerned about the standard of counselling and mediation made available <Col N="1283" /> because, when a marriage breaks down and the future of the spouses and children concerned is being considered, the issues involved can be very complex, profound and have a long-term influence on partners and the lives of their children.  There is much evidence to support the contention that the more that can be done to facilitate an amicable separation and settlement the better.  It has been adequately documented that the more amicable the parents' separation, the better it is for the children in the long-term, that the fewer the adverse effects the fewer will be the children's difficulties in later life.  We must also bear in mind the long period often involved in reaching such a settlement, also affecting children, one of our greatest concerns.</P>
    <P>Since we last debated these issues such sentiments have been expressed ever more frequently, for the obvious reason that very soon there will be a much increased demand when people will want reassurance that such professional services will be readily available. Before the referendum the Government and Opposition gave a strong commitment that they would not set aside this matter when the referendum was over and say, &ldquo;the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has been given £900,000 and good luck to him&rdquo;.  That is not the way to deal with the matter.  The necessary resources must be provided if we are to avoid considerable difficulties down the road.  The pay back to the State will be worthwhile as we are building foundations, so to speak, for families in the future.</P>
    <P>I cannot overemphasise the importance of professional counselling services.  I accept that professionals may employ people to assist them in their work but the value of professional advice cannot be undervalued.  I congratulate the Minister on accepting the amendment and urge him to set up the register as soon as possible. Given the solemn undertakings and commitments by parties on both sides of the House prior to the referendum, a lack of resources should not be given as a reason for the failure to set up the register as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment recognises the importance of counselling and mediation for couples who intend to separate or divorce.  By accepting the amendment the Minister is taking a lead and saying that the State recognises the importance of professional counselling services. The provision of high quality counselling in a stressful case involving separation or divorce will have a dramatic impact on the mental health of the couple and their children.  There is much evidence that this type of intervention can be very helpful.  I would much prefer couples to deal with their differences through counselling than by taking a case to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment refers to a register, a concept which must be looked at against the background of a confused but developing situation in terms <Col N="1284" /> of counselling groups, social workers and family mediation services.  All these groups are in the process of developing accreditation and validation at national and international level, and some counsellors are at a more advanced stage in this process than others.  The establishment of a register by the Minister will, therefore, be dependent on the progress made by these groups in tackling this task.  Nevertheless, the principle is an important one; it is about a professional standard and register, the road we must take.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect to the amendment.  During debates I have referred to the information deficit in terms of the legality of a situation.  This applies equally to this Bill in that it will take some time before people are fully tuned in to its complexities.  I am repeatedly struck at how difficult it is for people to have access to counselling.  People ask questions not only about the cost of counselling but also about to whom they should go and where they can get information.  By accepting the amendment the Minister is putting pressure on counselling organisations to make their services better known.  The Government must help them in doing this by providing funding.  The Minister, Deputy Taylor, has a legal background and he has made great strides in supporting counselling services and giving recognition to the importance of counselling.  He has supported groups such as the AIM Group, the Family Mediation Service and other counselling groups.  This amendment is important in terms of ensuring professional counselling services are available and getting the message across that the Government wants people to avail of them.  Many counselling groups are still seeking accreditation and validation and it is very important to ensure that people do not avail of counselling services provided by people who are not properly trained.  This is an area which also needs to be monitored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though he did not accept my Committee Stage amendment, I am glad the Minister accepted this Seanad amendment as it puts down a marker about the need for counselling organisations to provide professional services.  The Minister said this is an enabling provision.  Various counselling groups are at different stages in the accreditation and validation process and I ask the Minister to take on board the difficulties experienced by people in having access to counselling.  He should consider the procedures necessary to ensure all people have access to counselling and establish a register as soon as possible.  Instead of dealing with the matter in the long term, he should look at what can be done immediately.</P>

This shows the value of the time gap between debates in the Dáil and the Seanad &mdash; it gives more time for mature reflection, which has paid off on this occasion. <Col N="1285" /> This area should be regularised and the sooner the Minister does this the better.</P>

      <P>Section 8: In page 11, lines 19 to 25, subsection (6) deleted.</P>
      <P>Section 8(6) provides for the non-admissibility as evidence in court of communications between either of the spouses concerned and a third party for the purpose of effecting a reconciliation or a mediated divorce settlement after the institution of divorce proceedings.  Amendment No. 2 provides for the deletion of that subsection and amendment No. 3 substitutes a more comprehensive provision by way of a new section which provides for the non-admissibility as evidence of such communications made prior to and after the institution of divorce proceedings. Amendment No. 21 provides for changes in various sections of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which are mainly consequential on amendments Nos. 2 and 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister provide information regarding amendment No. 3?  I understand the purpose of the amendment but will he inform the House of his views relating to intimidatory behaviour by one spouse towards the other?  I want to be sure that, if this was part of a communication process, it will not, therefore, be inadmissible.  In other words, if threats are made towards one of the spouses I presume that type of behaviour will not be absolved in the context of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>Section 17: In page 24, after line 53, the following subsections inserted&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Where the personal representative of a deceased spouse in respect of whom a decree of divorce has been granted gives notice of his or her death to the other spouse concerned (&ldquo;the spouse&rdquo;) and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the spouse intends to apply to the court for an order under this section,</P>
      <P>(b)  the spouse has applied for such an order and the application is pending,</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(c)  an order has been made under this section in favour of the spouse,</P>
      <P>the spouse, shall, not later than one month after the receipt of the notice, notify the personal representative of such intention, application or order, as the case may be, and, if he or she does not do so, the personal representative shall be at liberty to distribute the assets of the deceased spouse, or any part thereof, amongst the parties entitled thereto.</P>
      <P>(8)  The personal representative shall not be liable to the spouse for the assets or any part thereof so distributed unless, at the time of such distribution, he or she had notice of the intention, application or order aforesaid.</P>
      <P>(9)  Nothing in subsection (7) or (8) shall prejudice the right of the spouse to follow any such assets into the hands of any person who may have received them.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This provides that where a divorced spouse dies, the court may by order make provision out of the deceased spouse's estate for the surviving former spouse.  Under section 17(6), the personal representative of the deceased spouse is required to make a reasonable attempt to ensure that notice of the death of the deceased is brought to the attention of a spouse who might be an applicant under the section.  Where an application is made under the section for provision to be made out of the estate, the personal representative must not, without leave of the court, distribute any of the estate until the application has been determined by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, there is no protection afforded to the personal representative.  The amendment provides that where a personal representative gives notice to a former spouse as required under subsection (6), that spouse is required, within one month, to notify the personal representative of any intention to make an application under section 17, any application <Col N="1289" /> pending or any order made.  Should the former spouse fail to notify the personal representative, the personal representative will be free to distribute the assets and shall not be held liable to the former spouse for any assets so distributed. The proposed provision is similar to a provision contained in section 49 of the Succession Act, 1965.  Amendments Nos. 34 and 37 are consequential on acceptance of amendment No. 13.</P>

      <P>`(a)  the marriage is annulled or dissolved either&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 47 contains an amendment to section 5(7) of the Powers of Attorney Act, 1996.  That subsection provides that an enduring power of attorney in favour of a spouse is invalidated if subsequently the marriage is the subject of a separation, annulment or foreign decree of divorce or if a protection, safety or barring order is made against the attorney on the application of the donor or <i>vice versa.</i>  Paragraph (a) of this amendment provides, in effect, that the enduring power will be invalidated also if the marriage is dissolved in the State.  Paragraph (b) addresses the question of what should happen the enduring power in circumstances where there are joint attorneys, one of those attorneys is the spouse of <Col N="1293" /> the donor and the marriage between the donor and that attorney breaks down.  It makes clear that the enduring power will be invalidated only in so far as it relates to the attorney who is the spouse of the donor.</P>

      <P>This amendment is necessary to enable this Bill become an Act and we support it. Changes are being made to the Powers of Attorney Act, 1996 in this legislation.  While that creates work for lawyers and others, it is not desirable.  This is where consolidating the legislation is important.  The consolidation of the Powers of Attorney Act would be a simple matter and could be done some time next year. Consolidating all relevant matters in one Act would eliminate complications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new approach to administration in the Department of Justice &mdash; I am sure that would not happen in the Department of Equality and Law Reform &mdash; matters might be dealt with in this manner.  If matters are dealt with when they are simple, they do not get complicated, but people do not tend to be interested in simple matters and they do not get coverage in the newspapers.  One of the main difficulties here is that unless a matter is of major importance, most people are not interested in it. One of our weaknesses is to manage by way of panic, crisis and fear, which can come from above or elsewhere.  Various legislation dealing with pensions, which has been introduced since the introduction of the Pensions Act, 1990, could also be consolidated.  That could have been done last year, five years after the introduction of the 1990 Act.</P>
      <P>While the Powers of Attorney Act has not been changed significantly, all related legislation should be consolidated.  Will the Minister ask the office of Attorney General to consider consolidating legislation such as this on a frequent basis to simplify matters?  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I also support the amendment. Deputy Woods has made a valid point and in general, I welcome the consolidation of legislation.  The employment equality legislation, which will be debated tomorrow, should also be consolidated.  It is difficult for practitioners to deal with complex legislation.  While the Powers of Attorney Act is straightforward, other similar legislation is likely to be enacted and unless it is consolidated it could become complicated like other legislation.  While it is not appropriate to talk about another Bill going through the House, we should establish a principle in regard to consolidating legislation.  Legislation should be as straightforward as possible for those who are not familiar with it.  I support the amendment and put down a market that legislation should be as <Col N="1294" /> accessible as possible to everybody, and not merely to legislators and lawyers.</P>

      <P>The passing of the Final Stage of this Bill in the House marks a historic occasion in the evolution of family law.  It is the end of a process on which the Government embarked in January 1993 and it is also in many respects the culmination of a decade of work in the family law area which has seen 18 Bills on the subject passed by both Houses.  The Bill gives effect to that which the people have enshrined in the Constitution, namely the right of persons in certain irreconcilable circumstances to have their marriage dissolved by our courts and to remarry if they so wish.  It keeps faith with the text of the draft Bill published by the Government in advance of the 1995 referendum.  I know that Irish society has for long cherished the family and that no one salutes the introduction of divorce. Nevertheless, the decision of the people in the divorce referendum was an acknowledgment of the need to address the painful problem of marriage breakdown.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to all those who were supportive of our efforts to have this legislation enacted, including Members of the Oireachtas, many of whom made fine contributions during the Bill's passage, all of which have been beneficial to the Bill.  I express my thanks and appreciation to the staff of my Department who worked so hard and for such long hours to prepare this Bill for its passage through all Stages, not least the Final Stage today.</P>

      <P>This is important legislation and I congratulate the officials, the Minister and all those involved in its preparation and those who debated it in the House.  The Minister mentioned those who supported the referendum which was closely run and won by a narrow margin.  The people were saying that they wanted to protect families, especially children, and do the utmost to keep families together.  The Government, at the request of and in agreement with the Opposition put draft proposals before the people for the legislation.  This was an important feature of the debate prior to the referendum because it was possible to say to people that this was roughly what the Government planned to introduce in terms of family law legislation if the amendment was passed.  The Bill keeps faith with those proposals.  I said that the proposals would have to <Col N="1299" /> be examined in detail and that was the case in both Houses.  That was satisfactory and a straight, open way to deal with the electorate.</P>
      <P>My understanding from the narrow margin of victory in the referendum was the concern of people about children in marriage breakdown where divorce would be possible.  We proposed that there should be a commissioner for children and the Minister said this matter would be taken up under the Child Care Acts.  I am concerned about that and would like to see it moving more urgently because it is the core concern.  Most people say it is the issue that they are most concerned about.  There is a constitutional obligation on us to provide adequate protection for children in situations of marriage breakdown. We have endeavoured to ensure that and the Minister has in many respects carried that through in the Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996. Resources are vitally important to meeting that commitments.  There is an onus on Government to provide the resources to match the legislation. We will continue to monitor and press for adequate resources.</P>
      <P>One issue brought to our attention in the course of these discussion was that of parental equality.  Both parents want to be treated equally and that will require a good deal of extra attention in future.  The Ministers agrees with that.  I congratulate the Minister on completing the legislation in such a patient way.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the officials of his Department who have worked so hard on this and I am sure he feels a great burden has been lifted from his shoulders with the final process of this legislation.  This is an historic moment.  The legislation recognises the fact that in Irish society we unfortunately have marriage breakdown.  I hope that as a result of the discussions and the Minister's commitment we will have a greater focus on counselling and support for families.  It is important to underline that in tandem with the passage of this Bill.  If there is a backlog in the courts, it should be alleviated as far as is possible.  I am glad we have come to the end of this process and I hope that for many people who wish to remarry, this will be the dawn of a new day for them.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a point regarding matters in the House this morning about which the Fianna Fáil Front Bench is anxious.  The Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party discussed the matter during the morning.  We are very anxious to have an orderly and useful debate this afternoon and tomorrow.  As I said this morning, <Col N="1300" /> we do not have any argument concerning the fact that the questions to be taken today, about ten in my name and others in the name of the Progressive Democrats, are not on the Order Paper.  I understand the Chair's ruling on that and I do not challenge it, as that would not be my form or that of my colleagues.  I understood that when those questions were ruled out of order on the basis that the debate was about to commence, they would form part of it, but we know from exchanges this morning that the questions tabled will not form part of it.  In the question and answer session tomorrow the person who is accountable and answerable to this House for the Attorney General and central to this matter will not form part of the debate and a committee of inquiry will not follow up the matter at the end of the debate, even though the eminent gentlemen who spent their weekends working on this matter suggested that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to intervene Deputy Ahern, but as the Deputy well knows the matter before the House, that of questions, is laid down very clearly and distinctly in our Standing Orders and shall commence at this time, 2.30 p.m. It is unprecedented that there should be any questions put to the Chair or any attempt to disrupt the proceedings at this time.  I am very concerned about that matter.  I must ask that if the Deputy has a view to express, it be expressed at some other time.  There will be ample time during the debate to which he referred and the questions and answers at that time.  The matter can be dealt with in another way, by way of the Whips' meeting or some such negotiations, but I cannot allow a disruption at this time.  It is unprecedented.</P>

      <P>They have carried out their tasks with conscientiousness, diligence and speed.  I thank them for recording that they received the fullest co-operation from the management and staff of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>In the words of the report, what happened was quite inexcusable.  What happened in this case was a chapter of accidents, each of which reinforced the adverse effects of the other.</P>
      <P>The report states that the circumstances which led to the failure to delist Judge Dominic Lynch are unlikely to recur because of the dire consequences which have followed.  The inquiry team expressed concern, however, that from what it has learned about the Department they might recur in some other section.  It states: &ldquo;This strongly confirms the need for changes in organisation and work practices...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I accept the findings and recommendations of the report and have already moved to introduce changes and reforms to tackle many of the issues raised.  I will take actions in the short, medium and long term to ensure &ldquo;nothing short of a comprehensive transformation of the Department of Justice&rdquo; is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, the report echoes the processes that I and the Government started last year.  Let me mention but a few.  Regionalisation of senior management in the Garda Síochána took place in 1995; further civilianisation of the Garda Síochána is taking place; major information technology programmes for areas of the criminal justice system were commenced; the first drug-free unit in our prisons was opened this year; an expanded Supreme Court which can now sit in two chambers was established; 800 prison places are in the process of being provided which will allow for better management of offenders; and a major programme of criminal law reform is taking place, including measures to use the time of gardaí and prison officers more efficiently.  In May this year I obtained the approval of the Government to set up an independent courts service to run the courts and further actions on <Col N="1306" /> the implementation of that decision were taken both this and last week.  I have also obtained the agreement of the Government to establish an independent prisons agency, something that was recommended 11 years ago but not acted on by previous Governments.  It is now happening.</P>
    <P>I accept all of the findings and recommendations of the report.  There are two separate issues to be considered.  There is the question of what is needed in the Department to ensure we never have a repetition of the administrative failures that arose on this occasion and to address the organisational, management and systems problems outlined in the report and the question as to what actions may be taken in relation to the way the officials at the centre of this matter discharged their duties.</P>
    <P>The report echoes the Department's own SMI study which has been ongoing for a year and which will be published in December.  In that statement the Department readily accepts the challenges it faces and the need for major change. The inquiry team acknowledges that documents it has seen of work in progress on the SMI strategy clearly reveal that the Minister, the Secretary and senior officials of the Department have been identifying the actions required.  The clear thrust of the report is that nothing short of a comprehensive transformation of the Department is called for.  The Government will do just that.</P>
    <P>I will detail the actions I have decided upon and which I communicated last night to my Government colleagues to implement the findings and recommendations of the report.  To modernise procedures in the Department, the best management, organisational and information technology expertise of the Department of Finance supported by external consultants who are experts in their fields will be made available to support the Department in implementing the recommendations of the report and any other changes that may be required.  As the report specifies, the Department has already identified the need for change but, for the reasons mentioned, will need support if senior people are to have time to participate in the planning process.  In this context, a decision has been taken to appoint, through TLAC, an official at deputy secretary level by 1 December.</P>
    <P>Second, immediate steps will be taken to assess the scope of what needs to be done and to draw up appropriate terms of reference for the management consultants.  The consultants will make a critical analysis of the functions of the Department of Justice and will recommend medium-term and longer-term solutions to the problems identified in the report of the independent inquiry.  The terms of reference of the management consultants will include examination, as a matter of priority, of the need for a dedicated EU division in the Department.  I will indicate later the reasons for examining this specific issue as a priority.  The consultants will be <Col N="1307" /> asked to produce an interim report by 1 February, 1997.</P>
    <P>Third, the work of the management consultants will be overseen by a small steering group with secretarial back-up, consisting of one person who is a private sector member of the SMI co-ordinating committee, the Secretary of the Department of Justice and the official at deputy secretary level who will be assigned to the Department for a two year period to provide critical support for the process of change.  The specification for this post will be drawn up immediately by the Departments of Justice and Finance.  The steering group will provide progress reports on implementation to the Minister every two months in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the report states that management must confront individuals who are deemed to have failed.  In accordance with the Civil Service disciplinary code, disciplinary proceedings are being initiated in the cases of certain officials referred to in the report.</P>
    <P>Fifth, as the Minister and the Government as a whole treat with the utmost gravity the findings in the report more specific to the failure to inform Mr. Justice Lynch that he was delisted from the Special Criminal Court the following immediate measures have either been or are being taken. The assistant secretary who headed up the courts division of the Department before Ireland's Presidency of the EU is being recalled from his duties in Brussels where he has been spearheading the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  All Government decisions affecting the Judiciary &mdash; whether new appointments, delisting or whatever &mdash; will be referred to the assistant secretary in the courts division and it will be his or her personal responsibility to ensure that those concerned implement the decision and that the Minister and Secretary of the Department are immediately provided with written confirmation that the action has been taken and that all necessary follow-up procedures have been implemented.</P>
    <P>More widely, arrangements have been put in place which will require all assistant secretaries in the Department to ensure that all Government decisions affecting their areas of responsibility are implemented and to obtain reports at least once a week on the action taken in their divisions in relation to implementation of such decisions. Assistant secretaries will report to the Secretary on a weekly basis &mdash; or immediately, in the event that difficulties are identified in the implementation of any decision or decisions.</P>
    <P>The rostering arrangements for annual leave are being urgently reviewed as it is clear that leave arrangements contributed to the difficulties in this case.  As well as this, detailed instructions are being drawn up to ensure there is a specific and detailed assignment in writing of current work from an officer who is taking authorised annual leave, to another named officer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> The existing procedures are being expanded whereby all future correspondence to the Minister from Members of the Government, the Attorney General, the DPP, members of the Judiciary and other major public officeholders, whatever their import will be shown to the Minister and copied to the Secretary of the Department immediately.</P>

      <P>By way of setting in context some of the decisions I have announced, I think it is right to advert to the major pressures, highlighted in the report, which the Department of Justice has had to face in recent years.  They are, briefly: first, a general increase in crime and lawlessness which has, among other things, resulted in serious prison overcrowding with relentless pressure for early prisoner releases.  I have done more to tackle that problem in my time in office than any of my predecessors.</P>
      <P>Second, there has been enormous growth in a short period, of European Union work, a development greatly accentuated during the EU Presidency.  This pressure arose because of the &ldquo;Third Pillar&rdquo; provisions of the 1993 Maastricht treaty.  Part of the outfall was that last year alone, for example, a relatively small number of middle management officials had to service 280 Justice and Home Affairs meetings abroad as well as preparing for five European Council meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third factor is the demands on senior staff to work on the Northern Ireland peace process and related activity.  I and a small number of senior officials in my Department have been deeply involved in the Northern talks process, which commenced last June.  The Department had been centrally involved for quite some time prior to that with attempts to deal with the issue of arms decommissioning which, as everybody <Col N="1309" /> knows, has bedevilled progress in the Northern talks.  The Secretary of the Department, in particular, has been closely involved in this process and in other aspects of the peace process which he cannot delegate to others.</P>
    <P>Fourth, there has been, in the words of the inquiry team, &ldquo;a heightened awareness among the general public of issues such as personal rights and crime with a consequent increase in demand for information by Members of the Oireachtas and the media&rdquo;.  By way of a practical example of the impact of this, the number of Parliamentary Questions to the Department ten years ago was about 670; already this year it is well over 2,000. The report goes on to say that the only significant way in which these demands were addressed internally within the Department was to seek some additional resources and that the additional resources provided over the years were entirely inadequate in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Resources have been provided in areas such as probation and welfare and forensic science during this Government's term but, over the past ten years, the core administrative staff complement has only gone up by about 5 per cent.  Most of those, incidentally, were provided this year on a temporary basis to meet our EU Presidency obligations.  They were not provided three or five years ago.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of the pressures generated in the Department of Justice over the years and the need to contain staff numbers in the Civil Service generally, for wider policy reasons, resulted in a situation where senior management were, in the words of the report, &ldquo;trapped on a treadmill of crisis management&rdquo; with simply no time available for planning.  However, while the report paid tribute to the staff of the Department that they handle so many routine and, especially, unique and unexpected transactions under pressure with so few errors, it took the view that human error in this case cannot be explained away entirely as being due to the organisational, management and systems weaknesses in the Department.  Deputies will know that I have come into this House twice already to make as full statements on the circumstances as I possibly could on the basis of the established facts that were available to me at those times.  In the course of my first statement on Thursday, 7 November, I said:</P>
    <P>...in the particular circumstances that have arisen here, and in order to avoid any suggestion of lack of objectivity, it would be right to have a person or persons outside the Department involved in this investigation.</P>
    <P>The action I took &mdash; which was unprecedented &mdash; cannot be faulted for its openness, its honesty and its objectivity.  I doubt if anybody in this House can credibly disagree with that proposition.</P>

      <P>It is worth saying in this House that the report confirms the account of what took place that I gave to this House before the inquiry and confirms that the actions taken by me on 5 November on receipt of the Attorney General's letter and on 6 November to rectify the failure, commenced with my query to an official in the courts division.  In the intervening time since I spoke on 7 November, there has been much speculation, rumour, innuendo and allegations and many of these points have since been shown for the political point-scoring they were.  The report gives the lie to allegations of cover-up and, among other things, lays to rest the suggestion that a senior counsel &mdash; whom Deputy McCreevy named in this House &mdash; had specifically warned the Department and had threatened to go public if the situation was not resolved.  Deputy McCreevy has now clarified that there was no basis whatsoever for his suggestion.</P>
      <P>There has been much debate on the Attorney General's role.  The report clearly indicates that the Attorney General's letter of 2 October should have prompted action by the Department.  The inquiry team concludes that its reading of the Attorney General's letter would lead it to infer that &ldquo;urgent action was required upon it&rdquo;.  It also stated that the most critical transaction from the point of view of potential consequences, namely, the delisting of a member of the Special Criminal Court, was least well served by a formal process or precedent.  Before any letters from the Attorney General or Judge Lynch came into the Department two months had gone by and the Government decision had not been fully implemented.  Even after the two letters came in, during the first 14 days or so of the third month, these still did not produce action until a second letter from the Attorney General was received by me on 5 November.  As the report said, &ldquo;this was inexcusable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Full access to the Department was available to the inquiry team.  I wonder whether any of the Members who say this report is not enough would, when they were in charge of Departments, have opened their doors to such critical examination.</P>

      <P>I spoke to the inquiry, as did the Attorney General and the senior counsel.  In all, 14 persons were interviewed inside and outside the Department.  While stating that the management and staff of the Department of Justice fully co-operated with the inquiry, the inquiry team clearly states that the results of its efforts to follow the paper trail came to an unsatisfactory dead-end at crucial points, with key individuals unable to recollect important details or failing to recognise the seriousness of <Col N="1311" /> vital correspondence.  This is most unsatisfactory for the purposes of identifying with exactitude who did what or failed to do what was necessary. Even with this lack of detail, however, it is evident that the investigation felt that human error had been made.  Importantly, the report stressed that any fair apportioning of blame would have to advert not just to present incumbents in all key positions &mdash; presumably, Civil Service and political &mdash; but also to missed opportunities and failure to initiate change in the past.  The record will show that many previous inquiries &ldquo;ran into the sand&rdquo;, to borrow a line from the report.</P>

      <P>Mistakes were made in Departments in the past and I do not recall any inquiry such as this ever being instituted.  I stress again that this report will be acted upon.  Work has already commenced on its implementation.  I assure this House, on my behalf and on behalf of the Government, that the most comprehensive and far-reaching actions are being taken and will continue to be taken to address the fundamental changes required to totally transform the way in which the Department of Justice operates and thereby deliver a better, more effective criminal justice system to the people.  That is, and must be the primary objective of any democratic Government.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil is participating in this debate under protest.  Through our Leader, we made legitimate demands of the Government which have not been met, and I will set out what these demands are.  We asked that the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General and the Taoiseach accept full political responsibility for what happened, as required by law under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, as amended; that questions to the Taoiseach, as well as those to the Minister for Justice, relating to the responsibility of the Attorney General be answered by the Taoiseach; that the Attorney General's letter to the Minister of 1 November 1996 be published and that a Dáil subcommittee on security and legislation be established to investigate and hold hearings on the entire affair, given the admitted inadequacy of the inquiry. These are legitimate demands which could be expected to be met in any democracy but which the Government decided to ignore for reasons best known to itself.  On that point, as with much more relating to this sordid affair, the jury is out on the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two significant statements in the Minister's speech to the House and in the report of the inquiry team.  The report states: &ldquo;Management must, therefore, examine the degree of culpability attaching to individuals and <Col N="1312" /> take appropriate action while having regard to established procedures and, as we have suggested earlier, the track record of individuals&rdquo;.  The Minister for Justice in her speech stated:</P>
    <P>...the report states that management must confront individuals who are deemed to have failed.  In accordance with the Civil Service disciplinary code, disciplinary proceedings are being initiated in the cases of certain officials referred to in the report.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice makes much of the inquiry's report on the fact that individuals must be confronted.  It appears that individuals &mdash; civil servants &mdash; are to be sacrificed.  To any reasonable person it appears the bounty hunters of the rainbow Coalition Government will take the heads of the kittens for the sins of the lions. The seriousness of this sorry saga is underlined by Article 40.4.1 of the Constitution which provides: &ldquo;No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 1 August 1996 the Minister for Justice brought a memorandum to Government and had it passed.  She failed to have that Government decision implemented and the result was that in the most sensitive court in the land, a bogus court handed down bogus decisions on the most serious of offences and charges.  The Attorney General had heard some time around the end of September 1996 that there was a problem with the Special Criminal Court and he wrote to the Minister for Justice on 2 October 1996 advising her of that.  The Minister said she did not receive the letter of 2 October 1996 but that she received the letter from the Attorney General of 1 November 1996.  She said she received the letter from Judge Dominic Lynch dated 2 July 1996 but that she did not receive the letter he sent to her on 10 October 1996.  Why did the practices and procedures, which are much criticised in this report, work in regard to two letters from the Attorney General and the Judge of the Special Criminal Court but not in regard to two other letters?  It is rather strange to say the least.</P>
    <P>Even stranger is the letter of 10 October 1996 which the Minister for Justice said she did not receive.  According to the report, that letter arrived in the Minister's constituency office and by some miraculous device &mdash; I presume it was not by way of paper plane &mdash; turned up subsequently in the courts division of the Department of Justice.  Neither the Minister for Justice, her personal assistant nor anybody who was interviewed knows how it got there or how it arrived on the file.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has admitted that she does not know what goes on in her Department, her personal office and her constituency office and that she does not receive or, alternatively, does not respond to letters she receives from the Attorney General and judges of the Special Criminal Court.  In those circumstances I am legitimately entitled to ask if the Minister for Justice does not know about these vital matters, <Col N="1313" /> what does she know?  To whom is the Minister for Justice responsible if not responsible to the Attorney General and judges of the Special Criminal Court?  The truth is that when the beauty board, decorations and smokescreens have been put to one side, this fiasco is down to one thing; the gross negligence of the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General whose gross negligence resulted in the Special Criminal Court sitting in a bogus court handing down bogus judgments which affect the security of the State.</P>
    <P>I want to expand on the role of the Attorney General in this sordid business.  It was patently wrong of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to come into this House and pretend that the Attorney General was merely the legal adviser to the Government and that it was not his responsibility to ensure action was taken when he first learned of the bogus court.  There is ample legal precedent to support the view &mdash; the incontrovertible fact &mdash; that not alone is the Attorney General the legal adviser to the Government, he is also the guardian of the public interest.</P>
    <P>In the Supreme Court judgments in the case of the Attorney General <i>v.</i>  Hamilton, No. 1 of 1993, page 250, two Irish Reports, and 1993 IRLM at page 81, the view of the late Mr. Justice McCarthy may be taken as representative of the court's view on the role of the Attorney General. He stated:</P>
    <P>The nature of the office of the Attorney General charges him with the duty to enforce the Constitution, whether it be in the protection of the unprotected, as in Attorney General <i>v.</i> X. or in a claim of public right or otherwise.  It follows that... if the Attorney General considers that the [certain] conduct ... involves a possible constitutional breach, he is entitled, in his own right, to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts.  Independence of function in this context has its duties as well as its rights.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be clearer than that the Attorney General not only had a right to take action when he learned of the bogus Special Criminal Court, he had a duty under the Constitution to do so inasmuch as the Minister for Justice had when she first learned of this débâcle.</P>
    <P>The role of the Attorney General can be stated to involve two separate and distinct legal functions.  He is, in the words of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, the legal adviser to the Government, but he is also the guardian of the public interest.  In his capacity as guardian of the public interest he had a duty to act &mdash; I cannot stress that enough &mdash; when he learned there was an impression among the Judiciary that Judge Lynch was still a member of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General would be well aware that the question of the correct composition of the Special Criminal Court can and has given rise <Col N="1314" /> to litigation in the past.  Twice in the past 14 years the issue has come before the High Court and the Supreme Court.  It came before the High Court in 1983 in the State (Gallagher) <i>v.</i> the Governor of Portlaoise Prison and in McGlinchey <i>v.</i> the Governor of Portlaoise Prison in 1988.  The Attorney General must have been aware of the consequences of a person sitting as a judge in a court where he is not entitled to sit as he personally appeared for the applicant in the leading Irish case dealing with the matter, the State (Walshe) <i>v.</i> Murphy in 1981.</P>
    <P>For anybody to suggest that a request for clarification discharged the Attorney General's duty in this grave matter is not just nonsense, it is downright dishonest and untrue.  There was nothing which needed to be clarified.  The Attorney General, as one of the greatest legal brains not just of his generation but of this century, would have known that better than anybody else.  He would have known also that previous Attorneys General intervened by taking action in the High Court and the Supreme Court when they saw the Constitution or laws of the State under challenge, sometimes in the certain knowledge that it would create a serious political problem for the Cabinets of which they were members.  There was no such problem in this instance.  The Attorney General had a right and a duty to act and there was no political difficulty in doing so.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has upheld the right of the Attorney General to apply to the courts.  It has gone further than that and declared that court intervention by the Attorney General is an obligation.  In the case of the Attorney General (SPUC) and Open Door Counselling in 1988, the late Mr. Justice McCarthy stated: &ldquo;It is a power, function and duty imposed on the Attorney General by the Constitution&rdquo;.  The duty of the Attorney General to apply to the court as guardian of the public interest when he sees laws or the Constitution of the State under threat was upheld subsequently in the X case and in the case of the Attorney General <i>v.</i> Hamilton which arose from the issue of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
    <P>When the Attorney General learned that a Special Criminal Court judge was acting beyond his powers and should not have been on the court, why did he fail to act?  When he realised the Minister for Justice had not acted following his letter, why did the Attorney General not apply to the High Court?  Knowing that the Minister for Justice was in dereliction of her duty, why did the Attorney General not carry out his obligations under the Constitution?  The answer is something for which we will forever search but it is certain that the Attorney General was in dereliction of his own duty and that made him as culpable as the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>It is true that under Article 30 of the Constitution the Attorney General is obliged to advise the Government in matters of law and legal opinion.  The truth of the matter in relation to this also is that the Attorney General failed to <Col N="1315" /> advise the Government, having previously failed to advise the Minister for Justice.  In &ldquo;The Irish Law Officers&rdquo; by Professor Casey it is stated that the term &ldquo;Government&rdquo;, when used in Article 30, is equivalent to the Cabinet, and this is the basis for the Attorney General's constant attendance at Cabinet meetings.  Why did the Attorney General not raise this matter at Cabinet when he had not received a response from the Minister for Justice?</P>
    <P>If the Special Criminal Court was not capable of dealing with the most serious criminal cases, it must surely be apparent that the entire Government crime package was a farce.  It gives me no pleasure to say it but the Attorney General singularly failed to discharge his obligations under section 6 (1) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, where he is charged with &ldquo;the administration and control of the business, powers, authorities, duties and functions of the branches and officers of the public services specified...&rdquo;.  The Attorney General failed to advise the Government as the Cabinet under that Act or the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely serious matter because it means the Government was not properly advised by the first law officer of the land, and was as ill served by him in this matter as it was by the Minister for Justice.  The failure of the Attorney General to act in the discharge of his statutory duties affects the entire court and judicial process.  The Attorney General had a responsibility in the appointment of judges under the Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, and the removal of judges under the Judges of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1945.  Traditionally the Attorney General notifies all judges of new appointments. Surely it would have been the simplest thing in the world for the Attorney General to have notified Judge Dominic Lynch that he had been delisted as a member of the Special Criminal Court.  When he learned of this rumour in the first instance, he wrote to the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice failed to act and, even then, the Attorney General wrote to the Minister for Justice rather than taking the responsibility on himself.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is also responsible for the Chief State Solicitor's office.  What steps did the Attorney General take to advise the Chief State Solicitor's office that a judge in one of his superior courts was acting without appointment and that his decisions were tainted?  The Attorney General &mdash; and this is an extremely serious point &mdash; also has responsibility under the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 for determining whether to proceed on extradition warrants to Britain. What steps did the Attorney General take to determine whether the parties detained in prisons on the direction of Judge Lynch at the Special Criminal Court were not also the subject of extradition applications?  That is an extremely serious matter.  Any subsequent extradition of <Col N="1316" /> any such individual would clearly be open to challenge.</P>
    <P>Under Order 60 of the Rules of the Superior Courts of 1986, the Attorney General as guardian of the public interest must be notified of any court applications that involve a constitutional challenge of any law.  If a constitutional challenge is mounted by any of the prisoners currently claiming their detention is illegal, how can the Attorney General, as guardian of the public interest, act as Attorney General?  Surely, in the light of all of this, a serious conflict of interest arises.  At that point will the Attorney General stand aside?  Can he appoint another senior counsel to act on his behalf as he did in the Goodman court applications because of his involvement in that case prior to his appointment as Attorney General?  Perhaps not.  Nobody knows.  The Attorney General acted or, alternatively, did not act, depending on which view one takes.  One thing is certain, he did not act when he should have acted.  Will the Attorney General ask the Taoiseach to act on his behalf as he did in May 1995 when he was involved in another conflict of interest arising from his legal advice to Mr. Russell who subsequently resigned from the Attorney General's office?  In short, who will act for the Attorney General as guardian of the public interest?  While the Attorney General wrote to the Minister for Justice, he did not, if one accepts what the Minister for Justice says, advise her in any proper sense, nor did he advise the Cabinet or the Government in any proper sense.  Nor did he contact Judge Lynch. He did not intervene by application to the courts as guardian of the public interest.  For fear of a further fudge by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Minister for Justice, let me make it clear that I am not talking about powers but about grave duties, under the Constitution, under legislation passed by this House, not to self-serving Taoisigh, Tánaistí or Ministers for Justice, but to the ordinary people.  I am speaking of dereliction of duties to the citizens of this land.  The Constitution exists to protect those citizens and it is the duty of the Attorney General to uphold it. It is the duty of the Minister for Justice to obey that Constitution.  None of these events have occurred in this sordid business.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Attorney General must come before a committee of the Dáil to explain the circumstances and his role in the Judge Dominic Lynch affair.  The precedent has been set.  Former Attorney General, Mr. Fitzsimons, appeared before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on 7 December 1994.  Indeed, the Taoiseach, as Leader of the Opposition, in March 1994, pressed in this House for a mechanism to have the Attorney General answerable to the Dáil on the discharge of his duties as guardian of the public interest.  The Taoiseach, for his part, must answer fundamental questions.  He must tell this House, in justice to the people, at what point the Attorney General learned of Judge Lynch's continuing service in the Special Criminal Court, <Col N="1317" /> and whether he realised the serious implications of an invalidly constituted court.  I have no doubt that he did.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice must say what conversation if any they ever had with the Attorney General about this extremely serious matter during the month of October 1996.  The Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach must be accountable and responsible to this House for the omissions of which they are clearly guilty.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach suggested that the letter of 1 November 1996, written by the Attorney General to the Minister for Justice is in some way privileged.  It is no longer privileged.  We know its essential contents.  We know, in general terms, precisely what advice the Attorney General deemed necessary and what the situation is in relation to the legal advice.  All we are asking for is the precise terminology used in the letter which was sent by the Attorney General to the Minister for Justice.  I do not see what the secrecy is about. The probability is that in the <i>habeas corpus</i> applications before the High Court discovery of that document will be sought.  It is difficult to understand why a cloak of secrecy is being thrown around this saga at every turn in the course of events.</P>
    <P>The letter sent by Judge Dominic Lynch on 10 October 1996 to the Minister for Justice was marked &ldquo;personal&rdquo;.  It arrived in the Minister's constituency office but she says she did not see it.  Those who have investigated this matter state clearly this letter is a mystery they have been unable to resolve.  They say the trail leads into the sand.  I humbly submit that the reason the trail leads into the sand is simply that all trails and all roads lead back to the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General.  The complicity of the Taoiseach is not yet clear.  The dereliction of duty of the Minister for Justice and of the Attorney General will be clear for all to see.</P>
    <P>The people will not be satisfied that the Government should discipline civil servants arising out of this affair.  They will not be satisfied that the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, whose function it was to ensure that the decision of the Government of 1 August 1996 was implemented, should escape scot free.  If the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General walk away from this sordid business we, as a people, will have to abandon, any question of there being political accountability here ever again.  The consequences are that our democracy, which was borne in conflict among ourselves, which was involved in the 1937 Constitution and which was upheld by every Taoiseach, every Minister for Justice and every Attorney General until now will have been demeaned irretrievably because of the sins of omission of the Minister for Justice and of the Attorney General, the failure of the Taoiseach to do his duty and the fact that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare decided to conspire with the Fine Gael Party to achieve their stated aim of keeping the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice in office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> I wish to address the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare.  Whatever about comparisons with 1994 or with any other period or grievances they may or may not have in relation to this party and however much they may not wish the Government to come apart, let them recognise that their duty goes beyond political expediency and opportunism.  Their duty in this matter goes to the root of democracy and is related to the democratic institutions of the State.  In short their duty in respect of this matter relates to the Special Criminal Court which is charged with most serious business and with the security of the State.  That being the position, the question which the Minister for Social Welfare and Tánaiste must face is whether they will obey their constitutional duties.  Will they face up to the fact that the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General must resign?  Will they continue in a Government which has shamefully ignored its constitutional obligations in the persons of the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General?  If the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare say they will continue in Government that is an answer I will have to accept, but it is one which the people need not and must not accept when they are made to account for this business.  As sure as night follows day there will be a price to pay.  The people are proud of their Constitution and their democracy and the manner in which politicians have been accountable under the Constitution and under the terms of that democracy.  They will not tolerate the actions, the inactions, the omissions and commissions of those who ignore the 1937 Constitution.</P>

      <P>The futility of inconsistency on the Opposition benches is extraordinary.  If one drives around the city or the country one will see billboards about the bail referendum urging people to vote yes.  Deputies opposite, including Deputy O'Donoghue who is leading for Fianna Fáil, twice defeated a bail referendum amendment Bill in the House.  We have to listen to allegations of waffle.

      <P>I would like to commence where Deputy O'Donoghue left off, with the 1937 Constitution.  It is a fine document but I am sure it is not without fault.  One of its weaknesses is that we do not have anybody in this jurisdiction akin to the Lord Chancellor in the British system which we pretend to follow.  It may or may not be desirable to have somebody exactly in the role of the Lord Chancellor in Britain who has three hats.  We have an independent Judiciary, which is right and proper, but we also have a Judiciary which seemed not only to be unaccountable but almost beyond reform, at least until this Minister brought forward a proposal for an independent services authority for the courts, something I have advocated for a long time.  If we are looking at the 1937 Constitution we might consider how we will make the Judiciary more effective and more efficient without interfering with its independence.  I shall come back to that point later in my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current fog of Opposition charges there is a danger that the key points in this controversy may be lost sight of.  Serious mistakes were made in the Department of Justice in the handling of the Justice Lynch case.  However, these mistakes were not of the Minister's making and as soon as the Minister heard of the situation decisive action was taken.  An inquiry was instituted, a statement was made to Dáil Éireann and fundamental reforms in the administration of the courts and prison systems were put in train.  Contrast that with the prevarication of Fianna Fáil in November 1994 or during the beef tribunal.  The Opposition is trying to turn this sorry affair into a storm designed at least to damage the Minister and at best to damage the Government.  The plot simply has not worked.  Its wild allegations and charges only go to show the paucity of its argument.  Allegations by Deputy McCreevy about an eminent lawyer contacting the Department of Justice have been withdrawn. These allegations had no substance, yet they <Col N="1320" /> found their way into a Sunday newspaper as the main story.  That newspaper returned to the story last Sunday to question my personal integrity for having the temerity to say I was reliably informed that these allegations were without foundation.  I made a factual and truthful statement.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has engaged in hypocritical flights of indignation on the Justice Lynch case, calling for the Minister's resignation while conveniently forgetting the three judicial appointments during their time in Government which led to difficulties but never even the suggestion of ministerial resignation.  There were four cases of which I am aware of judges who sat on the bench, three in Fianna Fáil's period in office, while not entitled to do so, through no fault of theirs.  I hope I do not cause them any personal embarrassment by mentioning their cases.  It is important that they be placed on the record so that all of the facts are established.</P>
    <P>First, there was the case of Mr. Justice Murphy, who had been in the Land Commission, who I understand did not have the requisite qualification but was appointed a judge.  Second is the case of Mr. Justice Lavin who was appointed to the High Court by a Fianna Fáil Government when there was not even a vacancy in that court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for allowing me to put that right.  Then there was Mr. Justice Mahon who was due to retire at 65 and was not informed he had reached the expiry of his term.  It was presumed he had been granted an extension and he continued to sit on the bench for another year.  All of whose decisions, I understand, had to be validated subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was also the question of Mr. Justice Ruane who sat on the bench from 1977 to 1989 while apparently not qualified to do so.  According to one estimate, he heard something like 54,000 cases, including serious ones involving imprisonment.  When it was discovered he was not entitled to continue to sit on the bench he continued to be paid right up to 1992 even though he did not hear another case.</P>
      <P>They were errors.  In at least three of those cases I am sure their ultimate effect was unintentional.  Was any Minister's resignation sought?  Did any Minister seek to offer his or her resignation?  Did any inquiry take place?  Was there proper accountability to this House in the manner now called for by the Opposition?  In no case did that happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious case of electionitis.  Fianna Fáil, having behaved badly in Opposition, are preparing for the 1997 contest, hoping to draw it <Col N="1321" /> out as long as they can until the campaign eventually begins next year.  It is very clear that under this Minister and Government there was accountability and an inquiry undertaken by two eminent people who within a week brought forward an excellent report setting out the position as they had ascertained it.  Under this Government and Minister there has been a full inquiry into the circumstances along with a comprehensive list of recommendations which propose, in the words of the report, nothing short of a comprehensive transformation of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>For a long time it has been my belief that many of our problems arise not through lack of legislation but from inappropriate administrative arrangements, not so much through a lack of law as a lack of order.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about dealing with the problems faced in the courts, in the Department of Justice, the Prisons Service, the Garda Síochána we should have the courage to place responsibility where it properly lies.</P>
    <P>I want to read into the record part of a letter the writer sent to the national newspapers.  He sent it to me following comments I made on the radio because he happened to agree with me and was very surprised at some of the outburst which had preceded it.  This person is a former Assistant Secretary in the Civil Service, now retired.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>What is going on here?  Attention should be drawn to two features.</P>
    <P>Firstly, Government and the economy have become highly complex.  The best course of action in many issues involves finding the optimum mix in a calculus of advantages and disadvantages.  Because there are not deep-seated ideological differences between parties, there is limited scope for major policy differences with which Opposition parties can hope to engage public attention in a gripping way.  Thus, Opposition is pushed back on trying to show that the Government of the day is performing incompetently.  Meantime, the growing complexity of Government means that, conveniently for Opposition, the scope for &ldquo;cock-ups&rdquo; is increasing.  Parliamentary debate is increasingly becoming a game of &ldquo;catch the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the banality that often ensues has its good side if it leads people to the realisation that the goings-on of politicians are not as important in life as appears.  However, Opposition parties are doing a disservice to the political process in the degree to which they personalise their criticisms, often quite losing a sense of proportion in their efforts to get at a particular Minister.  Many of us are accustomed, say, to hearing people on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and other current affairs programmes presenting strongly opposed cases on many issues without having to portray one another as knaves or fools.  Many politicians <Col N="1322" /> are, willy nilly, stoking the fires of cynicism among an already sceptical public.</P>
    <P>That puts the position very well coming as it does from a retired senior civil servant who is free to present his views and has written that letter to the newspapers.</P>
    <P>While we personalise our debate and behave like parliamentary monkeys &mdash; having paid ourselves peanuts, we now behave like parliamentary monkeys &mdash; the real issues go untackled.</P>
    <P>I should like to contradict one journalist who reported that, when I spoke in this House in July last, there were only three or four Members present.  I do not know how many Members were behind me but I do know there were at least eight Members opposite nodding agreement when I said that, whereas we had introduced a lot of law and more law reform was to come, in my view there was a serious problem with order and that we politicians were pretending to take all of the responsibility when by no means did we have all of the authority to do so.  To follow that argument through, if every Minister had to resign because of every mistake made in his or her Department it would make the job of Ministers absolutely impossible.  Politics has become unattractive enough for everyday Deputies and Senators without rendering it altogether impossible for Ministers to discharge their ministerial responsibilities.</P>
    <P>On that earlier occasion I said I should like to see prison reform.  The fact that a prisons board is to be established is a very welcome development.  I hope we will go the whole hog and take on the reform of the prisons system so that those who enter prison without a drugs problem will not come out with one and become part of the vicious cycle of crime.</P>
    <P>When was the last occasion that this Government was subjected to pressure to do something about prison reform?  The occasion was July last and it came from a Minister in this House; it certainly did not come from the Opposition Benches.  When was the last occasion pressure was exerted for reform of our prisons? It was when we occupied those Benches opposite, when I presented the contents of a joint Fine Gael front bench/Young Fine Gael discussion document on prison reform and sought prison reform and a prisons board.  Why is it that Deputy John O'Donoghue and Fianna Fáil are so concerned about the crime problem that they have erected billboards around the city and country advising people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the forthcoming referendum on bail, having twice voted down a Bill in this House?  Why is it that that party has not even once addressed the question of prison reform, the conditions in which prisoners serve their sentences, not in a manner that will afford them maximum opportunity to be rehabilitated but rather in a manner which contributes to the problem?</P>
    <P>This is the first time since the Whitaker report we have had such reform, for which I thank this <Col N="1323" /> Minister and Government.  It is something I have been seeking for some time.  Yesterday we were given another lecture by an eminent member of the Judiciary who is against the bail referendum and who apparently announced &mdash; if the newspaper reports are correct &mdash; that she will not vote in it.  Many Deputies may have understood the point I was trying to make last July.  I am sorry to be so blunt but I am sick and tired of being lectured by judges.  Most Members have made the same point to me <i>sotto voce.</i>  Judges blame successive Governments for this, that and the other.  Yesterday a judge delivered what amounts to a political opinion on voting in the referendum.</P>
    <P>The courts badly need to be reformed.  They have served us well and must remain independent, but they have been eulogised to the extent that they believe they can do no wrong.  It is true to say that the courts have upheld the rights of citizens on occasions when we have shirked our responsibilities.  This is another shortcoming in de Valera's Constitution. However, it is also true to say that councillors, Senators, TDs and MEPs vindicate the rights of citizens and communities on a daily basis without any credit from journalists.  Yet we do not believe we are without fault.  The courts must look at the way they do their business.</P>
    <P>Some smart questions have been asked.  For example, does the Attorney General not talk to the Minister and do Ministers not talk to each other?  Does anyone think it strange that judges do not seem to talk to one another and did not raise the matter among themselves?  It is clear that this issue arose out of a series of cock ups. Human nature being what it is, mistakes can be made by everyone, including judges, Ministers and civil servants.  What is important is that we use this occasion to reform the courts, the prison service and the Garda Síochána.  In so far as it is our responsibility to do so, the dog must start to wag the tail.  I am not suggesting that the courts, which are independent, are part of the tail and need to be wagged, but they must be accountable. I welcome this development and ask those lawyers, some of whom are eminent, who criticised my comments in the past to consider what I am saying and to look at the reforms needed in their area.  They are members of the judicial part of government and if we are not able to reform them without oppressing their rights then they will have to meet us half way.</P>
    <P>We have started down the road to serious reform under the Minister.  If it took this cock up to speed up some of these reforms then it is welcome.  The Minister has been trying for some time to bring about these reforms and I am glad they are at last being introduced.  When discussing law and order and the running of Government, we should remember that when the Ministers and Secretaries Act was enacted in 1924 the Government's budget was approximately £30 million.  The Government's budget is now <Col N="1324" /> approximately £15 billion and it has a huge number of agencies and Departments.  It is nonsense to suggest that the Minister is responsible for the actions of all her staff, from her driver to the doorman to the Secretary of her Department or that she should take responsibility if, say, her driver knocks down someone. Ministers cannot be asked to take responsibility for every mistake in their Departments to the extent that it is immediately a resignation issue. That is not real politics and the Opposition has gone off on a tangent at a time when the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues should be devoting their efforts to the Presidency of the European Union where real advances have been made in the justice and home affairs areas.</P>
    <P>This issue is a ball of smoke and it is outrageous that it has gone so far and been allowed take up so much parliamentary time.  It is disgraceful that we should have engaged in so much personalised and vulgar abuse instead of addressing the real issue, that is the need for order and the taking of responsibility by those who are capable of doing so, whether they are members of the Judiciary, prison service or the Garda Síochána, so that we have a reformed system which works properly and where social justice is the central concern.</P>

      <P>It was clear from the outset that the terms of reference of the inquiry were too narrow.  The Taoiseach was unwilling to spell out the terms of reference when asked to do so and said they would become clear when the report was published.  The terms of reference of the inquiry were too confined and narrow and the outcome is consequently predictable.  The two distinguished gentlemen who carried out the inquiry stated that they did not have sufficient time to consider the matter fully and were making the report available at this time because they had been directed to do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us action is to be taken, that is civil servants are to be disciplined.  This was obvious from the outset as the inquiry was designed to get at civil servants.  The Minister said the report stated that management must confront individuals who are deemed to have failed and, in accordance with the Civil Service disciplinary code, disciplinary proceedings are being initiated in the case of certain officials referred to in the report.  That is a disgraceful conclusion and it is essentially a ministerial whitewash issue.  In ways it is also a Government whitewash of it as the three leaders in Government agreed to the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> The Minister referred to the normal procedures to be followed when a Government decision is handed down.  It is important to bear in mind that we are not dealing with pieces of paper, trying to find where they went or looking for a paper trail.  Rather we are dealing with the non-implementation of a Government decision. This decision was not taken by civil servants, it was taken by their political masters in Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that existing procedures are being expanded so that important correspondence from other members of the Government, the Attorney General, the DPP or members of the Judiciary will be shown to the Minister.  I held various ministries and, to my knowledge, it was never the case that a letter from another Minister, the Cabinet or any of the officeholders to whom the Minister for Justice referred would not be first shown to the Minister to whom it was sent.  A copy would then be made and given to officials for appropriate action to be taken.  The Minister would be aware of such letters from the outset.  That has been the experience of myself and other Members who served in ministerial office.</P>
    <P>The Minister of Justice's statement rings hollow and does not sound like a factual description of what happens in the public service, which is a good public service.  The only people coming out of this affair with egg on their faces are civil servants, who are to be disciplined as a result.  The Labour Party lined up behind Fine Gael and Democratic Left and stated that it should be written into the Minister's speech that civil servants will be disciplined and everyone will be happy.  Everyone will not be happy because this issue involves many other fundamental issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the vital role of the Attorney General and Deputy O'Donoghue has already alluded strongly to this. The Minister stated that there has been much debate as to the Attorney General's role.  She further stated that the report identifies that the Attorney General's letter of 11 October should have prompted action by the Department.  The Attorney General's letter should have prompted action on his own behalf, not to mention that of the Department.  The Attorney General is a constitutional officer with separate constitutional responsibilities and duties.  When informed of this situation, the Attorney General should immediately have seen the dangers involved and should have acted instantly to ensure that no person was unlawfully imprisoned or detained.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution the Attorney General has a responsibility to ensure the protection of citizens and the vindication of their rights.  When the Attorney General became aware of the reality on 2 October he should have moved instantly.  He should have informed the Taoiseach by word of mouth and in any other way he saw fit.  The letter was designed to cover his back and ensure he could later state that he had spoken to <Col N="1326" /> the Minister and sent her a letter.  The Attorney General is central to this issue because he has a responsibility to vindicate the rights of the ordinary citizen.  It is clear that the Attorney General was aware that the Special Criminal Court was unlawfully constituted and allowed it to proceed with its business.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that we require answers in connection with these matters.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, attempted to gloss over this issue last week.  Quite obviously he tried to suggest that the Attorney General's role is as a law officer and an adviser to the Government.  However, the Tánaiste and Members are aware that the role of the Attorney General is twofold.  The Attorney General's second crucial role involves the protection of citizens, which is central to this discussion because he should have acted on that basis.  We must inquire if he acted?  Did he advise the Taoiseach?  Is that information being kept from the House?  I cannot understand why a brilliant person, who is well versed in the law, would not take the required action in an area of such gravity.  We have not seen the end of this matter yet.  The report stresses that the study is incomplete and more work will have to be done in that matter.</P>
    <P>We operate under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  It is the democratic guarantee to ordinary citizens that their rights will ultimately be defended and overseen by Ministers in all Departments.  I am aware that the Government wishes to hive off a great deal of this responsibility.  This will require careful consideration because, if Ministers do not retain that responsibility, the democratic control of the ordinary people in relation to the Executive and its actions will be tremendously weakened.  That cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>We want the questions which were put to the Attorney General to form part of this debate. Since the investigation is incomplete, we believe the matter should be referred to a special committee of the House where it can be given the time and attention it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is a quotation from the summary of the inquiry:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in this case was a chapter of accidents, each of which reinforced the adverse effects of the others.  There were, as we have outlined above, strong ameliorating factors which explain much of what occurred. However, there was also human error. We have considered whether, on the basis of the information which has been placed before us, we are able to assess the respective contribution of flaws in the system and human error.  We are satisfied that, because of the short duration of the Inquiry and the speed with which it necessarily had to be prepared, this is not possible.  It is not possible either, and for the reasons of equity and natural justice we would not consider it desirable, to attempt to allocate blame between individuals.  However, <Col N="1327" /> we have to say that what happened was quite inexcusable.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has a brass neck to enter the House and accuse the Opposition of playing politics with the circumstances in which two honourable gentlemen, Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy, state categorically that &ldquo;what happened was quite inexcusable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Someone must be accountable and, in our democracy, the buck rests with the Minister of the day.  If this were the only circumstance in which this Government encountered grave difficulty, perhaps one could state that these things could conceivably happen.  However, those of us who served in ministerial office heretofore cannot understand it.  Civil servants bring serious matters before Ministers on a regular basis.  There is only one conceivable circumstance where this might not be the case, namely, where they decided, for whatever reason, that a Minister was incapable of making decisions.</P>
    <P>There has been much running around Government Buildings by Ministers going in opposite directions, chasing their own personal agendas and causing more confusion than occurred at the Tower of Babel.  The ongoing confusion has resulted in the mismanagement of every problem the country has faced during the past two years.  From the peace process to hepatitis C, spiralling crime rates to BSE and the horrific escalation of drug abuse to this latest episode in a series of blunders, where a judge continued to preside over the Special Criminal Court when the letter terminating his period of office had been submitted to the Department of Justice months before, indecision has quickly plunged problems into crisis.  The Departments of Health, Justice, Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Food and Forestry are nothing but a shambles.</P>
    <P>The Government built this castle on high moral ground.  Where is the morality in the handling of the hepatitis C scandal?  It is obvious the Government's attitude is that only women are involved.  I am sure if men were affected in similar numbers the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, would not have used his energies to block court cases, protect the culprits and cause untold hardship to victims and their families. Indecision and stalling mechanisms have been the Government's policy on that matter, which sadly is resulting in the death of women.</P>
    <P>Where is the morality in the tolerance of the current crime levels?  At one time Fine Gael had a reputation for being tough on crime. Where is its decisive toughness now?  It has been diluted, eroded and sidelined by Democratic Left.  Where is the morality in the crisis facing farmers?  The mishandling of the BSE crisis by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, is nothing short of disgraceful.  Farm incomes are being dealt one blow after another by policy and lack of policy.  The 10 per cent clawback in milk quotas is his latest blunder.  If he did not hold <Col N="1328" /> such a serious position he would be a comical figure, remembered for his sexist &ldquo;man of a woman&rdquo; remark but, unfortunately, the men and women who make up the farming community will have no shortage of reminders of the reign of Ivan the terrible.</P>
    <P>Where is the morality in allowing the drugs problem to rage through the country like a plague?  Entire communities are living in a nightmare world where drug dealers openly ply their trade.</P>

      <P>In desperation some communities have taken to the streets begging for action.  Even the most closely knit rural communities are being penetrated by this poison. Where is the morality in the breakdown of the peace process?  When Fianna Fáil left Government there was peace in Northern Ireland for the first time in 25 years and there was a political process in place to consolidate that peace.  The Government sat back and watched it wither.  When it was in crisis where was the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  He was in foreign parts sorting out conflicts in other parts of the world while our peace process crumbled.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from this latest episode of blunders that the Government is not working.  Its buzz words of openness and transparency were thrown to the wind a long time ago.  Under a cloak of political correctness it will do anything to stay in office and we will do everything in our power to ensure it does not.</P>
      <P>Last week the Tánaiste was able to make snide remarks in the House and continue to lie about Fianna Fáil Ministers during the fall of the last Government.  In view of the latest circumstances, how can he justify his stout defence of the indefensible?  Where does he stand on truth and trust?  He has never been, or will never be, the conscience of Fianna Fáil, but how can the people trust a man who can stand over that level of incompetence and failure to get at the truth or, if it is got at, to reveal it?  How can the people trust a man who stands over an inadequate inquiry into a matter that lies at the heart of our democratic system, the workings of the Department of Justice, and fails to ensure that justice is done?</P>
      <P>There has to be culpability when something so serious goes so wrong.  Someone must be responsible to the people.  When the Department of Justice, and the Minister who presides over that Department, falls into such dangerous disarray, the people deserve the truth.  That is why we want a special committee of the House to deal with the matter.  We are not putting the country to undue or unnecessary expense.  We merely want to find out what is at the root of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried in the past few minutes to indicate that this is one in a series of unbelievable blunders by the Government.  It is time <Col N="1329" /> accountability and truthfulness were brought back into the House.  We will insist on setting up a special committee to get at the truth and to have the questions relating to the Attorney General answered by the Taoiseach so that at some stage in the future we can get back to doing the real business of Government and Opposition. Fianna Fáil will do everything it can to make sure there is trust and confidence in our justice system but, unfortunately, that is not possible today because questions remain unanswered.  Someone is hiding the facts behind this circumstance.</P>

      <P>The report of the inquiry into the delisting of Judge Dominic Lynch from the Special Criminal Court panel makes sad reading. I am familiar with many of its statements because of my dealings with the Department of Justice in the past quarter of a century.  A sad catalogue of errors occurred as the decision was passed from official A to official B and so on down the line to official G, but not implemented.  I welcome the proposal to set up a tracking arrangement in the Department to provide proper lines of communication and to update its technology.  This should have been done many years ago under successive Ministers for Justice.  It is a welcome move following the failure to communicate the decision taken on 1 August last.  Similar strategic management and tracking systems for correspondence should be established in all State and semi-State bodies, particularly in health boards and local authorities, from whom public representatives find it difficult to get information because of the absence of a modern information technology system.</P>
      <P>I categorically deny the statement in the <i>Sunday independent</i> of 17 November that &ldquo;Six Labour TDs think Owen should step down&rdquo;.  That is not accurate.  No Labour Deputy made a statement of that nature.

      <P>I know the Department of Justice probably better than most people in the House having dealt with it for almost a quarter of a century and I have had some bad experiences with it.  Under Deputy Owen's stewardship, I have for the first time experienced the human face of the Department of Justice.  I do not say that lightly because I have been extremely critical of the Department.  I found the Minister open, considerate and courteous at all times in regard to matters which I brought to her attention and I also found the officials, prison and departmental, open for the first time.  There has been a sea change in dealing with the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, on one occasion I questioned why the visiting committee reports in the late 1970s had not been published for five to six years, even though the visiting committee legislation in 1925 states that they should be published on an annual basis and that the public are entitled, on request, to peruse them.  I was refused the reports and had to go to the High Court to seek a copy of the annual prison reports.  The Department of Justice refused to make the reports available to me in Dublin and informed me that I had to go to each prison to view the reports.  I went to Portlaoise prison, was put into a portakabin and told I could read the reports but not take notes.  I went to Cork prison, arrived ten minutes late, was not allowed into the prison to see the reports and had to go back to Dublin empty handed.  I had to return to the High Court to get the Department to make the reports available to me in Dublin and it was forced to do so.  That is the type of experience I and other members of the public have had in terms of the obsessive secrecy and <Col N="1331" /> communication difficulties within the Department.  I have not had such experiences under the present Minister's stewardship and I deal with the Department more often now than in the past.</P>
    <P>A concern of mine for the last two years has been to enact legislation for the transfer of sentenced persons.  While I and the prisoners concerned and their families have had major difficulties with the Home Office, we have not experienced such difficulties with the Department of Justice in terms of its response to claims or its courteous attitude in dealing with queries.  There is a new human side to the Department despite the criticisms in this report, which can still be made.  The critical one in the summary recommendation of the report by Mr. Cromien and Mr. Molloy is the failure of the Department to adapt to major external forces and trends.  It has not kept up with the changing times in dealing with the matters under its responsibility in an effective and institutional manner that is watertight and streamlined.  That has led to the mistakes that we have talked about.</P>
    <P>I refer to the main decision taken by the Minister which is the establishment of a prisons board.  It is long overdue and was proposed officially in 1985 by the Whitaker committee of inquiry, a Government appointed body. Unfortunately, it has been sitting on the shelf, despite various Governments being in power since then.  It is an extremely important proposal on the day-to-day administration of prisons which are a huge and sensitive business because of the throughput of large numbers of people &mdash; 8,000 to 10,000 people on an annual basis.  It proposed that this should not be dealt with through the Civil Service, which was never the appropriate body for dealing with the nuts and bolts of prison administration, but through an agency or a board that would have specific responsibility.  There would be far more authority delegated to the prison governors.  It is strange that a prison governor has minimal responsibility for his jurisdiction and cannot make minor decisions with regard to people under his supervision without referring back in all cases to the Department.</P>
    <P>It is also particularly important with regard to the nature of the prison system and the changing profile of prisoners that other agencies should be given an equal footing in prison administration and deal with the problems which arise alongside the security agency.  If it is taken that the primary purpose of imprisonment is to deprive somebody of their liberty and the secondary purpose is to rehabilitate them so that they come out in a better state than when they went in, we must look carefully once the doors are closed behind them. The profile of prisoners has changed dramatically and a substantial number are inside for two types of offences, drugs and sexual.  That was not the case two decades ago.  A huge number of prison places are taken up by these prisoners who serve <Col N="1332" /> long sentences.  A level of services has to be put in place to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Any addict will commit crimes to feed his addiction but that does not mean that punishment is the solution.  The solution is to take steps to wean them from addiction and provide them with proper counselling and treatment services so that when they leave prison they are drug free or can attend an external counselling service if necessary.  Likewise there has been a modicum of response in terms of the treatment and counselling of sexual offenders.  Given that one prison and half the space in another is occupied by offenders in that category, it is time we put in place a thorough and comprehensive set of such services.</P>
    <P>Having initially considered the question of security provided by the Department of Justice, we must now consider the provision of services from other Departments, the first and foremost being a medical service by the Department of Health.  I have never understood why local vocational education committees were empowered and given responsibility for providing educational services and no effort was made to give local health boards responsibility for the provision of medical services.  A range of medical services is provided in the community, particularly in relation to drug offences, but a similar range of those services is not provided in the prisons.  Only a few years ago it was denied that drugs were available in a prison setting and now we are lucky to find part of the prison system that is drug free.  That is part of the changing profile of the prison population to which we have not adequately responded although the Minister has provided a drug treatment unit and a drug free unit in Mountjoy, both of which are long overdue.  Nevertheless, a greater focus on the provision of medical services in the prison system is required.</P>
    <P>The provision of education and training services in prisons is extremely important because prisoners have very little to do.  They twiddle their thumbs in their cells, are locked up and are not gainfully employed.  There is every reason to put in place adequate education and training services.  That is why I would like a prison board established which would give equal status to the provision of what have been Cinderella services in the prison system in the past.  I look forward to the establishment of the prison board and its effective operation.</P>
    <P>I attended a fine production of Westside Story in Mountjoy last Monday night.  I compliment the Minister for her vision in allowing that type of development.  The prisoners put on a full scale production of the show to which they invited the public.  There was a good deal of cheap propaganda put out about it, not by Fianna Fáil but by the Progressive Democrats in terms of the availability of tickets to the public for a show staged in an enclosed area within the prison walls. It would not have given rise to any lapse of security.  That type of development is required to <Col N="1333" /> bring members of the public, particularly decision-makers and professionals who deal with prisoners, into contact with them.  The proceeds of that production went to The Irish Association for Victim Support, which was welcome.  That is the type of development required in a realistic approach to crime and punishment in our society.</P>
    <P>The other major development of an independent Courts Service is also welcome. Developments are required in the District Court area.  I welcome the news that additional courts will be provided, but the courts have too great a work volume with which to deal.  District Court judges do not have enough time to deal with their work with the result that it is difficult for justice to be adequately administered.</P>
    <P>New members of the Judiciary should have to undergo an educational-induction process prior to becoming a judge to ensure they are informed about the type of work on which they are about to embark and that they learn from the experience of other members on the Bench.</P>

      <P>Difficulties arose during the day on the ordering of business.  Fianna Fáil's requests were quite simple.  One was the publication of the Attorney General's letter of 1 November with or without the paragraph relating the legal advice with which the Government appears to be extremely reluctant to part company.  The other two issues were more important.  One concerned the questions we tabled to the Taoiseach in relation to the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice to which we requested answers irrespective of this debate.  It was part of the understanding among the Whips when they met last week that the production of this report would not prejudice our right to have those questions answered.  Unfortunately, the Government also saw fit to refuse that request and to break that commitment.  The most important request was that made by Members on this side of the House to have a committee of the House investigate this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fitting that I remind the Minister of the contents of the document, A Government of Renewal, to which her party and the other two parties in Government are party.  Members of the Government said this Government would be more open, transparent and accountable.  Their aims included reforming the Oireachtas to ensure the various organs of the State and the holders of high office in the State would be more answerable and accountable to the Legislature.  What have we got so far? We have got a redefinition by the Minister and the Government of the word &ldquo;accountable&rdquo;.  They also said they would ensure Dáil Éireann has real power to investigate matters of serious public concern and that all <Col N="1334" /> holders of high office, including the Attorney General, would attend all relevant committees as appropriate.  They further said that they would form a committee of investigation to investigate matters of serious public concern from time to time.</P>
    <P>Apart from reneging on their earlier stance on Cabinet confidentiality the Government has reneged on other issues including this.  In the Lowry affair they said they would amend the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies to allow us to investigate matters in those areas of public concern, but they hid behind the rules of the House.</P>
    <P>On 15 December 1994 the Minister for Justice said, &ldquo;at the very centre of political character there has always resided the principle of accountability.&rdquo;  She has forgotten the fine words she uttered in 1994.  On the Arcon affair, as reported at column 1136 of the Official Report of 27 October 1994, the Minister said &ldquo;under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 a Minister is responsible for everything that happens in his or her Department.&rdquo;  She has forgotten what she said.</P>
    <P>I have some gems of statements made by the Taoiseach but the best one was made on 30 November 1994 when he said &ldquo;every time there is a political crisis in this House this Government seeks to blame administrators and turn it into an administrative crisis.&rdquo;  What have we got in this report before the House?  The report is a whitewash trying to put the blame on poor unfortunate civil servants.</P>
    <P>In November 1992 the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring made a comment.  I presume he was referring to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, when, as reported in the Official Report, 5 November 1992, vol. 424, column 2314, he said:</P>
    <P>This is the Taoiseach who says, over and over again, that the buck stops with him, but who makes every effort he can to ensure that the buck lands in the lap of the civil servants who work for him on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>This was a statement from someone who promised to reform Dáil procedures.</P>
    <P>In the Official Report, 15 November 1994, vol. 447, column 52 the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, stated in relation to Mr. Harry Whelehan:</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether he [the Attorney General] personally saw the file ... [the Attorney General] bears ultimate responsibility for the manner in which his office failed ....</P>
    <P>In applying that statement to this case we could substitute the Minister for Justice for the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan, who appears as his masters direct, in the Official Report, 26 October 1994, vol. 446, column 951 stated with regard to the Arcon affair: &ldquo;The Minister must admit that as <Col N="1335" /> head of his Department he is responsible for whatever action his officials take.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do not have to go back to 1994 to find out how quickly this Government has turned on its words.  On 12 November 1996 the Taoiseach told the House: &ldquo;We need to know now not only what happened but when and why it happened.  Only a completed inquiry will enable us to achieve that.&rdquo; He went on to say: &ldquo;This emphasises the commitment of the Government to make information available and to account for its actions to the democratically elected representatives of the people.&rdquo;  Today the Taoiseach hid behind the procedures in relation to the parliamentary questions</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, tried to airbrush the Attorney General out of the matter.  They tried to say he had no role in the affair.  When the Attorney General was put on notice that there was a problem in the Special Criminal Court he should have acted.  He had a duty as legal adviser to the Government.  If he were my legal adviser and he did not notify me of a problem I would get rid of him before too long.</P>
      <P>If a lawyer learns about structural defects in a housing estate, for example, at a social function and he subsequently allows his clients to buy houses in the estate, he cannot wash his hands of the matter at a later stage.  In this affair the Attorney General tried to do just that &mdash; he tried to claim it was not his job to insist that the decision was implemented.  He was put on notice and he had a bounden constitutional duty to contact the Taoiseach to tell him there was a serious problem in the court and a duty to let the citizens know and to protect their interests.</P>
      <P>The Special Criminal Court is not an ordinary court.  It was set up to deal with serious crime.  It takes away the right of a citizen under the Constitution to a jury trial.  Nobody knows better than the Attorney General that every legal procedure must be adhered to meticulously because the Special Criminal Court decides the liberty of citizens without the right to a trial by jury.  The Attorney General neglected his duty. He wrote a letter to the Minister for Justice.  I wonder if the Attorney General and the Minister for justice are speaking to each other because it defies logic that he should write a letter to her and not follow it up given that he meets her so frequently.  He also wrote a second letter to her on 1 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> With regard to this report, it is unprecedented to ask private individuals to investigate whether office holders have performed their constitutional duties.  It might be said that was not in the terms of reference of this report and that is one of the main reasons we were against the report in regard to the issue of political culpability.  The accountability of office holders should be tested in this House, nowhere else.  The Minister for Justice has redefined the issue of accountability by believing that she only has to appear in the House.</P>
    <P>We asked for the matter to be investigated by an Oireachtas committee.  The attitude of this Government may be contrasted with that of previous Governments when asked to set up a committee to investigate issues of concern.  The commitments in the programme for Government with regard to special committees of investigation were balderdash.  When the leaders of the three parties in Government formed the Government they decided to do what they liked.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Deputy De Rossa have treated this House with contemptible arrogance in not allowing a committee of the House to investigate a matter of serious concern.</P>

      <P>In most other jurisdictions a political fiasco such as this would have brought about the resignation of the country's Attorney General and Justice Minister.  However, ours is no ordinary Government.  It came to office with a promise of openness and accountability, yet it fails a litmus test of that promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue dealt with the role of the Attorney General in this affair.  A total of 16 prisoners had to be released, rearrested and brought before the courts.  The Attorney General and the judge involved sent two letters each to <Col N="1337" /> the Department of Justice.  The Minister, the Taoiseach and the Attorney General do not offer themselves as being accountable &mdash; they shrug their shoulders and put the matter down to an administrative failure.  So many prisoners released, rearrested and brought back before the courts hardly indicates just an administrative failure.  What would have happened if they had already been sentenced by the Special Criminal Court?  If they had to be released they could not be charged with same crimes again.  That little clerical error would have turned into a criminal error.</P>
    <P>Faced with this fiasco, instead of resignations the House today got a list of proposed actions from the Minister for Justice in order to ensure this does not happen again.  First, we are to have the best management, organisational and information technology expertise &mdash; we are going to have computers in the Department of Justice. Will that answer letters and ensure the Minister is responsible?  Like hell it will.</P>
    <P>The second action the Minister will take is to &ldquo;draw up appropriate terms of reference for management consultants&rdquo;.  These consultants &ldquo;will carry out a critical analysis of the functions of the Department of Justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The functions of the Department of Justice are written in our Constitution and laws and we all know them.  We do not need to draft terms of reference so that management consultants can find out what the functions of the Department of Justice are.  That is utter nonsense and an insult to this House.  The first two actions of the Minister will be to get more computers and an analysis of the functions of the Department.  That is very interesting but it would be much better to just answer the letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The third proposed action is that &ldquo;the work of the management consultants will be overseen by a small steering group with secretarial back-up&rdquo;.  They will not be left on their own because that would be too simple &mdash; they could not see to it that letters were answered or that judges were told of decisions.  The steering group will consist of senior members of the Department, members of the private sector and Deputy Secretaries assigned from other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a steering group to oversee the management consultants inquiring into the functions of the Department of Justice.  That is patent rubbish and nonsense.  There is no need to bring in management consultants to find out how to tell a judge that the Government has transferred him.  One does not need management consultants, topped up with a steering group, in order to answer the Attorney General's letter. One does not need all this paraphernalia to <Col N="1338" /> respond to a crisis such as this.  The simple things should be done properly.  Letters should be answered, Government decisions should be conveyed and the business of the Department of Justice should be conducted properly.</P>
    <P>This is all a smokescreen and the lamest, limpest response I have ever seen.  The first three proposed actions of the Minister are the provision of new computers, management consultants to analyse the functions of the Department and, in case they get carried away, a steering group of officials to keep an eye on them while they analyse those functions.  So far we have not got anywhere.</P>
    <P>The fourth proposed action is that management will &ldquo;confront individuals who are deemed to have failed&rdquo;.  However, we are not told who these individuals are.  We are certainly not told if the people who are really at fault &mdash; the Attorney General, the Minister and the Taoiseach &mdash; will be confronted.  Will the people who are really at fault be confronted?  This side of the House has strenuously and trenchantly attempted for days on end to have that confrontation and we will continue to do so. Confronting the individuals who are deemed to have failed is just looking for a scapegoat in the Civil Service.  According to the quotation from 1994 cited by my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, an administrative person has to be located every time there is a political problem, which is precisely what this Government is doing.  The first four actions of the Minister amount to a bottle of smoke.</P>
    <P>The fifth proposed action of the Minister is to appoint an Assistant Secretary in the courts division who will have &mdash; and this is a classic &mdash;&ldquo;personal responsibility to ensure that those concerned implement the decision&rdquo;.  It will no longer be the Minister's job to tell people that the Government has made a decision but will be the job of an Assistant Secretary.  The words &ldquo;personal responsibility&rdquo; are an interesting choice by the Minister.  Since when is it not the responsibility of a Minister leaving a Cabinet meeting to ensure a decision is implemented?  Is that now to be the responsibility of an Assistant Secretary in the courts division?</P>
    <P>If this House accepted that, it would mean that if in the future a Cabinet decision was not implemented while a Minister was at home or on holiday, she could point to this speech and say that years ago an Assistant Secretary had been given personal responsibility for implementing that decision.  It is a classic cop out to give an individual such personal responsibility.  If the Minister wants to make such a change she will have to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act. She cannot suddenly say in a smokescreen speech that she has decided Assistant Secretary &ldquo;X&rdquo; is responsible for carrying out Government decisions.  Assistant Secretary &ldquo;X&rdquo; was not elected or appointed to the Cabinet but the Minister was and she is responsible.  There is no proposal in this speech to change the Ministers <Col N="1339" /> and Secretaries Act, which the Minister should do if she really wants this to happen.</P>
    <P>These proposals for action are a total smokescreen.  In case we are not fully convinced, there is a further gem which I read a few times to ensure it meant what I thought it did.  It states &ldquo;More widely, arrangements have been put in place which will require all Assistant Secretaries in the Department to ensure that all Government decisions affecting their areas of responsibility are implemented&rdquo;.  We are to have a new regime whereby Departments will be responsible for carrying out Government decisions.  What a wonderful, new, breathtaking, creative piece of speechmaking.  The Minister stated she is proposing to take five actions, of which this is one.</P>

The only proper response to this fiasco is for the Minister, the Attorney General and the Taoiseach to do the honourable thing and leave their posts forthwith.</P>

      <P>While what happened in the Department of Justice is a mystery, the approach of the Opposition to this debate is equally mysterious.  It is in a quandary about how to handle this debate.  It argued last week that the period of time allocated to the motion of no confidence was insufficient.  The Government agreed to the Opposition's request and there was a two day debate last week on that motion.  The Opposition almost had difficulty in ensuring the debate lasted for the full two days.  It was offered two days this week to debate the report of the inquiry because we know of its thirst for argument, but it is not happy.</P>

      <P>We all realise that such an inquiry should never have been necessary and what happened in relation to Judge Lynch's removal should never have happened.  The Minister for Justice acted correctly in setting up this inquiry which we all acknowledge was conducted by very able, experienced and well respected persons.  Those who read the inquiry report will see it is quite clear and honest in highlighting the alarming and almost unimaginable deficiencies in the Department of Justice.  It is a matter of grave concern that business is operated in such a cumbersome, outdated and inefficient manner.</P>
      <P>However, the appalling incompetence within the Department did not start when the Minister took up office in December 1994.  She inherited a Department, with its structure and systems, which had been headed by a Fianna Fáil Minister for the previous nine years.  During this time these deplorable and ineffective structures were allowed to grow.  Nobody had the time or the courage to introduce the changes that were blatantly necessary to meet the growing demands on the Department in an increasingly crime and drugs dominated society.  All previous Ministers operated under the same structures and system as the Minister.  They are in no position to throw stones at her.</P>
      <P>The task for any Minister for Justice is so daunting nowadays that it is surely impossible to expect her or him to be a watchdog over the different sections of the Department.  The Minster rightly devoted her time and energy to introducing major anti-drug packages, a major anti-crime package, reform of the bail law, reform of the courts, the provision of additional prison spaces and a root and branch review of the Garda Síochána.  These were her priorities and I congratulate her on them.  Surely the Opposition does not expect that her task as Minister should have been to scrutinise the work of her officials and that of her civil servants.  If she had to devote herself to such duties, the radical reforms and measures she has introduced would never have appeared and we would all have been the losers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been badly let down by those whom she trusted, those whom she believed would give the same attention to detail, the same energy and commitment and hold the same standards as she applies to her duties.  I was appalled but unsurprised by the statement in the <Col N="1341" /> report to the effect that there appears to be a culture within the Department which supports a strong tendency to deal only with what is considered to be &ldquo;my own job&rdquo;.  No Department or business could survive within that culture.  It is lethal to allow it to develop and it must be eradicated immediately.  A culture of &ldquo;my own job&rdquo; inevitably leads to nobody being responsible for some jobs.  This should not be tolerated. Mistakes, errors and omissions are bound to happen without a co-operative teamwork spirit. This is essential because those working in or running a Department must realise that they are running the country.  This means that one job is everybody's job and it is the responsibility of everybody to ensure that no work is undone.</P>
    <P>Is the Department alone in its administrative and structural deficiencies?  Perhaps it is time to investigate the workings of all Government Departments.  It is all too easy to be anonymous within the system.  Once one is anonymous one is not blamed.  Yesterday I telephoned a Government Department from my constituency office.  I encountered seven answering machines and failed to speak to anybody.  New and better technology is no substitute for people.  It should not be used where competent and resourceful staff is needed.</P>
    <P>The inquiry established the sequence of events to the best of its ability but it is perhaps regrettable it did not establish who was responsible for the failure.  While it must be recognised that there is work overload and that some staff have little or no experience &mdash; these factors have been highlighted as one of the causes of the failure &mdash; it must also be recognised that someone did not deem it his or her job to deal with the letter in question.  In a Department so crucial as the Department of Justice, there is no room for anybody at any level assuming that somebody else did the job.  The report makes clear that officials repeatedly assumed that other members of staff were dealing with the matter. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has called on the Minister to resign.  There is no reason she should do so. Would the resignation of a Minister do anything to correct the inefficiencies outlined in this report?  Would it bring about the necessary reforms in the Department?  As always, the Opposition is only interested in resignations, not in improving the system and not in ensuring that failures such as this will not happen in the future.</P>
    <P>The recommendations contained in the report, which include an overhaul of the outdated structures in the Department, are the most positive outcome of the inquiry.  The report makes clear it is vital that they are addressed immediately.  We must allow no opportunity for a repeat of this situation.  It is alarming to consider that the most basic deficiencies within the Department include a lack of communications, structures and well established procedures.  The inquiry team has warned that its report should not be left to gather dust.  It rightly calls for the <Col N="1342" /> political will and the financial commitment to implement its recommendations.  I am glad the Minister stated in the House today that they will be implemented in full.</P>
    <P>The report exonerates the Minister by finding a failure of procedures, an inappropriate institutional framework, weak management, staff inexperience and shortcomings in personnel policy and practice.  The state of decay within the Department did not take place in the past two years.  The Minister has discharged her responsibilities and duties in an able, dedicated and responsible manner.  She has never abdicated her responsibilities, reneged on her duties or abandoned her work.  She has not diminished her desire to create a safer, fairer and more just society.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has sought the resignation of the Taoiseach, the Attorney General and the Minister.  However, it must accept that there will be no head on a plate.  The Minister should be allowed to get back to her work and to continue her programme of reform and action.  She has introduced more reforms to the justice system than any Minister in recent times and has worked unceasingly to tackle the twin problems of crime and abuse.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be a colleague of the Minister, Deputy Owen, and of her record.  The best the Opposition can offer is to allow the Minister for Justice and the Government to continue their work.  It should allow the Minister to provide the reforms and actions that people want but which were not implemented until the Minister took office.  The letter will be debated for four days. This is sufficient time and our duty is to allow the Minister to get back to work.  She should be allowed to continue her excellent work in helping people to live in a safer and better environment than they had in the past.</P>

      <P>I intended to start at a sprint pace but I will do a middle distance jog.  The Taoiseach told the House on 12 November in relation to this sordid matter:</P>
      <P>We need to know not only what happened but when and why it happened.  Only a completed inquiry will enable us to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the same day the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, said she wanted to make it clear that all the facts would be established and made known to the House.  In addition, she said &ldquo;the key issues in the inquiry were to establish precisely what happened&rdquo;.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, said on 12 November &ldquo;that we need to get to the bottom of this saga and sort out the areas where there are personnel and procedural logjams&rdquo;.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, on 12 November 1996, in one of the most spiteful contributions to the House in recent times, said &ldquo;the ramifications and implications of the <Col N="1343" /> investigation would be followed wherever they led.  We know where they led.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>They led to the Minister's office, the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Taoiseach.  The first paragraph of the inquiry's report states:</P>
      <P>The results of our efforts to follow the `paper trail' came to an unsatisfactory dead-end at crucial points, with key individuals unable to recollect important details, or failing to recognise the seriousness of vital correspondence.</P>
      <P>The key individual in the Department of Justice is the Minister, Deputy Owen, who is responsible for the Department's activities.  The report further states:</P>
      <P>It has to be said straight away that the result of our enquiries here was very unsatisfactory ....  In this unsatisfactory way, the trail in relation to the Government Decision ran into the sand.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has been asked to accept this report.  However, we and the people do not accept it.  I challenge the rainbow coalition to consult the electorate because it is horrified by what has gone on in the name of Government over the past two years.  In common with most people, I have observed with horror and amazement the administrative anarchy over which the Minister, Deputy Owen, has presided in her time in the Department.  The drip feed of information on this grave matter has been accompanied by a major attempt to pass the buck.</P>
      <P>The Government passes the buck to civil servants or to programme managers, who were supposed to streamline the system and ensure Government decisions were effected.  The report states that the Minister's programme manager also received a copy of the Government decision. They are paid over £45,000 a year and the Minister should insist that they do something. The Minister passed the buck to information technology.  The Minister, the Attorney General and the Cabinet have behaved pathetically in this sordid matter.  Do any of them have the slightest concept of their solemn duties to the people and the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard enough bunkum in recent years about openness, transparency and accountability. However, we have seen it in high relief in the past few weeks in the House where Ministers, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the leader of Democratic Left have, in the most craven manner, clung to office at all costs and dragged unfortunate backbenchers in to hold up this sordid edifice which passes for Government.  The behaviour of all concerned is disgraceful but nothing to date could adequately prepare one for <Col N="1344" /> the shocking disclosures in the report on this affair.</P>
    <P>Before considering some of the points in the report, we should consider the fact that the two people asked to carry out the investigation in the Department of Justice in a week found it necessary to make nine substantial recommendations regarding the Minister's operation.  If they could do that in seven days, what would they have recommended if they had the time they said they needed to carry out a proper examination of the way the Minister for Justice operates?  I was a Minister for some time and there are no circumstances under which a responsible Minister, having carried a memorandum to Government which was passed by the Cabinet, would not ensure the decision was implemented. The Minister as a member of the Cabinet has a duty to do so.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for Government backbenchers when they hear the Minister has made another appalling blunder for which there are no excuses. How can they defend the indefensible?  There are no circumstances under which that type of thing should happen.  However, two memorandums were prepared in the Department and when the Minister finally received a letter addressed personally to her, she rang an unfortunate individual in the courts division but she was unable to communicate the message that the judge involved was Judge Dominic Lynch.  The unfortunate civil servant did not know about whom she was talking and they got the message mixed up.  What should one think of a Minister who cannot deliver a message in relation to an unconstitutional matter?</P>
    <P>While the Cabinet decision to accede to Judge Lynch's request was circulated to five individuals, the Minister totally failed to receive the information or to act on it.  What should one think of a report which mentions some type of systems failure?  The one consistent factor in a systems failure is that it consistently fails to operate. However, in this case, it does not operate consistently.  Some letters are seen but others are not seen; some communications find their way to the Minister's office but others do not.  How can there be a systems failure where sometimes it works and other times it does not?  It is an appalling way to treat such an important and constitutional matter.  Criminals can take solace from the way the Department of Justice is being run.  If the Minister makes a hames of the most urgent and imminent decisions, not once but several times, how can we expect justice to be run properly in this democracy?</P>
    <P>What should we make of the Minister, Deputy Owen's amazing performance regarding the Special Criminal Court débâcle? I do not doubt her personal integrity and good intentions but she has no alternative but to admit that her time as Minister for Justice has been a profound disaster. From the start she appeared to totally fail to grasp the importance of her Department and the vital need for control, vision and accountability <Col N="1345" /> on her part.  Apart from the welcome plagiarisation of Fianna Fáil legislation, expertly put together by Deputy O'Donoghue, her attempts to further the process of law reform has been virtually non existent.  She boasts about what has been done in that area, but the trail of those reforms leads to Deputy O'Donoghue.  The Minister and the Government have no option but to face the music and the wrath of the electorate before they do any more damage to our fragile democracy.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill arises from one of the many recommendations of the task force on small business which was chaired by Deputy Seamus Brennan as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for commerce and technology.  The Small Business Forum ascertained that if this issue could be rectified, it would result in a saving of at least £20 million to the small business community which would enable it to overcome, to a great extent, many of the trading difficulties encountered in regard to cash flow.</P>
      <P>In its programme for Government the Government gave a commitment to introduce a prompt payments Bill.  Last March the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, indicated it would be introduced in early autumn.  However, in response to a question from me, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, indicated firmly that small business formed part of his portfolio.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe and I then set about drafting this Bill with the assistance of our advisers.  As soon as it was printed and presented at a press conference, the Minister pulled a political stroke by announcing the details of his own Bill at a press conference.  This could be described as one-upmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unusually, representatives of ISME and the SFA attended the launch of this Bill, the aims of which they support.  In complete contrast to what happened earlier, it is not a cause of contention or conflict, rather it seeks in common cause to do what is best for the business community.  If the Minister is of the view that it requires amendment, we would be glad to work with him <Col N="1346" /> to present unified legislation which would have the support of the business community.  This would not be unusual.  When in Government Fianna Fáil accepted Deputy Alan Shatter's Bill while in late summer the Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, admittedly at the point of crisis, accepted Deputy John O'Donoghue's Bill. In the Parliament across the water private Members' Bills are readily accepted if they serve a cause on which there is no disagreement.</P>
    <P>I thank all those who made suggestions and submissions to us.  The advice and assistance of the staff of the Bills Office, for which we were grateful, was also well received.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, late payment is a serious issue.  It is a major headache and never ending problem for small business.  It causes serious cash flow problems and requires small firms to extend overdraft facilities or engage in additional borrowing.  It consumes vast amounts of scarce management time.</P>
    <P>The findings of surveys carried out for the task force on small business showed that Irish payment periods are among the worst in Europe. State bodies are among the worst offenders. Government Departments, local authorities, vocational education committees and health sector bodies have poor payment records.  Only 35 per cent of State bodies paid their bills within 40 days; 30 per cent took 90 days; 15 per cent took six months while 10 per cent took one year. The average payment period in the public sector was 154 days, an extraordinary and remarkable figure which has not been contradicted by anybody.</P>
    <P>The public sector should have an exemplary record when it comes to paying accounts on time. State firms should lead by example.  This would have a significant knock-on effect on all other firms and bodies.</P>
    <P>The State intervenes in many ways to support enterprise.  Forfas, IDA Ireland and Forbairt are committed to supporting indigenous industry.  It is contradictory, however, for the State to assist small business through industrial policy interventions while the payment practices of State bodies smother its development.  While State agencies have thought of ingenious and bright ideas, all of which are welcome, as to how small business can be helped &mdash; I hope further measures will be taken in the forthcoming budget in January &mdash; a simple measure which would be of enormous benefit to small business has been consistently overlooked.</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister berates me, the task force on small business was established by Fianna Fáil under the chairmanship of Deputy Seamus Brennan.  We are now seeking in Opposition to further the agenda we conceived with the help of small business.</P>
    <P>This Bill follows on a number of initiatives taken by Fianna Fáil to assist small firms.  The task force on small business made a significant number of recommendations, some of which have been implemented.  Progress on the remainder <Col N="1347" /> has been slow.  This is highlighted by the fact that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is about four months away from presenting to the Dáil a Bill on prompt payments, despite repeated commitments over the last two years and in the programme.  A Government of Renewal.  The Minister recently took the rather unusual step of holding a press conference to announce that he would have proposals for a Bill at a later stage, although he did not have legislation yet.  I suspect this was an effort to disguise the lack of progress, particularly in the knowledge that we had published our Bill with help from the Bills Office. I hope our legislation will be accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not our first initiative on prompt payments by State bodies.  My party has a strong track record in highlighting and tackling the matter.  For example, in 1994 the then Minister for Finance and current Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, allocated £100 million to restructure the finances of health bodies, who were some of the worst offenders in terms of withholding payments from suppliers and small businesses.  Deputy Ahern allocated some of the proceeds from the tax amnesty to address this issue.  Unfortunately, health bodies have slipped back into their old ways of paying suppliers.</P>
    <P>Our Bill goes a step further.  We seek to address the wider late payments crisis involving State bodies.  The legislation takes up the recommendations and requires all State bodies to settle their bills within 45 days.  No exceptions are made for any State body.  The press release at the Minister's press conference stated that a number of bodies would be exempted from his prompt payment legislation, including Telecom, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  I do not understand why these bodies should be granted exemptions.  I accept they face competition and that some of them have come through difficult industrial times. However, if the Bill is to mean anything it should be applicable across the board to all State agencies.  Why should a small supplier of Telecom, Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta be affected? This announcement bears out reports that Government Departments and State agencies had difficulty with and animosity towards the progress of the prompt payments legislation.  I believe this Bill should be accepted tonight.  I also believe that, had we not moved as quickly as we did and the Minister had not accepted our Bill, his legislation would not have come forward.</P>
    <P>No exceptions are made in our Bill.  Our list includes every Government Department, health board, harbour authority, local authority and vocational education committee; we also include Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the ACC, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Bord Gáis Éireann, Bord na Móna, CIE, the ESB, RTÉ and the VHI.  These agencies are all brought under the terms of the Bill in section 2, where we define &ldquo;business&rdquo; as:</P>
    <P>a Government Department or associated agency as set out in Part I of the First Schedule <Col N="1348" /> to the Ombudsman Act, 1980, as amended, a local authority as defined by the Local Government Act, a health board as established under the Health Act, a vocational educational committee as defined in the Vocational Education Committee Act, 1930, a State body as set out in the First, Second or Third Schedules to the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993...</P>
    <P>Section 2 also defines the credit terms as the period from the date of invoice to the last business day of the month following upon the date of invoice.  This is the definition used by the task force on small business and gives average credit terms of 45 days.  There is a big difference between that period and the average time in which State companies pay their bills, as shown in a survey.  This was an extraordinary admission which the survey did well to highlight.</P>
    <P>This section also provides for a penalty if State bodies make late payments, which is an interest payment at the rate of 1.25 per cent per month on the amount due.  This penalty, which is the same as the Revenue Commissioners' sanction for late payment of corporation tax, will be paid on top of the bill and will be awarded to the small business.  It is interesting to note that, if corporation tax is not paid in due time, a company rightly pays a hefty fine, yet for too long &mdash; and no matter who was in Government &mdash; the State, which sets the penalty for people not paying corporation or personal tax on time, blithely continued to allow many small businesses to be driven to the wall because of its tardy response in paying its bills and liabilities.</P>
    <P>Our Bill offers a major discouragement to stop State companies introducing unreasonable credit terms in written contracts to avoid the terms of this legislation.  This is an important provision.  Many State bodies wield a heavy hand over small businesses by indicating that a business will not be kindly regarded for tendering unless it allows extensive time for payment of bills.  If such terms are not forthcoming, the State body goes to another small company.  Moral blackmail is exercised on small businesses &mdash; the big stick wielded by the master.  They will not even be considered for a contract unless the credit terms are favourable.  The longer the term is extended, the more chances the poor small business person or supplier has of getting the contract.  Last Saturday a businessman came to see me on foot of material I had sent him about our Bill.  He had calculated that he lost money on a particular contract by acceding to the undue long terms of credit demanded of him by a health board.  In the end, he had to give up competing for that business.</P>
    <P>If this provision is passed, small businesses will be able to notify such moves by State bodies to the Ombudsman.  If he deems that unreasonable credit terms are being operated, further penalties can be introduced.  Section 10 states:</P>
    <P>a business not operating within the credit terms ... shall be liable to a penalty of the <Col N="1349" /> higher of £1,000 per day or one two-hundred and fiftieth of annual turnover in the State per day ... Monies arising from [this] penalty ... shall be payable to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the Ombudsman the power to ensure prompt payments.  The Ombudsman already has a developed role with the State sector and these new powers shall add to his office and further his role.  Given the high esteem in which the previous and current holders of the office and the office itself are held, we hope this will pressurise State companies into complying willingly.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman will have the power to name offenders in his annual report.  It will be delicious to read the State or the State agencies which have not fulfilled the terms of the Bill.  On one hand I hope there will be no need to name anyone but on the other I look forward to the blushes which will be occasioned all over the land.  The Bill also requires senior executives in all State companies to certify compliance or non-compliance with the Bill in their own annual reports.</P>
    <P>We propose that the Bill should come into force on 1 July 1997.  This date is based on an assumption that the Bill will pass early in the new year.  State bodies would then have a few months to get their house in order.  That would be better than introducing major exemptions for companies.  I do not know what pressure was exercised on Government to insert such a provision, but it is discordant with the thrust of the Small Business Forum.  I hope the Minister will accept this Bill.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, delivers his bounty &mdash; we have been told there is great bounty available to the Government &mdash; an announcement to the effect that this Bill would be enacted and that the once off costs appertaining to each Government Department would be provided for would be a very useful carrot to extend to small businesses.  The Bill could save small businesses up to £20 million per year in credit costs.</P>
    <P>We will continue to review the position of the private sector &mdash; the task force on small businesses stated that the position of the private sector should be reviewed three years after the introduction of this legislation.  We are currently considering the feasibility of a special court system that would allow for quick, inexpensive and effective legal remedies for non-payment of commercial debts.  A prompt and simple system similar to the small claims court would serve a useful purpose in registering judgments for commercial debts up to £5,000.  We are also studying the small claims procedure which operated before the establishment of the small claims court.  Under that procedure if respondents did not dispute a claim of non-payment within 30 days on receipt of a notice from District Court clerks or Circuit Court registrars they would be held to have admitted to it.  The claimant could then proceed to obtain a judgement.</P>
    <P>All Government contracts should contain a <Col N="1350" /> clause requiring main contractors to pay their subcontractors in accordance with the payment terms of this legislation.  Ireland's Presidency of the EU should be used to designate small businesses as consumers.  That would bring them within the remit of ombudspeople and would give them new powers and avenues to overcome their difficulties.</P>
    <P>We hope this Bill will be accepted.  We have agreed to a very brisk reading, two hours.  The practice is that Bills introduced in Private Members' time are debated over two weeks and I believe that to be an unnecessary, convoluted and prolonged mechanism, particularly with relatively straightforward, non-contentious Bills such as this and particularly when the Minister agrees, as he obviously does, to bring forward a Bill.  We have gone through all the motions and met all the criteria laid down by this House for Private Members' Bills and I welcome very much the warm support given to this legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Government accepted this Bill and brought forward the amendments required, the legislation could be passed early in the new year. It could go from here to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy where it could be dealt with quickly.  The longer the delay, the greater the cost to small businesses.  This is just one plank in a series of measures.</P>
    <P>We are also planning radical reform of agencies that provide enterprise advice to small businesses. I welcome the Government proposal for a funding agency for small businesses.  For some time we have highlighted the proliferation of agencies which give advice and assistance.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government bodies such as county enterprise boards were established.  At that time a bottom-up approach was adopted and finance was available from the EU to promote and establish such agencies.  It is now accepted, however, that there is an overlap of agencies, with bureaucratic tangles obscuring and obstructing small businesses in seeking advice and money. Now is the time to rationalise the 200 bodies dealing with enterprise, including the IDA, Forbairt, county enterprise boards, area partnership boards and Leader groups.</P>
    <P>The message I receive from around the country, particularly my constituency, is that people planning to set up businesses or expand have to go to several agencies to establish what assistance is available.  That creates confusion and wastes valuable time.  When the Minister was on this side of the House he raised this matter many times with the then Ministers, Deputies Quinn, Seamus Brennan and myself and we stoutly defended the proliferation of agencies.  I would have no difficulty accepting measures to rationalise State agencies, as recommended by a committee of this House.  We propose that there be one centre in every county for enterprise information and dissemination of finance.  We also propose that there be only one body providing support to small business rather than the current panoply of agencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> This Bill originated from the task force on small businesses set up by Deputy Seamus Brennan.  Earlier I paid tribute to the work he did in that regard, which is testament to his diligence. Some of the recommendations of that task force, of which this Bill is one of the central planks, have been implemented.  Circumstances two years ago put us out of office before we could come to grips with many of the proposals, but we succeeded in introducing this legislation reasonably quickly.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Hughes who, with other Members of a committee of this House, visited New Zealand and gathered much valuable information.  This Bill is modelled on legislation in that country but is much stricter in its ramifications.  The worthwhile information gleaned by that committee proves that some such visits are entirely useful.  The information also forms the basis for a second Bill on cutting red tape, the next Bill I hope to introduce in Private Members' time &mdash; as a result of recent events there may not be much time left in the life of this Government, but I hope we will have an opportunity to bring forward that Bill.</P>
    <P>This non-contentious Bill would save the business community approximately £20 million which it could use to its benefit.  We hear many harrowing tales of small businesses living on the edge, waiting for the cheque in the post which never arrives.  When they ring the purchasing manager or marketing manager they are shunted from person to person and told that payment will issue the following week.  Very often State agencies and Departments, cocooned in the knowledge that they are Government funded, tell small businesses that their money is guaranteed. Those people are aware of that, but if it takes up to six months or, in some instances, longer to get the money the value of the service or product provided is massively eroded.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleagues, Deputies O'Rourke and Ned O'Keeffe on introducing this Bill.  While it has only 11 sections, a short Bill by any standards, its import will be significant for the many thousands of suppliers who engage in day to day business with Government Departments and State agencies, which number more than 200 in all.  I hope the Bill will be accepted by the Minister.  If the Government is committed to the principle of a level playing pitch for small manufacturing and service industries, the dominant and monopolistic position of State purchasing agencies, local authorities or health boards will become more equalised in the way they do business and conduct their affairs in their dealings with the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of at least two instances in my constituency alone in the past four years where over 100 jobs were lost &mdash; I can give the Minister the details if he is interested.  People were made <Col N="1352" /> redundant as a result of the respective dealings between both manufacturing firms and the company they supplied.  Because that company enjoyed a dominant position as regards its purchasing power it could dictate terms without anyone being in a position to say objectively that both parties came to the table with equal bargaining strength.  Terms such as the necessity to keep minimum stock levels, terms of payment, discounts and the many other onerous conditions that can be imposed by a dominant player dealing with competing firms who wish to succeed in getting their orders placed were all unequally biased in favour of the dominant company.</P>
    <P>As it is in the private sector the purchasing power of health boards, local authorities, Government Departments and State bodies can lead to situations whereby if good business practices are not adhered to and a mechanism is not in place allowing for the speedy adjudication of the debt or matter in dispute, serious difficulties can be encountered by manufacturing and service firms.  Difficulties in the ability of the supplier to maintain cash flow may manifest themselves months down the line when the initial cause of the problem, such as increased bank interest, a penalty imposed by a lending institution or other suppliers to that manufacturer restricting credit terms for raw materials due to slowness of payment for good delivered previously, has been resolved.</P>
    <P>This proposed legislation is long overdue.  We are one of only two countries in the European Union, England being the other, that does not have such a code.  As public spending increases each year over and above the real rate of inflation, Government expenditure directed to the private sector plays an increasingly larger role in the total make-up of turnover of many firms. This Bill can and will benefit thousands of firms, companies or individuals, who deal on a day to day, week in week out basis with the categories of State business as defined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sophisticated computer companies, suppliers of more mundane products to the Government's central purchasing office, suppliers of the many hundreds of items required by Government, Army, Garda and the numerous other agencies and sub-agencies, the person who tenders to supply a digger to a local authority or a potato merchant supplying goods to a health board for its canteen, will support the underlying principle in the Bill introduced by Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
    <P>As an active member of the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services we have received many presentations from representative groups. The excellent report published by the then Minister with responsibility for commerce and technology, Deputy Seamus Brennan, entitled the Task Force on Small Business, has become the benchmark from which to assess progress as its 140 recommendations come to be implemented; to date approximately 130 of the recommendations have been implemented.  One of the recommendations called for legislation for the <Col N="1353" /> public sector as a result of its indifferent payment record.  The task force made three recommendations in regard to late payments and this Bill follows closely those recommendations which have been accepted by Government.</P>
    <P>The task force report referred also to the possibility of similar legislation to effect dealings between and in the private sector.  However, the report did not recommend legislation in that instance but in the meantime IBEC has introduced a prompt payment code to which its membership of 4,500 companies have signed up since it was introduced some time ago.</P>
    <P>In a submission by the Small Firms Association to the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services on 25 April 1995 its chairperson, Lorraine Sweeney, stated that small business people could not afford to tender for health board business because they could not give six months' credit.  She stated:</P>
    <P>It affects the ability of small business to tender for contracts and expand their business. We want the Government to change its attitude and pay its bills on time.</P>
    <P>She further stated that if a Government agency takes six months to pay its bills, it should pay interest for four months and be penalised in the same way as an individual or company who fail to pay their bills on time.</P>
    <P>In a further submission on 17 October 1995 by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Brian Flanagan, in presenting a report entitled The Financing of SMEs, stated: &ldquo;The implications from our study are that the objective of most companies is not growth but pure survival&rdquo;.  In a survey of the accounts of 2,000 Irish companies ranging from fewer than ten up to 250 employees &mdash; the Minister will be aware that the definition of a small company has that range of employee numbers depending on who is giving the definition &mdash; the association found that 25 per cent of the companies surveyed were recording losses and 35 per cent to 40 per cent were achieving profit increases of 3 per cent to 4 per cent when inflation at the time of the study was the same.  Mr. Flanagan described those companies as running to stand still; they were not accumulating any capital with which to finance their growth.</P>
    <P>While I recognise the substantial improvements in the ongoing efforts of the Revenue Commissioners to reduce compliance costs, offer alternative payment methods, etc., the fact remains that &ldquo;big brother&rdquo;, by the force of a huge corpus of legislation, can demand and receive on a specified date tax payments, back payments and employee contributions without legislation currently being on the Statute Book offering reciprocal recognition of the fact that goods supplied and services rendered must be paid for within a reasonable period.  Why should &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; not adhere to the norms well established in the wider private sector, namely, payment 30 days after date of invoice?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> If payments owed to the Revenue Commissioners are overdue by the due date, punitive interest rates, which have not been adjusted downwards despite inter bank rates having fallen to a near historical low, are automatically imposed.  Is it moral, equitable, fair and just that a company can be obliged to pay its Revenue obligations on a certain date while on the other hand that company might seek prompt payment on its invoice lying on the desk of some faceless State or local authority employee whose priorities could be directed elsewhere?</P>
    <P>The attention of many public representatives in this House has been brought to the issue being discussed tonight.  I do not expect it to make headline news but like many items that become headline news, they are often forgotten when the next news story breaks.  This Bill, if supported by the three coalition parties, will further copperfasten the supports which in the past five years have been directed at Irish firms.  This measure will give further indirect protection to thousands of jobs and will introduce discipline and good business and management practices into an ethos where that is lacking.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the opportunity to take on board the underlying principle of this measure. As Deputy O'Rourke stated earlier, if the Minister is not happy with certain sections of the Bill he can refer it to Committee where we will be co-operative in regard to getting the amendments right and achieving the purpose of the Bill which all sides of the House support.  Can the Minister put his hand on his heart and say that Irish firms will not suffer as a result of the many hundreds of invoices or statements which have overrun the 60 or 90 days' deadline and where spurious complaints about quality, standards, etc. are being used to defer further payment?  I ask the Minister to give a clear signal tonight that he will accept the Bill and let us get on with the work of Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of common ground between Deputies O'Rourke, Hughes, O'Keeffe, Séamus Brennan and me on the importance of introducing prompt payment legislation for the small business sector.  It was included in the programme for Government because of its importance.  It is not true that we held a press conference to upstage Deputy O'Rourke but because I had got approval from Government for the heads of the Bill to deal with the problem.  Deputy O'Rourke likes to hop the ball, but I assure her I did not try to upstage her. It is not true either that this would not have come forward were it not for the Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Deputies on their initiative in bringing forward proposals.  They put much work into this Bill and were motivated by a desire to improve the environment for business. However, the proposals the Government will bring forward will result in a more effective Act which will better meet the needs of the business <Col N="1355" /> community and more fully assist and facilitate the development of business.  For that reason I would ask Deputies O'Rourke and O'Keeffe to consider withdrawing their Bill.  The Deputies will appreciate why when I explain more fully.  No time will be lost in bringing the Bill to the House. I am sure I will have the support of the Deputies when it is introduced and I will, as always listen to reasonable points put forward by them with a view to amending it.  However, if the Deputies press this to a vote on Second Stage, the Government will have no choice but to oppose it.</P>
    <P>Before explaining why it would be better to await the Government Bill, I reiterate the Government's appreciation of the type of problems to which Deputies O'Keeffe and O'Rourke drew attention.  The task force on small business, which reported in 1994, noted that getting paid on time was a never-ending problem for most small enterprises.  That is well borne out by the existence of cash flow problems requiring firms to extend overdraft facilities or engage in additional borrowing which consumes a good deal of scarce management time which has to be devoted to chasing debts when it should be devoted to the long-term future and development of the business.  There is undoubtedly a need for a much improved atmosphere with regard to paying bills on time.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of surveys and estimates of the average time taken to pay accounts both in Ireland and in other European countries.  The task force on small business estimated that payment periods in Ireland were 79 days on average, which was poorer than the European average.  A European business survey published in May this year by Grant Thornton International Business Strategies Ltd, on the basis of a survey undertaken during 1995, showed the average payment period in Ireland to be 59 days which is two days less than the EU average of 61 days but nine days longer than the UK average of 50 days.  A survey of Irish companies by Interface Business Information, published in February, 1996 showed the average payment period for Irish companies to be 56 days.  None of the surveys distinguished between public sector and private sector purchasers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the survey to which Deputy O'Rourke referred, showing a period of 154 days, there is some dispute about the scale of the sample &mdash; I understand only 11 firms were surveyed.  I will not offer categorical evidence against the survey, but there may be grounds for believing that figure is an over estimation of the problem.  There is, nonetheless, considerable anecdotal evidence to suggest that public sector payment practices are worse than private sector payment practices.  That is the suggestion with which I concur, and it is important that, far from being a laggard in payment, the public sector should be exemplary and show a much better record than the private sector in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> The problem of late payment does not arise solely from the practices of public sector purchasers.  It is evident from the surveys to which I have referred that some private sector purchasers are also at fault.  It was clearly private sector purchasers who were at fault in the incidents described by Deputy Hughes.  I would remind the House we now have legislation that allows the Competition Authority to investigate abuse of dominant position, to which the Deputy referred.  It is an abuse of dominant position to apply discriminatory terms.  Clearly, in the case of such abuses, the Deputy will in the future have the opportunity to refer them to the competition authority.  However, it is right that different approaches should be adopted, initially at least, to the private and the public sectors.  In the case of the public sector, I favour a legislative approach on the grounds that the public sector should have an exemplary record, since exemplary behaviour is expected of the private sector in tax payments.  Also, the public sector devotes substantial resources to economic development of business.  It would be ironic, therefore, if the public sector were the cause of difficulties in the development of small businesses through its payment practices.  In the longer term, the benefit to the Exchequer of the improved survival, growth and employment prospects of small enterprises would outweigh any short-term cash flow losses.</P>
    <P>In the case of the private sector, I consider that legislation would not be the best approach, at least initially.  Taking into account that codes of practice on prompt payment have been adopted by employer organisations, it would be reasonable to allow some time to elapse to judge how effective these codes will prove to be.  It would also be prudent to allow time to gain experience of the operation of the legislation in the public sector before making a decision on its extension to the private sector.  As an exception to that general principle, I consider that subcontractors on public sector contracts should be included in the legislation.  It seems only fair and reasonable that if the main contractor gets new statutory rights and protection in relation to public sector purchasers, the legislation should ensure that the cash flow benefit is passed on to small business suppliers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the private sector, I am committed to a full review of the operation of both the forthcoming legislation and the operation of the private sector codes of practice three years after the implementation of the legislation to determine the merits of extending the legislation to the private sector.  I see significant economic benefits for business and Ireland generally in the full and proper implementation of a system of prompt payments.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline the main provisions of my draft Bill which I have sent to the parliamentary draftsman for drafting.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the legislation is to ensure the prompt payment of amounts due to suppliers of goods and services by public sector purchasers and by subcontractors on public sector contracts. <Col N="1357" /> It will apply to all public sector bodies.  CIE, Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann will be allowed a one year transition period.  They are not being exempted, they are being given a one year transition period.  This is because of the competitive markets in which they are engaged. That is not unreasonable in relation to those three bodies.</P>
    <P>The Government's Bill will require public bodies to pay amounts due to their suppliers within 45 calendar days of receipt of an invoice or date of supply, whichever is the later or, where the contract is in writing, on or before the date due under the terms of the contract.  These provisions go further than the credit terms provided for in the codes of practice which apply in the private sector.  Those codes stipulate that companies should agree payment terms at the outset of a deal and stick to them and should not extend or alter payment terms without prior agreement.  My proposed legislation will contain safeguards to deter public bodies from seeking unduly long credit periods in written contracts.  In addition, public bodies will have to publish details of their payment practices in their annual reports or, where a public body is not required to publish such a report, to submit an annual review of their payment practices to me.</P>
    <P>Another key aspect of my Bill is that it will provide for an automatic entitlement to interest in respect of late payments.  Suppliers will be entitled to this interest without having to submit a claim for interest.  My legislative proposals which have been approved by the Government and which underline the strong, ongoing commitment of the Government to continually improve the operating environment for business will be a major advance in overcoming late payment difficulties.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties Deputies face in preparing Private Members' Bills.  Legislation is always a complex matter and it is obviously more difficult to draft a Bill outside Government, without the administrative support available in the Department.  I am fully aware that legislating for prompt payment is far from being a straightforward matter.  Detailed and time-consuming examination of all the issues involved has been necessary in my Department to bring forward proposals for legislation which will be sufficiently effective to make a real impact in resolving the problem of late payment.</P>
    <P>To be effective legislation must be clearly designed to work.  The business community would not thank us for producing legislation on a matter of such seriousness for many firms which was less than effective.  With those points in mind I wish to discuss some of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 sets out the short title with which I could agree, as it concurs with the proposed title of my own Bill.  In regard to the operative date of 1 July 1997 I expect to introduce my Bill to the House early in the new year and I hope it will be enacted before the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> Section 2 is a definition section and gives rise to a number of problems.  &ldquo;Business&rdquo; is defined by referring to definitions of public sector bodies in a number of other Acts and Schedules to Acts. This appears to be an opaque way of transposing the intentions set out in the explanatory memorandum which states that the purpose of section 2 is to define the bodies covered by the Bill as including all Government Departments, local authorities, health boards and all State companies, as well as all their subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>I have taken a more straightforward approach in my proposed Bill by simply listing the bodies covered in the Schedule.  Consequently, suppliers will be able to confirm by a glance at the Schedule that their public sector purchasers or prospective purchasers are included.  This will ensure clarity and certainty which is often advocated by the business community.  The scope of my Bill is wider in that it also includes subcontractors on public sector contracts.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;credit terms&rdquo; in the Private Members' Bill also gives rise to concern.  The credit term period is defined as starting from the date of invoice.  This could give rise to difficulties, as the date of invoice can predate the date of issue of the invoice.  More importantly, it can even predate the date of supply of goods or services. This could lead to a situation where penalty interest rates could apply in respect of goods which had been delivered late or had not yet been delivered.  It also appears that, in practical terms, the credit terms as defined are significantly extended by section 5(6) which states that the penalty interest shall be calculated at 1 per cent per month.  This could be interpreted as requiring a full month to elapse after the expiry of the credit terms before penalty interest could be paid, thereby allowing up to 90 days free credit rather than the 60 day maximum period mentioned in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>In my proposed legislation, I have allowed a payment period of 45 days from date of receipt of invoice or supply of goods, whichever is the later.  As an alternative, I have provided that in the case of written contracts payments shall be made on or before the date due under the contract.  This will allow suppliers and purchasers the flexibility to negotiate mutually acceptable payment periods in situations, such as construction contracts, where the simple 45 day rule would not be feasible.  This provision is far clearer and more decisive.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;financial and capital contracts&rdquo; would require a further definition to define &ldquo;capital equipment&rdquo;, as the difference between &ldquo;equipment&rdquo; and &ldquo;capital equipment&rdquo; is not immediately obvious.  Clarity is essential in this definition, because &ldquo;financial and capital contracts&rdquo; are being excluded from the provisions of the Bill and it will be essential to know precisely what type of contracts are being excluded.  The definition of &ldquo;late payment&rdquo; extends beyond definitional purposes by including a substantive provision as it provides <Col N="1359" /> that, in the event of disruption of postal services, other reasonable means of making payment should be used.  I am advised that it is not legally permissible to include substantive provisions in a definition section.  The word &ldquo;should&rdquo; is aspirational which may not have been intended.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the application and the non-application of the proposed legislation.  I have some difficulty in understanding what is intended.  I can understand the first line which specifies that the Act will apply to a business as defined in section 2.  It is in relation to the extent of the exclusions that many difficulties of interpretation arise.  For example, the explanatory memorandum states that large contracts such as building contracts would not be included in the Acts.  The wording of section 3 of the Bill is somewhat different in that it states that financial and capital contracts, including construction contracts, shall not be subject to the credit terms. Consequently, it is not clear what provisions of the Act, if any, will apply to financial and capital contracts.  However, as &ldquo;late payment&rdquo; is defined as payments made after the credit terms as defined in the Act and financial and capital contracts are not subject to the credit terms of the Bill, it would seem to follow that late payment of such contracts are not covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The last sentence in section 3 states that &ldquo;deviation from individually negotiated credit terms shall attract the penalties detailed under this Act&rdquo;.  This is confusing.  Credit terms are defined in the Bill as the period from date of invoice to the last business day of month following upon date of invoice and the Bill specifies that payments outside that period will be late payments.  It is not clear how it is possible to have individually negotiated credit terms.  The provision would appear to mean that credit terms which were different from or longer than those defined as credit terms in the Bill would be permitted.  It would also appear to mean that penalties will apply to late payments which are not defined as late payments in the Bill.  It may be intended that the provision on individually negotiated credit terms will apply only in the case of financial and capital contracts but I am guessing here.</P>
    <P>There is a great lack of clarity in respect of the proposed exclusions from the Bill.  I have difficulty also in interpreting the extent of the exclusion in relation to contracts which include arbitration provisions.  The section states that the parties to such contracts shall not be subject to the provisions of the Act pertaining to the Ombudsman.  On the face of it, this seems clear enough.  When we examine what this would mean in practice, the waters get a little muddier.  So far as I can ascertain, there appears to be no specific provision in the Bill which confers a right to interest on suppliers in respect of late payments. The construction used is that the Ombudsman may impose a penalty interest rate and the penalty shall then be paid by the State business to <Col N="1360" /> the applicant.  This would seem to mean, whether intentional or not, that in the case of contracts which include arbitration provisions, the supplier will not have an entitlement to interest in respect of late payment.</P>
    <P>It appears, from studying the provisions of the Bill, that there is no automatic right to interest in respect of late payments.  In other words, a supplier will not be paid interest unless he or she takes a case to the Ombudsman, wins that case and is awarded penalty interest by the Ombudsman.  It has often been argued to me that suppliers would be reluctant to pursue cases against purchasers in case this might have adverse consequences when bidding for future contracts. For this reason, my Bill will give suppliers an automatic right to interest which public bodies shall be obliged to pay whether or not the supplier submits a claim for such interest.  The House will agree that such provision will be of major benefit to suppliers.</P>
    <P>My proposed legislation will clearly set out to whom the Bill will apply.  It will clearly stipulate that purchasers shall pay suppliers within the periods specified in the Bill, details of which I have already given the House.  It will also clearly provide that the purchaser shall pay the supplier interest each month or part of a month on all amounts due but not paid within the periods specified in my Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Private Members' Bill states that the Ombudsman shall have the power to adjudicate in disputes relating to late payments. This is a matter to which I gave detailed consideration in my legislative proposals. However, I understand there are legal and technical difficulties to extending the powers of the Ombudsman to deal with these types of disputes on which I shall elaborate later.</P>
    <P>In regard to the details of section 5, there is a lack of clarity as to what types of disputes are covered.  Subsection (1) gives the Ombudsman power to adjudicate in disputes relating to late payment which are specifically defined as payments outside the credit terms specified in the Bill.  The section does not specifically provide, however, that parties to a dispute relating to late payment may refer their case to the Ombudsman.  In the absence of such provision they could be unable to do so.  In contrast, subsection (2) allows parties to negotiated contracts to make application for redress to the Ombudsman.  In any event, it is not clear in what circumstances negotiated contracts will be permitted.  However, it seems unlikely that the powers conferred on the Ombudsman to adjudicate on late payment disputes would be sufficient to cover these types of disputes.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of section 5 I find somewhat puzzling is that it introduces the term &ldquo;State business&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Business&rdquo; is defined in section 1 of the Act.  It is not clear to me if the term &ldquo;State business&rdquo; is used to distinguish such business from the business of the bodies covered by the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; in section 1.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> Section 6 provides that &ldquo;business parties to this Act&rdquo; may not waive their rights, as conferred on them by the Act, unless with the written permission of the Ombudsman.  This brings us back to the question of what rights are being conferred by the Bill.  There does not appear to be a specific right to be paid within the credit terms specified nor does there appear to be an automatic right to interest.  In essence, it would appear that the rights conferred relate to the right to refer disputes to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;business parties to this Act&rdquo; is rather confusing, particularly as business is specifically defined in section 1 in terms of public sector bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for certification by accounting officers of compliance with the provisions of the Bill.  I have no difficulty with the principle of this provision and have included a similar one in my legislative proposals. However, in the context of the Bill before us, in the absence of clarity as to what rights and obligations are being conferred on suppliers and purchasers, I suggest the certification process will pose problems.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with penalties for non-compliance. I have some difficulty interpreting the intention of the section and ascertaining how it will operate in practice.  The section provides for substantial penalties in the case of businesses not operating within the credit terms of the Act. However, there is no corresponding provision to make non-compliance with credit terms an offence.  In addition, the phrase &ldquo;not operating within the credit terms of the Act&rdquo; could cover a wide range of circumstances from being one day late on one account to being persistently late on every account.  The level of the penalty is also rather complex &mdash; one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of annual turnover in the State per day or £1,000 per day, whichever is the higher.  Many public bodies would not have an annual turnover as such but, in respect of those that have, the annual turnover would vary from year to year.  In addition, I am not sure I understand the reason for imposing the penalty and paying it to the Exchequer, particularly in the case of public bodies funded solely from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>This Bill would give rise to widespread confusion on the part of both suppliers and purchasers as to their respective rights and obligations.  In so far as I can interpret the provisions of the Bill, some of them would give rise to legal and technical difficulties, while others would fall short of meeting the reasonable and legitimate aspirations of small business suppliers. Apart from the matters of detail to which I have referred at some length, the Bill hangs on the pivotal role accorded to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>My Department gave detailed consideration to the question of providing access to the Ombudsman when proposals for legislation were being formulated.  However, having explored the merits of this approach in consultation with the <Col N="1362" /> office of the Ombudsman, it became clear that the Ombudsman had strong reservations on the proposal.  It may be useful to mention his views.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is a central component, as an instrument of control, in the field of administrative law.  Administrative law has as its focus, relations between the individual and the State in contrast with private law such as contract, tort, which regulates relations between individuals, including corporate personae.  The function of the Office of the Ombudsman is to examine complaints about maladministration in actions of public servants taken in the performance of administrative functions.  In this context it would be possible for the Ombudsman to examine a complaint about the failure of a body within his remit to honour uncontroverted obligations, that is where a sum of money was due.  However, disputes in relation to the completion, frustration, breach or interpretation of the terms of a contract are issues of private law and a matter for the courts, or for special arbitration procedures where applicable.</P>
    <P>The whole tenor of the concept of an Ombudsman is that an inquisitorial, as compared with an adversarial, approach is adopted in the examination of complaints.  Of its very nature, the work of his office seeks to arrive at a consensual resolution in the first instance, before embarking on a more formal investigative process.  This is a time-consuming process and the Ombudsman considers it would be unlikely to meet the requirements of legislation which seek to provide for the immediate resolution of a dispute.  Indeed the Ombudsman Act provides that an examination or investigation by the Ombudsman shall not affect the validity of the action investigated, or any power or duty of the person who took the action to take further action, with respect to any matters the subject of the examination.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman does not administer justice &mdash; which, under Article 34 of the Constitution, is reserved to the courts &mdash; or make determinations on legal rights.  Neither does the Ombudsman make declarations or impose penalties.  The net result of a finding by the Ombudsman that maladministration has occurred, coupled with adverse effect for the complaint, is a recommendation to a body, first, to further consider the matter in relation to which the action was taken; second, to take specified steps to remedy, mitigate or alter the adverse effect of the action or, third, to furnish reasons for taking the action.</P>
    <P>The generally accepted principle that an Ombudsman should make recommendations, rather than determinations, is extremely important.  It enables him to act informally and pragmatically, thus avoiding the legalistic approach which legal determination requires.  As the Ombudsman makes recommendations only, we avoid conflict with the courts, which could arise if he had legally binding powers of determination.  At the same time the Ombudsman <Col N="1363" /> has a powerful sanction by means of a special report to both Houses of the Oireachtas if his recommendations are not accepted.</P>
    <P>At present, in effect, the Ombudsman is the last avenue of appeal open to a citizen in relation to valid complaints.  The Ombudsman Act does not provide any mechanism of appeal to the courts.  Of course, the Ombudsman is subject to judicial review by the courts and a complainant is also free to pursue his complaint through the courts if he is dissatisfied with the outcome of the Ombudsman's examination.  However, any provision which sought to provide that decisions of the Ombudsman be directly appealable to the courts would undermine the independence of the Ombudsman, the very foundation stone upon which his office operates.</P>
    <P>Giving the Ombudsman a determining role in relation to legal obligations would have very significant implications which would need to be carefully considered &mdash; first, engagement by the Ombudsman in what are essentially matters of private law; second, interpretation by the Ombudsman of a complex and specialised area of private law; third, possible conflict with the courts in relation to the administration of justice; fourth, adoption of an adversarial approach in the adjudication of disputes; fifth, diminution of the Ombudsman's role as the avenue of last resort and, sixth, diminution of the independent status of the Ombudsman.  In addition, the Ombudsman's wide-ranging powers to obtain documents under the Ombudsman Act, 1980 apply only when he is dealing with complaints against bodies within his remit and would not be available to him in other cases.  Commercial State-sponsored bodies do not fall within his remit.</P>
    <P>Having considered all of these factors it is clear it would not be appropriate to give the Ombudsman an enforcement role in relation to prompt payment.  Therefore, the Private Members' Bill would not prove an adequate or effective mechanism for ensuring prompt payment to suppliers of business accounts by public sector bodies.  I am also satisfied that attempts to amend this Bill would prove too difficult to achieve my objective of a clear and effective Bill.  I am satisfied the legislative proposals recently approved by Government, at present being drafted by the parliamentary draftsman, will result in a superior more effective measure to ensure prompt payment of business debt.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have outlined the Government is not in a position to accept this Bill.  Therefore, I cannot commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission I should like to share my time with Deputies Mary O'Rourke and Ned O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's attitude to this Bill.  Deputies <Col N="1364" /> O'Rourke and Ned O'Keeffe put a great deal of work into its drafting and nothing the Minister said here this evening gives me any reason to believe he has any fundamental problem with the Bill.  Throughout his speech he made it clear that he supported the objectives of Deputies O'Rourke, Ned O'Keeffe and their party in introducing this Bill.  His only complaint appeared to be that we had inserted the Ombudsman as a type of arbitrator.  I want to make it clear that there will be recourse to the Ombudsman only in cases which are contested.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to some of the words, clauses and phrases in the Bill.  This is the normal reaction of Governments to Opposition Bills, but we put much work into the legislation and if the Minister wishes to put forward amendments, including ones relating to the Ombudsman, we will consider them.  If the amendments are accepted the Minister will then be in a position to accept our Bill.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government has no political will to accept the legislation.  The legislation, which is not contentious, is required for small businesses and the Minister should accept it.  I am disappointed he has not seen fit to accept the Bill which offers this beleaguered Government an opportunity to show small businesses that it is prepared to accept sensible legislation prepared by the Opposition.  The Minister outlined in detail the reasons he could not accept the Bill, but it is his job to lead small businesses and he should refer to what can be done rather than what cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Ninety eight per cent of the 160,000 small firms employ fewer than 50 people and they have a turnover of less than £3 million.  By any stretch of the imagination, this is a country of micro businesses.  Ninety per cent of firms employ fewer than ten people.  Given that small businesses occupy the high ground in industry, the Minister's reaction to the Bill is extremely disappointing. Small businesses account for more than half of all employment in the private sector.  This dominant position requires more urgent action than the Minister has taken this evening.  The much boasted about increase in employment has mainly been in the small firms sector.  Large businesses tend to be net shedders of jobs and employment growth is not created by large multinationals but by small industries.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Small Business, which I had the honour to chair, pointed out that the level of enterprise creation is not nearly as bad as it is made out to be.  A myth put about regularly is that there are not enough start-ups.  The task force report indicates that as many companies start up in Ireland as in any other country in Europe or the rest of the world but the difference is they do not survive here.  It is worth again putting on the record the staggering statistic that 56 per cent of the companies which started up in 1983 had gone out of business by 1993.  We are not bad at starting up companies but we are not great at keeping them in operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> The legislation is designed to keep small companies going; they cannot afford to wait for their money.  I am aghast at the proposal in the Minister's legislation that CIE, Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann will be allowed a one year transition period.  Why should Telecom Éireann not have to pay its bills for a year?  This makes no sense.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, has repeatedly told the House that Telecom Éireann is very successful &mdash; it has a strategic alliance, makes enormous profits and is worth a fortune to outsiders.  Yet the Minister is telling the House it cannot pay small industries.  This does not make any sense and I ask the Minister to remove the provision relating to Telecom Éireann from his legislation.  It is silly to suggest that Telecom should be subsidised by not requiring it to pay its bills to small companies on time.  The Minister's proposal to give this company a one year transition period undermines the credibility of his legislation and I ask him to rethink his position. If he believes that Telecom Éireann should be exempted because of its competitive position then it is difficult to have confidence in the rest of his analysis about the position of small businesses.  His analysis is wrong, and he should have a chat with the Minister, Deputy Lowry, who will tell him it is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Small Business made 150 recommendations which will help small businesses.  About 30 of these recommendations have been implemented and I compliment everybody involved in making these changes, some of which are very important, for example, new divisions have been set up in the Department, access to finance funds of approximately £200 million has been provided and there have been reductions in corporation profit tax.  The chairman of the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services, Deputy Creed, has been doing excellent work in this area. However, much more needs to be done and the remaining recommendations must be implemented.  I would like to hear when the Minister proposes to implement the remaining recommendations.  Small businesses have been demanding for some time that section 115, which provides for a charge on the book debts of companies, should be amended.  If this section were amended it would free up much money for companies.  There have been no changes in regard to the family allowance.  Members of a family who work in a family owned company do not get a PAYE allowance.  This provision discriminates against these people and it should be changed. The task force recommended a tax relief on dividends, but there is no proposal to provide for this.  It is unreasonable that a family member who takes a dividend out of a family owned company does not get any tax relief on it.</P>
    <P>The task force also recommended a special rate of tax for small firms.  It made the sensible suggestion that there should be a 25 per cent tax rate on profits up to £80,000.  However, the <Col N="1366" /> Government rejected this proposal and instead sought to reduce the level of corporation tax overall.  By reducing the rate of corporation tax from 40 to 38 per cent the Government gave a £25 million gift to banks, insurance companies and large companies.  I am sure they were happy to get this gift, but it would have been much better to give the 160,000 small firms a real tax reduction rather than a nominal 1 per cent reduction.</P>
    <P>The owner of a small firm who makes a capital gain on a sale pays 40 per cent tax.  We previously asked the Minister to introduce a sliding scale so that a person who has owned an asset for five years pays 15 per cent tax while a person who owns an asset for one year pays the higher rate. The Government has not put forward any changes in this area and I again ask the Minister to accept Deputy O'Rourke's legislation, to omit Telecom Éireann from his proposals, to stop nitpicking about our proposals and to introduce amendments which we will support.  Most importantly, I ask him to look again at the remaining recommendations of the task force and introduce real changes which will help small industries to create badly needed jobs.  That would show real political will on the part of the Minister, rather than informing us about what is not possible.  He should show leadership by making changes and not inform the House that he cannot make those changes, which are urgently required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my party's deputy leader, Deputy O'Rourke, for her work in introducing this important legislation.  The Bill is narrowly focused, which is correct, because it seeks to tackle a single issue of importance to many thousands of small businesses throughout Ireland.  Members are aware it is extremely difficult for small businesses to survive without a reasonable cashflow.  The State sector has a tremendous contribution to make in this area and for this reason the Bill is important.</P>
      <P>We recognise that small businesses encounter difficulties in trying to collect outstanding amounts from the various sectors of the economy with which they deal.  It is particularly difficult for the owners of such businesses to understand why, in their transactions with the State sector, it can take a long time to obtain payment.  It is understood that the State sector cannot spend money unless it has access to it and cannot take on contracts unless it is in a position to discharge any debt associated with such contracts. Consequently, it is difficult for the owners of small businesses to understand why it takes such a long time for some operators in the State sector to pay their accounts.  This causes terrific problems for the small industries sector which is extremely important to the economy and is a tremendous supplier of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maintaining cashflow is the crucial issue for small businesses.  It is on that issue, and on those raised by the need for this legislation, that a new <Col N="1367" /> industry has developed in recent years, arising from the slow payment of accounts.  I refer to invoice factoring and invoice discounting whereby businesses are compelled to submit their invoices to financial institutions, banks, etc., to raise money on invoices on which payment remains outstanding.  This involves additional costs for the businesses concerned.  There are costs relating to administration and interest, which are charged by the financial institutions, and there are also signing on fees.  An entire range of costs is tapped into small businesses because they cannot obtain payment in time to enable them to survive and flourish.</P>
    <P>These costs are ultimately passed on to the consumer which has the effect of making the businesses less competitive and this is an important issue relative to their survival.  With up to 200 Departments and State agencies involved in the area confronted by this legislation, it can be seen that the State sector has an opportunity to make a major commitment to the development of the small industries sector.  If they were in a position to pay their accounts on time to businesses in the small industries sector, it would make a terrific contribution to enabling future growth in that sector.</P>
    <P>There are severe administration costs on small businesses in trying to manage their cashflow.  It is estimated that it costs between £4 to £6 to send out an invoice.  In addition, there are collection costs, these do not take account of personnel costs, involved in sending out monthly statements, which cover post and stationery. There are also costs relating to making sometimes endless telephone calls while attempting to obtain payment and other costs, to which I referred earlier, where invoice discounting and factoring are involved.  Costs multiply because businesses cannot obtain payment on time.</P>
    <P>The target set in the legislation for an average of 45 days has a great deal of merit.  While I understand the Minister's points about a number of aspects of the Bill with which he is unhappy or that require change, the kernel of the issue could be tackled if there was a meeting of minds on this Bill and if it were passed as quickly as possible to make the impact on small businesses which I suggest it can achieve.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is very important and seeks to ensure that purchasers cannot exempt themselves from the prompt payment objective of the Bill.  That is extremely important because there are those who state that one can enter into court proceedings if there is a difficulty with regard to late payment. That is the worst possible scenario for anyone involved in the private sector.  When one enters into court proceedings to obtain payment, one immediately sours relations with one's client. Consequently, one does not expect to attract repeat business from that source.  Going to court is no answer because it has the possible effect of closing off an option for future business, and business is the lifeblood of any operation. <Col N="1368" /> Therefore, the involvement of the Ombudsman as an arbitrator and decision-maker has great merit because it seeks to leave the courts aside, if possible, and reach agreement before legal proceedings become necessary.  The Ombudsman is seen as fair and impartial and would probably be more acceptable to both sides than the route through the courts, which tends to sour relations and ensures that no one wins.</P>
    <P>This country has a very poor reputation in comparison with its partners in the EU.  In contacts with business people throughout Europe, I discovered they are continuously surprised at the length of time it takes to obtain payment in Ireland.  They bluntly informed me that, if similar payment terms were demanded in their countries, many of their businesses would not be in a position to survive.  Consequently, the attempts in this legislation to address this issue for the first time on a statutory basis is to be welcomed and we should support the main thrust of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is an uneven playing pitch in this area which must be tackled.  The larger the business concern or supplier and the larger the purchaser, the more muscle they have with regard to the terms and conditions they can impose on supplying companies and small industries.  This particularly relates to in-built conditions, which are not necessarily written down but which are expected, involving payment terms, etc.  There have been cases in the private, public and State sectors where advantage was taken on this issue and outstanding payment terms were demanded and expected.  If these terms are not offered or guaranteed by the supplier, the business is not placed with that particular source.  No small industry can survive if its opportunity for business is removed.</P>
    <P>It is time this urgent issue was tackled.  With all the competition from outside &mdash; and inside &mdash; the country for our small industries, I do not believe they can survive if their costs continue to increase.  They need to maintain an adequate cashflow to provide lifeblood for their operations, which may involve supplies of goods, services, etc. What we are seeking to achieve in the context of the Bill is good.  I do not believe the Bill is contentious and I thought it might have been possible to reach agreement for it to go forward to Committee Stage where whatever changes or improvements suggested during this debate, and as agreed to by the proposer, Deputy O'Rourke, might be discussed.  The House would then have produced legislation with the capacity to make a considerable impact on the development and protection of our small industries, which create much employment and which, against the tides of economic difficulty, tend to survive better than large industries which are sometimes subject to winds of change from outside the country.  Small and medium sized enterprises, because their owners and employees work together as a team, can withstand the difficulties thrown up by a troubled economy at home or abroad.  I commend <Col N="1369" /> our deputy leader on introducing this legislation and hope it might still be possible for the Minister to agree to send the Bill to committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach báire moladh mór a thabhairt don Teachta O'Rourke agus don Teachta O'Keeffe as ucht an Bille seo a chur os ar gcomhair.  Creidim go bhfuil sé fíor a rá murach an obair a rinne siad nach bhfeicfimis Bille geallta ag an Rialtas go ceann i bhfad.  Is fadhb an-mhór do lucht gnó nach mbíonn a gcuid billí á n-íoc ag na heagrais stáit ar fad go luath. Tá sé thar am againn gníomhú le cinntiú go n-íocfar billí in am.  I ngnó ar bith anois bíonn duine fostaithe go lán-aimseartha beagnach ag iarraidh íocaíochtaí ar bhillí agus níl sé pioc níos éasca airgead a fháil ón Stáit ná mar atá sé airgead a fháil ón earnáil phríobháideach.  Mar sin ba chéim an-mhór chun tosaigh é da mbeadh an Bille seo achtaithe ina dhlí go luath.</P>
      <P>The Minister supports the Bill, but stated he will vote against it on Second Stage.  I understand that when we vote on the Second Stage of a Bill, we vote on its principle.  The Government appears to be reluctant about the principle of prompt payments.  Any faults in the Bill could be dealt with on Committee Stage.  Some of the difficulties the Minister pointed out might not be as complex as he believes.</P>
      <P>It is well known that many State agencies delay the payment of bills and if there is query on an invoice nothing is done until payment is sought. The person concerned is then told the next cheque run will not take place for two or three weeks.  This can often result in considerable cashflow difficulties for small companies.</P>
      <P>I compliment Galway County Council who has recently placed regular creditors on an electronic system of direct transfer payments.  Government agencies and Departments should place regular suppliers on an electronic transfer system and inform them of the date on which they can expect payment each month.  They should also ensure that queries about deliveries and so on are notified to the supplier in sufficient time to resolve them before payment is due.  Payment should be made on time all the time. Consequently, as well as people getting paid on time, the human resources tied up in trying to get payments would be released to do more productive work.  It is ridiculous that people should have to make three or four telephone calls to get a cheque from a Government agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In allowing for the introduction of a Bill some time in the spring and its enactment by Easter, the Government has sought a free loan from the private sector for CIÉ, Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann until the spring of 1998.  I am sure the private sector will be delighted to know it has been asked to come to the rescue of the Government in funding those major companies. The Minister stated, in effect, that those three major companies, who between them purchase vast quantities of goods from big and small suppliers, will not have to pay their bills for a full <Col N="1370" /> 12 months after the enactment of the Bill.  That extraordinary announcement gives an indication of how bad the finances will be next year.  It is a dishonest way to fund the Government.  It is borrowing by stealth and without interest.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, quite rightly stated the private sector should pay its PAYE, PRSI and VAT on time, irrespective of conditions.  That should also apply to the Government paying the private sector.  If a 45 day limit applies, it should apply to everyone.  The private sector should not be left to the discretion of companies who obviously &mdash; otherwise they would not be given this exemption &mdash; must not intend to pay on time during the next year and a half.</P>
    <P>I am some what surprised the Minister ruled out a role for the Ombudsman in this procedure.  I accept he would not have a role in major disputes regarding supply or quality of goods, but I do not understand why he could not have a role to play when problems arise relating to a properly invoiced supply of goods, for which payment was not made on time.  As one who had to contact the Ombudsman in the past month on behalf of constituents who did not get Government grants owing to them, I believe he has a valid role to play in this matter.  If invoices are not paid on time and there is not a dispute he could approach the company and resolve the matter by acting as an intermediary rather than ruling on the matter. As the Ombudsman's primary role is to resolve delays in administration, it is only proper that he should have a role to play in this matter.  Dealings with the Ombudsman are not taken into account if a person wishes to take a matter to court.  If the Minister is not happy with the role outlined for him in the Bill, it would make more sense to amend the proposal rather than throw out the baby with the bath water because of technical difficulties about legally complex issues.  Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús ba mhaith liom an-mholadh a thabhairt don bheirt Teachta.  Is tábhachtaí an Bille seo do lucht gnó na tíre seo, go mór mhór do ghnótha beaga, ná go leor de na deontais atá á dtabhairt amach faoi láthair.  Bheadh sé scioptha agus bheadh sé éifeachtach.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be starting from the wrong point to allow hang in the air an assertion that, as Deputy O Cuív stated, the Minister has some difference of opinion on the principle of the Bill.  There are no differences in terms of the objectives and goals in this regard.  I share in the commendations of Deputies.  O'Rourke and Ned O'Keeffe for introducing this Bill in Private Members' time.  It <Col N="1371" /> is a productive use of Private Members' time and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, went into considerable detail to show the common ground that exists between the Government and the Opposition in respect of the fundamental principles involved.  Both sides are conscious of the difficulties and problems caused by late payment practices in the public sector for small business.  Not only do they arise in revenue or cash flow terms but they create particular difficulties for the owner-manager of a small business who simply cannot afford the diversion of time involved in having to go after tardy debtors.  This is time the owner-manager could spend more productively on other issues crucial to the survival of the company such as marketing or innovation in products or processes but if he has to spend time needlessly pursuing cash flow his company will surely fail.  These other areas inevitably cause detrimental consequences for the long-term health of the company.</P>
    <P>Deputies Brennan, O'Keeffe and Flood referred to the provision relating to the Ombudsman.  Deputy Brennan, in particular, seemed to draw the conclusion that the only reason for the Minister's stance related to the provisions regarding the Ombudsman.  However, the Minister painstakingly went through a series of problems with the Bill.  I do not expect the Opposition, who do not have the resource of draftspersons available to it, to come up with a perfect Bill but it is not just the provision relating to the Ombudsman that is unworkable.  The Minister dealt with a number of points in his address but fundamentally he demonstrated convincingly that the Ombudsman could not be used for the purpose intended.  He investigated this possibility carefully and found conclusively that it cannot work.  Since the Private Members' Bill so fundamentally hangs on the Ombudsman provision he has no choice but to proceed with the Bill to which the Government is committed. A date early in the new year has been given to the House with the objective of it being enacted by Easter.</P>
    <P>The issue is clear.  All sides are agreed on the broad principles for resolving the problem. Legislation is necessary to ensure that small business, in particular, can expect to receive payments from public sector bodies for services rendered within a forecastable and certain timeframe.  I repeat the appreciation expressed by the Minister for the Bill brought forward by Deputies O'Rourke and O'Keeffe.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that whatever legislation is put through the Oireachtas will be sufficiently comprehensive and clear to ensure it results in a real improvement for the people we are trying to help.  The Minister raised the difficulties and questions that arise in regard to draft legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív fundamentally misunderstands the reason for the transition year in the case of Telecom Éireann, Aer Lingus and CIÉ.  It is not <Col N="1372" /> because of any projected public finance difficulties that the transition year is proposed.  I suggest that he has a word with his party leader who might explain to him why it would be practicable to allow a brief transition period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disappointing that we differ so much on the small print of the Bill because Minister accepts it in principle and admires the initiative of those who drafted it.  I was impressed at the Fianna Fáil press conference led by Deputy Leader, Deputy O'Rourke, by the number of people who turned out and complimented her on the Bill and its necessity. The Minister must be aware of the demand for the immediate drafting and implementation of a Bill.  I was disappointed with the way he went through it section by section.  He was probably seeking information on the terms of reference for the Government Bill.  For that reason he should be magnanimous and accept this Bill.  This legislation deals with business matters and as his colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, said is important and necessary.  The options are limited and I urge him at this late hour to concede and put this Bill in place by having it discussed at the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy.  That would be worthwhile as we would be seen to defend small business.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has a justly proud history of holding office in the Departments of this state.  A major consequence is that each Department has pushed out its parameters, has implemented innovative policies, and has become more user friendly to the citizen.  I confidently assert that every party in this House would acknowledge that the Fianna Fáil Party, because of its sense of duty, has balanced such responsibility with upholding the rights and livelihoods of those in small businesses and on small farms.  It has always appreciated that such enterpreneurs are the backbone of our economy.  The deputy leader of the party, Deputy O'Rourke and myself, initiated the Prompt Payments Bill, 1996, in the hope that the rainbow Government will follow this example and approach the financial relationships between the private and the public sector in a balanced way.</P>
      <P>This Bill will assist and develop business by restricting unreasonable credit terms, and it will also further assist and develop business by providing in law for penalties on excessively late payments by State organisations.  It will facilitate, harmonise and put on a statutory basis, the payment procedures of a State business on foot of a contract to another party.  A &ldquo;business&rdquo; means a Government Department or associated agency and refers to the health boards, the vocational education committees, the commercial or non commercial State-sponsored bodies, and all associated and subsidiary companies.  The final figure comes to over 200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of paramount importance that the financial dealings between the public and private sector should be kept on an efficient and co-operative <Col N="1373" /> level.  We are all aware of how successfully the economy operates on a macro level while guided by the income policies initiated by the social partners.  This partnership, consisting of the Government, farmers, trade unions and employer groups, has developed from the <i>ad hoc</i> collective bargaining of the 1970s, through to the national wage agreements and national understandings which culminates today in the formalised and effective system, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is aware that such success is only possible if the micro-economic details, such as prompt payments are in proper functioning order. As the rainbow Government is at present negotiating the next national programme, it has an opportunity to act in the national interest by accepting this Bill.  It is acknowledged that our party Leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, as a former Minister for Labour and Minister for Finance, helped to establish the success of this exemplary system of negotiation.  I cannot over-emphasise that such partnership at a national level can continue into the 21st century only by catering for this co-operation in a responsible manner.  Fianna Fáil believes that the Prompt Payments Bill, 1996, will serve in such co-operation.  This Bill takes up the recommendations of the Task Force on Small Business which requires all public sector bodies to settle their bills by the last business day of the month following the date of invoice.  This gives an average credit period of 45 days to public sector bodies, although some bodies could get up to 60 days credit.  Amazingly, some public sector bodies can take up to 154 days to settle their accounts.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts the Bill, it will be operable by summer 1997.  We envisage that certain State organisation may be affected by cashflow problems as a consequence of it.  In 1991 when Deputy Bertie Ahern was Minister for Finance, he allocated £100 million to alleviate the cash flow problems facing health boards, larnrod Éireann and other semi-State organisations to clear existing debts for consumer goods and essential services.  We recommend that the Minister should prepare similar such contingency plans in the form of available funds to certain semi-State organisations, where appropriate, to exploit the application of this legislation.  We have heard a good deal about the funds that will be available for distribution in 1997.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, to make some of that money available.  That would accord with good business practice.  Such moneys would help bodies, such as CIE, Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann, to which he wants a transition period to apply.  I wonder why those three were selected given that, say, health boards face more serious problems because of their bad financial management.</P>
    <P>A major consequence of the enactment of this Bill will be the greater financial management of the semi-State sector.  It will be necessary now and in the future for proper accounting procedures and figure displays to be adhered to, <Col N="1374" /> akin to the format and style of any modern private business.  That will complement section 3 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, which provides for the legislative base of Article 33 of the Constitution. That article provides for the Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We should reflect and consider the cost of credit for small and medium-sized enterprises. For many firms, waiting for payment can account for a significant proportion of their profits. According to the enterprise association, ISME, the annual cost to Irish owned manufacturers of financing their overdue credit payments is estimated at about £79 million.  Further, improved payment rates within the public sector could improve the cash flow of businesses by more than £160 million and reduce their financial costs by about £16 million per annum.  The unfortunate reality is that local authorities, commercial semi-State companies and health boards are almost invariably cited as the slowest payers.  I refer Members to the Small Business Task Force Report, 1994 and the ISME survey, September 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 5(5), (6), (7) and (8) attempt to address the problems of late payments by public sector organisations to suppliers by imposing an extra 1 per cent per month, or the rate of interest being charged by the Revenue Commissioners, whichever is the higher.  Section 5 gives the Ombudsman all the necessary powers to adjudicate in disputes arising from late payments. While the Minister has surprisingly made a big issue of the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman Act, 1980 can be changed by order or by an amendment.  Part I of the First Schedule of the Act outlines the Departments and the Second Schedule outlines the various State agencies, including the semi-State sector.  I fail to understand why the Minister does not agree that the office of the Ombudsman is the ideal vehicle for the lodgement of complaints and the Ombudsman should adjudicate on late payments.</P>
    <P>A role for the Ombudsman would ensure that a settlement process would be equitable and impartial and thus bring about a speedy and cost effective solution to a complaint.  If a business makes late payments, it should be liable to penalties as specified in the Bill and listed by the Ombudsman in his annual report. Notwithstanding that, it is necessary to provide additional resources for his office.</P>
    <P>I am aware and fully endorse the Forum on Public Procurement in Ireland established in August of this year.  That forum will deal with the demands from players on both sides of the public procurement market for the establishment of a common forum to tackle issues of mutual concern and agree a consensus approach.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the cost of credit today is substantial in any business and small business <Col N="1375" /> people have difficulties in regard to bank borrowing and trying to secure extended credit to finance late payments.  We must also recognise that the volume of trade in the semi-State, other State and public sectors is enormous compared to the levels in other countries.  We are very dependent on the public sector.  We must consider the cost of administration including the cost of postage and telephone calls which leads to inefficiency, particularly in small businesses.  It also leads to stress and strain on management. While small businesses are the way forward in terms of job creation, it is important that the Government gives a lead in that regard.  The Opposition has been to the forefront on this issue.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that on 6 November the Minister issued a rushed press announcement claiming a major advance for business, especially small business.  It states &ldquo;Mr. Richard Bruton, T.D., Minister for Enterprise and Employment, announced today (Wednesday 6th November 1996) that the Government has given formal approval to his proposals for the drafting of a Prompt Payment Bill&rdquo;.  The Minister issued that on the eve of the day the deputy leader of the Fianna Fáil Party put forward her Bill, details of which were known at that stage.</P>

      <P>I am not running out of notes. I have plenty of information for the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>There was reference to the number of State agencies.  The 40 county enterprise boards have a role to play in the development of small businesses.  They do not appear to be compatible in their decisions. Some are more strict in their funding and assistance to small businesses.  A co-ordinated approach should be adopted in that area.  The main problem concerns the management of the representatives of the boards, but there is also a lack of uniformity among the boards.  That is regrettable because those boards are a good vehicle for the development of business and for providing assistance to small businesses.  They should be fine combed and their areas of weakness teased out.  The conglomeration of State agencies inhibits rather than assists development.  We should examine agencies in the financial and other areas.  I compliment my Deputy Leader for being to the forefront in admitting we have too many agencies, that they inhibit development and they should operate as a type of one stop shop.</P>
      <P>Regarding the State sector, the related but different issue of public procurement procedures should not suffer from staff shortages to aid the implementation of this Bill.  Staff in the public sector may require adequate support to properly execute the application of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the Bill will greatly improve credit management in the State sector.  The immediate benefits to be gained by all players concerned will be an improved cash flow, increased certainty, lower costs, greater capacity to finance growth and lower exposure to possible bad debts.</P>

      <P>As Opposition spokesperson on Health, I have raised health insurance matters on as many as ten occasions in the past year in this House.  Apart from hepatitis C, there is no other health issue that generates as much comment in this House.</P>
      <P>During those debates I have been sharply critical of the VHI and have expressed alarm at the level of premium increases &mdash; 54 per cent over ten years and 35 per cent over the past four years, including a recent increase of 6 per cent &mdash; at a time when inflation was running at under 2 per cent per year.  The increases have led me to coin the expression that instead of VHI standing for Voluntary Health Insurance, it stands for very high insurance.</P>
      <P>I have also raised concern about the absence of a statutory council to represent consumers of health insurance and the VHI's row with private hospitals.  Two other issues that I have raised are directly related to this debate.</P>
      <P>In October 1995 the then chief executive of the VHI said in a speech that the organisation was considering charging higher premiums to people who joined at older ages.  I made it clear that this discrimination would not be accepted by Fianna Fáil and that we would oppose any cherrypicking of younger customers.  We are strongly committed to the concept of inter-generational solidarity. The VHI backed off any such plan claiming that the chief executive was thinking aloud and that such a thing could not happen because of the principle of community rating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil raised this matter on Committee Stage of the VHI Bill on 14 December 1995 at the Select Committee on Social Affairs the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated: &ldquo;I assure older subscribers that they will be treated on an equitable basis with all other subscribers as heretofore&rdquo;.  He also said that under the Health Insurance Act, 1994 it would be <Col N="1379" /> illegal for the VHI to depart from the principle of community rating which ensures that all subscribers are treated the same, regardless of age or medical condition.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I demanded a debate on the health insurance regulations made under the terms of the 1994 Act.  I was concerned about certain matters in the regulations, including cover for psychiatric patients and outpatient cover.  The Minister insisted that the status quo would apply with community rating.  Following their introduction, it was announced that the British health insurer, BUPA, was entering the Irish market.  I welcomed this announcement and said it was my hope that competition would be good for health insurance consumers.</P>
    <P>Yesterday BUPA announced its various health insurance schemes and packages and said that the company's philosophy was about care, cure and choice.  In its documentation it states that its essential scheme is community-rated.  However, the company also has cash plans where costs vary according to the buyer's age.  It is reported today that these plans bypass community rating and are not covered under the health insurance regulations.  If so, this discrimination on age grounds is a serious threat to community rating.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister who acts as regulator of the health insurance industry, to clarify the position in relation to these plans.  Do they infringe the community rating principle?  Do they comply with the terms of the 1994 Act and, if not, what does the Minister intend to do?  Does he plan to intervene and, if so, how, when and why?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy is an important, complex and sensitive one which needs to be approached in a considered way.  As the Minister said in a previous Adjournment debate, our community-rated health insurance system has provided considerable benefit to our population.  The principle of community rating and its preservation in our health insurance system is regarded as so vital that it has been enshrined in law.  This step was taken to maintain the essential traditional values of our system in the new competitive market environment following on the EU third non-life insurance directive.  The relevant legislation comprises the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which came into effect on 30 June 1994 and the health insurance regulations signed by the Minister on 28 March this year.  The Act defined the broad principles which were elaborated on in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provided for the prohibition of non community-rated health insurance contracts with provisions covering open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefits and the establishment and operation of a risk equalisation scheme between registered insurers.  The latter mechanism was put in place specifically to support community rating, provide stability in the <Col N="1380" /> market and ensure no insurer would suffer from a worse than average risk profile because of preferred risk selection by other insurers.  The British United Provident Association, is a registered health insurer under the Act.  It is the only insurance undertaking from inside or outside the State which so far has entered our health insurance market as a competitor to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  The Minister for Health is aware this development has been widely and genuinely welcomed.  It adds a new dimension which has the potential to benefit our market.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, BUPA &mdash; which had been working since April last to set up operations here through its branch BUPA (Ireland) &mdash; launched the schemes on which it has decided to conduct business here.  Insurance cover for BUPA subscribers will commence on 1 January 1997. The Department now has the opportunity, as part of its normal regulatory function, to consider the contents of BUPA schemes.  It commenced this process in conjunction with its consultant insurance advisers yesterday afternoon, immediately upon receiving the documentation published by BUPA.  Should it be considered on completion of the process that there are matters which warrant clarification or discussion of the schemes, the Department will raise these with BUPA immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health does not intend either making judgments or rushing to conclusions until the matter has been carefully gone into and fully assessed.  He wants to re-iterate, however, that community rating is a core value of our system which Governments have taken specific legal steps to maintain.  The Minister also wants it to be abundantly clear that our commitment is to a competitive market developed in accordance with our core values and not one that is operated by way of immediate intervention by Government unless this is found to be necessary to maintain the integrity of the regulatory framework.</P>

      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the recent flooding in Shandon Court, Cork, which caused devastation for residents of the surrounding area.  The position was vividly brought home by a resident who made a video of the flooding caused by a burst main.  Some national newspapers showed pictures of firemen breaking open a door with a hatchet and water flowing out.  This was a devastating experience for the local residents. Will the Minister indicate to the House what arrangements have been made with Cork Corporation and if the Department will supply <Col N="1381" /> urgent funding necessary to allow the corporation to make arrangements with the residents.</P>
      <P>Homes both old and new have been destroyed. Some residents are interested in returning to their homes, others are not.  Some are young people or have young families, others are old people who have lived there all their lives.  They have been disrupted by something outside their control.  I pay tribute to the Southern Health Board and Cork Corporation for their efforts to assist and support these people, many of whom have lived in hotels for the past few weeks because the financial arrangements have not been agreed with the corporation.  I ask the Minister to indicate to the House what contact has been made with the management of Cork Corporation to ensure that matters can be finalised as quickly as possible. Local Deputies have had meetings with the residents, some of whom are angry and feel that proper priority has not been given to the matter. At this time of year, heading into Christmas, we owe them help.  Something happened outside their control which wrecked their homes.  If it had happened a few hours earlier there would have been loss of life &mdash; we were lucky that the main burst at about 8 a.m. and that many people were awake.  It was devastating to see it.  I appeal to the Minister to indicate that the Department will provide the necessary resources to allow Cork Corporation to proceed as quickly as possible to get these people's lives back in order, because they have gone through a traumatic time.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Wallace for allowing me time; we co-operated on this matter as we are from the same constituency.  The Deputy has outlined the circumstances in which the people of Shandon Court and Shandon View now find themselves.  To give an indication of the force of water involved, one must remember that Cork is known for its hills and these two estates are situated on Fever Hospital Hill.  One can imagine the pressure necessary to drive the water from the city basin to Mayfield and the pipe fractured where the pressure was most acute.  It left a crater four feet deep and ten feet wide across the road.  The volume of water entered houses under that pressure and literally washed all the residents' belongings through the points of least resistance such as windows and back doors. Elderly people who had purchased the houses when they first married and still lived there in their 80s now find themselves homeless.  Young families have had to move from their first homes and find a new home in rented accommodation before Christmas.  Most of the elderly are living with friends and families, so in that way they are not as badly affected, but they are all extremely upset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar funding to that provided for last year's flooding in the west of Ireland should be given to Cork Corporation.  That local authority is not wealthy, it has been underfunded for years.  We must ensure that the people most affected will be cared for, as the corporation wants to do.  I appeal <Col N="1382" /> to the Minister to ensure not alone that the funding is made available but that it is provided speedily, so that the trauma these people have endured can stop.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to reply on behalf of the Minister for the Environment who is not available, and to explain the Department's position on this incident.  Before doing so, I offer my sympathy to the householders in Cork whose homes were severely flooded on Monday 4 November when the 18 inch water main serving Mayfield burst at a point near the top of the steps of the Fever Hospital.  As the Deputies from north Cork will be aware, the operation and maintenance of water supplies is a matter for the local authority concerned, in this instance Cork Corporation.  The Department has no direct function in the matter.  However, in accordance with normal practice, corporation officials have kept the Department generally informed concerning the incident.  On the basis of the information supplied by the corporation, I will outline briefly to the House what happened and the response to the incident.</P>
      <P>The first notification that something was wrong was received just after 7 a.m. on the morning of November 4 on Cork Fire Brigade's emergency phone number.  The fire brigade and the corporation's water works staff responded immediately to the call and were quickly on the scene.  There was a huge flow of water from the burst pipe and it was being held in check by the houses at Shandon Court and Shandon View Cottages.  The corporation's immediate concern on discovering the break was to shut-off the water to the burst section and this was done safely within an hour, with no further pipes being broken.  This served to minimise the potentially highly destructive impact of the burst but even with quick action, the corporation estimates that 2.4 million gallons of water escaped from the burst main.</P>
      <P>Because the burst had occurred high on the hill above Shandon Court and Shandon View Cottages, the escaping water cascaded down towards the houses, damaging them.  The occupants of the houses were evacuated and Cork Corporation arranged temporary accommodation for those requiring it.  I understand from Cork Corporation that it has already settled some compensation claims submitted by affected householders and will examine and deal as quickly and sympathetically as possible with any further claims lodged by householders whose homes have been damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the health board rather than the Department which has funds to provide assistance in the case of flooding.  There are no special funds available to the Department to provide assistance to householders who have to leave their homes due to flooding, however caused.  The health board may, however, assist by <Col N="1383" /> way of a rent allowance or otherwise under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This assistance may be made available to households who would not normally be eligible for assistance under that scheme if they have a particularly urgent need.  It is also open to the health board, in necessitous cases, to provide assistance to elderly householders through the task force on special housing aid for the elderly to remedy damage to their homes.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the community welfare office in Cork has acted quickly to provide assistance to the victims of flooding in this instance.  On the day of the flooding a special clinic was set up in the area to provide assistance to those who sought it and a community welfare officer has been specially assigned to deal with the matter.  The health board is also assisting, as necessary, with rent and other costs that victims of the flooding might have to pay in the short-term.</P>
    <P>The corporation has undertaken surveys of the structural condition of the houses damaged in the flooding to establish that their stability is not affected.  In addition, it has taken urgent action to eliminate the consequential dampness in the houses with a view to making them habitable again as soon as possible.  Dehumidifiers were installed as soon as possible after the flooding and, having achieved their purpose, are now being taken out.  It is hoped it will be possible for householders to return to their homes shortly &mdash; I appreciate the concern expressed by the Deputies that families would like to return home before Christmas.</P>
    <P>This was a very unfortunate and unusual incident.  While no emergency response action by public authorities could alleviate the trauma and inconvenience suffered by the residents, we can be satisfied that the bodies with first-line responsibilities acted promptly and with compassion &mdash; I wish to put my appreciation of that on the record of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise the issue of the development plan for Sligo Regional Technical College and the refusal by the Government to provide matching funds for the college's £5.2 million project to upgrade the college to full university status.  The college drew up a comprehensive expansion and development plan designed to provide for the ever-increasing demands on facilities and the wide range of excellent courses offered.  The college authorities very wisely and sensibly put this plan together to equip the college for the challenges and <Col N="1384" /> opportunities of the 21st century and the technological revolution which is expected to accelerate with the passing of each academic year. I fully support Sligo Regional Technical College in its plans to upgrade the college.</P>
      <P>The Government White Paper on Education, published last year, had as one of its objectives the expansion and development of regional technical colleges.  Sligo Regional Technical College has a pivotal role in third level education, particularly in the north west.  It ranks fourth in size among regional technical colleges, with a first year enrolment of more than 1,000 students in the current year.  How can the Government claim on the one hand that central to its policy is the expansion of the role and function of regional technical colleges while on the other hand it refuses to come up with matching funds to enable the development of Sligo Regional Technical College to proceed?</P>
      <P>The building projects under threat are the administration-library block and the business innovation centre, both of which are essential to meet the growing demands of a student population which now totals 2,500.  The college is grossly overcrowded and the region is at risk of losing students to other colleges, which it can ill afford.  This project would benefit the north-west region immensely, directly and indirectly.  Not only would it provide much needed college spaces for students, it would also provide much needed employment inside and outside the college in a region that is an unemployment black spot and suffers from the disadvantage of being a peripheral area.</P>
      <P>The failure of the Government to put up matching funds will inevitably mean that a substantial amount of Structural Funds will be lost, which is inexcusable.  It can only damage our standing and image in Europe and very probably weaken our case for similar funding in the future. If Exchequer funding of approximately £2 million is not forthcoming, the £3 million EU Structural Funds and IFI funding already approved for the project could be diverted elsewhere.  All the community organisations concerned are stunned by this shock news and I share their deep concern.</P>
      <P>A new administration-library block is an absolute necessity.  The college staff are doing their utmost in extremely difficult conditions to meet the needs of students, but it is impossible to provide a proper level of service in present conditions.  The building was designed many years ago for much smaller student numbers and a more limited range of faculties than the college now offers.  Business innovation and information technology are the systems of the future.  It is vital that Sligo Regional Technical College has the most modern accommodation and equipment to prepare its undergraduates for tomorrow's world. I urge the Government to agree immediately to provide the matching funds for this most admirable project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the question of matching funding to upgrade Sligo Regional Technical College to full university status.  First, I wish to deal with the matter of matching funds which, I presume, relates to the £3.7 million provision which was included in the National Development Plan 1994-99 for Sligo Regional Technical College.  This provision, which was first announced by the Minister for Education on 13 January 1994, comprises 75 per cent EU funding and 25 per cent Exchequer funding.  To date £1.5 million of the allocation has been expended on the upgrading of the science laboratories and improving the infrastructure of the college.  The balance, amounting to £2.2 million, including the Exchequer component, remains available for investment in information technology and central administration facilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education is fully aware of the need for further investment in capital projects at Sligo regional technical college.  This requirement is being considered by my Department in the context of the 1997 Estimates, other priorities and overall resource constraints. To date, my Department has not received proposals from the college authorities specifically relating to matching funding for capital developments.</P>
      <P>Second, with regard to the question of full university status for the college, the steering committee on the future development of higher education fully endorsed the maintenance of a diversified system of education to meet the varying needs of students, society and the economy.  They found that this diversity finds most concrete expression in the distinctive roles and missions of the two main sectors of higher education, the university and extra-university sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extra-university sector is distinguished from the universities in particular as the source of technician training and the committee was satisfied that this level of training remains of critical importance in Ireland as recently indicated by the IRDAC report.  The committee was also of the view that an appropriate balance needs to be maintained between technician and degree level courses and that any additional degree provision in the regional technical colleges should be subject to the following criteria: the main thrust of programmes and the output of graduates should remain at certificate-diploma level; new programmes should be in the form of add-on degrees rather than <i>ab-initio</i> degrees, other than in exceptional circumstances; programmes should have approval from TEASTAS following evaluation on the basis of the following conditions: (i) the proposed programme has unique features linked to the activities and academic strengths of the college; (ii) the demand could not be met by an existing programme in another Irish institution, including a university, or it could not be mounted more cost effectively in another college having regard to <Col N="1386" /> staffing and other resource considerations; (iii) there is a proven demand for the course; (iv) the course is geared towards industrial development needs based on liaison with the support from industry; (v) the need being addressed by the programme could not be served by a diploma level programme; (vi) the level of resources required to mount the programme is acceptable; and (vii) there should be overall national monitoring of degree level provision by the Higher Education Authority in collaboration with TEASTAS.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education considered that the changed and still evolving role of the regional technical colleges in technology and in research and development be reflected in their title, without changing the current thrust of their activities or the distinctive role of the colleges.  To reflect and ensure regional emphasis, the steering committee recommended regional institutes of technology as a new title for regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>As required by section 3(4) of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, the college authorities were consulted to as certain the views of governing bodies with regard to the change of title.  Initial reaction from the governing bodies tended to be that a technological university encompassing all the regional technical colleges was the answer.  It is understood, however, that the matter is being discussed by the Council of Directors of regional technical colleges and possibly with chairpersons of governing bodies who are attempting to find a solution to the future status of the regional technical colleges under TEASTAS and in conjunction with Dublin Institute of Technology to provide a full links and ladders system.  Proposals on this matter will come to the Department in the near future and these proposals will have a bearing on the appropriate title or titles for the colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue on the Adjournment to highlight the need for the Minister for Education to urgently allocate funds to Scoil Triest, Lota, County Cork to ensure that the immediate commencement of work on a new school building can take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This co-educational school provides a comprehensive education service to children with special needs.  We all owe a great debt of gratitude to the teachers in the school who have performed above and beyond the call of duty in the most trying of conditions.  The prefabricated buildings which currently accommodate the children are outdated, too small and far too <Col N="1387" /> restrictive.  Current accommodation is nothing short of disgraceful.  This school should be a priority with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the Minister for Education met the parents of the children attending the school prior to the Cork by-elections.  She gave a solemn promise to the parents that work on a new school building would commence immediately.  Since then the Minister has treated the school with contempt.  She has refused to provide the funds over the past two years and has engaged in disgraceful delaying tactics.  On a recent visit to Cork the Minister refused to meet the parents and the board of management.</P>
    <P>The Minister also attempted to create confusion on the issue.  In a Dáil reply to a question I tabled on 25 July last the Minister stated that the Department was not consulted prior to the invitation of tenders for the building, which the board of management had initiated. This ignored a letter sent by an official in the primary buildings section of the Department to the chairperson of the board of management on 13 October 1995 informing him &ldquo;that it had been decided to grant-aid the total project including the excess area&rdquo; and instructing him to submit tender documents to the Department.  On the one hand, therefore, the Department had instructed the board of management to go ahead with the tendering process in October 1995 but the Minister, in response to a parliamentary question last July, gave an opposite view point and claimed that permission was not given.</P>
    <P>The board of management and the parents acted in good faith and it was wrong of the Minister to try to malign them and accuse them of not observing proper procedures.  Up to now the Minister has claimed she could not allow the project to proceed to tender due to &ldquo;the current level of financial commitments on the Primary School Capital Programme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A short while ago, however, I received a faxed communication from the Minister indicating she has now authorised officials in the planning and building unit of the Department to proceed with the tender and contract processes for this project. The letter stated:</P>
    <P>Dear Micheál,</P>
    <P>I refer to your ongoing representations on behalf of Scoil Triest, Lota, Cork concerning the provision of new accommodation for the school.</P>
    <P>You will be pleased to learn that I have now authorised officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department to proceed with the tender and contract processes for this project.</P>
    <P>I received that communication at approximately 6 o'clock this evening and I have no doubt the hurried nature of it is related to this debate.  It is interesting that on 30 August the Minister was not in a position to make this decision as per <Col N="1388" /> written correspondence with me.  The change of heart is due to the decision by the parents to go public with their campaign.  Their picket of the Department of Education's office last Friday has borne fruit.  It is to be regretted that parents were forced into such action and that it took such action to provoke a change of heart in the Minister.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister's reply to my representations, I would prefer a more specific and definitive statement.  I want to know when the funds will be released and when work will commence.  I want a definite commitment from the Minister tonight that funds have now been allocated to this project and that work on a new school building will begin shortly.  All the preparatory work has been done and the tendering processes have been engaged in with the exception of some aspect of the electrical installation work.  We do not want any more excuses.  We want positive and immediate action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Two weeks ago I put down a question to the Minister on this matter and at that stage no money was available.  It is quite extraordinary that a letter should be received at 6 o'clock this evening, resulting from my representations, stating that the project can now go to tender.  I was asked today to withdraw this Adjournment matter but I refused because two years ago the Minister gave a commitment that funding would be provided for this school.  As one parent said to me, &ldquo;we broke wine on the occasion to celebrate&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, there is a great deal of wine on ice in the interim period because of the Minister's inaction.  It is extraordinary that these parents, teachers and everybody involved in a school that is not fit to be called a school were forced to march on the Department of Education.  As Deputy Martin said, it is extraordinary that there has been a change of heart resulting from this debate tonight.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have on the record of the House an absolute commitment from the Minister that money is being provided and that this school will be given the go ahead.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm that for the parents, the teachers and particularly the children in this special school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Martin, for allowing me time to make a brief contribution.  Like my colleagues, I was pleased to hear late this evening that permission is to be given for the school to go to tender and that the building is to proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it was sad to see almost 70 parents, young and not so young, walking up and down outside the Department of Education at South Mall, Cork, last Friday morning, to make their well documented case to the Department.  There was plenty of correspondence.  In 1994 a commitment was given, and there was documentation containing the names of officials <Col N="1389" /> in the Department.  Even that correspondence was disputed by the Department and the Minister in the interim.  We welcome tonight's news, but the parents and their children have been badly treated by the Minister and the Department.  If the Minister or officials of the Department had visited Scoil Triest and seen the conditions, they would realise how concerned the parents were. Parents of children attending special schools suffer enough trauma and anxiety, and it is appalling that they had to wait until tonight, that they had to go to the South Mall last Friday, that Deputies from all parties had to repeatedly demand that the Minister act, before anything was done.</P>
    <P>I hope the commitment given earlier this evening will be acted on as quickly as possible, that the parents can put behind them all the trauma they have suffered in the interim, and that their school will be built as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that epithets such as &ldquo;contempt&rdquo;, &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo;, &ldquo;malign&rdquo;, etc., have been used.  Such attitudes do not help.  A little generosity would help now and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am glad the Deputies have given me the opportunity of outlining to the House my Department's current position regarding Scoil Triest, Lota, Glanmire, County Cork.  The Minister for Education is aware that the school has a current staffing level of principal <Col N="1390" /> and six assistant teachers with an enrolment of 38, and is housed in accommodation provided by the Brothers of Charity.  The Minister knows conditions are less than satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A building project for the school was included in the capital programme announced by me in 1995.  The new school will include six classrooms, a general purpose room and all other necessary ancillary accommodation.</P>
    <P>The school engaged its own architect to design the project and the manager invited tenders in January of this year.  Having examined the development plans and the tenders in detail, my Department advised the school of the need to make changes.  These changes were effected. However, due to contractual commitments at the time, the Minister was not in a position to authorise the project to proceed to contract.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister is now in a position to allow this project to progress to contract stage.  The school management has been informed of this development and the Department will be in further contact with them shortly.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the project will be progressed as quickly as possible and I am confident that the Minister's announcement will be well received by the pupils, parents, teachers and school management.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 November 1996.</P>

They were: (1) the value of the local partnership approach and the very positive impact the local development process in Ireland has had on the co-ordination of the delivery of local services and the tackling of unemployment; (2) that a stable currency is good for jobs and therefore the Irish Presidency has given priority to advancing the single currency process; (3) that crime and personal security may be the major challenges of the 21st century and must be tackled by the joint efforts of member states, to complement positive action at local level and (4) that the primary achievement of the European Union is the peace which it has brought to the nation states of western Europe.</P>

      <P>The following groups were funded by the Exchequer under the scheme of grants for special local development projects in 1995:</P>
      <P>(1)  Togher Community Group, Togher, Cork, £20,000.  Funding towards the production of a newsletter for the area and the preparation of an environmental improvement plan.</P>
      <P>(2)  Mahon Community Action Plan, Mahon Shopping Centre, Avenue De Rennes, Mahon, Cork, £30,000.  Funding for a community desk top publishing business and a community resource park.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Famine Commemoration Committee provided the following grant during 1995:</P>
      <P>Cork Civic Trust, £1,000.  Grant towards the restoration of a Famine graveyard in Cork.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for two EU supported operational programmes: (i) the local urban and rural development and (ii) URBAN. Both of them will support projects in Cork in the period to 1999.  My Department does not provide direct funding to specific projects.</P>
      <P>Decisions on funding and selection of projects are taken at local level by the designated management structures for the programmes.</P>
      <P>Allocations under URBAN will commence shortly.  These will be managed through the Cork Steering Group.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Local Urban and Rural Development Programme, funding is allocated by Area Development Management Ltd., the intermediary company for the programme.  The allocations made by ADM, in 1995, to Cork based groups are as follows: Mahon Community Group, £32,000 (75 per cent EU funding); Mallow Area Development Community Group, £36,000 (75 per cent EU funding); Cork Community Development, £5,000 (75 per cent EU funding) and Cork City Partnership, £397,120 (75 per cent EU funding).</P>

      <P>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) provides annual information on the numbers of persons at work classified by region. <Col N="1395" /> The annual change in the numbers at work depends both on the number of jobs created and the number of jobs lost.  However, statistics on the total numbers of jobs created or jobs lost are not available, either from the LFS or other CSO sources.</P>
      <P>The most recent regional results from the LFS, showing numbers at work, relate to April 1995 and corresponding results for April 1996 will be available in January 1997.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Western Development Partnership Board, established by the Government in October 1994, is to develop a strategic focus for economic and social development in the western region, with the objective of achieving population stability by the end of the decade at 1991 census levels on a county by county basis.</P>
      <P>The board launched its action plan, &ldquo;The Challenge &mdash; a positive future through action&rdquo; in May last year.  A number of key decisions have been take by the Government on foot of recommendations made in the plan including the establishment of a western development commission.  Discussions are continuing with relevant Departments on a variety of sectoral development proposals outlined in the plan.</P>

      <P>The Government continues to believe that the problem of policing in Northern Ireland is one of the crucial issues which must be addressed by the parties within the context of comprehensive negotiations.  In the Joint Framework Document both the Irish and British Governments accept that issues of law and order in Northern Ireland are closely intertwined with the issues of political consensus.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on many occasions, for a police service to secure and enjoy crosscommunity support, it must reflect the communities it serves both in its composition and ethos, and must accord equal esteem to the Nationalist and Unionist identities.  Achieving this remains the Government's objective in relation to comprehensive reform of the RUC and new policing structures in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have availed fully of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and its machinery to put forward views and proposals on policing issues.  Most recently, for example, a special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference was convened on 18 July at the Government's request in the wake of the disturbances surrounding Drumcree.  The damage done to Nationalist confidence in the RUC by these events was central to the discussions at that special conference meeting.  Indeed, policing has been discussed at most if not all of the Anglo-Irish conference meetings since 1986.  It will continue to form a central issue within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and within the wider context of political negotiations involving the two Governments and the parties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to Question No. 45 of 12 November 1996 which relates to this matter.</P>
      <P>The Government and our EU partners remain very concerned about the situation in Sudan.  The ongoing civil war, continuing human rights abuses and severe food shortages have caused great suffering to the Sudanese people.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the Government about the situation in Sudan have been made known to the Sudanese Government by the Irish Ambassador in Cairo who is also accredited to Khartoum. Both bilaterally and along with our European partners, we have supported the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which consists of Sudan and seven neighbouring countries, in its special initiative which is seeking to bring peace to Sudan.  As part of the ongoing process of critical dialogue between the European Union and Sudan, discussions have taken place with the Sudanese authorities on various issues including the need to pursue the peace process, democratisation, and to ensure protection of human rights and the unhindered distribution of humanitarian assistance.  We will continue to support efforts aimed at resolving the conflict in that country.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to provide assistance to those who have suffered from the conflict in Sudan.  Since 1994, it has provided nearly £1.25 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance to Sudan.  This includes a recent allocation of £100,000 to UNICEF's Operation Lifeline Sudan for the provision of basic healthcare to displaced people in southern Sudan.</P>
      <P>The Government is also aware of the particular humanitarian difficulties faced by the inhabitants of the large settlements of displaced people in the vicinity of Khartoum, northern Sudan.  To this end, the Government has, since 1993, been providing assistance through GOAL for an ongoing project with displaced people around Khartoum.  £430,000 has been provided to the project since 1993 including £125,000 this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition Ireland has continued to provide bilateral aid aimed at poverty alleviation at local <Col N="1400" /> level.  Since 1994, this has amounted to approximately £1.63 million, of which approximately £620,000 will be spent this year. Under the Irish Government's bilateral aid programme, the co-financing scheme with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) provides grants for small to medium-sized projects which meet basic needs.  So far this year grants amounting to a total of £163,400 have been allocated to Sudan, covering the health, education, training, income generation and rural development sectors of the scheme.</P>
    <P>For its part the European Union has, since 1994, provided a total of 32.5 million ECU in emergency humanitarian aid for Sudan, of which 13.1 million ECU has been disbursed this year.</P>
    <P>Along with our European partners, the Government will continue to follow the situation in Sudan closely and with concern, and to avail of every appropriate opportunity to exert positive influence on the Sudanese authorities, including in the United Nations and other international fora.</P>

      <P>The figure of £3 billion (4 billion ecu is the figure given in the Court of Auditors Statement of Assurance) has been obtained by extrapolating the results of a sample of 683 payment transactions and related to payments involving an error of one kind or another.  It would be wrong to assume that all of these errors in payments involve fraud: some may refer to irregularities.  An error rate of 5.9 per cent was detected.  Applying this rate to the entire budget gives the figure of 4 billion ecu.  This figure can only be taken as an indication of the possible level of payment error.  Nevertheless, the Government, in common with other member states, is concerned about the existence of fraud or irregularity in EU funding.  Indeed, article 209a <Col N="1402" /> of the Treaty on European Union obliges member states to take the same measures to counter fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community as they take to protect their own financial interests.</P>
      <P>Let me assure the Deputy that this Government is fully committed to combating the misuse of Community resources.  Last week ECOFIN adopted a regulation dealing with on-the-spot inspections.  The Commission report on sound financial management (SEM 2000) is currently before the ECOFIN council.  This report contains wide-ranging proposals for the improvement of the financial management of EU resources by member states in partnership with the Commission and it will be considered at the next meeting of the ECOFIN council in December.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the blind person's tax allowance available under the Irish income tax code is currently £700 in the case of a single person or married couple where one spouse is blind, and £1,600 for a married couple where both spouses are blind.</P>
      <P>Proposals for an increase in this allowance have been sent to myself and to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  In this regard I wish to assure the Deputy that all allowances and reliefs will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.  I would, however, remind the Deputy that in the 1996 budget I increased this allowance by £100 single-married one spouse blind, and by £200 married both spouses blind. The allowance had not previously been increased since the 1985 budget.</P>

    <P>(1) Statistics are not available which would enable the precise information requested by the Deputy to be provided in respect of share purchase schemes qualifying for tax relief under the provisions of section 12 of the Finance Act, 1986. It is tentatively estimated that share purchases by employees over the period from 1987 to date, relating to income tax years 1986-87 to 1994-95, were accorded tax relief at an appropriate cost to the Exchequer of £1.9 million.</P>

    <P>(4) The figure in the table is the estimated cost of extending the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for shipping companies in respect of accounting periods ending between 1 April 1994 and 31 March 1995.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in my reply to a similar parliamentary question in relation to this case tabled by the Deputy in May of last year, I understand that the case referred to by the Deputy was reviewed by my Department in 1987 in consultation with a prominent firm of solicitors, acting on behalf of the person concerned.  As a result of this review, the matter was resolved on the basis of a full and final settlement which was accepted by all parties. The person concerned indicated in writing on 30 March 1987 that she was prepared to accept the agreed terms in full and final settlement of her claim for additional benefits under the superannuation Acts.</P>
      <P>The settlement terms provided for a payment amounting to seven twelfths of salary, which is equal to what the person would have got if she had been awarded both the injury warrant pension and the pension under the Civil Service widows' and orphans' (contributory) pension scheme at the rates which actually applied before 1978.  It is not the case that, at the time of the unfortunate death of the civil servant referred to by the Deputy, the rate of injury warrant widow's pension had been increased from one third to one half of salary.  In fact, this change was implemented by way of statutory instrument in 1978, with retrospective effect to 1 June 1973.  It was explicitly provided, both in the relevant agreement under the conciliation and arbitration scheme and in the relevant statutory instrument implementing this change, that a widow could not avail of both the injury grant payment and payment under the widow and orphans &mdash; now referred to as the spouses and childrens &mdash; scheme.  Under the terms of this statutory instrument, the most that the widow concerned could receive would be 50 per cent of salary. Therefore, the settlement reached with the person concerned is more advantageous and certainly does not amount to a unilateral rescinding of the 1978 agreement by my Department.</P>
      <P>Finally, as to the claim that the 1987 settlement was reached under duress, I should point out that the matter had been the subject of exhaustive correspondence over the years and at the time of the settlement the claimant's solicitors thanked the Department officials concerned for &ldquo;the very helpful and sympathetic manner in which... [they] dealt with this claim&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>The figure of 6 per cent refers to the Court of Auditor's estimate of payments to beneficiaries in all member states, involving some type of error.  The figure can only be taken as an indication of the possible level of payment error as it is calculated by extrapolating from the amounts involved in cases actually identified. However, there is no suggestion in the Court of Auditor's report that losses of this order have been incurred by Ireland, which is recognised by the EU Commission as having a very good record in the administration of EU funds.  In response to the need for action to up-grade financial systems throughout the Union, the EU Commission, in co-operation with member states, has taken on the task of identifying reforms needed for the better financial management and control of EU funds.  The Commission's initiative, called Sound and Efficient Management 2000, has produced a number of recommendations, which will be discussed at the Council of Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) of 2 December, prior to its submission to the European Council in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under VAT law a farmer engaged in the supply of insemination services retains his farmer status for VAT purposes and is not obliged to register or account for VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> This means that an authorised AI station engaged in farming activities rearing and breeding bulls, for example, qualifies as a farmer and is not obliged to register for VAT.</P>
    <P>However, companies other than authorised AI stations are prohibited from operating an AI service under the 1947 Livestock Breeding Act, but may engage in direct sales of semen to farmers who operate on a DIY basis.  They are obliged to register and account for VAT at the standard rate of VAT of 21 per cent where annual sales exceed £40,000.  This can put such companies at a disadvantage as they will be obliged to charge VAT on direct sales of semen whereas authorised AI stations with farmer status and who provide a wider AI service, as distinct from direct sales only, to unregistered farmers will not.</P>
    <P>While the Revenue Commissioners and officials in my Department have been aware of the position for some time, I understand that they are awaiting the outcome of a Supreme Court case challenging the monopoly position of the AI stations under agricultural legislation before considering any changes to VAT legislation.  I will, however, keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the State already provides significant assistance towards the purchase and improvement of private housing.  In order to encourage house construction and increase the housing stock, first-time buyers of new houses are assisted by the £3,000 new house grant and enjoy a complete exemption from stamp duty except in relation to the site value of houses with a floor area over 125 square metres.  In addition, support is available to those taking out residential mortgages through interest relief for tax purposes which helps reduce the burden of loan repayments.  Also, there is a capital gains tax exemption for the disposal of principal private residences and there are special tax reliefs for residential accommodation under the urban renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>In view of these factors, I am satisfied that there is ample State support given to the housing sector and consequently I have no plans to introduce any form of tax-free savings schemes for home repairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that VAT is charged on child care services at the standard rate of 21 per cent.  The situation is governed by European VAT law.  Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, education is an exempt service for VAT purposes, but this exemption does not extend to child care services or nurseries.  Such facilities are liable for VAT when they are provided in the course or furtherance of business and if their annual turnover exceeds, or is likely to exceed £20,000.  However, I should point out that non-profit making child minding services provided by public bodies or recognised charities are exempt from VAT.  In addition, <Col N="1413" /> creches and playschools which follow a clear educational programme may be exempt if they come within the terms of the exemption for children's education.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether or not a particular facility follows such a programme.</P>
      <P>While the application of EU law in the UK is a matter for the UK authorities, I understand that the UK treatment may be based on their application of the exemption for hospital and medical care.  The position in that regard is being checked with the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>Finally, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, VAT is a tax on final consumption and, therefore, according to the general rule is paid out of the after tax income of the consumer.</P>

      <P>The provision of funding to voluntary organisations, such as Brainwave, is a matter for the health boards.  In 1996, health boards have allocated a total of £26,000 to Brainwave.

An officer of my Department recently held a meeting with representatives of Brainwave at which the subject of funding and other topics of concern to the association were fully explored.  The matters raised are being brought to the attention of the chief executive officers of health boards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): At present there are 6,401 persons registered as blind.  However, the information sought by the Deputy regarding the number of registered blind persons who do not hold a medical card due to their income levels is not readily available to my Department.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of this special provision, I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic <Col N="1416" /> entitlement to a medical card to all registered blind persons, without any reference to their means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Chronic fatigue syndrome, CFS, sometimes known as chronic fatique immunodeficiency syndrome CFIS in the United States and myalgic encephalomyelitis, ME, in the United Kingdom, is the subject of widespread international research in a range of medical and scientific disciplines with a view particularly to elucidating its cause which is at present unknown.  The Department of Health, and indeed the medical profession in general in this country, monitor this research with a view to incorporating any new proven findings in the diagnosis and management of this difficult condition.</P>
      <P>Since ME is not a notifiable disease, national figures on the incidence of this condition are not routinely available.  I am advised that currently there are no diagnostic tests for the syndrome, and that there are no laboratory tests that establish or support the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome.  International studies based on survey techniques have not proved reliable estimates of prevalence due primarily to the lack of consensus regarding positive diagnosis of ME.</P>
      <P>The Health Research Board is the statutory body with responsibility for health research in Ireland.  Although the board is not currently engaged in funding a research project in the field of myalgic encephalomyelitis, the board considers all applications for funding and allocates funding to projects on a competitive basis subject to the board's peer review process whereby experts in the field assess the merits of each individual project.  Any person or body seeking funds to enable research to be undertaken in the field of myalgic encephalomyelitis should submit a proposal to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Blood Transfusion Service Board has informed me that the various blood group systems together contain over 400 characterised antigens, the vast majority of which are so weak that they rarely cause clinical problems.  Only two, the ABO and rhesus D, RHD, systems, require routine prospective matching prior to blood transfusion.  All donated blood is routinely typed for ABO and rhesus D antigens.  The remaining blood group differences present problems for only a small number of patients for whom a previous sensitising episode, usually from pregnancy or earlier transfusion, has stimulated the formation of antibodies which necessitates the selection of more accurately matched blood for transfusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Kell antigen of the K blood group has the potential to provoke an antibody response. Research in relation to donors shows that about 91 per cent of the general population are Kell negative and the frequency of Kell positive type in the population is therefore 9 per cent.  Only about 5 per cent of Kell negative patients transfused with a unit of Kell positive blood will produce anti-Kell.  Accordingly, the chance associated with receiving a Kell positive unit and becoming immunised is quite low.  However, given the large scale of blood transfusion the anti-Kell is a comparatively common antibody detected among transfusion recipients.  Therefore, before any patient receives a transfusion a small sample of blood is routinely tested for antibodies and cross matched against the prospective donation.  The BTSB routinely screens for the provision of Kell negative or any antigen negative blood upon request from hospitals.  If a Kell antibody is detected, the BTSB will provide Kell <Col N="1418" /> negative blood which is more accurately compatible im meeting individual patient requirements.</P>
    <P>Anti-Kell can also cause haemolytic disease in a Kell positive newborn if the mother is K negative and is immunised.  Routine screening for antibodies, including Kell antibodies, is available within the health care sector for all women during pregnancy as part of the standard care and management protocols during pregnancy.  If a Kell antibody is detected the pregnant woman is referred for specialist management and where necessary appropriate treatment.</P>
    <P>The medical consultants at the BTSB and the board's scientific committee are at present assessing the technical requirements necessary to make available Kell negative blood transfusion to females of child bearing potential, who require blood transfusion.</P>

Under the emergency category of the dental treatment services scheme, 12,732 treatments have been provided to the end of October 1996.  The board also provided 3,562 treatments under the routine element of the scheme and dentures have been provided for 1,673 persons in the first ten months of this year.</P>

This has arisen because the emergency element of the scheme is using a disproportionate amount of the board's budget for the scheme as a whole.  This has limited the amount of routine treatment which the board has been able to approve.</P>
      <P>The board is making strenuous efforts to bring the emergency element under control with the assistance of revised arrangements for emergency treatment.  These are designed to ensure that the emergency element of the scheme is used only for the relief of pain in accordance with the original design of the scheme.</P>

      <P>As the project in Fermoy was at an advanced stage of development, £106,000 of the above sum was apportioned by the board for Fermoy.  Of the remaining £94,000, the board allocated £44,000 towards the development of a day care centre in Bandon.</P>
      <P>The board inform me, however, that as the project in Bandon is at a very early stage in the planning process, very little expenditure will arise in 1996 and the money allocated this year will not be spent until next year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have received a copy of the Women's Aid pre-budget submission requesting additional funding for services for victims of domestic violence.  To date the role of the health services in this area has been to support refuges for women and children subjected to violence in the home and to provide crisis support and counselling.</P>
      <P>It has been recognised that the issue of domestic violence is extremely complex and cannot be tackled by any one Government Department in isolation.  Accordingly, the Government has decided to assign responsibility for co-ordinating policy on women and violence across Government Departments to the office of the Tánaiste.  The office has established a Working Group on Violence Against Women chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, on which both my Department and the health boards are represented.</P>
      <P>The working group is due to report to the Government in February 1977.  I feel it would be important to await this report before coming to any firm conclusions with regard to the planning of future developments in this area.  The Deputy will be aware that the provision of extra funding to the organisation will be dependent upon the additional funding made available to my Department in the 1997 Estimates for such services.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual or family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on <Col N="1429" /> medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.

In view of the availability of this service it would not be the policy of the health board to provide a satellite unit at Belmullet District Hospital.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The series of cancer initiatives which I announced last week are aimed at bringing about important improvements to services relating to cancer throughout the country.  The national cancer strategy contains plans for reorganising cancer treatment services, targeting resources to screening programmes of proven value and developing specialist palliative care.  The services will concentrate on the needs of patients, with particular regard to the most sensitive and responsive arrangements for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.  All areas of the country, including the North East region, will benefit over the coming years from the initiatives contained in the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key element in the Cancer Strategy is that hospital based treatment services should be organised around regional services in designated groups of hospitals.  The regional services would be responsible for organising an appropriate cancer treatment service for the region and would be led by one of the hospitals.  In this regard, it is proposed that the North Eastern regional service would be led by the Cavan/Monaghan hospital <Col N="1431" /> group.  This hospital will co-ordinate cancer treatment services for the region to ensure that the hospitals in the region adopt a cohesive approach in the delivery of care.  A key concern will be to ensure that patients receive the best treatment in the most appropriate location.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): On 20 April 1995 the North-Western Health Board adopted a motion asking the health board to seek State funding for the provision of day care and residential hospice care for the North West Hospice and Donegal Hospice.  This motion was communicated to my Department by the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board on 25 April 1955.  In subsequent discussions between my Department and the North-Western Health Board, the board identified the provision of funding in this regard as a priority in terms of the funding available for the provision and development of hospice services.</P>
      <P>Since taking office I have identified cancer as one of my major priorities.  On the basis of service priorities agreed with the North-Western Health Board, I have addressed the need to improve services for cancer patients in the North West and I have provided £275,000 for the development of oncology services in the North-Western Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday, 5 November 1996 I announced a set of initiatives for the future reorganisation of cancer services throughout the country.  Included <Col N="1432" /> in these initiatives are proposals for the development of specialist palliative care so that the development of this service will best meet the needs and personal preferences of patients with cancer or long-term conditions.  A national cancer forum, which will have consumer representation, will be established to co-ordinate services and to provide detailed advice on the development of palliative care services nationally.  In parallel with this process all health boards will be requested to draw up a set of priorities for the development of palliative care services in their area.  In this regard, the North-Western Health Board has advised me that the board's priorities will address the role, function and funding of the voluntary organisations, the North West Hospice and the Donegal/Foyle Hospice, in the proposed future organisation of the services in the board's area.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Admission for open heart surgery for adults in the public hospital service is determined having regard to the medical condition of patients.  Admission is based solely on the patient's condition, not the length of time on the waiting list.  As priority is given to urgent and emergency cases, routine cases for cardiac surgery can be on the waiting list for a considerable time and I have indicated previously how I intend to tackle this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual activity for open heart surgery at the Mater and Cork University Hospitals has been increased by 450 to 1,400 per annum.  Bypass surgery is one dimension of open heart surgery. In 1995 there were 957 bypass procedures <Col N="1433" /> performed on adult patients in the public hospital system.</P>
    <P>The number of adult patients awaiting cardiac surgery prior to 1994 is approximately 820 while the number of patients on the cardiac surgery waiting list since 1994 is approximately 1,060. These figures are constantly changing as a result of patients receiving the operations and/or new patients being added to the list.</P>

      <P>The group concerned is one of a number of groups receiving assistance for the first time under the scheme of grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services, which is administered by my Department.  The first instalment of the grant was paid to the organisation concerned once it had been established to the satisfaction of those administering the scheme that the group satisfied the eligibility criteria, although the full amount payable had yet to be determined.  This payment was made on 13 May 1996.</P>
      <P>Of necessity, applications submitted by groups which are being grant aided for the first time require more extensive consideration than would otherwise be necessary in order to determine the full amount payable in each case, hence the lapse of time in making further payments to this and to other counselling organisations in a similar situation.  Further payments under the scheme will be made soon to applicant organisations. These will include, in this group's case, the second and third instalment of their grant for 1996.</P>

      <P>I am continually monitoring the position with regard to waiting times at law centres, in consultation with the Legal Aid Board.  Where, for whatever reason, waiting times at any of the law centres become excessive the cause of the problem is determined by the board following careful examination of the situation at the centre and appropriate remedial action is taken.  The length of the waiting time in the law centre in Tralee is a cause of particular concern to me and officials of my Department have been in consultation with the Legal Aid Board in the matter.  I can assure the Deputy that appropriate remedies will be applied in order to achieve more acceptable waiting times for legal aid applicants at the Tralee Law Centre.</P>

    <P>The Heritage Council, which I appointed on 10 July 1995 under the Heritage Act, 1995, is an autonomous statutory body which has power to provide assistance (including financial assistance) and advice to persons and bodies in matters relating to its functions.  A detailed list of any grants approved or paid by the statutory Heritage Council in 1995 will be published it its annual report for that year.</P>
    <P>In 1995, funding in relation to the Heritage Service, which transferred to my Department earlier this year, was channelled through the Vote of the Office of Public Works.  For the Deputy's information, a sum in excess of £400,000 was expended on projects in Cork city and county from that Vote in 1995, principally in respect of National Monuments and Heritage Properties projects at the following locations: Charles Fort, Kinsale; Knockdrum; Labbamolaga; French Prison, Kinsale; Barryscourt Castle and Ilnacullin (Garnish Island).</P>
    <P>The figures which I have provided above do not take account of moneys expended or approved directly by bodies under the aegis of my Department such as An Chomhairle Ealaíon/The Arts Council or Bord Scannán na hÉireann/The Irish Film Board during the period in question.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy that in addition to the direct expenditure to which I have referred, significant allocations have been approved by me, but not yet expended, for projects in Cork city and county.  In regard to arts and culture projects, a number of significant <Col N="1437" /> projects amounting to some £3.3 million have been approved by me under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 as follows: Crawford Municipal Gallery of Art, £1,800,000; Cork Public Museum, £900,000; Cork Opera House, £375,000; Everyman Palace Theatre, £350,000; Briary Gap Theatre, Macroom, £150,000 and Kino Arthouse Cinema, £100,000.</P>
    <P>In the Heritage area, significant projects amounting to £2.25 million have been approved by me under the terms of the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 as follows: Lough Hyne Marine Reserve, £500,000; Glengarriff Wood, £400,000; Doneraile Forest Park, £350,000; Charles Fort, £500,000 and Barryscourt Castle, £500,000.</P>
    <P>Projects approved under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 will involve a mixture of Exchequer and EU funding but I regret that it is not possible to give a comprehensive breakdown in this regard at present.</P>

      <P>Under the first phase of the cultural development incentives scheme (CDIS), which was advertised in December, 1994, a total of 170 applications for grant assistance were submitted to my Department, of which four were in respect of projects in County Cavan and one in respect of a project in County Monaghan.  All 170 applications were the subject of a detailed assessment process and consideration by an advisory committee for the CDIS, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Tourism and Trade, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Heritage Council, the County and City Managers' Association and the General Council of County Councils, following which it made its recommendations to me.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in considering the recommendations of the Advisory Committee some very difficult decisions had to be made and some worthwhile projects throughout the country could not be assisted, given the limited funding at my disposal.  While this is a regrettable situation, <Col N="1440" /> the fact that I obtained 170 applications under the first phase of the CDIS indicates the wealth of interest in arts and culture activities which exists throughout the State.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I invited applications for the final phase of the CDIS, for which funding of some £5 million is available, by way of an advertisement in the national press on Friday last, 15 November 1996.  It is open to the promoters of the projects which were unsuccessful under the first phase of the CDIS to submit new or revised proposals for consideration under the final phase.</P>
      <P>Details of the 25 projects approved in principle is as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of a modern theatre facility in Letterkenny, County Donegal &mdash; £1,500,000;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of a modern arts centre in the old Courthouse, Portlaoise, County Laois &mdash; £1,300,000;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the development of, and extension to, existing facilities at the Cork Public Museum &mdash; £900,000;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the renovation and extension of the Waterford Theatre Royal, a unique victorian horseshoe theatre, bringing the venue up to modern contemporary theatre standards &mdash; £562,000;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the restoration and refurbishment to contemporary theatre standards of the Everyman Palace Theatre, Cork City &mdash; £350,000;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the development of the Limerick City Gallery of Art into a modern gallery facility through a comprehensive conversion of, and extension to, the existing facilities &mdash; £687,500;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of a 200 seat art house cinema in Cork City &mdash; £100,000;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of a modern arts centre in Edenville House, Roscommon &mdash; £250,000;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the development of a cultural centre, including theatre facilities, at Doolin, County Clare &mdash; £90,000;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Difficulties in relation to the recycling of paper are being experienced at present in Ireland and internationally arising from a significant reduction in the demand and price for waste paper.  Certain materials such as cardboard, office paper and other higher-grade papers continue to be collected but many recyclers have suspended the collection of lower-grade waste papers, such as newspapers.  Some collection agencies are, however, maintaining collection banks in place of reserving collection sites pending recovery of markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The successful development of waste recycling will depend to a significant extent on the <Col N="1444" /> development of more extensive and stable markets for recyclable materials.  At my initiative, this issue was discussed at the Informal Council of EU Environment Ministers in July, where there was agreement as to the need for consideration to be given to measures which will encourage more stable and adequate markets for recyclables.  The need to develop concrete actions to support markets for recycled products is now being considered as part of a review of European Union waste management strategy.</P>
    <P>Increased demand for recycled paper will be supported in Ireland by the Green Government guidelines to which the questions refers.  Each Department has been asked to assign a nominated officer to co-ordinate the preparation of a green housekeeping programme within the organisation.  The nominated officers also participate in the interdepartmental network established to support and promote the development of green housekeeping across the Civil Service.  This interdepartmental network has already begun its work and is addressing, <i>inter alia</i>, the implementation of the recommendation in the Green Guide for use of recycled paper by all Departments.</P>
    <P>Financial assistance is being provided by my Department, with the support of the European Union, to support capital expenditure on the provision of infrastructure for waste recycling. Grants have recently been approved for a number of private sector projects, including operations dealing with paper recycling.</P>

      <P>A review of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995 was initiated in my Department last September, one year after the commencement of the regulations. As part of this review, all licensing authorities were asked for their comments on the operation and application of the regulations.  A number of authorities have submitted responses to date which are quite detailed and involve a number of complex issues, while submissions are still awaited from some authorities.  I cannot say, at this stage, how long it will take to examine all of the submissions and issues arising and to determine what action, if any, is required.  There will, however, be no avoidable delay in dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>Section 26(1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, empowers planning authorities to attach conditions to planning permissions while section 26 (2) contains specific provisions for conditions requiring contributions towards expenditure already incurred, or to be incurred, by the planning authority in respect of works which have facilitated, or will facilitate, the proposed development.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>A total of £0.59 million was paid out to civil servants in my Department in respect of overtime in 1995.</P>
      <P>The overtime allocation is mainly spent on work relating to the examinations branch.  This accounted for approximately 66 per cent of the overtime expenditure in 1995.</P>
      <P>The work of the examinations branch is governed by extremely tight time constraints and deadlines.  The pattern of the workload is seasonal, dominated by a peak period leading up to the start of the certificate examinations in June and the issuing of results in mid-August, (leaving cert.) and mid-September, (junior cert.)</P>
      <P>The resources employed by the Department in managing this pattern comprise a core staffing complement augmented by temporary employees and overtime working.  Due to the seasonal nature of the workload it would be inefficient to employ more than a core of permanent staff. Approximately 70 temporary staff are recruited each year.  The balance of resources necessary to meet the tight deadlines set by the Department for holding of examinations and the issue of results is made up by overtime working.</P>

      <P>Data from the 1995 ESRI annual school leavers survey shows that, of 67,500 school leavers in 1993-94, 3.3 per cent left with no qualifications; 14.8 per cent left with junior cycle qualifications; 18 per cent left without completing senior cycle.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>, indicates that one of the main objectives of educational policy is to encourage and facilitate as many students as possible to continue in full-time education after the end of junior cycle.  A major objective is that the percentage of 16 to 18 year olds completing senior cycle will increase to at least 90 per cent by the year 2000.  The 1995 ESRI annual school leavers survey indicates significant progress in retention rates, with 82 per cent completing senior cycle in 1993-94 compared to 70 per cent in 1986.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have persistently pursued a range of strategies designed to counter underachievement and early school leaving, particularly among those who are disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>These include major curricular reform, increased financial support for second-level schools with additional financial support for schools categorised as disadvantaged, the book grant scheme for necessitous students, alleviation of examination fees for necessitous students, concessionary teaching posts, expansion of the home-school community liaison scheme, links programmes between disadvantaged schools and third level institutions, support for junior and senior centres for travellers and increased investment in in-career training of teachers.  In addition, second chance education and training is provided through the Youthreach programme for unqualified early school leavers and by the vocational training opportunities scheme for long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>The counties which will not, at this stage, have an education centre (previously teachers' centres) with full-time status are Carlow, Cavan, Longford, Louth, Offaly, Roscommon, Tipperary and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The provision of full-time centres or part-time centres is not decided on a county basis.  In the upgrading of centres, which I announced recently, account was taken of a range of factors, in particular, geographical spread, school-teacher population, local need and strategic locations within what will be the new education board areas.</P>
      <P>This upgrading of centres will bring the number of full-time centres to 21 and is a major investment in the education centre network, more than doubling the number of full-time centres. This development is in the context of the National Development Plan 1994 to 1999.  It is not possible to say when further development of the network may take place.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that some areas were understandably disappointed that their area could not be included, the development of the education centre network which I have announced is far greater than anything previously achieved and is, I believe, very welcome throughout the system.</P>

      <P>St. Brigid's and St. Joseph's schools in Moville, County Donegal, amalgamated in September 1996.  A number of improvement works are needed at the schools.  The funding for these works must be considered in the light of existing contractual commitments, and the funding to be made available for 1997.  These matters are under consideration at present and I expect that the process will be completed shortly.  My Department will then be in touch with the school management.</P>
      <P>In the long-term, it is proposed to provide an extension to the existing girls' school to house the amalgamated school.  This project will be considered for inclusion in a future capital programme.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>This initiative is based on the outcome of detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the education research centre.  Among the findings of these studies was a recommendation that a more targeted approach be adopted, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The studies also concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged area scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
      <P>Under the Breaking the Cycle initiative, a targeted programme of special supports is being made available to selected urban and rural schools.  In the case of urban schools, the focus was on schools which already had disadvantaged area status and were located in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The second element of the initiative focused on schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers and particularly schools in rural areas which serve dispersed populations and which have concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the school system.</P>
      <P>The criteria used in selecting schools for inclusion in this initiative and the selection process itself were devised and carried out by the education research centre following detailed study of a range of possible indicators of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, based on staffing and enrolment, the school referred to by the Deputy was not eligible to apply for inclusion under the new initiative.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254, 255, 256 and 257 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the procedures applied in selecting schools for inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle initiative resulted in the exclusion of schools in the circumstances described by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As previously indicated to the Deputy, the criteria under which schools were selected for inclusion in this initiative and the selection process itself, were devised and carried out by the education research centre following detailed consideration of a range of indicators.</P>
      <P>All applicant schools submitted data under a variety of headings and on a standard application form devised by the education research centre. The centre reviewed the data submitted and selected schools on the basis of priority of need as reflected by the data.</P>
      <P>As part of the selection process, the education research centre also had access to Departmental records to assist in determining the eligibility of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would have every confidence in the integrity of the data submitted by individual schools in support of their applications, I would point out that all applicants were requested to retain the data on which their applications were based to facilitate verification of data should this prove necessary.  Should it transpire, on foot of any such examination, that a school had provided <Col N="1471" /> erroneous information, the position of the school within the scheme would have to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>While it is understood that a very high correlation exists between the schools included in the Breaking the Cycle initiative and those located in areas identified in the GAMMA study, I am not in a position to provide details in relation to individual schools.  I should also point out that, unlike the exercise conducted by the education research centre which was specifically focused on educational disadvantage, the GAMMA report was a broadly based study drawn on the 1991 census to identify areas of high disadvantage.  It was not specifically focused on the issue of educational disadvantage.</P>

The social guarantee register, supplemented by local referrals from schools, garda, probation, youth and welfare services, is used to recruit young people onto the Youthreach programme for unqualified early school leavers.  The White Paper <i>Charting our Education Future</i> proposes that the function of monitoring school attendance will fall within the remit of the regional education boards when they are established.</P>
      <P>The following table gives details of trainees on a county by county basis who are availing of the Youthreach programme in the education sector. A further 1,500 places approximately are provided by FÁS on this programme, and an additional 450 Youthreach places in the vocational education committee sector are now being put in place.  This will bring the combined provision under the programme to 3,950 places. Youthreach is targeted at young people in the 15-18 year age group who have left school with no qualifications.</P>
      <P>A fundamental objective in the White Paper <i>Charting our Education Future</i> is to increase retention rates in education to completion of senior cycle to 90 per cent by the end of the decade.  Progress in the achievement of this target is being made, and rates of retention have increased from 70 per cent in 1986 to 82 per cent in 1993-94.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has a range of strategies in place to help prevent early school leaving.  These <Col N="1473" /> include the development of early start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the new breaking the cycle initiative; the home-school-community liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; improvements in the quality of teaching and certification systems; the expanson of psychological and guidance services; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees, for necessitous pupils; and the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and the vocational training opportunity scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department makes every effort to provide school transport for children attending special schools and classes on either scheduled or special services.  However, in some instances this is simply not feasible due to the particular circumstances of the case.  Where a transport service cannot be provided, my Department offers a grant to the parents to help defray the cost of private transport arrangements.  The amount payable depends on the distance involved and the level of attendance of the pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pupil in question had been facilitated with school transport until recently.  However, following a number of incidents on the bus, in which this pupil was involved, it was decided for <Col N="1474" /> safety reasons to suspend transport facilities for this pupil.  As an alternative arrangement, an annual transport grant up to a maximum of £1,500 has been sanctioned towards the cost of private transport arrangements for the pupil.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme was last expanded in 1994 when disadvantaged status was extended to an additional 54 primary schools.  On that occasion, applications for inclusion were received and considered from St. Fergal's junior and St. Fergal's senior schools.</P>
      <P>Schools were selected for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators which had been agreed with schools' management and the INTO.  Account was also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between applicant schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios.  The cases put forward by both of the schools mentioned were considered on that occasion.  While St. Fergal's junior school qualified for inclusion, it is unfortunately the case that St. Fergal's senior school did not qualify.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently <Col N="1478" /> launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  This initiative is based on the outcome of detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.  Among the findings of these studies was a recommendation that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged area scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>Under the Breaking the Cycle initiative, a targeted programme of special supports is being made available to selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.  The criteria used in selecting schools for inclusion in this initiative and the selection process itself were devised and carried out by the Education Research Centre following detailed study of a range of possible indicators of disadvantage.  Unfortunately, based on staffing and enrolments, the senior school to which the Deputy refers was not eligible for inclusion under this new initiative.</P>

      <P>An application for a remedial teacher for the schools in question has been received by my Department. I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 to 87.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected <Col N="1481" /> urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 287 together.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau is responsible to the Garda Commissioner for the performance of its functions and I am assured by the Garda authorities that the highest standards of confidentiality and security are applied to all bureau operations.  The Deputy's questions refer to unauthorised leaks to the press regarding the bureau operations.  Any inference that such a leak could have emanated from the Garda or from within the bureau itself is no more than speculation</P>
      <P>Any such leak could not be condoned as it would put in jeopardy the success of the bureau operations and could endanger bureau officers involved.</P>
      <P>In relation to the depiction of members of the bureau in press photographs while engaged in their duties on 3 October 1996, the view of the Garda authorities is that, due to the sensitive nature of the work of the bureau, the publication of such photographs could not be considered appropriate.  I agree with this view.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau Act, which became law on 11 October 1996, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that it is an offence to publish or cause to be published the fact that an individual is a civilian officer (other than the bureau legal officer) or member of the staff of the bureau, or that an individual is related to any officer or member of staff of the bureau.  Media organisations have been made aware of the legal restraints that apply when reporting on the activities of the bureau.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>Regulation 14 of the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988 provides for the recruitment of persons having special technical qualifications to the force.  Members recruited under this provision do not have to fulfil all of the admission criteria required of members who are appointed to the regular uniform force.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner is satisfied that the level of training currently given to persons recruited under Regulation 14 for their technical qualification is sufficient to equip them to carry out their duties.  However, the question of training for all personnel is under constant review and additional training is arranged for individuals and groups as necessary.</P>

      <P>I have a Director of Prison Medical Services who is a qualified medical practitioner with higher qualifications in psychiatry.  He advises me on these issues on a continuing basis.  He also liaises, in tandem with other prison and Department officials, with outside hospitals in respect of outpatient care arrangements of the type referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The provision of a comprehensive accident and emergency treatment service within prisons to meet all possible medical emergencies is not feasible on practical grounds.  To do so would require enormous expenditure to ensure the presence of a fully qualified accident and emergency treatment team at all times in the prisons.  The physical plant and facilities associated with accident and emergency treatment is very extensive.</P>
      <P>There is in place a system of medical cover for all prisons and 24 hour medical orderly cover at all closed prisons.  However, medical orderlies who come on an injured prisoner, say, in the middle of the night, are only in a position to administer basic first aid and the doctor on call to the prison would, when contacted, tend to advise that appropriate further steps to manage an injured prisoner should be taken in a proper local accident and emergency unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent incidents at the Mater Hospital alluded to in the question, involved escape bids by prisoners undergoing necessary medical treatment there.  These incidents were extremely regrettable and new procedures for the management of prisoners being brought to the Mater and other hospitals are now being implemented.  The Mater Hospital authorities have been kept fully informed of these new arrangements and have agreed to keeping in close <Col N="1489" /> touch with my Department as the new procedures are implemented.</P>

      <P>The deployment of Garda personnel is the responsibility of the Garda authorities and they have informed me that as part of Operation Dóchas, introduced by the gardaí on 7 October 1996, there is one sergeant and two gardaí responsible for foot patrols in the area referred to in the question.  The area is also patrolled by routine mobile patrols, the Task Force and the Divisional Drug Units.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the area concerned is receiving appropriate Garda attention.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 304, 305 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have expressed concern about providing details of the procedures to obtain firearms and the number of firearms held by members of the Force, and I share that concern on the grounds of security and in the interests of crime prevention generally.  However, they have informed me that the question of firearms training in the Garda Síochána was examined in 1990 and the training and standard of proficiencies required for each firearm used by the force was set out at that time.  In addition, Garda management continue to review the training of members of the Force in the use of firearms as the need arises.</P>
      <P>I understand that gardaí undergo a basic firearms training course as part of their overall training while at the Garda College.  They are trained in the use and handling of firearms and must attain a specific standard of proficiency.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that each Garda division has a panel of members authorised to carry firearms on duty.  Selected members are trained in the use and handling of specialist weapons.  These members are required to attain a specified level of proficiency and are also required to attend refresher firearms training courses on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>There are three ways in which a person who is not a citizen of Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship: these are, by descent, by naturalisation and by marriage to an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Descent</i>
      </P>
      <P>A person whose mother or father was an Irish citizen at the time of his or her birth is automatically an Irish citizen.  A person whose grandfather or grandmother, but not his or her parents, were born in Ireland may become an Irish citizen by registering in the Foreign Births Register (FBR) at an Irish Embassy or Consular Office or at the Department of Foreign Affairs. There are also certain instances whereby a person can obtain Irish citizenship through his or her great-grandfather or great-grandmother.  The following table sets out the position in tabular form.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Note:</i> If &ldquo;C&rdquo; had registered prior to 31 December 1986, &ldquo;D&rdquo; would be able to register at any time.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986 introduced a provision whereby registration in the FBR after the aforementioned date granted citizenship from the date of registration only.</P>
    <P>Pending the reintegration of the national territory, a person, not otherwise an Irish citizen through descent, born in Northern Ireland after 6 December 1922 may declare himself or herself, in the prescribed manner to be an Irish citizen.  If the person is not of full age, i.e. 18 years, his-her parent or guardian may make the declaration.</P>
    <P>The President may grant Irish citizenship as a token of honour to a person or to the child or grandchild of a person who, in the opinion of the Government, has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Naturalisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice may, at her absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation, where statutory provisions are complied with. These provisions require that an applicant has resided in the State for 5 years, is of good character and intends to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation.  Section 16 of the Acts provides that the Minister may, in specific instances, waive some or all of the statutory requirements when considering an application.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Marriage to an Irish citizen (post-nuptial citizenship)</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Acts provides that a person who is not an Irish citizen may, following 3 years marriage to an Irish citizen, lodge a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship, provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration and the couple are living together as husband and wife and the spouse who is an Irish citizen submits an affidavit to that effect.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána policy is that after receipt of four false calls in any rolling six month period, the occupant of the premises is warned by written notice that Garda response will be withdrawn in the event of the number of false calls exceeding six.  If the number of false calls exceeds six during this period, a written notice is served on the occupant that the Garda will no longer respond to alarm activations from that premises.</P>

      <P>Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, empowers the Minister for Justice to make regulations providing for a national, voluntary, age card scheme as a means of helping to curb the supply of alcohol to persons under 18 years of age.  I am satisfied that the most acceptable and effective way of complementing the comprehensive set of provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 aimed at curbing under-age drinking is through the continued development of voluntary local age card schemes.</P>
      <P>I have no plans, therefore, to invoke legislation aimed at introducing a nation-wide age identity card at present.  However, as the Select Committee on Legislation and Security is currently examining licensing laws in general, I will ask that committee to look into this matter.

      <P>Leis an Acht Téarmaí Dlíthiúla Gaeilge, 1945, déantar socrú maidir le bunú, comhdhéanamh agus feidhmeanna an Choiste Chomhairlithigh um Théarmaí Dlíthiúla Gaeilge.  Is iad feidhmeanna reachtúla an Choiste ná breithniú a dhéanamh, agus tuairisc a thabhairt don Aire Dlí agus Cirt, i ndáil le déanamh Orduithe Reachtúla a dhearbhaíonn na hiontamhla caighdeánacha sa Ghaeilge do théarmaí dlí.  Tá sé d'fheidhm acu freisin comhairle a chur ar an Aire i dtaobh foirmeacha agus fasaigh a fhoilsiú i nGaeilge.  Sa tréimhse 1945 go 1956, rinneadh sraith d'Orduithe Reachtúla &mdash; 10 gcinn acu san iomlán &mdash; dar teideal &ldquo;Orduithe Téarmaí Dlíthiúla Gaeilge&rdquo;.  Tá obair an Choiste mar a leagadh amach í sna hOrduithe sin le fáil freisin i leabhrán dar teideal &ldquo;Téarmaí Dlí&rdquo; a d'fhoilsigh Oifig an tSoláthair.  Níor chuir an Coiste aon ábhar eile faoi bhráid mo Roinne lena fhoilsiú.</P>
      <P>Bhí an cruinniú ba dheireanaí ag an gCoiste ar 22 Samhain 1985.  Tuigtear dom nár tháinig ábhar ar bith eile chun cinn le linn obair aistriúcháin ó shin i leith ar ghá cruinniú den Choiste a thionól lena aghaidh.  Tuigtear dom freisin go ndéanann Rannóg Aistriúcháin an Oireachtais gach Acht den Oireachtas agus na hIonstraimí Reachtúla go léir a aistriú go Gaeilge ar bhonn leanúnach.  Ní dhéanann easpa cruinnithe an Choiste Chomhairlithigh um Théarmaí Dlíthiúla Gaeilge difear ar bith don obair aistriúcháin sin.  Tá líonadh na bhfolúntas ag an gCoiste faoi bhreithniú.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 328, 329 and 334 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel companion pass, which was introduced in 1990, is aimed primarily at incapacitated people who are unable to travel alone and who would otherwise be unable to benefit under the free travel scheme.  It is a special version of the standard travel pass and enables a companion to travel free with the pass-holder.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to the companion pass has been extended progressively since 1990 and amongst the categories currently covered under the scheme are people in receipt of a blind person's pension from my Department and certain other people who are currently, or who were previously, in receipt of disability allowance &mdash; formerly disabled person's maintenance allowance.  In July of this year, entitlement to the companion pass was extended to blind or visually impaired children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A free telephone rental allowance is available to people who are in receipt of a blind person's pension from my Department and who are registered telephone users.  The allowance covers the normal two-monthly rental charge on a land-based telephone and up to 20 free call units in each two-monthly billing period.  Service charges <Col N="1498" /> and calls in respect of mobile telephones are not covered under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The question of further extending the two schemes referred to by the Deputy so as to cover all registered blind people and to provide for service charges in respect of mobile telephones in circumstances where a land-based telephone connection is not available are matters which would have to be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The National Social Service Board, which has been operating under the aegis of my Department since June 1995, is the resource agency for the development of the independent information sector and for the development and registration of citizen's information centres.</P>
      <P>The board has recently prepared a three year strategy for the development of local information services in every county and major urban area which will be based on an expansion of the existing network of over 80 citizen information centres.  The purpose of the strategy, which is being considered in my Department, is to provide a high quality, independent, confidential and professional service which will meet the increasingly complex information needs of citizens across the spectrum of social services. This is in line with my own conviction that local access to independent, impartial and accurate information on social services is a basic right of every citizen.</P>
      <P>In relation to the areas referred to by the Deputy, I should mention that there is a citizen's information centre in Cobh and discussions have taken place in regard to Youghal.  Community groups or other organisations interested in developing citizen information centres in their areas should contact the National Social Service Board for further information and advice.</P>

      <P>My Department's policy in relation to lone parents and their children is two-fold &mdash; first, to provide basic income maintenance to help oneparent families and second, to help lone parents break out of poverty and dependency on social welfare payments by facilitating their taking up employment.</P>
      <P>As part of this latter policy aim, the new oneparent family payment, which I am introducing from January next, is designed to make employment a more feasible option for lone parents as it will increase to £6,000 the amount which a lone parent can earn without affecting title to the payment.  I am confident that over time it will prove successful in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333 and 339 together.</P>
      <P>Under existing arrangements, different methods of assessment are applied in calculating means derived from investments and property in the various social assistance schemes.  For instance, in the case of unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and supplementary welfare allowance, the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and capital in excess of this amount is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>For old age non-contributory, blind person's pension and carer's allowance purposes, an initial disregard of £200 is allowed, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.  In the case of widow's and orphan's non-contributory pension, an initial disregard of £200 is allowed and the balance is assessed at 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I have already made known, during the debate on this year's Social Welfare Bill, that I am taking the opportunity of the introduction of the new one-parent family payment and the new disability allowance to commence the process of standardising the provisions for the assessment of capital across all the various social assistance payments.  Under the new provisions, the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, will be assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>The extension of these provisions to other social assistance payments will be done progressively over a period of time in view of the significant administrative implications involved. There are about 430,000 people in receipt of a social assistance payment at present and the means of all those with capital will have to be reviewed on the introduction of any changes in this area.</P>
      <P>The substantial £2,000 initial disregard under the new arrangements will significantly reduce the effective interest rate for most recipients and will mean that claimants are not effectively assessed at 7.5 per cent until their level of capital approaches £25,000.  The cost of extending these arrangements to other social assistance payments is in the region of £9.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The free travel companion pass, which was introduced in 1990, is aimed primarily at incapacitated people who are unable to travel alone and who would otherwise be unable to benefit under the free travel scheme.  It is a special version of the standard travel pass and <Col N="1501" /> enables a companion to travel free when accompanying the pass-holder.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to the free travel companion pass scheme has been progressively extended since 1990 and is currently available to certain old age pensioners and certain invalidity pensioners aged both under and over 66 years of age.  Since last year, the companion pass has been provided to all care-recipients whose carer is receiving a carer's allowance from my Department.  In this way, the carer is able to travel free when accompanying the person being cared for.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that the situation envisaged by the Deputy is met to a large degree by the existing arrangements.  The extension of the companion pass scheme to include additional categories not covered at the present time would have cost implications which would have to be examined in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 337 and 338 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; SWA &mdash; scheme is administered by the eight regional health boards on behalf of my Department and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Under the SWA scheme a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which could not reasonably be expected to be met of weekly income.  These payments are known as exceptional needs payments &mdash; ENPs.</P>
      <P>Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  At present, all cash income, including the net cash value of any non-cash earnings derived from personal exertions is assessible as means for SWA purposes.</P>
      <P>At present my Department funds some 40 money advice and budgeting services &mdash; MABS &mdash; projects around the country.  In providing the service, an important element of the approach is the targeting of families who have been identified as having particular problems with debt and moneylending.  Local projects are established on a partnetship basis, with the involvement of all relevant statutory, voluntary and community interests.  The credit union movement plays a key part in the successful operation of the service and in opening up alternative sources of credit for people with particular debt problems.  The MABS service is an independent and confidential service.</P>
      <P>There are merits to the local employment trading system, and I will have the implications of supporting such a system examined in greater detail of my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Disabled person's maintenance allowance &mdash; disabled person's maintenance allowance &mdash; transferred to my Department from 2 October 1996 and is now known as disability allowance. The disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations, 1996, made by the Minister for <Col N="1503" /> Health had removed a provision whereby the amount payable to a couple who were both eligible for disabled person's maintenance allowance could not exceed one personal rate plus an increase for an adult dependant.  In May of this year the Department of Health advised health boards of the new provisions and it is understood that about 100 couples were affected by the revised arrangements.</P>
    <P>Provision for the payment of two full personal rates to couples who are individually eligible has been in existence from the commencement of disability allowance in my Department, and implications are processed without reference to a spouse or partner's eligibility for the allowance.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force.  The scheme has proved to be a worthwhile initiative with over 15,000 persons currently in receipt of the weekly allowance.  I expect that this number will have increased to around 16,000 by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a further increase in the number of places available under the scheme to 17,000.  This is a significant increase on the number of places which was available when the scheme commenced in 1993, which was 3,000.  I will keep the present limit under review to ensure that there are adequate places available on the scheme for persons who are genuinely interested in returning to the labour market.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Task Force was established by the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications in February 1992 and reported in October of that year.</P>
      <P>Its report made detailed and wide-ranging recommendations under the broad headings of organisation and structures, tourism product development and tourism financing and marketing.  Most of the key areas which the task force identified as requiring action or attention, for example, tourism priority in the allocation of European Union funds, marketing and seasonality, have been taken account of in the current community support framework and more specifically in the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>Since the report a new Department of Tourism and Trade has been established and, following the A D Little Review, the work of Bord Fáilte has been refocused broadly along lines similar to task force recommendations.  Product marketing companies have been set up in a number of niche areas and the Tourism Council has been in operation since September 1993.  In so far as marketing is concerned, subsequent measures have since built on the recommendations of the task force, for example, the overseas tourism marketing initiative and the recently launched &ldquo;Tourism Brand Ireland&rdquo; campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has also been made in progressing issues highlighted by the task force which are the responsibility of other Government Ministers, both through the work of the Tourism Council <Col N="1506" /> and bilateral contacts with the Minister concerned.  Obvious examples include the areas of taxation and access transport which of course require to be addressed on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the recommendations of the Tourism Task Force have in the main been implemented or continue to be addressed where issues are of an ongoing nature. It will be appreciated, however, that the setting up of new tourism structures and other significant developments in the tourism area has meant that the report has, in large measure now been overtaken by events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in response to previous similar questions, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-1993 did not <Col N="1507" /> provide support for tourist accommodation projects.  Based on the readiness of the commercial accommodation market to respond to growth in visitor numbers without grant assistance this policy was, in general, continued under the current operational programme.</P>
      <P>The current programme recognised however that there were a number of market segments where the quality of existing accommodation was deficient and included a provision to assist on a selective basis, investment in certain areas.  These are: accommodation-related conference and leisure facilities and a limited scheme of accommodation improvements to existing small and medium sized hotels with a current capacity of up to 100 bedrooms and graded up to and including three star.</P>
      <P>There is limited grant aid for certain specialist accommodation needs such as: caravan and camping park facilities; upgrading and improvement of existing buildings for hostel or other specialist accommodation and associated facilities on branded walking routes; provision of new and improved accommodation at approved outdoor pursuits centres in remote areas currently without appropriate accommodation; improvement of existing accommodation at approved residential equestrian centres; horsedrawn caravan and motor-home investments; the additional cost of providing, in existing hotels, suitable access-friendly accommodation for people with disabilities and improved access for people with disabilities at hotel and major visitor centres.  In general, in keeping with the overall strategy in the programme, support is aimed primarily at the enhancement of existing investment rather than supporting new development and all accommodation supported must be registered or approved, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I should add that the funds provided under the programme for tourism development projects are generally over-subscribed and, unfortunately, those available for specialist accommodation related developments are fully committed.  These and other aspects of the programme's operations will be considered fully in the context of the upcoming mid-term evaluation of the programme.</P>
      <P>Other EU funded programmes such as the programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry and the Leader II programme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the local urban and rural development programme provide support for smaller tourism initiatives.  In the Border counties assistance may also be available under the IFI and INTERREG programmes and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, again on a limited basis.  This includes limited provision for accommodation projects, including in some cases, guesthouses and bed and breakfast establishments, on a basis compatible with that in the Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All registered and approved tourism <Col N="1508" /> accommodation has been deemed eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  A sum of £52 million of this £208 million fund has been specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country.  A similar scheme especially for the Border counties, was recently introduced under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund.  However, I understand that all the funds under this latter scheme have been committed. Investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax relief under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, in all the circumstances, the range of supports already in place in respect of tourism accommodation projects generally is sufficient.  The industry has responded well to market forces and major increases in tourist numbers and spending, which have helped sustain steady expansion in tourist accommodation, especially in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 350, 351 and 352 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has achieved record and sustained tourism growth in recent years with 4.25 million overseas visitors in 1995.  This does not, in my opinion, constitute mass tourism nor is the Government interested in developing a mass tourism product in Ireland.  Unlike, for example, some destinations where tourism is concentrated in narrow coastal areas, we can achieve a wide geographical spread of tourism.  This, coupled with our low population density and improving seasonal spread, means that we are better placed to preserve our environment, while at the same time maintaining a unique holiday experience for our visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> The Government's policy on tourism development takes full account of the value of the image of Ireland's clean, green environment and the consequent need to protect it.  The ambitious growth targets set for the tourism sector relate to growth in overseas revenue and job creation and emphasise the need to develop a sustainable industry concentrating on a quality product rather than quantity.  The strategy of increasing tourism revenue yield is an integral element of the &ldquo;Brand Ireland&rdquo; campaign launched last week.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 acknowledges that a balance must be struck between tourism development and preservation of the environment.  Measures to achieve this objective, as set out in the programme, include the following: improving the seasonality profile of Irish tourism &mdash; the aim is that by 1999, 75 per cent of visitors will arrive in Ireland outside the peak July-August period compared with about 70 per cent at present; attracting high yield business &mdash; priority is given to marketing conference and incentive business and other quality niche and activity markets such as cruising, golf, equistrian, shoppers and users of paid services such as accommodation and car hire; where possible enhancing existing product investment rather than creating new developments; a wide geographical dispersal to minimise capacity problems; capital projects recommended for assistance under the programme are required to comply with all environmental regulatory requirements as a condition for grant approval and support for overseas marketing under the programme is weighted towards projects that aim to extend the season; and progress on the consistency between tourism developments and the principle of sustainability will continue to be monitored as part of the programme.</P>
    <P>Statutory responsibility for environmental protection generally rests with the Minister for the Environment while the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has certain statutory responsibilities in relation to the protection of heritage areas.  I understand that the heritage services &mdash; National Parks and Wildlife Service and National Monuments and Historic Properties Service &mdash; of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht operate an ongoing review of the impact of visitors on heritage sites in order that suitable control and management procedures are put in place and applied as necessary. Similarly, the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service aims to keep visiting levels at each heritage property to the optimum number of visitors consistent with site protection and presentation and to manage such properties accordingly.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the need for the ongoing monitoring and management of the impact of tourism on the environment, particularly during the peak tourism season.  Such problems are already being addressed in the context of the <Col N="1510" /> strategies and monitoring arrangements that I have already outlined.  I am satisfied that the issue is afforded a high priority by the relevant agencies and there are no further plans by my Department at this time to introduce any additional measures in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under the mechanism of the interdepartmental policy committee on local development, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr. Carey, chaired a task force on the funding arrangements in the Border region.  The report of the task force which was presented to the Dáil on 24 October 1996, sets out details of the general EU funding available in the Border region, including the level of funds allocated to tourism development under the Operational Programme for Tourism, the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Tourism projects in the Border region can avail of EU funding from a variety of sources.  Support for tourism initiatives is available, on a national basis, from the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, the programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry which has an agritourism scheme, the Leader II programme and the local urban and rural development programme.  Other sources, which are available to the Border region alone, include the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG II Programme, the International Fund for Ireland and the special support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
      <P>In relation to trade, neither the Department nor its agency, An Bord Tráchtála administer any EU funded programmes which are devoted exclusively to the Border region.  However, ABT, the implementing agency for the marketing sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development, 1994-99, are involved in trade promotion in the region, as they are in the country as a whole.  They offer marketing services, such as workshops and seminars which specifically focus on the Border area and work closely with the IDB and LEDU in many joint projects with a cross-Border dimension.</P>
      <P>Projects are selected for grant assistance on the basis of their individual merits and their contribution to the stated aims of the individual programmes and measures concerned rather than on the basis of geographical spread.</P>

      <P>I had a meeting recently with representatives of the Irish Hotels Federation, the Town and Country Homes Association and the Irish Farm Holidays Association during which they presented a submission on the statutory licensing of all tourist accommodation.  This submission is currently being examined.</P>
      <P>It has been not only my view but also that of my predecessor that the statutory licensing of all tourist accommodation would not be practical nor would it necessarily lead to an improvement in accommodation standards to any great extent. In addition to potential difficulties as regards policing and prosecution, licensing could in fact also lead to a reduction in the accommodation bank available, particularly during the high season and at festival times.</P>
      <P>At present unapproved operators do not have access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte and the tourist information office network, nor do they have access to tax breaks or other subsidised finance schemes which are available to the approved sector.  The Pilot Tax Relief Scheme for Certain Resort Areas and the subsidised tourism loan schemes were carefully designed so that only approved operators would be eligible.</P>
      <P>Unapproved operators are, on the other hand, obliged to comply in the same way as the approved sector with official requirements, for example, in the areas of taxation, planning, fire and safety, and hygiene.  My Department has been impressing on the relevant enforcement agencies the need for constant vigilance to ensure that their policing or inspection practices do not discriminate as between the approved and unapproved sectors.</P>
      <P>The ideal solution would be for unapproved operators to become approved and I can confirm that both Bord Fáilte and the recognised approving bodies will be mounting an information campaign encouraging operators to seek approval and explaining clearly not only what is involved in terms of procedure but also in terms of the benefits to be gained from being part of the approved tourist accommodation sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99 agreed between the Irish Government and the European Commission in July 1994, proposed that with the support of the European Regional Development Fund, a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates be built in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The first EU Operational Programme for Tourism (1989-93) had designated Dublin as the most suitable location for a National Conference Centre.  This view was endorsed in an independent study in 1991 on the feasibility of such a centre on the basis that Dublin, as the capital city, has entry points from most major markets by sea or air, a significantly greater concentration and range of suitable accommodation than other areas, and all the necessary support services for a major international conference centre.  The Dublin location was therefore specified when the open tendering competition was launched in 1995 to find a suitable private sector developer for the project.</P>
      <P>Following the failure of that competition, in which one of the participants proposed an O'Connell Street site, to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, an alternative strategy was pursued whereby Bord Fáilte, under the aegis of the independent Management Board for Product Development, was asked to examine further an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved, under the Programme, for public and similar bodies.</P>
      <P>The possibility of an O'Connell Street Conference Centre proposal, involving a public-private joint venture, was also explored but I was informed by Bord Fáilte, who are responsible for assessing such proposals, that the promoters were not in a position to submit the necessary outline details within deadlines set to allow assessment of suitability for inclusion in the alternative strategy.</P>
      <P>Upon completion of their examination of the RDS proposal, Bord Fáilte and the Management Board commissioned an independent cost-benefit analysis.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consulting firm who were selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure.  The results of this analysis were favourable to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed, on 5 November, to make a submission to the European Commission, whose formal agreement is required for the project to go ahead, recommending approval of the proposed development by the RDS of the Conference Centre at their Ballsbridge site.</P>

      <P>The Local Employment Service (LES) was established initially in the 12 original partnership areas and two non-designated areas on the model as outlined in the Interim Report of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment. The LES provides a range of services for certain categories of persons, in particular those who are long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>The aim of the service is to provide a gateway, or access point, to all the options which should be available to enable a long-term unemployed person return to the world of work.  These options include guidance, training, education and employment support, as well as a job placement service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Northside LES now has two local employment centres in operation, one in Glin Road and the other in Greendale shopping centre where a one-to-one employment guidance and counselling service is available for LES clients. Three Job Clubs are operational in the area.  The Job Clubs provide a meeting point for people who are actively looking for employment.  By working together members can use the facilities of the Jobs Clubs to actively plan, seek and, hopefully, achieve realistic work opportunities. The three Job Clubs are located in the Northside Centre for the Unemployed, St. Monica's Youth Club, Edenmore and the FÁS Training Centre, Baldoyle.  The LES also includes a network of Contact Points, where information, referral and registration services are available.  Four Contact Points are already operating &mdash; in the FÁS office in Coolock, the FÁS Training Centre in Baldoyle, PARC in Bunratty Drive, Coolock and TARGET in Donaghmede.  The intention is to establish Contact Points in Edenmore, Rosary <Col N="1515" /> College Adult Education Centre, St. Benedict's, Kilbarrack and Donneycarney.</P>
    <P>The LES are also planning to establish a local Contact Point, initially on a one-day-a-week basis, in the Darndale area.  The needs of the Darndale area will be assessed and the service will be enhanced if required.  The target date for the establishment of this limited service is mid-December 1996.  The development of the Darndale service was delayed until this time because of its proximity to the existing employment centre in Glin Road.  A similar type service is also planned for the Kilmore and Moyclare areas.</P>
    <P>The Government has already indicated its intention to expand the Local Employment Service nationwide on a phased basis.  It is proposed to expand the service to four new areas in 1997.  These areas will be determined on the basis of their relative deprivation, concentrating initially on large urban areas suffering the problems associated with high unemployment and drug abuse.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland</P>
      <P>During 1995 a total of £12,046,251 was paid to companies located in Cork city and county.  As the IDA does not have direct access to EU funds, it is not possible to break down this amount into Exchequer and EU components.</P>
      <P>Forbairt</P>
      <P>Forbairt manages financial support programmes on behalf of the Department of Enterprise and Employment under a number of broad headings.</P>
      <P>1.  It manages financial support programmes under the provisions of the Industrial Development Acts, 1986-95.  The total amount disbursed to firms in County Cork, including Cork city, in 1995 was £5,322,366 including £1,227,419 paid to Cork County Council.  Some of these funds are co-financed by the European Social Fund.  If individual projects meet the criterion set down by the ESF they are co-financed at a rate of 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>2.  Forbairt manages the Industry Research and Development Initiative (Measure 1 of the Sub-Programme for Indigenous Industry Development), and Retex Programmes which also provide funds to enterprises, both being funded by the EU to a maximum of 50 per cent. In 1995, £595,565 and £28,602 was provided to firms in County Cork under these headings.</P>
      <P>ESF</P>
      <P>Two EU Human Resources Community Initiatives &mdash; EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT &mdash; are supported by the European Social Fund.  Both Initiatives commenced in 1995 and will operate until the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>The EU contributes a maximum of 75 per cent of the total cost of each project and project promoters are required to raise the matching funds from other sources.</P>

      <P>Community Employment (CE) is the main manpower intervention by the State in respect of the long-term unemployed and other special categories such as those referred by the National Rehabilitation Board (NRB) and lone parents.  Its purpose is to provide temporary work experience together with some training that would assist those concerned in obtaining mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>Participants are generally engaged for a 12 month period for an average of 39 hours per fortnight.  However, some participants may be re-engaged for further periods with the agreement of FÁS where such participants are key participants and no other suitable eligible person is available or where the participant would benefit from additional training-development.  In particular, participants on the part-time job option, which is targeted at those over 35 and more than three years unemployed, who have an annual contract of engagement for 12 months, can have their contract renewed for up to three years.</P>
      <P>As CE is designed to provide temporary rather than on-going opportunities for unemployed people, any decision to provide extensions other than those outlined above would be contrary to the objective of the programme.  Also, as the programme is operating close to capacity relative to available resources, such extensions would be at the expense of potential participants waiting for a place on the programme.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the updating and consolidation of the body of legislation dealing with credit unions, which dates in some cases from 1893, are well advanced.  The scope of the Bill has necessarily required detailed attention on the part of both my Department and the Attorney General's Office.  However, I am pleased to be able to say that a first draft of the Bill, which involves up to 200 sections, has been received from the Parliamentary Draftsman, and it is presently being examined in detail by my Department and the Registrar of Friendly <Col N="1520" /> Societies, who has overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of credit unions. Discussions to finalise the text of the Bill will take place with the Parliamentary Draftsman shortly. Given the length of the Bill, I expect that it will take another few weeks before I will be in a position to submit the Bill to Government for approval.</P>
      <P>The Credit Union Bill is my major priority for legislative action in the coming months and, while I am not able to give a precise date for publication at present, I can assure Deputies that every effort is being made to have the Bill published before the end of the present session. Upon publication, it is my intention that interested parties will be given an opportunity to review the terms of the Bill before it is considered by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, official price control on petroleum products was discontinued on 1 October 1991 with the entry into force of the Competition Act, 1991.  In the meantime, the objective and thrust of public policy have been to promote fair and increased competition in all sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications that the price per litre for diesel in respect of the period August to October 1996 is as follows: August 1996, 56.82p; September 1996, 57.68p; October 1996, 60.49p.</P>
      <P>The reason for the increase is the result of the rise in crude oil prices on international markets. The rise was influenced by, among other things, concerns regarding stability in the Middle East and its implications for future supply.</P>

      <P>Geesala Agricultural Bank and Glenhest Agricultural Bank, are societies which were registered under the Friendly Societies Act, 1896.  Geesala Agricultural Bank was registered on 15 November 1898 and was wound up by Order of the Circuit Court on 14 November 1933. The final winding-up is believed to have been effected by an order of the Circuit Court made on 23 April 1945.  Glenhest Agricultural Bank was registered on 19 May 1901 and is believed to have been wound up by order of the Circuit Court made on 1 May 1934.  The winding-up of Glenhest is believed to have been completed in 1938.  Since the dates of winding-up, these societies have ceased to exist, and consequently the question of their purchase does not arise.</P>
      <P>The above information has been obtained from correspondence files in the Registry of Friendly Societies.  However, despite a thorough search of the Registry and the National Archives it has not been possible to trace the public record files of either society.  While this is a matter of regret for the Registrar, it appears that the files have not been in the Registry for a considerable time. Having regard to the fact that each society ceased to exist more than 50 years ago, the Registrar believes that there is little point in undertaking any further searches of his office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 379, 380 and 381 together.</P>
      <P>The fall in beef consumption within the EU and the changes in third country imports since the BSE crisis erupted last March have affected our beef exports and accordingly the overall Irish food sector trade.  The main impact of the BSE crisis on the beef trade has been a reduction in our exports to EU markets which have been compensated by increased exports to third country markets and sales into intervention.  Irish beef exports to EU countries are forecast to fall by 32 per cent in 1996 compared to 1995 while exports to third country markets are expected to rise by 23 per cent.  Russia is our most important export market, having increased to an estimated 140,000 tonnes.  Sales of Irish beef into intervention to date this year amount to approximately 50,000 tonnes.  It is not possible to predict the value or volume of exports to individual markets in 1997 but it is hoped that the strong performance achieved this year will be maintained.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the crisis various measures have been put in place to stabilise the industry at both production and processing level to maintain export markets and to restore consumer confidence.  I am making every effort to seek the reopening of the few remaining markets that remain closed &mdash; notably Iran and Libya.</P>
      <P>To address the oversupply situation in the market the Council of Ministers has agreed to measures which will apply over the next two years.  In addition, proposals on identification and labelling have been tabled by the EU Commission and I will be striving to have these proposals advanced in the Council during the Irish Presidency.  These measures along with an adequately EU funded promotion campaign should strengthen consumer confidence in beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> Following is the detailed information requested by the Deputy.  The volume and value of the top ten beef markets in 1996 is estimated as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 382, 391, 394, 396 and 402 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Control of Horses Bill, 1996, which has been brought forward pursuant to a commitment in the A Government of Renewal programme, has been passed by Dáil Éireann and is shortly to receive a Report Stage reading in Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA) letter in the matter of funding regarding urban horses.  The Bill proposes to place the primary responsibility for dealing with this localised phenomenon on local authorities.  It will be for the local authority in each case to decide, within the parameters of the legislation, what arrangements it may wish to make in this regard, including arrangements which may include organisations such as DSPCA carrying out certain functions on its behalf on a defined basis.</P>
      <P>Representations seeking funding have been made to me by, and on behalf of, the DSPCA.  I have long been aware of the very valuable work which the society carries out for the welfare of animals generally in the Dublin area and was pleased to make a grant of £50,000 to the society last year to alleviate its financial difficulties.  The society were informed at the time that this was a once-off payment.  Deputies will appreciate that I must necessarily reconcile a great many demands with the funds at my disposal, and I regret to say that it is simply not possible for me to make a further grant to the society at this juncture.  I will, however, bear the society's case very much in mind and should resources permit I will consider further assistance at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards cruelty and welfare issues, I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that the Bill provides for increases in the maximum penalties under subsection (1) of section 1 of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, on summary conviction to a fine of £1,500 and-or six months' imprisonment and on conviction on indictment to a fine of £10,000 and/or two years' imprisonment.  In increasing these penalties I am <Col N="1529" /> reflecting public feeling on this issue and am proposing to provide the courts with the means to deal more harshly with those who mistreat animals.</P>

      <P>The townland of Ashfield, in the district electoral division of Arless, County Laois was considered by the disadvantaged areas appeals panel in conjunction with other townlands in the area which had appealed for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme. However, based on the information supplied by those farmers in the area who were surveyed, the stocking density of the townland exceeded the limit of 0.99 livestock units per forage hectare.</P>
      <P>The appeals panel attempted to aggregate the results of Ashfield with those of other townlands in the DED to see if a group of townlands could be identified which would together satisfy the criteria.  However, since most of the other townlands also exceeded the stocking density limit, this was not possible, and the panel had no option but to exclude this area from its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 29 July 1996, a letter was received in my Department requesting an explanation for the omission of Ashfield and expressing the fear that this omission had resulted from incorrect processing of the data received.  Following receipt <Col N="1532" /> of this letter, the survey returns were thoroughly rechecked, and it was found that all of the data had been accurately entered on computer, resulting in confirmation that the figures used by the appeals panel in making its decision were correct.  A reply was duly issued on 12 August 1996 giving the results of the re-examination relating to Ashfield, and a detailed explanation of the way the data had been processed and how the appeals panel had used the results in arriving at its decisions.</P>
    <P>My Department has since had further correspondence about this matter but no justification has been found for a change in the stated position regarding the ineligibility of Ashfield for disadvantaged status.</P>

      <P>Details in respect of the 1996 cattle headage-beef cow headage and sheep headage schemes are outlined on the attached table.</P>
      <P>Before payment can issue to any applicant under headage and premium schemes, other than the ewe premium and slaughter premium schemes and applicants with under 15 livestock units, a valid area aid application must be submitted.  As part of the integrated administration and control system, required by the EU, Ireland was committed to developing a new area aid related land parcel identification system (LPIS) in 1996.</P>
      <P>Given the increased levels of checks and controls associated with the new system it was inevitable that some delay in making payments, when measured against the 1995 performance, would arise.  Notwithstanding this, so far in 1996 some 914,000 payments totalling over £666 million have been made to farmers under the various headage and premia schemes including the BSE compensation package.  The position with regard to the 1996 schemes is that payments commenced on target and some 486,000 payments valued at £408 million have been made under these schemes to date.  This compares most favourably with the payment positions at similar times in 1994 and previous years which were as follows:</P>

      <P>Under the An Bord Bia Act, 1994 the chairman and the ordinary members, of whom there are currently 13, of the board of that body are required to be persons having knowledge or experience of consumer requirements.  The An Bord Bia (Amendment) Act, 1996, increased the ordinary membership of that board from thirteen to fourteen and provided also for the appointment of one ordinary member on the nomination of an organisation representative of consumer interests.  The Consumers Association of Ireland have been designated as the nominating body for the filling of that additional post and I am currently awaiting nominations from them.  While the legislation governing the membership of the boards of the other two bodies does not contain any specific provision in relation to consumer interests such interests are taken into account when the boards are being appointed.</P>

      <Quest>whether a decision has been taken by the EU that, as and from 1 January 1997, the maximum amount of headage premia payable to a farmer is to be reduced from £5,000 to £3,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 403 and 404 together.</P>
      <P>A formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of the negotiations in 1994 on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  The Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to this measure represented too high a percentage (62 per cent) of the overall allocation to the structural improvement and rural development element of the operational programme.</P>
      <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with many recommendations.  Following consultation with the farm bodies on the consultants' report, I have made a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes in 1997 and following years.</P>
      <P>No decision has yet been made by the Commission.  I will, of course, announce the details as soon as Commission agreement has been obtained.</P>

      <P>The position is that before payment <Col N="1540" /> can issue to any applicant under headage and premium schemes, other than the ewe premium and slaughter premium schemes and applicants with under 15 livestock units, a valid area aid application must be submitted.  As part of the integrated administration and control system, required by the EU, Ireland was committed to developing a new area aid related land parcel identification system (LPIS) in 1996.  This involved the digitisation, on a computer database, of all land parcels outlined on maps supplied by farmers between 1993 and 1995.  In 1996, area aid application forms were issued to farmers on which were printed, in so far as it was possible to do so, the unique land parcel identification number and gross area for land parcels declared by them in 1995.  Farmers were also given copies of their 1995 applications so that they could relate the new LPIS numbers with the slots they had declared and shown on maps between 1993 and 1995.  The intention was that in those cases where there was no change in lands being farmed between 1995 and 1996 the farmers concerned, having checked the pre-printed data on the 1996 application form against the maps supplied, would simply complete the application form and return it to the area aid unit.  It was anticipated that up to 40,000 applications would require amendment and redigitising of maps.  As it turned out however over 93,000 of the 131,000 area aid applications submitted by farmers in 1996 required amendment and the associated maps had to be redigitised.  I believe that given the magnitude and complexity of the task involved in introducing the new LPIS, the area aid unit of my Department has achieved very significant progress in a relatively short period and I would not accept that area aid applications were mishandled.</P>
      <P>Given the increased levels of checks and controls associated with the new LPIS it was inevitable that some delay in making payments, when measured against the 1995 performance, would arise.  Notwithstanding this, so far in 1996, some 914,000 payments totalling over £666 million have been made to farmers under the various headage and premia schemes including the BSE compensation package.  The position with regard to the 1996 schemes is that payments commenced on target and some 486,000 payments valued at £408 million have been made under these schemes to date.  This compares most favourably with the payment positions at similar times in 1994 and previous years wich were as follows:</P>

      <P>My Department does not have information on the amounts paid by farmers for TB tests for either 1995 or 1996.  The position is that in 1995 farmers paid their veterinary surgeon for private tests, the cost of which was a matter between farmers and veterinary surgeons.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements for the disease eradication schemes which commenced on 1 April 1996, farmers pay for the first herd test each year.  In recognition of this, farmer levies have been significantly reduced.  The Exchequer carries the costs of any second or subsequent herd tests each year.  The level of fees payable by a farmer is a matter between farmers and veterinary surgeons.</P>

    <P>The work obligations of standard, deepwater and frontier exploration licences differ in so far as drilling the first exploration well is concerned. In the case of a standard licence the licensee has an obligation to drill during the first three years of the licence, whereas the obligation arises during the first four years for a deepwater licence. For a frontier licence the well need not be drilled until the second phase of the licence and as the length of the phases varies this could be into the eighth year of the licence.  As a result some of the well obligations under these licences have not yet arisen.  Exploration work has been carried out by the licensees on all of these licences.  However, one licensee did not meet its well obligation programme and the licence was revoked.</P>
    <P>With regards to the presence of commercial quantities of oil and/or natural gas, I take it that the Deputy is referring to this year's discovery of gas by Enterprise Oil in their second well in the Slyne Trough.  Enterprise intended testing this discovery, but despite their best efforts they were unable to do so because of mechanical problems arising in the well.  It is my understanding that they will be acquiring new seismic data in the area of the discovery in order to determine the optimum location for further drilling.</P>
    <P>Statoil will be drilling an appraisal well and conducting an extended well test on the Connemara Field early next year in order to establish its ability to produce and to give more certainty to the calculation of oil-in-place.  Oil from the extended test will be collected and sold and will be the first commercial oil production from Ireland.  If the test results are satisfactory, Statoil plan to move into a rolling development programme for full production of the field.</P>
    <P>There is now a near record number of exploration licences in place and this year seismic activity has been at a near record level also.  As licences and seismic acquisition are a necessary precursor to drilling, I am hopeful that exploration drilling levels will continue to be at a high level for some time to come.</P>
    <P>Details of petroleum exploration and development authorisations are contained in a six <Col N="1546" /> monthly report for Dáil Éireann which is available in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 432, 437 and 438 together.</P>
      <P>Intensive analysis of the report of the review group has been under way in the Department of the Marine since the report was published and a new national policy on fishing vessel safety is currently being finalised with a view to implementing the recommendations and objectives of the review group, including those relating to fleet policy.  This will require the putting in place of the necessary legislative framework, structures and logistical and financial resources, including EU and Exchequer funds.  I am totally committed to pursuing these resources. I propose, in this regard, to seek additional allocations of Structural Funds, in the context of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework, to support the implementation of the recommendations of the review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to fleet renewal a consultancy study is currently being undertaken to analyse, from all perspectives, the relative socio-economic and commercials merits of the introduction of new <Col N="1550" /> vessels into the whitefish fleet.  The outcome of this study will inform an assessment of future directions for fleet policy having regard to all relevant factors, including developments at EU level.</P>
    <P>While the proposed comprehensive safety programme for the fishing sector will clearly need to be phased in over a period of time, a number of measures are already being implemented on foot of the report of the review group.</P>
    <P>The Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara are reviewing safety training requirements in light of the review group's recommendations in this area and in that context a newly refurbished mobile coastal training unit will be launched shortly which will bring training in the safe operation of fishing vessels directly to fishermen in ports around the coast.</P>
    <P>Having regard to on-shore radiocommunications facilities, the Department has placed orders for new medium frequency radio transmitters at Belmullet and Rosslare which will provide greater radio coverage and improve response to distress calls from fishermen off the north west coast and in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>In July I established a Marine Safety Working Group which aims to increase safety awareness among seafarers, including fishermen.  The Working Group, which brings together representatives of various organisations having an active role in promoting marine safety, is to shortly issue a booklet containing guidelines to reduce machinery failure in fishing vessels, the main cause of emergency incidents involving such vessels.</P>

      <P>In 1995 an amount of £3.497 million was allocated in respect of projects in Cork by my Department and by semi-State bodies under the aegis of my Department.  Of that amount, EU aid amounted to £2,690 million while Exchequer aid amounted to £0.807 million.  Details of the projects and the level of funding in respect of each project are provided in tabular format attached.</P>
      <P>In addition, some research projects focused on a number of counties, including Cork.  It is not possible to be specific about amounts proper to individual counties in those instances.</P>

      <P>In 1995, the Department of the Marine commenced improvement works costing some £77,000 at Derryinver.  The works involved the provision of a slipway, a small berthing wall, additional lighting, parking area and pier kerbing.  The works were completed this year.  During the course of the works proposals were submitted by local interests to modify the scheme to include a low level landing platform.  This proposal was examined by my Department's engineers and would have resulted in a doubling of cost for the overall project.  Given the level of funding available and demand for essential works at strategically important fishery harbours, I am not in a position to provide any further funding for additional works at Derryinver at the present time.</P>

      <P>A number of pelagic vessel owners have indicated to the Department plans to proceed with investment in new vessels.  There has already been significant private investment in the Irish pelagic fleet, within existing fleet capacity constraints, in recent years and the fleet is now among the most modern in Europe.</P>
      <P>Any plans for further investment by pelagic vessel owners will have to take account of current licensing policy parameters notably the &ldquo;one for one&rdquo; replacement tonnage requirement.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 444 and 445 together.</P>
      <P>The report referred to by Deputy Dempsey relates to a survey of the Beaufort Dyke munitions site which was published by the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department in January 1996.  I am arranging for a copy of the report to be sent to the Deputy for his information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> I am pleased to note from that report that an analysis of edible fish and shellfish showed no significant pollution.  The analysis of seabed sediment showed that levels of heavy metals were similar to the safe levels elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I was concerned, however, to note that the survey identified dumping of munitions outside the confines of the charted dumpsite.  My colleague at the Department of the Marine, Minister of State Gilmore raised these concerns with the UK Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and the Environment, Scottish Office, Lord Lindsay and the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State, UK Ministery of Defence, Lord Howe at a meeting in London earlier this year.  It was agreed at that meeting that the Scottish Office would undertake a new study on the Beaufort's Dyke dumpsite in order to remap and rechart the extent of the dumpsite and distribution of munitions within the site.  British and Irish scientists co-operated on the methodology and methods of analysis for the study.  The survey was completed at the end of August and it is expected that the report will be published within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>A senior chemist from the Marine Institute will be meeting with British scientists before the report is published.  Arrangements are under way for a meeting with Lord Howe and Lord Lindsay in December to assess the results of the survey and to discuss what further steps are required.</P>

      <P>Preparations are under way for the completion of an environmental quality status report (QSR) for the entire area covered by the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) to which Ireland is a party.  The information gathered in this report will allow for assessment of the environment of the area, including water quality, and will provide a firm basis for future monitoring and management of the maritime area covered by the North-East Atlantic covered by the OSPAR Convention.  For the purpose of the report the Convention area has been divided into five sub-regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> Ireland and the United Kingdom are required to prepare the report in respect of that part of the North-East Atlantic region (Celtic Seas) extending westwards of the UK mainland to the edge of the continental shelf (200m depth).  The area includes all of Ireland's marine and coastal areas.</P>
    <P>The report will comprise of: (i) a compilation of existing knowledge (physics, chemistry, biology, human activities) of the area; (ii) an assessment of this information in relation to agreed criteria of environmental quality; and (iii) a statement of the prevailing condition of the area.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with similar reports on the four other parts of the OSPAR region, the Celtic Seas QSR will be assimilated into a Convention-wide QSR that will be published in the year 2000.  It is expected that the draft of the report in respect of the Irish/UK region will be completed early in 1988.</P>
    <P>Ireland is working in close conjunction with the UK in completing the Celtic Seas report. However, much of the initial work in sourcing, compiling and reviewing information is being carried out independently by Irish and UK scientists.  I cannot comment on the UK budget in that regard.  It is a matter for the UK Government to put in place appropriate structures and arrangements to provide the input to complete the report as required by OSPAR.</P>
    <P>The Irish contribution to the QSR is being managed by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Departments of the Environment and of the Marine.  The institute has established a QSR Office at the Forbairt Laboratory in Shannon, County Clare, staffed by a team of four marine scientists.  The team is lead by Mr. Rick Boelens, a recognised international expert in marine environmental science, who has been seconded to the Institute for this 2-year project.  The cost of the Irish contribution to the report is expected to be in the region of £300,000 &mdash; the cost to be divided between the Department of the Marine and the Department of the Environment.</P>
