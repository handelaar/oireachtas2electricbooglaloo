      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.  I welcome the recent publication of the report of the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on the Office of the Attorney General.  Its recommendations deserve to be fully and seriously considered and I am arranging to have this done.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that a provisional report from the Constitution Review Group on Article 30, the article of the Constitution dealing with the Attorney General, was published on 22 January 1996.  This report also dealt with the issues raised in these questions. The group is continuing its work and I have forwarded the Select Committee's report to them for consideration in so far as its recommendations might have constitutional implications.  The group is expected to report in May and it would be prudent to await the outcome of its deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the independence of the Attorney General will not be compromised by greater accountability as recommended by the committee and, therefore, the correct way to proceed is to ensure there is accountability by agreeing that the Attorney General will appear before committees and that if legislation is required to copperfasten that it should be provided?  The Taoiseach did not comment on the specific proposal to appoint a deputy attorney general.  Has he any thoughts on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the select committee was received about a fortnight ago.  It makes a number of recommendations, including recommendations in regard to accountability, which are being carefully considered.  So far as a deputy attorney general is concerned, the constitutional implications of such a proposal would need to be considered, in view of the fact that the Attorney General is a constitutional officer.  However, there are significant practical arguments in favour of allowing a procedure for delegation of <Col N="227" /> some of the work currently undertaken by the Attorney General to another person but that needs to be done in the context of the constitutional provisions and following study of the practical implications of any such proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying he agrees generally that the Attorney General should be more accountable and he is proceeding in that general direction subject to the detail being studied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are proceeding in that general direction.  As the House is aware there is a provision in the compellability of witnesses Bill for a greater degree of accountability from the Attorney General's Office.  The precise details of this are matters that need to be studied with care because as the select committee acknowledges there is a tension between independence and accountability.  One needs to work out a system that respects the necessary independence of the office while providing a reasonable degree of accountability. Accountability is provided through the Taoiseach who is available to be questioned twice a week on any aspect of the Attorney General's Office.  It would be wrong to say there is no accountability. I am accounting at this moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach says he is moving towards greater accountability for the Attorney General, is he aware of the views of the select committee that section 3 of the compellability of witnesses Bill will lessen rather than increase the accountability of the Attorney General?  If he is really interested in getting more accountability for the Attorney General's Office will he arrange for that section to be withdrawn?  Furthermore, is he aware of the proposals in the report of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs that the roles of the Attorney General should be clearly separated and delineated and will he arrange for that?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the supposition in the first part of the Deputy's question.  The other aspects of the select committee's report are being carefully selected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  The committee has given great consideration to this report.  Is thought being given to introducing legislation to govern the independence of the Attorney General?  As the report points out, there is not a law or any part of the Constitution which says he is independent, unlike the law which applies to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of some legal difference as to whether the second part of the Deputy's supplementary is valid.  Many people understand that independence is provided for in the constitutional provisions as they stand. However, as I have indicated the report from the select committee chaired by the Deputy, in which he had a very important input, is being carefully considered by me and the Attorney General. In so far as it has constitutional implications it is important that it should also be studied by the constitutional review group and that is being done.  We have arranged to furnish the report to the review group for study.  It is important that any legislation of the kind the Deputy is urging should be founded on a full and proper understanding of the meaning of the constitutional provisions as they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Taoiseach disagree with the Select Committee's recommendation that section 3 of the 1995 legislation should be withdrawn? How can he justify a situation whereby the DPP is obliged to come before a Dáil committee but the Attorney General is not obliged?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I do not propose to enter into the work of the Select Committee which is dealing with the Compellability of Witnesses Bill.  I have no <Col N="229" /> doubt the Deputy will be able to advance all his arguments adequately to the Minister responsible through his party representatives on the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 14, inclusive, together.  Intensive efforts have continued during the past week to secure the restoration of the IRA ceasefire and the commencement of all-party negotiations. In particular, the Government has been focusing on the objective of agreement on a specific date for the beginning of negotiations.  In this way, an avenue will be provided for the peaceful political resolution of differences in a democratic fashion without violence or the threat of violence.  The past week has been characterised by intensive exchanges with relevant parties with this objective in mind, but obviously I can only give limited information on these at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I have been in further contact with the British Prime Minister.  I believe a convergence of views is now <Col N="231" /> emerging between the two Governments on how the various ideas for progress can be accommodated in the context of agreement on a specific date for negotiations.  However, further work remains to be done in order to ensure a positive outcome to the forthcoming summit, a date for which will be finalised shortly.  I expect to speak to the Prime Minister this afternoon or later this evening.</P>
    <P>Second, the Government has been keeping in close contact with the Northern Ireland parties.  I had a constructive meeting on Saturday week last with Mr. Bob McCartney, the Unionist MP, and I believe that, as a result, there is a better mutual understanding of our respective positions and possible ways forward.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate the invitation to the leaders of the two main Unionist parties to meet the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare and myself.  I referred to this invitation in the House on 31 January. On the question of Unionist participation in the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I would welcome such participation, but that is a matter for the parties concerned to ultimately decide.</P>
    <P>My meeting on Wednesday with the SDLP leader, Mr. John Hume, MP, was very useful and we have maintained almost daily contact since then.  We share the same urgency regarding an agreed specific date for all-party negotiations and, at our meeting, we had a detailed exchange of views on how the ongoing preparations for the summit meeting might best be pursued with a view to ensuring a successful outcome. As part of those preparations, the Government is examining Mr. John Hume's suggestion for referendums North and South on non-violence and all-party negotiations.  An unambiguous interpretation of any such referendum would be clearly desirable in order to maximise the potential for a positive outcome.</P>
    <P>In addition, official level contact with Sinn Féin has been continuing.  In response to Question No. 5 from Deputy Ahern, two joint statements <Col N="232" /> involving the Government and Sinn Féin were issued, on 14 July and 28 August last year.  It was my understanding at the time that the commitments made in those statements by Mr. Adams had the support of the republican movement generally.  Both statements included affirmations of a total and absolute commitment to democratic and peaceful methods of resolving political problems.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Alliance Party, there have been official level contacts but no meeting at political level since the ceasefire was ended by the IRA.  I would be happy to have such a meeting with the Alliance Party at a mutually suitable date.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government has always attached significance to the constructive role of the US administration in the peace process.  I have discussed the situation personally with President Clinton by telephone on two occasions in the past week or so and I am keeping him regularly informed of progress.</P>
    <P>The Government had a very good meeting on Thursday last with Senator George Mitchell.  I availed of the opportunity to convey our deep gratitude for the excellent work undertaken by the international body which he chaired. The Government delegation gave him a detailed account of our efforts to secure a reinstatement of the IRA ceasefire, placing particular emphasis on the importance of a specific date for negotiations. Senator Mitchell conveyed the readiness of President Clinton and his administration to assist the two Governments in their efforts, describing the US role as one of support and encouragement to all sides.  I also had a meeting with Mr. Bill Flynn and Mr. Bill Barry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach's expression of sympathy to the Ceann Comhairle on the death of his brother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the original date for talks &mdash; 29 February &mdash; has almost expired, this side agrees with the Taoiseach that every effort must be made to ensure that a firm date for all-party talks and <Col N="233" /> negotiations is fixed and adhered to resolutely. Is the Taoiseach in a position to tell the House whether a summit will be held later today or tomorrow?  I understand the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister are unavailable on Thursday or Friday.  If that is not the case, perhaps the Taoiseach will outline the position.  Is he satisfied that a date put forward for negotiations in this communiqué will be fixed and adhered to resolutely, rather than just suggesting a date for all-party talks as in the previous communiqué on 28 November?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation to the Deputy for his support of the Government's objective of securing a specific date for the opening of all-party negotiations.  I am not in a position at this stage to state specifically when a summit meeting will take place. However, as I indicated to the House, I expect to have further discussions with the British Prime Minister this afternoon or later this evening.  We are working towards obtaining agreement on a specific date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention that it would be adhered to resolutely.  This is a commitment we are seeking and hope to obtain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than it being necessary for me to put down 20 parliamentary questions, this side endeavours to support the Government on this matter. Is it the Taoiseach's intention to hold the summit before he leaves for the Far East?  Does he hope to achieve that or is it not possible to hold it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the House as much information as I can on that matter.  I am working with a view to having a summit at the earliest possible date.  My objective in attending such a summit is to have agreement on a specific date for the opening of all-party <Col N="234" /> negotiations.  I indicated to the House that I will have further consultations with the British Prime Minister about this matter later this evening.  I am not in a position to be more specific at this point on the date or time of a summit.  I may be in possession of further information later but as of now I cannot be more specific.  I ask the Deputy to appreciate that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach achieves the objective of holding a summit, perhaps his office and those around him will be a little more helpful to the Opposition.  On the last occasion I heard most of the communiqué on the television before I received a copy of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recollect that, on the last occasion, the summit was not expected to take place. There was no finalisation as to whether a summit would be held or the precise wording of the matter until approximately two hours before it took place. The Deputy should have a degree of understanding with regard to my ability to communicate information in that short timeframe, given that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;most of the time in question was spent in transit from Dublin to London for the summit. Therefore, my ability to be in touch with the Deputy was less than might otherwise be the case.  I am anxious to ensure the Opposition is kept as informed as possible on an up to date basis of matters as they transpire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Taoiseach to contact me when he is trying to arrange a summit.  He might reflect deeply on the speed with which that summit was arranged and whether another summit should be arranged in the same way.  There is not much point in holding summits if issues are not tied down, as is the case with this communiqué.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the record will show that the way in which that summit was arranged was of considerable benefit in so far as the communiqué was concerned and the results that flowed from it.  I do not accept the Deputy's interpretation in regard to the matter but, having said that, it is my purpose to ensure we get a specific date for all-party negotiations and to create the most favourable conditions possible for ending the IRA campaign of violence.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, I am working with a view to agreeing a communiqué and a basis for the opening of all-party negotiations with the British Government.  I am concentrating my attentions on that matter. I have told the Deputy the matter to which she refers is one of the issues currently in negotiation and, therefore, I do not propose to express any views about it of a personal kind.  These matters are currently the subject of negotiation between Government and it is the intention to reach an agreed position on them.  As soon as that is the case, I will report to the House on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously that matter has been discussed in the confidential discussions arranged between officials and Sinn Féin.  The purpose of the meetings undertaken was to establish the conditions and basis for a resumption of the ceasefire by the IRA on the recommendation of Sinn Féin.  As to any representation of Sinn Féin's position, it would be better if that came from Sinn Féin.</P>

      <P>I thought the Taoiseach's judgement on the communiqué of 28 November would have been based on the success of the objectives of the twin track process, first, the Mitchell report which was binned by the British Government and, second, the firm aim of achieving the second track by the end of February 1996, which cannot now happen and which must be left for history to judge.  Does the Taoiseach welcome the first sign in 12 months that the British Government is not prepared to accept the proposal of the Ulster Unionist Party to have a debating assembly on moving the peace process forward?  Will he agree there might be some hope, now that the British Government is moving away from the Unionist proposals, to debate the peace process for the next two years, as stated by its leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be adequate time for historical retrospection in regard to the communiqué of last November, but I ask those who wish to make such judgments to reflect on what might have happened if such a communiqué had not been agreed.  I believe if it had not been agreed the consequences would have been far more severe than anything that happened since, but I am quite prepared to deal with the Deputy's opinions on that matter comprehensively on another occasion; it is not an appropriate <Col N="237" /> occasion for that type of discussion here today.  As far as the Unionist proposals are concerned and the British Government's attitude to them, I do not propose to get involved in any discussion or comment on the positions adopted by particular parties involved, either in attributing success or failure to any particular party's proposals or to the attitude of other Governments to the proposals of particular parties.  We are seeking an agreement and we want negotiations in which everyone will take part.  I do not put a high value, therefore, on recrimination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the six Mitchell principles calls on the participants to agree to abide by the terms of any agreement reached in all-party talks. Has Senator Mitchell given his opinion to the Taoiseach on the mechanics of such an agreement or will the Taoiseach give an opinion on that?  Would it have to be a unanimous agreement by all the parties and, if so, will the Taoiseach agree that by signing such an agreement, the undertaking required by Senator Mitchell would have been delivered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise that these are principles.  The Mitchell report does not deal with the mechanics of how these principles would be dealt with in a talks process because, as the Deputy knows, the mechanics of the talks were outside the remit of the Mitchell body.  Obviously that is a matter for discussion now in the political track and it is one of the issues currently in discussion between the Irish and British Governments.  I have taken careful note of the opinion Deputy McDaid has expressed on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Mitchell's role is continuously referred to in the preparation for the summit, and in the hopes of restoring the peace process as quickly as possible, did the Taoiseach raise with Senator Mitchell the possibility of him having an ongoing role in the process, assuming it can be put on <Col N="238" /> the tracks as soon as possible?  As the six principles will obviously play a key role in any further negotiations, a role for Senator Mitchell and the US Administration is vital.  What steps has the Taoiseach taken with the British Government to ensure such a role for Senator Mitchell?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly not excluded and I want to express my appreciation again to the US Administration for the very constructive role it is playing in the current efforts to ensure agreement on a specific date for all-party talks.  This is clearly evidenced by the fact that President Clinton has had two extensive conversations with me in the past week or so on this matter. I have no doubt he and other members of the US Administration have been in similar contact with other figures engaged in the process at present.  The possibility of the further involvement of Senator Mitchell can be the subject of discussion between the two Governments and if an agreed, useful function is identified, I do not have the slightest doubt that Senator George Mitchell, who has given generously of his time to assisting us in solving these problems, would be willing to assist but it is a matter that obviously must be processed forward on the basis of agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer the question.  Has this matter been part of the discussions and is it intended to ask the British Government to agree that Senator Mitchell should have a role to play in this process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been adverted to in the discussion but the discussions are not concluded and obviously any role of this nature would have to be one which was agreed to and where specific tasks were identified which could not be performed otherwise. I am not in a position to go further than that at this juncture.  The emphasis at this stage is on securing agreement between the two Governments on a specific date and on a procedure to <Col N="239" /> enable talks to start on that specific date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the nature of the elective process now been agreed with the British Government?  Will the Taoiseach agree it is important, in the context of all-party talks, that the smaller loyalist fringe parties are represented in those talks and will he give me an assurance that any elective process to which the Irish Government agrees will have the maximum possible representation in all-party talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the form of any elective process is one of the matters currently in negotiation between the British and Irish Governments. I cannot appropriately go any further than that at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the need to recognise the particularly constructive role played by the two loyalist parties, the Ulster Democratic Party and the Progressive Unionist Party, not only in instituting a ceasefire, but in maintaining it despite the abandonment of the IRA ceasefire.  The Government is also conscious of the constructive approach both parties have adopted towards finding new ways forward to solve the problems which have long defeated present and past generations of political leaders in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.  While the results of any election, if an election is to occur, are not something that can be determined by Governments, I express my appreciation of the constructive role those two parties have been playing and continue to play.</P>

Does he agree that Article 10 of the Downing Street Declaration should not be put to the people as several times during the past two years people put their own <Col N="240" /> meaning on it once they had created great division?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be drawn into commenting on whether Article 10 of the Downing Street Declaration is clear or unclear as I was not involved in its drafting, but the question of a referendum or referenda, and the appropriate wording, are currently the subject of discussion and negotiation between the Irish and British Governments.  Therefore, I cannot elaborate any further on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 26, 37, 48, 50 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>Following the recent tragic events in London I and my officials have maintained regular contact with Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry in an ongoing assessment of the situation.  Specifically, I addressed a joint Bord Fáilte-Northern Ireland Tourist Board workshop in London on 15 February 1996 and met many of the 100 Irish and 300 British trade representatives in attendance.  I also spoke at the Irish Hotels Federation annual conference on 20 February 1996 at which I met many hoteliers from all parts of Ireland.</P>
      <P>We cannot deny that the London bombings have come at an important time of the year for generating visitors for the coming season and that these events will impact to some extent on our capacity to attract overseas visitors this year.  It is important, however, that we do not talk ourselves into believing that Irish tourism is facing a crisis as a result of these incidents.  Before the very welcome ceasefires of late 1994, Irish tourism was growing at a fast rate.  There are underlying strengths in the Irish tourism industry which have been built up over many years through investment in our product, increased marketing resources, improved air and sea access and the general climate of competitiveness which can be found in the economy.  I am confident that these underlying strengths will continue to serve us well in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The monitoring of overseas markets which Bord Fáilte has been carrying out <Col N="242" /> since 9 February 1996 indicates that to date there has been a very limited reaction among customers in key markets. The general trend, and I would stress that this is an evolving situation, is that in continental European markets there has been no noticeable drop in inquiry levels; in the United States inquiries are still running at very good levels and in Britain, the picture is more mixed with some operators reporting some falling off in inquiries while others have experienced no downturn.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that in the immediate aftermath of the horrific incidents such as we have seen in London there is evidence of a small number of cancellations, but I am advised that within the context of the overall numbers of bookings for holidays in Ireland, the numbers are insignificant.  I strongly caution Deputies that the interests of Irish tourism will not be served by having the subject of cancellations, limited as they are, highlighted to an undue degree.  I have no doubt but that some of Ireland's competitors for international tourism business could only benefit if a perception was to be fostered in the international media that we were suffering large scale cancellations. Those who would be tempted to prophesise such a scenario could find that their prophesy becomes self-fulfilling. The main consumer marketing campaigns in our overseas markets are carried out under the aegis of the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative which is a partnership between the tourism industry and the State sector, North and South.  I understand that in the immediate aftermath of the bombings in London, some television advertising in Britain and the US was rescheduled in the interests of reacting sensitively to the situation.  Press advertising is continuing in these markets and no changes have been made to the media and promotional campaigns in other markets.</P>
    <P>The question of resuming TV advertising is entirely a matter for the OTMI board.  The board is monitoring the situation closely with a view to resuming at the earliest possible and appropriate <Col N="243" /> time.  I understand they will be resumed tomorrow, 28 February.</P>
    <P>At this stage the question of devising appropriate strategies to deal with the new situation is being considered by the OTMI board and Bord Fáilte.  I am satisfied that the substantial resources which I have made available in 1996 for marketing activities are sufficient.  I am happy to leave the tactical application of those resources to those with the knowledge of the markets and the expertise in the most appropriate mechanisms for marketing our tourism product.</P>
    <P>In her question, Deputy Coughlan asked about the potential for marketing Ulster as a region.  Consumer research carried out for Bord Fáilte and the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative has shown that potential visitors to Ireland from overseas think of Ireland as a complete entity in tourism terms and do not readily respond to messages which are specific to any one geographical region.  In line with this research, the thrust of the OTMI's marketing campaigns is to market and advertise Ireland as an overall destination product.</P>
    <P>There is already a good working relationship between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and this will have its most practical marketing manifestation in the 1996 OTMI, in which the NITB is an active participant. The peace process has encouraged North-South co-operation in the area of tourism to develop at a significant pace and as new areas of common interest are identified, I will ensure that there will be no lack of willingness on our part to participate in further joint marketing activities.</P>
    <P>I hope that in this lengthy reply I have assured Deputies that the tourism industry is a strong and resilient sector and that it is responding to recent events in a calm and considered manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response, particularly the indication that <Col N="244" /> the reaction, in terms of the number of cancellations, has been limited.  It was most important that he availed of the opportunity to clarify that that is the situation. I agree that it would be unhelpful if the opposite perception were abroad.  Was he consulted by the OTMI in relation to its decision to cancel some advertisements on British television? Did he have an input?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comment in relation to the overall reaction to the incidents in London.  I have left the mechanics and the day to day operations of the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative to its board.  This decision was taken following the incidents in London having regard to the need for common sense and a sensitive reaction to the bereaved.  I am aware that the advertisements have been rescheduled and will resume tomorrow, 28 February.  I understand that there has been no reduction in the press advertising campaign conducted by the OTMI.</P>

      <Quest>the number of meetings he has had with An Bord Tráchtála to discuss problems experienced by exporters, particularly arising from the strength of the punt against sterling; and the initiatives, if any, there are to address these problems.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4406/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my officials have on-going contact with the chairman and executive of An Bord Tráchtála concerning developments affecting Irish exporters.  Exchange rates are just one of a number of complex and inter-connected factors affecting exporters.  It is Government policy to ensure, in so far as it can, that the economic environment here is as conducive as possible to the conduct of business, with a strong emphasis on helping industry to keep its cost base competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> our main competitors and key markets.  That policy has resulted in an economic environment characterised by sound public <Col N="245" /> finances, high growth, low inflation, interest rates at historically low levels and moderate wage increases.  The Government in this year's budget introduced a number of further measures aimed at improving the economic climate for business including improvements in income tax, PRSI and corporation tax.</P>
      <P>While it is the responsibility of business itself to cope with the fluctuations in the marketplace, An Bord Tráchtála offers a range of services, some specific to certain markets, aimed at assisting exporters to maintain market position and increase export levels.  For example, ABT is establishing a special task force, consisting of five marketing specialists, based in Britain, to work with indigenous exporters who are highly dependent on the British market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the board has also been pursuing a very pro-active campaign to encourage and assist indigenous companies to expand and increase exports into key markets in continental Europe such as France, Germany, Benelux, Scandinavia, Austria, northern Italy and northern Spain.  While all markets, including the UK, showed export growth last year ranging from 6 per cent to 14 per cent, continental Europe's share of indigenous exports grew by 2 per cent to over 46 per cent while dependence on the UK market dropped by 2 per cent to 44.8 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The punt is today trading at £1.032 sterling.  The Minister for Finance, who has a great interest in this, indicated that he would examine the ESRI report on the European Monetary Union.  It is important also to note the effect and the consequences of the state of the British economy which, after strong growth in the 18 months leading <Col N="246" /> to the first quarter of 1995, has weakened considerably in the last six to nine months.  The export boom which had driven the economy to a GDP growth rate of 4.5 per cent in 1994 tapered off considerably, resulting in a weakened demand for British consumer goods in Europe.  Consumer expenditure remained depressed during the year, with last autumn showing the biggest rise in unsold goods in British warehouses for 20 years.</P>
      <P>The depressed consumer market had a significant effect on exporters in the consumer sectors during 1995.  There are expectations that retail sales will improve in the second and third quarters of 1996 and the projections are for a significant growth in 1997, which would have an impact on our ability to export to Britain.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report for the end of last year indicated that indigenous exports to Britain increased by 6 per cent in 1995.  This compared to an exceptional 17 per cent in 1994.  Consumer exports performed somewhat poorly and showed an increase of only 1 per cent. This reflected the state of the British economy, especially with regard to consumer goods.  I do not have any figures for the Deputy regarding assessments or estimates as to jobs gained or lost as a result of the exchange rate position.</P>

      <P>The British Government is interested in managing a strong British economy.  I have outlined what occurred last year and its consequences in respect of indigenous goods from Ireland.  A small number of companies in the non-food area has experienced difficulties.  ABT has established a specialist task force of highly competent marketing people to assist these companies. It is taking up duty on 4 March and I expect it will deal from a position <Col N="247" /> of intimate knowledge with the British market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have set out in detail in my response to an Adjournment Debate in this House on 3 October 1995, Bord Fáilte was legally contracted under Global Grant Agreements, concluded directly with the European Commission, to administer the EU funds available under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-1993 for private sector led developments such as Celtworld.  I understand that last Wednesday night's &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo; programme made a number of allegations regarding the Celtworld project, following which I asked Bord Fáilte for its views on the allegations made and to report back to me with its findings.  The programme suggested that the existence of substantial contracts between associated companies of the major shareholders and Celtworld was not clear to business expansion scheme (BES) investors.  This suggestion is incorrect as details of both material contracts in question were explicitly mentioned in the BES placing document and the contracts were available for inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme contended that the value of land provided by Tramore Fáilte, a subsidiary of Bord Fáilte, was overstated, the implication being that this was due to a deliberate policy of <Col N="248" /> Tramore Fáilte to extract considerable shareholding for little value.  The land involved was professionally valued and this valuation was explicitly referred to in the BES placing document.  I should add that the value of the land had no bearing on EU grant assistance as it was not regarded as eligible expenditure.</P>
    <P>The programme also suggested that £100,000 of the expenditure of £265,000 incurred by Tramore Fáilte on behalf of Celtworld and for which Tramore Fáilte effectively received shares did not relate to the Celtworld project and that this was highlighted in an independent report to Bord Fáilte.  I understand from Bord Fáilte that the issue was raised by an independent consultant appointed by it to review the project and rejected in their follow up by the Celtworld board as without foundation.</P>
    <P>Business expansion schemes by their very nature involve a risk element.  This was referred to at least three times in the BES placing document where the advice of solicitors, accountants, tax advisers or other appropriate experts was recommended to assist potential investors in their own commercial assessment of the proposal.  People associated with Tramore Fáilte, the Bank of Ireland and MF Kent invested in this business expansion scheme.  It is unlikely that they would have done so if they believed that the project was fundamentally unsound.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, following further consultation with Bord Fáilte, that the statement I gave to this House on 3 October 1995 is correct in all material matters.  In the opinion of Bord Fáilte, Celtworld did not fail because of the issues raised on &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo; regarding the internal transactions between shareholders.  It failed ultimately because it could not attract the levels of business necessary for survival and profitability.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the serious public disquiet over the circumstances surrounding the Celtworld project at Tramore?  Is he aware many people believe there is <Col N="249" /> adequate justification for a public investigation into the circumstances surrounding this matter?  Will he confirm that the construction of the building by Kent Brothers and the installation of equipment by Vectrovision was not put out to tender?  Does he agree they invested in the company on condition they would secure the contracts?  The Minister did not adequately explain why Tramore Fáilte sold land to Celtworld for £160,000 per acre when adjoining land was sold for £11,000 per acre?  Why was there such gross over valuation of the land, thereby grossly over valuing Tramore Fáilte's investment in the project? The Minister did not adequately respond to the question on prior development costs which are listed in the accounts as initial setting up costs of £716,000.  He confirmed that according to the consultant appointed by Bord Fáilte, £100,000 of those costs were not associated with the setting up of Celtworld.  He said Celtworld denied this.  Of course it would.  What is the Minister's view?  Why did it cost £110 per square foot to construct this building, making it one of the most expensive buildings in the country?  It is alleged there was overcharging in respect of everything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy will recall he was a member of Government at the time, although that does not implicate him.  This was a private company and Bord Fáilte was legally contracted under global grant agreements concluded directly with the European Commission to administer EU funds available under the programme for private sector led developments, such as Celtworld.  Since I answered a question on the Adjournment, financial accounts have been prepared and audited by Coopers and Lybrand of Waterford for the period up to 31 October 1995, which was very soon after the company ceased trading.  These were accepted at an AGM on 15 December 1995 at which BES investors were represented by their trustees.  It is also important to note that a BES involves a risk and the BES document for intending investors contains numerous references to this.  The document states that the 2.5 acre site in Tramore for the project was acquired by the company from Tramore Fáilte Limited for a consideration of £400,000.  It refers specifically to the fact that a new venture of this nature carries a number of significant risks which could have an adverse effect on the profits and working capital requirements and draws attention to the section on risk factors on page 13.  The Deputy asked if a tender process was in place at the time McMahon Phillips constructed the building.  There was not, because the cost of capital works for the project was below the threshold in the public procurement directive 89/440EEC, dated 10 July 1990 which was 5 million ecu or £3.887 million net of VAT.  It was not necessary, therefore, to place an advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Communities.  I understand, however, the building contract price was negotiated between Celtworld and McMahon Phillips and was based on a design and amplified cost plan prepared by a design team and on competitive tender rates.  This was happening at the <Col N="251" /> start of the operational programme for tourism under which EU funds could be drawn down.  People were looking for new and imaginative concepts and this was one.  The lesson to be learned from involvement in such projects is that a repeat of &ldquo;newness&rdquo; is required.  The reason Celtworld ultimately failed was that it was unable to attract new and ongoing overseas visitor business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree he should not quote this as a private company when Tramore Fáilte was one of the promoters and investors.  The articles of association of Tramore Fáilte state that it cannot do anything without the written approval of Bord Fáilte.  It cannot enter into contracts, dispose of assets or agree a sale without the approval of Bord Fáilte who is responsible to the Minister.  A glib reference to a private company does not remove the Minister's responsibility for the expenditure of public funds and the manner in which this deal was handled.  I am surprised he can stand over the fact that the building was not put out to tender. I am even more surprised that he can stand over all the dealings in which Celtworld and its investing companies were involved.  I presume he is referring to the Bank of Ireland as representing the number of BES investors.  Is it not surprising that it has subsequently transpired that a substantial number of the investors were in-house people engaged by their respective parties, such as the Bank of Ireland and Kent?  A proper investigation into this matter is necessary to restore public confidence in projects which have Government approval and the support of Bord Fáilte.  The Minister is treating this serious matter rather glibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make a glib reference to a private company.  Bord Fáilte was contractually obliged by the European Commission to administer these funds under the operational programme for private sector led developments, such as Celtworld.  The public <Col N="252" /> tender system was not necessary under the procurement directive 89/440/EEC dated 10 July 1990.  The average BES investment in Celtworld was approximately £5,000 which would have resulted in an average cost to those investors of approximately £2,500 because tax could be recouped under BES investment.  There are clear references to the BES risk in the document on investment details to which I referred.  For example, the directors advise that projections of future financial results are inherently subject to risk and that the actual results may not correspond with those projected.</P>
      <P>These details were available to potential investors in Celtworld.  The asset is still there and active progress is being made in disposing of it.  Bord Fáilte retains its interest in Celtworld in so far as its continued use in the tourism area is concerned.  Deputy Molloy will be aware from the reply given to an Adjournment debate that Bord Fáilte made a further contribution to Celtworld subject to serious rationalisation and streamlining of its business and potential to attract new and overseas business.  These efforts failed but lessons have been learned from this type of development.  Proposals in the operational programme which were regarded as new and imaginative at that time must obviously be looked at in a different light today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 40, 52 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Deputies who referred in their questions to the &ldquo;Destination Ireland&rdquo; campaign are referring to recent media reports about the development of a brand image for Irish tourism.  Deputies will recall from replies to Dáil questions on 15 November 1992 that the first phase of the consideration of a brand image for Irish tourism was completed in the spring of 1995 with a presentation of initial consultancy findings to the Tourism Council.</P>
      <P>A Partnership Forum organised by Bord Fáilte on 24 October 1995 gave leading figures in the tourism industry an opportunity to discuss strategic issues facing Irish tourism, to hear the results of research on international consumer perspectives of Ireland and to debate further steps in the development of the brand image.  It was agreed that Bord Fáilte would continue, under the aegis of an advisory group led by Bord Fáilte's international marketing director, to develop brand positioning proposals and communications strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has now placed notices in the Official Journal of the European Union seeking approaches from suitable advertising practitioners who would be capable of carrying out the strategic and <Col N="254" /> creative development of a new branded advertising approach.  In the notices Bord Fáilte, which is the awarding Authority, has indicated that the following selection criteria will apply in relation to the contract award: (a) excellence in strategic and creative approach to the communications task defined, (b) track record and quality of previous work and (c) ability to work as part of a strategic planning team with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>The question of a specific budget for the execution of a marketing campaign based on a new brand image for Irish tourism does not yet arise.  The expectation is that funding for any such campaign would come from a redirection of some of the approximately £60 million expenditure which Bord Fáilte estimates is currently incurred annually on marketing by the industry and State agencies on Irish tourism abroad.</P>
    <P>The steps which Bord Fáilte has taken recently are part of an ongoing process which is being kept under continuous review with the industry which has a critical role to play not only in terms of inputting its views and ideas but also by ultimately incorporating it in its own marketing expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the considerable public disquiet about previous Government publicity campaigns and appointments.  It is important, therefore, for this publicity campaign to be open and transparent. Will the campaign continue or expand the current OTMI marketing campaign or will it be entirely under the remit of Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The OTMI was given responsibility for marketing in our major international markets.  Assuming that an evolving brand continues to develop, obviously there will be a concentration on its better effects, and this will be put into operation by the OTMI. Deputy Killeen can take it that this campaign will be transparent.  Bord Fáilte recently placed notices in the Official Journal of the EU and it is <Col N="255" /> envisaged that up to nine agencies will be interviewed before the contract is awarded.  The company chosen will be given a specific contract and there is no question but that transparency and accountability will be the order of the day in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the NITB involved in the current discussions and the general evolution of the brand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very good working relationship between Bord Fáilte and the NITB in regard to the OTMI etc.  The NITB is not actively involved in this area but it is aware of the procedure involved.  One cannot take this out of a box and say &ldquo;this is the new brand for Ireland&rdquo;.  It is an evolving process which involves considerable detail arising from international studies on the perception of Ireland abroad. The NITB is aware of what is going on and the matter is closely monitored by Bord Fáilte, through its international marketing director, and the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is a fundamental contradiction in the NITB and other interests, North and South, working with Bord Fáilte in marketing Ireland abroad while at the same time they are involved in developing a brand name which effectively is a brand name for tourism in the Republic?  Would it not be better from the point of view of long-term prospects and projections to evolve the brand name for Ireland in co-operation with the NITB and other tourism interests in Northern Ireland who have a central role to play in the OTMI marketing campaign?  Do the Minister and Bord Fáilte have a fundamental problem with the continuation of the OTMI?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put Deputy Killeen's mind at rest in this regard; there is no question but that the OTMI is a huge success.  Potential overseas visitors do not react as well as expected to the marketing of individual locations by <Col N="256" /> tourist boards and a much better result is achieved by marketing the entire island.  The development of a new brand image for Ireland is an evolving process which will continue for some time.  The overseas tourism marketing initiative will continue to be implemented by Bord Fáilte and the NITB as it has been proven that one achieves much better results by marketing the entire island of Ireland internationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>In general the approval of European Regional Development Fund funds under the product development and marketing sub-programmes of the Operational Programme for Tourism is determined by independent management boards established under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RTOs play an important role in encouraging grant applications under the sub-programmes of the Operational Programme for Tourism within their regions.  They and SFADCo also have a direct input to the evaluation of each individual development proposal from their area seeking European Regional Development Fund assistance.  This gives the regional bodies, which are responsible for tourism promotion in their areas, the opportunity to co-ordinate development proposals with <Col N="257" /> regional marketing strategy at an early stage in both the design and the evaluation of expenditure proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two marketing boards, one for the SFADCo area and the other for the rest of the country.  Has the Minister received complaints about the decision to have one management board for the remainder of the RTOs? Many members of RTOs believe they do not have a sufficient input to decisions about major projects in their areas.  Has he received complaints from Western Tourism, South West Tourism and Cork-Kerry Tourism about their apparent lack of success in attracting major projects which have to be assessed by the management board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, that is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fundamental question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts down a question I will give him the details of the approvals to date for each region.  The report, which is now available, indicates a fairly even spread within and throughout the different regions involved.  I received complaints from a variety of sources in respect of the regional tourism organisations, SFADCo, Cork-Kerry tourism and so on.  I took the opportunity to meet all these bodies and we have sorted out the difficulties.  The result is that the regional tourism organisations and SFADCo have a genuine input to lodging applications and arranging such applications for consideration for European Regional Development Fund funds.  They have a specific responsibility in that regard and I know they take it very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the management boards were an essential element in the make-up of the structures for European Regional Development Fund funds but a number of difficulties have <Col N="258" /> arisen which need to be addressed specifically.  Does the Minister agree that some of the difficulties which have been made known to him by the regional tourism organisation cannot be addressed under the management board system and that there needs to be a fundamental rethink of the role of the management boards and, perhaps, of the policy which directs particular infrastructures towards areas which have not been enjoying high growth rates in tourism relative to other areas of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We made a specific policy of encouraging applications from as many and diverse areas throughout the country as possible.  The report on the distribution of grant assistance under the European Regional Development Fund programme is public information and very clearly indicates an even spread, in so far as that can be achieved, throughout the different regions.  The Deputy will be aware that all applications for European Regional Development Fund funding have to be directed through the regional tourism organisations and SFADCo.  From that point of view that regional tourism organisations and SFADCo have a direct input to the claims and proposals before they are determined ultimately by the independent boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the experience with Celtworld in Tramore and, I understand, another aquarium project which has run into difficulties recently, does the Minister know whether there are certain projects which Bord Fáilte and the Department will not recommend for approval to the EU because of the fact that in some cases these facilities are already in the country?  Does he know whether this information has been conveyed to the local authorities and the regional tourism organisations which are involved in developing projects for application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important <Col N="259" /> point.  It is very clear that quite a number of applications that come in to the regional tourism organisations and SFADCo prior to decision by the independent boards are turned down on the basis of assessment by the independent boards.  In respect of heritage applications, for instance, where a number of these were grant aided under the original programme and where difficulties have been experienced because of falloff in visitor numbers or for other reasons, for these to be considered and approved, the local authority is now required to underwrite any operating losses to show the seriousness of its commitment in this regard.</P>
      <P>The independent boards give very careful scrutiny to these applications and in quite a number of cases there have been rejections.  However, rejections are not related to the geographical location of the proposal or anything like that; it is because of the independent assessment, analysis of commercial viability and potential to attract new and overseas business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether there are some projects which will not be grant-aided.  For instance, is it now the position that applications for the construction of major aquarium-type tourism projects will not be approved because of the number already provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for the independent board but I know it gives very serious consideration to these kinds of applications.  A number of proposals, not only for aquarium type projects, have been rejected by the board for what it considers very good and valid reasons.  That has been made perfectly clear to the proposers involved. We would all like to see only commercially viable projects, with long lasting tourism potential, approved.  The independent board is there to attempt, in so far as possible, to safeguard that aim.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy is aware of the way the applications are processed.  They are initiated through the regional tourism organisation and assessed by Bord Fáilte.  If that assessment is positive it goes before the independent board.  The board may or may not accept the recommendation either of Bord Fáilte or SFADCo.  I am not sure of the individual to whom the Deputy refers, if he wants to give me details of the case I will give him a full response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position in regard to areas which have a deficiency of accommodation and need major tourism projects?  What criteria will be used for them?  Will they be treated in a different manner from the areas that already have an abundance of facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean criteria in respect of the provision of facilities for a proposal under the European Regional Development Fund programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria are there for everybody to see.  Applications come in from proposers, they are initiated through the regional tourism organisations and conditions in terms of matching funds and so on must be met.  The independent board makes its decision based on the quality and adjudged commercial viability of the proposal and of its ability to attract new and overseas business.  It is relevant to European Regional Development Fund funds and, therefore, the ability to attract new and overseas visitors is critical to final approval and grant aid.  Deputy Ellis will be aware of a number of these in his own locality.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the threat to environmentally sensitive and important heritage areas from mass tourism; the studies, if any, that have been undertaken regarding this problem; the steps, if any, which have been taken in specific areas of concern to his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Following record growth in tourism to Ireland in recent years, overseas visitor numbers to Ireland in 1995 amounted to 4.25 million. Taking into account regional and seasonal spread and local population densities, this would not be seen as constituting mass tourism by international standards.  Nevertheless, in view of the experience of other tourism destinations, understandable concerns have been expressed about the negative effect that tourism growth can have on the environment.</P>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for environmental protection generally rests with the Minister for the Environment while the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has certain statutory responsibilities specifically in relation to the protection of heritage areas.  I understand that the Heritage Services &mdash; National Parks and Wildlife Services and National Monuments and Historic Properties Service &mdash; of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht operate an ongoing review of the impact of visitors on heritage sites in order that suitable control and management procedures are exercised and applied as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to play down this whole question of mass tourism.  Does he accept there are areas to which very large numbers of tourists are attracted, that the sensitivities of these areas are not capable of handling this huge volume of people and that <Col N="262" /> there is a threat to the destruction of the attraction of the area arising from the huge numbers of people who want to visit it?  I have in mind a place like Inis Mór, where thousands upon thousands of visitors land every day during the summer on an island which has a very sensitive infrastructure.  In view of his special responsibility for tourism, what studies has the Minister carried out to ensure that these areas are pinpointed and appropriate steps taken either by his Department or at the urging of his Department to ensure that the heritage is not destroyed for all time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>My responsibility as Minister for Tourism is to see that we create 35,000 new jobs by the end of 1999, bringing the tourism revenue yield up to £2.25 million per year.  I am aware of the difficulties being experienced in a specific number of very important locations.  I am also aware of the incidence of up to 5,000 people visiting Inis Mór on a single day last year.  This does nothing for the quality tourism we promote, or for the perception and understanding of native Irish culture and the personality of the Aran Islands for those who visit them in such numbers.  It also places undue pressure on the water, sewerage and refuse disposal services provided by the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  This area and a number of others around the country are environmentally sensitive to undue visitor numbers.  There is a drive, with the co-operation of the regional tourism organisations, to move visitors to other parts of the country that have not experienced a surplus of tourists in recent years.  At international and national travel trade promotions, areas that were not traditionally involved in their own marketing are now doing so, and doing it very well.  This is in line with our tourism objective of not only bringing greater numbers to the country and increasing revenue yield, but of <Col N="263" /> meeting the challenge of moving these people to as many areas as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that forests are sprouting up all over the west and north-west, without the need for planning permission provided the plantation is under 500 acres. Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that he will seek to have an input to the discussions now going on about planning permission for forestry between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and that he will insist that only minor forests are allowed to be planted without full planning permission?</P>

      <P>This matter is being dealth with by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in the context of the Heritage Bill which is due to come before the Cabinet.  Strictly this is a matter for the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister's negative response to the supplementary question in suggesting that he will devote the energies of his Department to attracting people to other areas.  The Aran Islands are a major highlight of people's visit to the west, and they are very welcome on the islands.  My question relates to the need to ensure adequate facilities to cater for the numbers coming to the islands so that the numbers in themselves will not destroy the beauty, heritage and sensitivities of the environment on the islands.  It is a question of organising tourism, not shunting it off to some other location, which seems to be a very negative way of dealing with it.  Does the Minister feel he has any responsibilities in this matter?  What studies has <Col N="264" /> he undertaken?  Will he have studies undertaken?  What action will he take?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy has, for his own reasons, deliberately distorted what I said.  Ballinamore in County Leitrim is as entitled to visitors as any other place.  I am not responsible for the numbers who turn up at ferry points for access to the Aran Islands.  My job as Minister for Tourism is to market Ireland internationally as a place of quality tourism, competitively priced, where people from abroad can have an enjoyable quality holiday.  It is a matter of managing those who travel to the Aran Islands or to any other place. There are other sensitive locations where the Office of Public Works has had to limit access because of fear of damage to our national and prehistoric monuments.  That matter is being looked at by the regional tourism organisations who send me regular reports on visitor numbers, where they come from and the areas they visit.  It is a matter of management by the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, together with the private operators who are involved in commercial activities in bringing visitors to these places in the first instance.</P>

      <P>The environmental <Col N="265" /> damage being done by tourists in other countries is enormous, and much of it is irreparable.

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should examine the long-term effects of tourism in certain parts of the country.  It is vital that we do not kill the goose that laid the golden egg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiment of the Deputy's question. The long-term implications of tourism are very important from the point of view of European Regional Development Fund funding.  It is in that context that the longer-term viability of any application receives genuine consideration.  Major proposals have to involve the local authority in terms of planning.  It is important that we do not spoil the longer-term viability of the industry through any of these activities.  That is one of the reasons the special resorts scheme was introduced in last year's budget, to give an impetus to the development of further quality facilities in areas that were not traditionally or are not currently as strong as they could be in terms of dealing with visitor numbers from the point of view of provision of facilities and so on.  We will examine the effect of that on an ongoing basis.  I am concerned that we should retain the thread of quality that runs through all our tourism promotions.  That involves planning, the provision of proper facilities and sensitivity to the environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 30, 32, 41, 225 and <Col N="267" /> 226 together.  When I last spoke in the House on this subject on 24 January, I indicated that I had asked Bord Fáilte to pursue further a proposal from the Royal Dublin Society to develop a national conference centre at its Ballsbridge site.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte has now received an initial submission from the RDS outlining in broad terms its plans to develop a conference centre on the basis of EU grant assistance at a rate of 75 per cent.  This submission is currently being examined by a Bord Fáilte assessment team with a view to presenting its report to the product development management board within the next month or so.</P>
      <P>All submissions prepared by the RDS to date in connection with the development of the conference centre have been at its own expense.  My objective remains that work on site will commence by December 1996.</P>
      <P>At this stage no bookings have been taken for the national conference centre. However, myself, Bord Fáilte and the industry will continue to actively market and promote the extensive range of smaller conference facilities which have been put in place in recent years.</P>

      <P>The Special EU Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation envisages the provision of £48 million in EU funding for the first three years, 1995 to 1997, of the initiative for the Border counties.  While there is no specific tourism measure, up to £5 million has been tentatively earmarked for tourism related projects across a number of measures dependent, of course, on the quality of proposals submitted by the eligible community groups and local authorities.</P>
      <P>Details in relation to the measures and eligible activities can be found in the programme which was, I understand, circulated to all Oireachtas Members shortly after it was adopted in July 1995.

I am sure he agrees that tourism could be a major contributor to the necessary regeneration of the Border economy.  In view of its potential, particularly for job creation, substantial resources should be made available for the Border region.

At least 20 per cent of the total fund or £48.4 million will be available for the Border region in the South.  Of this, 15 per cent must be devoted to cross-Border activities. It is intended to be genuinely additional to that available from other sources including the sectoral operational programmes and INTERREG.

There would be a better case to make if community groups and local authorities were in the business of attempting to see how best genuine and quality applications for cross-Border tourism activities could be promoted and dealt with under this allocation, which, together with what is available under the INTERREG and the European Regional Development Fund funds, is substantial.</P>

      <Quest>whether Ireland is on course to draw down the full projected amount under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99; whether the anticipated private investment under the programme is materialising; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 42 together. Although the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 was not agreed and launched until late 1994, to date over 760 projects have been approved at a cost of some £200 million, attracting over £90 million in EU aid.  Expenditure to the end of 1995 on approved projects exceeded £75 million, of which almost £37 million was private investment.  By the end of 1996 total expenditure is expected to increase to £190 million with an expected private sector contribution of over £74 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no indications at this stage that available funds will not be drawn down or that private investment targets <Col N="273" /> will not be met during the lifetime of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has indicated that all the funds will be drawn down.  In regard to decision making on the huge number of applications received, is regionality a factor in deciding which scheme shall be approved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer Deputy Molloy to the report of the Product Management Board which I will bring before Cabinet shortly and which indicates a general spread throughout the regions. The independent product boards, Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations agree the objective should be to promote quality proposals in as many regions as possible.  That is evident in the spread of grants allocated to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Benefits will result from these projects once they are up and running. Has the Minister plans to bring forward investment to the earlier years of the programme?  It is clear that relatively small amounts are spent in the early years and the biggest level of expenditure will be in the later years of the programme, thereby postponing the benefits from the projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had the opportunity I would make arrangements to spend a huge amount of money this year, but a monitoring group considers the nature of expenditure and the categories to which the money is allocated. A mid-term review of the programme will be carried out.  I have no reason to doubt that all the available funds will be drawn down in due course and regionality will be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>Conclusions and recommendations from various studies carried out on the previous INTERREG and Tourism Operational Programme were taken into account in the design of their current counterparts and also in the design of the new Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. The opportunities available under the latest programmes are being adequately promoted and tourism interests are sufficiently aware of the funding possibilities involved.  I, therefore, have no immediate plans for further studies. However, as the Deputy may be aware, ongoing mechanisms have been built into the current programmes to oversee implementation and operation and to monitor progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The regional tourism organisations have been monitoring the level of development in the designated <Col N="276" /> resort areas since the introduction of the pilot relief scheme on 1 July 1995. However, as I have indicated in reply to earlier question on this subject, the tax-based nature of the scheme and the normal lead in time for capital projects of this nature, make it difficult to assess the level of investment planning and activity under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the developments that may take place under the tax incentive scheme?  The question relates specifically to Salthill in my area, and the Minister will be aware of the recent comments of the city manager expressing disappointment at the lack of response to the scheme.  A special conference is being organised today to attract development to the area by way of the tax incentive scheme.  Is the Minister considering improving the scheme in view of its failure in an important area such as Salthill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy has been a consistent supporter of Salthill and I am glad that town was included in the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, and many others, brought much pressure to bear in that regard.  Eleven applications have been lodged for developments in Salthill, ranging from apartment to commercial office and restaurant developments. Persons applying for developments may not apply for tax concessions under the scheme until 1997 in the case of income tax and February 1996 in the case of corporation tax.  While I can give information on application for planning development in Salthill, I cannot say whether application has been made for tax concessions under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there is a substantial difference between the urban renewal tax incentive scheme and the traditional seaside resort scheme?  There is a belief that there would have been a greater response had <Col N="277" /> urban renewal tax incentives and rate remissions been granted.  Is the Minister considering that matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Title>Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for primary health care services free of charge for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion.</P>
      <P>When the possible link between the anti-D product and hepatitis C was brought to the attention of my Department in February 1994, the immediate concerns were the protection of all future recipients of anti-D immunoglobulin and the identification of any risk for mothers who received the anti-D product in the past.  The first objective was met by the immediate introduction of a new virally inactivated anti-D product to all maternity hospital units and the second objective was met by the launch by the Blood Transfusion Service Board of the national screening programme for anti-D recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 58,905 women who received anti-D between 1970 and February 1994 have been screened under the national blood screening programme and 980 have screened positive for hepatitis C antibodies, of whom 466 have tested positive for the virus.  A targeted lookback programme to identify persons who had contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion was also undertaken. <Col N="505" /> To date 263 living recipients have been traced under this programme.  Testing for hepatitis C antibodies has been carried out on 208 persons and testing for hepatitis C virus has been carried out on 176 persons, of whom 72 have evidence of continuing hepatitis C infection.</P>
    <P>The optional screening programme commenced in early September 1995 to trace a small number of persons who may have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion who would not be traced under the targeted lookback programme. Some 7,901 persons have come forward for testing to date, of whom 20 have been confirmed positive for hepatitis C antibodies and 15 are positive for hepatitis C virus.  The Government is committed to providing a high quality health service for all persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or a blood product.  Substantial progress has already been made during the past year in meeting the many complex and varied health care needs of those persons who have contracted hepatitis C.  This has been made possible by a process of consultation between my Department and Positive Action &mdash; a support group for anti-D women and their families &mdash; and Transfusion Positive &mdash; a support group for blood transfusion recipients and their families, the Irish Kidney Association and the Irish Haemophilia Society.</P>
    <P>Many of the concerns, particularly about future health care arrangements expressed by these groups have been addressed.  The special health care programme involves an extensive range of services in the following areas: (i) secondary health care services; (ii) primary health care services; (iii) special research programme; (iv) statutory Monitoring Body.</P>
    <P>Secondary health care treatment for those persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion has been provided since early 1994 at special consultant staffed clinics at six designated hospitals: St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. Vincent's Hospital <Col N="506" /> Dublin; Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
    <P>Specific funding will be provided in the Book of Estimates each year to ensure the consolidation and maintenance into the future of a high quality hospital in-patient and out-patient service including prescribed medication for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or blood product. The secondary care element of the health care services programme includes provision for: (i) access to in-patient and out-patient treatment; (ii) non-payment of hospital charges; (iii) appropriate staffing levels and arrangements for staff training; (iv) equipment for hepatitis C units; (v) anti-viral therapies and therapy initiation programmes; (vi) liver transplantation; (vii) treatment outside Ireland where necessary; (viii) liaison between the hospital service providers; and (ix) prompt referral to clinicians for conditions associated with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The treatment services will also be available to children and partners who are hepatitis C positive.  These secondary care services are being provided for under the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the need for specific research in relation to hepatitis C particularly in view of the fact that hepatitis C was described for the first time in 1989 and that a reliable screening test had only become available in 1991.  I have, therefore, arranged with the Health Research Board, for the establishment of a special programme of reseach on hepatitis C including research projects into hepatitis C as it relates to persons infected through the use of anti-D product.  I have provided special funding of £100,000 to the Health Research Board to enable this special research programme to commence this year.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the health service as it relates to persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion is responsive to the changing needs of such patients, I am establishing a statutory consultative council which will advise me on matters <Col N="507" /> relating to hepatitis C.  I have circulated a draft establishment order to interested groups for their views.  The functions of the consultative council will include: the monitoring of health and counselling services for persons with hepatitis C; the making of recommendations on the organisation and delivery of services for persons with hepatitis C; publication of information on hepatitis C; and liaison with the health research board in relation to the special programme of hepatitis C research projects.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with interested groups, I am currently considering a number of amendments to the draft establishment order to take into account the views expressed by these groups.  The secondary health care services, the consultative council and the research programme do not require new legislation as there is already statutory provision for these initiatives.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the purpose of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, is to make provision for primary health care services free of charge for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion. The primary health care services to be provided by the Bill, free of charge and without a means test, are: general practitioner services including prescribed drugs and medicines; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; independent counselling services; home help services; and home nursing services.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general practitioner services, those persons entitled may attend the general practitioner of their choice for all medical conditions.</P>
    <P>The dental, ophthalmic and aural services will be provided for these people within the meaning of section 67 of the Health Act, 1970.  Home help services within the meaning of section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, and home nursing services within the meaning of section 60 of the Health Act, 1970, will also be provided free of charge to persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or a blood product. These arrangements will also apply to <Col N="508" /> the children and partners of persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or a blood transfusion if such children and partners have also been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the interested groups I propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to clarify the entitlement for these specific categories of patients to be treated by the general practitioner of their choice for all medical conditions.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides at section 2 that a health board shall make available certain health services without charge to persons who have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of a human anti-D product.  I propose to introduce an amendment to this section on Committee Stage to include persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or other blood product. It was always my intention to include these additional categories of patients by way of regulation, as is clear from the health care package for hepatitis C patients which I published in December 1995.  However, following consultation with the representative groups I now propose to include these specific categories in the substantive legislation to allay any concerns that their members may have.</P>
    <P>I also propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to allow the chief executive office of the relevant health board to determine eligibility for these services within his discretion.  I am introducing this amendment following detailed discussions with Transfusion Positive to meet their genuine concerns regarding difficulties that might arise in acquiring past medical records for a number of their members.</P>
    <P>In detailed discussion with Transfusion Positive over the last number of weeks officers of my Department offered to give all necessary assistance to their members who were meeting difficulties in locating past medical records.  Transfusion Positive subsequently wrote to all their members and yesterday details of eight persons <Col N="509" /> who were encountering difficulties were forwarded to my Department.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I also propose to bring forward an amendment to include a provision in relation to a commencement order.  This will allow me time to finalise the necessary arrangements to ensure the provision of a high quality primary health care service.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision of the general practitioner services free of charge, I hope to commence negotiations with the general practitioner representative groups in the immediate future.  I trust that the co-operation shown recently by these groups in working successfully with my Department in relation to launching the optional testing programme will carry forward into the provision of these services.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary also to finalise arrangements in respect of the delivery of dental and other primary health care services outlined in the Bill.  I am confident I will be in a position to make the commencement order at an early date to put the services provided for in this Bill into effect.  I assure the House that whatever financial resources are necessary to meet the cost of these new services will be made available by me to the health boards.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for the health care needs of these persons, the Government is fully committed to fair compensation for those persons who contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion.  I established the compensation tribunal on 15 December 1995 and three priority cases have been heard to date.  I understand that the tribunal has also listed cases for hearing during the months of March and April.  I have every confidence that the tribunal will operate smoothly, efficiently and fairly.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, will copperfasten the Government's commitment to meeting the future health care needs of persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or a blood product.  The health care services, both at primary care and secondary care levels, will <Col N="510" /> meet the genuine concerns in relation to the continued provision of high quality health care into the future for those who have contracted hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;now&rdquo; and add at the end of the motion the following words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;when the tribunal providing for the payment of compensation to persons who have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin-anti-D and to persons of such other classes (if any) as may be prescribed is placed on a statutory footing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the fifth occasion in the House in the past number of months that there has been an opportunity to discuss hepatitis C.  One would have expected that in the time between debates and question times some headway would have been made on the issues involved. That is not the case and most of the issues remain as they were six months ago.  The only progress that has been made relates to the legislation before the House.  However, the Bill has been brought forward only after intensive efforts by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and groups representing the victims of hepatitis C.  The demands of victims were resisted every step of the way by the Minister until eventually he had to take some action.  Even when he did agree to publish a Bill he broke his commitment to consult the groups representing victims prior to publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was published on 18 December 1995 it had all the signs of being rushed.  For example, it failed to make any reference to those who were infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusions.  If this was an oversight then it was a most serious one as those infected through transfusions are a most vulnerable group.  Many of them have <Col N="511" /> life threatening conditions as a consequence of hepatitis C.  Many of these victims have not let their employers know they have hepatitis C so they are bearing their condition in silence and in private.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was hoping to get one over on them, because they do not wish to go public, it was a cheap political manoeuvre.  It has also backfired.  Public pressure has forced the Minister to consider amendments to his Bill.  If those amendments are not adequate &mdash; while I welcome them as announced in the House today &mdash; I will table, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, more inclusive amendments.</P>
    <P>As far as the Health (Amendment) Bill goes it rightfully puts on the Statute Book the Government's commitment to provide, without charge, certain health services to a category of persons who have contracted hepatitis C.  Their need for quality health care is compelling.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis C is a serious and potentially life threatening virus for which there is no effective cure.  According to the virus reference laboratory at University College, Dublin, up to 75 per cent of those infected with hepatitis C develop chronic hepatitis.  About one in five patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection develops cirrhosis of the liver.  Hepatitis C is a most uncertain disease.  The type which most of those infected through anti-D have is the least responsive to the standard interferon treatment.  Those with hepatitis C antibodies are continuing to undergo testing and it is not known how many of these have a hidden virus which current tests cannot discover.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis C infection is associated with several diseases which are not directly related to the liver. Side effects experienced include rheumatoid arthritis, extreme fatigue, eye problems and auto-immune diseases.  Hepatitis C is often a silent disease and many patients do not know they are sick until they are faced with possible irreversible liver damage.  While some might feel a <Col N="512" /> liver transplant would be the solution, hepatitis C infection almost universally recurs in a newly transplanted liver.</P>
    <P>Those who have hepatitis C include over 1,000 mothers who caught it from contaminated blood products administered when they were giving birth.  Half of these women have the full virus while more than a dozen children of the mothers and some partners have also been infected.  More than 500 others have been infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusions.  Renal transplant patients and haemophiliacs have also been infected.  All these people believed they were getting something which would save their lives and possibly that of their children.  Instead, through the negligence of the State, they were administered a deadly virus.</P>
    <P>The responsibility of the State in this matter was accepted by the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government once the tragedy and consequences became apparent.  A quality health care commitment was given by that Government in 1994 and, to copperfasten it, a promise was made to introduce legislation.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, was asked to bring forward a health care package and legislation.  The Government was briefed on a regular basis and told this was progressing. When the new Government took office in December 1994, we heard regularly after that from the Minister for Health about the promises of quality health care.  However, the package and the legislation were slow to materialise.</P>
    <P>In June 1995, when the Minister announced his flawed, <i>ad hoc</i> hepatitis C compensation tribunal, he made no reference whatsoever to the health care needs of the victims.  He no doubt believed foolishly that money would solve all his problems and that this was all the victims wanted.  In fact, of greater concern to the groups representing victims is whether ongoing treatment will be available in ten, 20 or even 30 years. This is why they are so concerned about the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the tribunal.  They are not primarily concerned about compensation but rather about their health. <Col N="513" /> They want to know how they will be treated today, tomorrow and in the future.</P>
    <P>Their concern about health care spurred them into tough and lengthy negotiations with the Government and the Minister for Health.  The Minister eventually gave a commitment to produce a health care package and to put it in statute.  Two years after the promise was made the package and Bill emerged.  The Bill represents part of the package and, provided the correct amendments are brought forward, it will eventually be sufficient to deal with the matters involved.  The other part of the package spells out in detail the hospital, general practitioner and other services which will be provided to the victims.  It includes reference to counselling services and allows for the establishment of a consultative council which will have a role in monitoring the services.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Bill and the health care package will only be as effective as the resources provided for it.  The health care package must not end up as a collection of aspirations which are never delivered.  Adequate funding for primary health care must be provided.  Funding of £2 million was included in the 1996 Health Estimate to cover hospital in-patient, out-patient and counselling services.  This strikes me as a rather inadequate allocation given that a recent study found it costs approximately £5,000 a year to treat each person who develops chronic hepatitis. Three-quarters of those with hepatitis C will reach this chronic stage. Based on these figures the drug treatment bill alone could be over £4 million a year.</P>
    <P>What does the £2 million Health Estimate allocation represent?  Will next year's allocation be more and at what rate will it increase over time?  Is this £2 million in 1996 just to cover the six clinics and will health boards provide further money for primary health care? Other questions also arise in relation to the health care elements of the Minister's proposals.  Has the Minister undertaken and completed discussions <Col N="514" /> with representatives of general practitioners in relation to hepatitis C patients?  Has the Minister negotiated a package so these patients will now be able to attend surgeries free of charge for all conditions?</P>
    <P>Up to now, infected victims had to pay for visits to their GP from their own pockets.  However, some general practitioners have refused to take money for such visits because of the tragedy and how it has affected their patients.  I commend such general practitioners. However, given that this was a tragedy caused by the State, doctors should not have to pick up the tab for the negligence of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the fee which has been negotiated with doctors and will he state for what period that fee agreement will apply?  Has the Minister addressed the concerns raised by some of the groups representing victims in relation to the failure of the General Medical Service payments scheme to meet the cost of some services required by individuals?  Will the Minister also explain if the agreement involving doctors and the Department of Health will allow for the time which will be needed for doctors to deal adequately with hepatitis C victims?  For example, will it allow for the time envisaged in the health care document for the provision of counselling services?</P>
    <P>The Bill places an onus on health boards to make services available to victims. Will the Minister outline the negotiations which took place with each health board?  Will the health boards receive additional funding to provide these services?  If so, will the Minister outline the amounts in detail in each case?  Has the Minister told the health boards what extra provision will be made in the budget for these new programmes? In addition, how will the delivery of these services impact on waiting lists in each health board area?</P>
    <P>In the health care document there is provision for dental, oral and counselling services.  These services are stretched and overcrowded; there are <Col N="515" /> already long waiting lists and they are longer now then they were a year ago. Will hepatitis C victims have to join the queue?  If they do not, does it mean the queues will get longer or will the resources be provided to health boards to keep the queues moving and the hepatitis C victims looked after?  In addition, will the Minister outline how the public service embargo will apply in relation to hepatitis C?  Will staff numbers be increased in health boards?  Will in-patient and out-patient access be fully available all the time?  Will all charges be waived and will they stay waived?</P>
    <P>Will somebody ensure the services provided by each health board are up to a national standard as one health board &mdash; as we have often discovered &mdash; may offer a good service, another may offer an adequate one and more perhaps may provide a poor one?  Who will provide the extra resources to ensure a health board's services come up to scratch? The intention behind the legislation is to provide the hepatitis C victims with the guarantees they deserve in relation to health care.  They do not deserve a health care agreement which is not properly funded.  Fianna Fáil will demand answers in the debate and on Committee Stage on the specifics of what will be provided and how it will be funded.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a number of other services in addition to general practitioner attendances and drugs.  As the Minister said, it provides for dental, ophthalmic and oral treatment and home care and counselling services. These may appear generous terms, but the reality is that, unless statutory provision is made for them, those infected could be refused access.  Already some of the victims have been refused treatment by their local dentist.  The dentists say they can no longer give them a simple filling because they do not accept the risk of treating a person they know to have hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Dentists who treat victims have altered appointments so that victims are <Col N="516" /> taken at the end of the day.  Such stigmatisation is difficult for many victims to bear.  Victims have also had to meet the cost of additional sterilisation requirements.  The humiliation of refusal and being singled out, as lepers were in the past, has created enormous hurt among victims.  It is also right that the provision of a range of medical services, including dental services, is included in the Bill as at least it ensures treatment and an end to discrimination of victims.</P>
    <P>Another medical service covered in the Bill relates to ophthalmic services as eye problems have been identified as a side effect of hepatitis C.  The individuals who are infected had to bear the cost of additional medical attention they required.  Home help and nursing services will also be provided under the terms of the Bill.  As there is no cure at present for hepatitis C, the health of many victims has already deteriorated while the health of others will worsen over time.  They may experience general ill health and liver damage ranging from chronic to a complete breakdown of the liver system.  The provision of nursing services means families will not be forced to take upon themselves the total burden of care.  Not all of those infected will require a service of this nature but it is essential that all health boards operate this provision where and when it is required.  That must be done with generosity; victims cannot be made to feel they are under a compliment to the particular health board.</P>
    <P>Since this controversy began three years ago the provision of counselling services has been a great weakness in the State's response; I would go so far as to say it has been a disgrace.  It was a disgrace that the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the guilty party in this affair, was given the job of counselling.  What the board undertook was a damage limitation exercise.  Women were asked questions about their lifestyle, ear piercing, tattoos and so on.  The counselling did not offer any comfort; the women even felt worse after it.  Those who availed of the service were treated <Col N="517" /> coldly, callously and without respect. They felt isolated and that they had been dismissed.</P>
    <P>The expert group, which produced a fine report on the hepatitis C controversy, stated that the board should have no future role in counselling.  That was a correct recommendation but the Minister was slow to make changes and political and support group pressure again had to be applied.  A detailed counselling scheme has not yet been agreed and the services currently in place are far from adequate.  Independent professional counselling services are not available nationwide.  I am using this opportunity to ask the Minister for Health to specify the funding he is allocating for counselling services.  I also want him to outline how he plans to expand the services to meet the current demand which will continue well into the future.</P>
    <P>Regulations are to accompany this legislation.  When will these be published and will they be discussed with the groups representing victims before their introduction?  These regulations are an important feature of the legislation and they should reflect fully the intention of the Government to provide quality health care services to the hepatitis C victims.</P>
    <P>Considerable concern has been expressed about this Bill because it did not make any mention of those who contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions. There was also a difficulty in relation to the health care document because it provided for special hepatitis C wards in hospitals.  Those who wished to maintain privacy would be immediately identified as victims if they were corralled into these special wards.  I understand negotiations have been continuing for some time on these difficulties and amendments and changes are to be brought forward by the Minister. There will be a guarantee opt-out on the designated wards and letters are to be provided by hospitals which will be made available to the victims.  I am happy enough with this compromise but <Col N="518" /> I remain concerned about the qualification for health care of those who contracted hepatitis C from transfusions and other sources.  I understand the new arrangement is that if a victim gets a medical consultant to write a letter saying that person has hepatitis C and had a blood transfusion, the chief executive officer of a health board can allocate them a hepatitis C card and health care. I am concerned in that if a medical consultant refused to give such a letter because there was some other factor involved, how would the hepatitis C victim obtain health care?  What if the health board chief executive officer disagreed?</P>
    <P>As I have said many times in this House, I am extremely concerned at the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the compensation tribunal and the rules and regulations applying to it.  These difficulties could eventually spill over into the health care element, particularly if a person is refused compensation by the tribunal. Will that person then be entitled to quality health care?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health's handling of the hepatitis C controversy has been a matter of some comment in the media and in the House.  It is no secret that I have been critical of his handling of the issue.  I thought my concern would abate with time but unfortunately this has not happened.  The latest matter to set the alarm bells ringing concerns the Minister's treatment of the funding for the groups representing victims.  As I understand it &mdash; perhaps the Minister would clarify this when responding &mdash; their lottery funding has been stopped and they are now dependent on funding from the Department of Health.  I detect &mdash; perhaps I am wrong &mdash; a distinct element of muzzling of the support groups in this regard.  The implication seems to be that unless they tone down their public comments and play the Minister's game, they could find themselves short of funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister is holding rigidly to his position on the tribunal despite all the apparent difficulties.  Those claiming at the tribunal do not have the right to <Col N="519" /> appear before it or indeed the right to have oral medical evidence heard. There is not any right to a provisional award even though hepatitis C is such an uncertain disease.  The flawed, <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the tribunal has not yet been resolved.  The most serious difficulty has been the failure of the Minister for Health to make any concession on the balance of probability requirement.  This heavy onus of proof that is put on the victims is likely to result in many of them failing to meet the criteria for the tribunal.  That could happen because medical records are lost or because it is impossible to prove conclusively the link between the blood or blood product they received and hepatitis C contamination.</P>
    <P>A number of other matters continue to concern me.  The Minister for Health said on a radio show recently that he would make contact with the tribunal. The tribunal subsequently made very small awards to two people.  Following that, the Minister said in the Dáil that the tribunal &ldquo;will hand down awards and as soon as some of the very large awards are made, there will be a rush of applicants&rdquo;.  How does the Minister know that large awards will be made?  Is this a strategy he is expounding?  How is it that even though the tribunal makes the award, the cheques come from the Department of Health?  Why is the tribunal so sensitive to public comment and why does it want to silence anyone who criticises it?</P>
    <P>The Minister is most naïve to believe that the lure of big money will somehow make the problem disappear.  It is insulting to the groups representing victims to accuse them of simply being interested in the money.  I can tell the Minister they are much more interested in health care than compensation and I call on him to apologise for the remarks he made in this House about compensation.</P>

      <P>The Government has tried to minimise the State's responsibility in this affair at every turn. It is making the tribunal appear as charity. The application forms for the tribunal could lead to information about the individuals concerned being disclosed to their employers and to various Departments, including the Revenue Commissioners.  The Government is trying to force victims to go before the tribunal rather than going to court with a legal challenge being mounted to one women's court application.  Heavy handed letters are being issued by the Chief State Solicitor's office to those who decide to go the court route.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health has given information to try to lure others into the tribunal.  Prior to Christmas, for example, the Minister said that 500 cases were ready to go but during Question Time at the beginning of this month he conceded that the tribunal had received only 72 applications.  What happens, for example, in the case of victims who have died?  No consideration is given, either at tribunal level or in the Department of Health, to such victims, their spouses, their partners, their children or their extended families.  It would be important for the Minister to let us know what exactly the Government proposes to do for the families of such victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had denied that he circulated application forms for the tribunal to victims.  Will he confirm that a personal message was sent by him to victims with individual application forms for the tribunal?  In the past I called on the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate whether a criminal prosecution should be brought in regard to this whole affair and in the past ten days I received a rather threatening letter in my mail as a result of that call.  As this debate shows, this scandal has serious health implications.  The Director of Public Prosecutions should investigate this issue because of the seriousness of the findings of the expert group which investigated the blood <Col N="521" /> bank and found that it breached its own rules.</P>
    <P>The events that occurred at the Blood Transfusion Service Board will hopefully never be repeated but the confidence of the public in the blood bank continues to be low.  We all heard about a recent blood scare following the infection of an individual who had received a transfusion.  An inquiry was ordered but its findings were inconclusive.  I find it most surprising that no organisation, company or individual was found to be responsible, that the inquiry drew a blank but that would not convince me that much has changed at the blood bank since the expert group compiled its report.  I intend, at the Select Committee on Social Affairs meeting later this week, to ask my colleagues to agree to issue an invitation to the management of the Blood Transfusion Service Board to appear before the committee at an early date.  Above all, in relation to the board, there is a need for openness, transparency and, definitely, accountability.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister responds to my questions and I appeal, once again, to Government backbench Deputies in Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left, all of whom have given personal commitments to hepatitis C victims and their families, to support the establishment of a statutory tribunal.  These Members have such opportunity now by voting for our amendment.  Victims and their families will no doubt be watching with interest.</P>

      <P>The welcome health care provisions the Minister is proposing in this Bill for hepatitis C victims form an integral part of a composite package which, regrettably, is still most unsatisfactory and with which the women concerned are very unhappy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is being introduced following detailed negotiations with the groups, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, which represent the victims of the hepatitis C scandal, the people who have been infected with a potentially <Col N="522" /> life threatening virus due to the negligence of a State board in the manufacture of Anti-D immunoglobulin.  The Bill provides for a statutory commitment to make available, without charge, certain health services to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C. This is in line with a commitment given to the House in February 1994 by the then Coalition Government to provide free health services for the victims of this tragedy.  The Bill is the result of two years of tough and protracted campaigning by the victims who have had to fight very hard to get the Government to agree to a health package which meets their needs.  It reflects that agreement and gives guarantees to the victims. To that extent I welcome the provisions announced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department had found it difficult to acknowledge that detailed health care guarantees were needed for the victims.  When, in June 1995, the Minister first gave details of the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal there was no reference to health care. After the predictable strong reaction from the women infected with the disease he realised he could not ignore their strong and genuine concerns, but it was only after months of hard negotiations that the Department finally agreed to a health package.</P>
    <P>Transfusion Positive, the group which represents those victims who contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions, argues that there is a lack of clarity about who may receive free medical treatment.  These people, who were excluded under the original Bill, believe that there is no certainty.  The difficulty is that obstacles could be put in their way.  Transfusion victims are encountering difficulties in recovering medical files which in many cases have been destroyed.  If there case is rejected at the tribunal, a health board could then refuse to provide free treatment.  The health board could also refuse if the person concerned decided not to apply to the tribunal.  If they do not qualify for a tribunal hearing because they are unable to satisfy the burden of proof, <Col N="523" /> who will satisfy the health board?  These victims could find themselves in a difficult situation seeking desperately needed health care.</P>
    <P>This Bill details part of the health care agreement negotiated with Positive Action.  It is a detailed agreement because of the complexity of the health problems associated with this illness.  It outlines the general practitioner, hospital and other services that will be provided for the victims.  It refers to counselling services and allows for the establishment of a consultative council which will have a role in monitoring services. These proposals are welcome.</P>
    <P>The members of Positive Action and Transfusion Positive welcome the health care package.  In this instance, the Minister and the officials of his Department have recognised their genuine concerns.  Will the Minister outline the detailed agreement reached with general practitioners regarding the services that will be provided?  Will he outline the negotiations that have been completed with the health boards with regard to their role in the provision of services and detail the way in which applications will be made for services by hepatitis C victims?  It would be useful if he could detail what funding has been provided by the Department specifically for these services.</P>
    <P>My party welcomes the proposals set out in the Bill by the Minister to meet the long-term health care needs of the women who have been infected.  It is a shame that these measures must be debated against a background of bad relations between the victims and the Government in relation to the tribunal. There has been a spectacular failure, in regard to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal, to recognise the equally genuine concerns of the women who have been infected.  The Minister continues to promote a tribunal which the largest group of hepatitis C victims continues to argue is unfair and flawed.  It is heartening that he recognised, as his officials did, the concerns of the victims about their <Col N="524" /> health needs, but the failure to recognise the concerns of Positive Action and Transfusion Positive in relation to the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal shows they have been listened to with one ear only.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is flawed because it is unfair in that it falls short of the commitment given in the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, to provide fair compensation.  The scheme should be acceptable to the women who have been infected with a potentially life threatening virus for which there is no cure.  What they have been offered is inadequate.  They received contaminated blood from a State board and everything possible should be done to ensure they are happy with the deal negotiated on their behalf.</P>
    <P>In addition to the physical injuries, all the women in question face an uncertain and unpredictable future.  The full extent of the damage to their health will only manifest itself in time.  Perhaps the most frightening aspect is that many of them suffer from cirhosis of the liver and may have to undergo a transplant. They face a panorama of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the reasons Positive Action believe the tribunal is flawed.  It does not give women the right to have oral medical evidence heard in individual cases.  The position now is that all medical and other evidence has to be submitted in writing in advance of a hearing.  The tribunal decides whether it will hear oral evidence.  There is a right of appeal to the tribunal members, the people who first refused to allow oral evidence to be heard.  Women wish to ensure that their cases are presented fairly and want the right to have their doctors heard, if warranted.  They also want the tribunal to have the right to compel witnesses to attend.  It does not have the power to direct or order any witness to appear before it, no matter how essential it may view that witness.</P>
    <P>Women want the right to receive a provisional award which is a key feature of the tribunal.  This allows a claimant to return again if her condition worsens, but a provisional award is only allowed <Col N="525" /> at the discretion of the tribunal.  Therefore, a women may opt for a provisional award for personal or health reasons, but find that she is denied it and given a lump sum against which she has no appeal.  If a women, or an infected child, accepts a provisional award, they have no guarantee that the tribunal will still be in existence if they return to have their condition and compensation claim reassessed.  Positive Action is seeking a limited form of contract between the individual and the State which would provide such a guarantee.  These demands are reasonable.</P>
    <P>When debating legislation on Second Stage we usually deal with academic points and what might happen. However, we are here addressing a situation involving real people with real needs.  When people express their demands in negotiating what they need and what will make them happy we hear what they require.  However, in terms of the tribunal, we should move towards making concessions to give them what they want.  We have all met these women and they are not unreasonable. Their health has suffered greatly and their lives, and the lives of their families have been terribly affected by this illness. Some of them are 40 years of age, suffer from cirrhosis of the liver and face a liver transplant operation.  It is reasonable for them to request that these outstanding matters be addressed. It is their view that the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting their health requirements, but they urge him to go the extra mile and make changes to the tribunal to render it acceptable.</P>
    <P>Those who contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions believe they are at a major disadvantage in making claims under the tribunal.  Their medical records at hospitals or at the Blood Transfusion Service Board, may be incomplete, lost or destroyed.  It was said some hospital records were lost when Dublin hospitals amalgamated and I understand some hospitals have a policy of destroying records after two years.  Records may not exist for people in their middle thirties who received <Col N="526" /> blood transfusions as children but who have not since received any.</P>
    <P>A problem may also arise regarding the chain of evidence.  A person who contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion may identify the batch of blood received and pass on that information to the Blood Transfusion Service Board which in turn may identify the donor.  However, the donor may not have given blood after 1991 when testing for hepatitis C was introduced so the board cannot say conclusively that the donor in question was the source of the infection and the donor cannot be ordered to have a test, so the chain of evidence is broken.</P>
    <P>The group representing these victims of blood transfusions has sought that the term &ldquo;balance of probabilities&rdquo; be dropped and replaced by more acceptable terminology.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate if this is possible, especially if he is committed to giving equal treatment to all of those infected, whether through blood transfusion or anti-D.</P>
    <P>Under the tribunal scheme, the Minister has power to make changes at any time.  These small number of changes should be conceded to make the tribunal satisfactory to all.  Promises were made to the women of Positive Action last November that the Minister would give them everything they wanted under the tribunal's structure, provided it was not a statutory tribunal, which was initially demanded.  Positive Action has always said that an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal would be considered acceptable if important changes were made; the <i>quid pro quo</i> for their agreeing to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal has been negated by the failure to concede the required outstanding matters.</P>
    <P>The members of Positive Action will not apply to the tribunal as it stands. According to the Minister's recent advice to the House, thus far the tribunal has received only 72 applications out of 1,800 potential claimants.  That shows the appalling and regrettable level of confidence the victims have in the tribunal.  It is sad that the goodwill <Col N="527" /> between the Minister and the women involved has evaporated.</P>
    <P>The members of Positive Action had two general meetings since the tribunal was announced and have overwhelmingly rejected it.  They have no confidence in it.  Providing what is needed would give them the confidence and I appeal for some flexibility from the Department in this regard.  Only the Minister can resolve the difficulties.  To date he chose to turn his face against their requests and in consequence, the State has been left open to a vast number of legal cases in the courts, cases which will not be settled as cheaply as by a tribunal.  Because of what has happened to these women and their experience in dealing with a State board, they have very little confidence in any public administration.  This loss of confidence is central to their relationship with the Minister and his Department.  Given that they have been seriously damaged by maladministration at the hands of the State, is it surprising that they distrust proposals and have no confidence in guarantees given with regard to the operations of the tribunal?  It is understandable that they are fearful.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obvious lack of transparency, one of the recent features of public administration in this State is the lack of accountability for action and inaction.  Deputy O'Malley addressed this matter in the House in the recent debate on the budget.  According to the Official Report, 1 February 1996; Column 2128, he stated:</P>
    <P>...the most easily understandable and glaring example of the lack of public accountability...lies in what has now come to light about the activities of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Its negligence in regard to contaminated anti-D immunoglobulin almost defies belief.  The ordinary civil negligence is, in effect, admitted by the Government...</P>
    <P>The more sinister aspect, however, arises when one considers the question of criminal negligence.  The <Col N="528" /> degree of negligence, wilful neglect and failure in this instance is so great that it is difficult to see how it can be less than a criminal offence, but what accountability have we had in that sphere?  Who is responsible?  Not alone are there no prosecutions, but there were golden handshakes for some officials of the board.</P>
    <P>Not for the first time, golden handshakes are accommodated and presented to public servants who deserve to be fired and, in this case, prosecuted.  Resignations were not sought or given in this case.  There were voluntary retirements; a deal was done in private with those involved in this maladministration.  There has been failure to hold accountable those responsible. In other jurisdictions they would be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>When the package of £60 million was set aside in the budget great passions were aroused in the House on the question of budgetary irregularities, but no such passions were displayed regarding the substance of the matter to which the allocation was made.  Nobody expressed outrage at what happened to these women.  The Government's deliberate intention was to minimise the enormity of what happened with regard to the hepatitis C scandal.  Public confidence has been severely damaged regarding the blood supply generally.  That is very worrying.  All steps should be taken to renew confidence in our blood products.</P>
    <P>When asked if the DPP would take a prosecution against those involved in the scandal, the Minister said it was none of his business because the DPP is independent.  The DPP is also unaccountable. If I ask why the DPP is not proceeding to prosecute those involved in the scandal I will not get an answer because the DPP's decisions are exercised independently and he does not have to account for his decisions.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of circuitous and fruitless debate on accountability that takes place in the House.  It represents a permanent flight from accountability <Col N="529" /> and is something I have become accustomed to with regard to the DPP and other office holders, health boards and so on.  There is also failure to publish reports ordered by the Minister on the maladministration in health boards because of legal difficulties.  There are many reasons nobody is ever held accountable for maladministration.</P>
    <P>The women infected with hepatitis C have been fighting for their rights for the past two years and they deserve the generosity shown to the public servants who were given golden handshakes.  The women concerned are being punished by the State for a second time.  At the outset the State did not have a leg to stand on in regard to this matter.  Every inch of territory conceded has been negotiated by the women and great credit is due to them.  Their continuing persistence must be admired, they have been empowered by this tragedy and many of them have been politicised because of the need to fight for justice.</P>
    <P>The health services and the tribunal form a composite package.  Despite the women's satisfaction with the medical service proposed in the Bill, the entire package is diminished and compromised by the serious deficiencies of the tribunal. One would have to be a woman to understand how badly this tragedy affected those concerned.  It flowed from one of their happiest moments, that of pregnancy and childbirth.  The fact that this tragedy is linked to such happiness must be distressing for them. Dr. Hederman O'Brien's report, which was damning in its criticism of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, should be debated by a committee of this House. I agree with Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that we need to examine the criminality of this matter and if the DPP does not do so, a committee of this House should pursue the matter.  We have tried to increase the Dáil's inquiring, as distinct from the legislative, role.  We have a role to play in inquiring into the maladministration of the Blood Transfusion Service Board at that time and since.</P>
    <P>The inadequacies of the scheme are clear and the Minister is well aware of <Col N="530" /> them.  Why is it so difficult to make these concessions?  The Minister did not explain why he is standing firm against the women's concerns.  This Bill provides an opportunity to introduce flexibility and for the Minister, in consultation with the women, to go back to the drawing board in regard to the tribunal. This should be possible given the goodwill of the Minister and the women who want to settle their differences with the State by getting reasonable compensation in a satisfactory tribunal.</P>
    <P>In December last Positive Action members rejected the tribunal because it was unfair.  The women concerned should not settle for half measures, they should keep up the fight.  They want justice, not charity, and they have every right to be furious.  They have been treated deplorably and the Minister must explain the intransigence on the matters about which they are still unhappy.  Months of negotiations by the women and others have failed to impress on the Department that the women will not give up on this matter. They are determined not to walk into an unfair tribunal on the promise of big money.  For that reason many of them are determined to pursue actions in the High Court.  I was surprised to learn that individual women have received letters from the Chief State Solicitor stating that if they ignore the tribunal and proceed through the courts &ldquo;the resulting litigation will be fully defended by the State, if necessary to the Supreme Court&rdquo;.  That type of State bullying of vulnerable women who seek to vindicate their constitutional rights in the courts is unacceptable.  I am sure the public would not agree with that being done in the name of the State and the people.  How does that type of attitude from the Chief State Solicitor's office and the State fit with the twin track approach to which the Minister referred on Question Time?  He referred to a twin track strategy, in other words, if the women did not like the tribunal they could go to the court.  If the matter were defended to the teeth in the court, surely this is not a twin track strategy. <Col N="531" /> There is no parity between the two options.  This inflexible response to the needs of women infected as a result of State negligence demonstrates a lack of understanding and empathy for the subjective needs of the women concerned. I hope moves can be made to get the parties back to the negotiating table on the outstanding issues.</P>

      <P>I deplore the outrageous carry-on of limiting time on Second Stage as it goes against proper debate in the House.</P>
      <P>The nature and appalling repercussions of this problem have been described in detail by people inside and outside the House.  I do not intend to deal with this any further except to take it as read.  I could not say anything more to illuminate the problem.  When the problem was identified the Minister and his predecessor moved commendably to respond to it.  This Minister, in particular, gave the matter priority during 1995 and held extensive consultations on the issue.  He worked with great sincerity to deal with the repercussions of the matter. I am sure both previous speakers agree that the package he announced last December, with the additions announced in the meantime, provide a comprehensive response to the problem. For that reason, some of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's remarks about the Minister's intentions and his approach are unwarranted and unworthy of her stature as a leading Member of the House.  In case she may have forgotten, the Government of which she was a member did not do anything about a tribunal. She may say it had not got that far and she would be correct to say that because it would vitiate many of her remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes statutory provision for the delivery of a series of services to the victims, and in some cases their partners and children, of this tragedy.  It puts the funding and the provision of those services beyond doubt.  When passed none of its provisions can be changed or affected by any transient approach or <Col N="532" /> difficulty in regard to public finances without a change in legislation.  That is why the Minister has put this provision on a statutory basis.  It is only fair to point out to the public that a report today in <i>The Irish Times</i> which attributes certain views to the Positive Action group in relation to funding is out of date.  It should be recognised that this Bill meets any concern that could be legitimately voiced about these matters.</P>
    <P>We must bring as much certainty as possible into the assistance and treatment that will be available to the victims of this appalling tragedy.  They, their partners and their children have to deal with enough uncertainty because of the nature of the problem.  Therefore, anything we can do in this Bill or in any other way to bring more certainty into the response they can expect would be welcome.  The part of the series of measures provided for in the Bill will be put on a statutory basis.  However, I fail to understand why the rest of the series is not being put on a statutory basis as the need for certainty in regard to the other parts of the response is just as great, if not greater.  Why is it not possible to set up the tribunal on a statutory basis?  I have made inquiries and have been told that a statutory tribunal would experience a number of technical difficulties in delivering the kind of things the tribunal is intended to deliver.  I have been told that by its nature a statutory tribunal would be more formal, less flexible, unwieldy, subject to greater delays and have potentially substantial legal costs.  Some of this might be the case but it is not inevitably the case.  It is not obvious to me that this would be the case and if that danger exists then a necessary part of the design of any statute is that it would avoid those problems. I cannot see any <i>prima facie</i> reason it should be beyond the wit of the people who design the scheme and draft the legislation to produce a scheme which would have the flexibility, convenience etc., of the tribunal now in place and to establish a tribunal on a statutory basis.  I have not heard any <Col N="533" /> convincing explanation of why there are these differences between a statutory and non-statutory tribunal and I would like to hear them.  I am sceptical at present and I would like to be conviced one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Some of the legal advice shown to me and given to the groups who discussed the matter with the Minister seems to be not only flawed but rather political in nature.  For example, it has been alleged to me that legal advice includes the suggestion that the method adopted to deal with this problem is designed to put the problem behind us as quickly as possible.  I cannot find any basis, even from my sceptical standpoint, for making that allegation about this action.  If anything, the attempt has been to ensure that the system continues for as long as it is needed and on as wide a basis as is needed.  That should be our approach when dealing with this legislation and when we come to deal in whatever manner is appropriate with the other measures.</P>
    <P>The suspicions and fears seem to be founded.  Deputy O'Donnell quoted responses alleged to have been made by the Chief State Solicitor's office to people who say they will not choose the tribunal route, that if they ignore the tribunal and proceed through the courts the resulting litigation will be fully defended by the State, if necessary, to the Supreme Court.  I do not know &mdash; and I cannot be bothered spending the time trying to find out &mdash; the legal formalities of the relationship between the Chief State Solicitor's office and a Department and Minister but it seems that common sense and humanity should prevail and that nobody in the Chief State Solicitors's office should be allowed even to think of communicating in those terms with anyone facing the kind of problems faced by the victims in this case.  This is outrageous and deplorable and if it happened it should be stopped immediately.</P>
    <P>Those who represent the victims have shown a commendable level of ability, expertise and persistence.  Given the problem they face they are to be <Col N="534" /> applauded.  I understand they have said that they are willing to consider proceeding on the basis of a non-statutory tribunal if certain conditions and concerns they have expressed are met.  I will not detail these as it would be tedious to do so.  The Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, Deputy O'Donnell and many other Deputies are fairly well acquainted with these matters but I ask the Minister to consider these conditions in the light of what he has said so far about the tribunal.  We owe it to the victims in this case to give them as much assurance as we can.  They need assurance and certainty and to know what exactly will be done to help them. None of them will ever be cured or feel that this problem has been rectified so that they can close the page and move on to a new chapter.  In the nature of the problem, no one will every feel that but at least they should be able to feel that if anything more emerges after a period of years there will be a response to it and it can be met if it is traceable back to this event.  I ask the Minister to consider the conditions on which agreement could be reached by a non-statutory tribunal in the light of the situation facing these victims.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that before Christmas the Opposition chose to make something of a political football of the funding for the tribunal.  I am sorry Deputy O'Donnell is not present as I would like to say this to her in the greatest of amity and directly to her, but undoubtedly she will read the record of my contribution with riveting interest. The part of her contribution which dealt with the argument about the £60 million was utterly glib and lacked any conviction or, to use her word, passion.  I found it rather entertaining to hear her passionless denunciation of the lack of passion in the debate about this issue. We heard from her the standard issue identikit Progessive Democrats' text on accountability &mdash; and the alleged lack of accountability &mdash; of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I found this more than a bit amusing given that later on this evening we will start a debate on a Bill <Col N="535" /> put forward by the same party which goes to considerable lengths to make it clear that it does not want or intend in its proposals on the criminal justice system to require the Director of Public Prosecutions to give an account in any particular case.  Before Deputy O'Donnell starts trying to manufacture ersatz passion in the House, makes glib remarks about passionless debates or gives out the standard doctrine as unreflectedly as she did this evening, she should read some of the Bills produced by her party.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessor acted with commendable thoroughness on this issues.  The Bill and the other measures which have been taken are comprehensive in that they seek to address all the aspects of the problem about which we know.  It is a great pity that the debate so far has been marred by the argument about whether the tribunal should be a statutory one.  It is also a great pity that the trauma to which the victims of this awful event have been subjected has been added to by this uncertainty and argument.  I think Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that there is in prospect and near at hand the means of resolving this problem and of arriving at an agreement so that we will have a tribunal, statutory or non-statutory, which can meet the real concerns of the 1,800 people most directly affected and, is some cases, of their spouses, partners and children and which will properly translate into action the concern the Government and its predecessor have brought to bear on the problem.  The means of resolving the problem are not far away from us and I urge the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that we get to that point.  The situation demands this and the sincerity the Minister has brought to it so far requires that to put the finishing touches to it.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's amendment.  There has been much talk about the hepatitis <Col N="536" /> C problem but to date, everything has been done in a piecemeal fashion to try to provide an adequate response in regard to treatment of those affected. Much of what is contained in the Bill in regard to primary care is aspirational.  A number of issues have been raised today, such as the Government's embargo on public sector appointments. Will this embargo affect primary care for these people?  Will extra funding and personnel be made available to the general practitioner service, the dental service and the carer's service?  People are experiencing difficulties in trying to see appropriate consultants and to get counselling. It is good to express a wish to provide counselling and dental services, but much of what is in the Bill is aspirational.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister has not yet entered into serious negotiations with general practitioners in regard to this service.  He is depending on their goodwill and they have been flexible to date. It is to be hoped that in the final analysis the Minister will offer them adequate money to solve the problem, but does this amount to putting the cart before the horse.  He should have entered negotiations earlier.  Most people who have been affected by hepatitis C are worried primarily about their health, they are not worried about the money even though monetary compensation will always be a factor.</P>
      <P>People in peripheral areas have difficulty getting to secondary treatment centres such as the major hospitals, and there has not been provision for this. Money has not been made available for transportation and so on.  People have difficulties staying overnight in cities etc. prior to treatment and provision should be made for those patients. Treatment should not cause too much disruption to families.  We must take account of those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know the long-term consequences of hepatitis C on patients.  We do not know whether the condition is progressive.  Not alone may it affect the liver but it may affect the eyes, the kidneys or other body systems and people <Col N="537" /> are worried about this.  They do not know what the outcome might be in regard to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and chronic fatigue.  People are not primarily worried about the money aspect, they would like to see provision for long-term treatment and not just on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone a long way to allay fears in regard to all aspects of this issue but it has been done in a piecemeal fashion.  He has produced a rather good package, but we want all of it put on a statutory basis.  Deputy Dukes said he does not see why this cannot be done.  The Minister has defended his ground well but if we are intent on solving the problem we should not be getting caught up between the statutory and the <i>ad hoc</i> aspects of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>We are primarily interested in the satisfactory outcome of the process because the Government, and its agencies, are responsible in one way or another.  This was not intentional, it was accidental.  Immunoglobulin has been beneficial through the years but, unfortunately, in this instance we have to take responsibility and we must deal with those affected in an amicable and straightforward manner.  People must be dealt with as human beings and in such a manner that they or their families will not have undue fears in the future.  This is part of the problem.  If all aspects of this package were put on a statutory basis, those affected would have no undue fears for the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, our spokesperson on Health, has adequately outlined the position and expressed the fears of those affected.  I do not want to go over the ground she covered but I urge the Minister to do his best to treat the women in a manner commensurate with his portfolio as Minister for Health. His interest should be in the health of those affected, not in the compensation to be paid to them.  In the future it will be remembered whether he treated the women as patients in a manner appropriate to the Minister for Health, whether he was interested in their health or in the compensation issue, <Col N="538" /> which is the main difficulty we seem to be running into in regard to this tribunal.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak on a point I spoke to the Minister about recently.  I am concerned about a group of people whom I do not believe are catered for in the Bill.  While there is a great deal of help for those affected by hepatitis C, a certain group has been left out.  I speak of the families of victims who have since died.  They have not been taken into consideration.  Two people whom I knew have since passed away.  I am led to believe that the compensation provided for these people will be based on the compensation which would be paid had their deaths been the result of a car acccident.  I have been in touch with a number of solicitors and they say that the families of these people will be entitled to something in the region of £7,500.  That is not adequate.  In such cases, compensation arises as a result of an accident in which the trauma dates from the time of the accident.  The trauma suffered by these families dates from the time the patient was diagnosed as having contracted hepatitis C.</P>
      <P>The people I refer to contracted hepatitis C through blood transfusions which they were given because they already had a chronic disease, and this hastened the deaths of these people.  In that context the Minister should ask the tribunal to remove the standard clause, if that is what it is banking on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister say whether provision can be made through the tribunal for this type of case?  There will be few such cases, but the families have suffered. Many husbands have given up their jobs.  They have had to meet added medical costs over the years and unwonted and unnecessary costs up to now.  I speak on behalf of a sector which has been left out, namely, the families of victims who have since passed away. I ask the Minister to consider granting them adequate compensation when they come before the tribunal.  It would be helpful also if these cases could be given <Col N="539" /> priority because the families have suffered the loss of a loved one but they have not been referred to in the deliberations to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing the grave trauma caused to the victims and their families, I thank the Minister sincerely for the manner in which he has moved to deal with this terrible tragedy in our generally excellent health care services which has resulted in many otherwise healthy women having to face an uncertain future.  Some of them, unfortunately, have gone to their eternal reward.</P>
      <P>A number of aspects of this Bill will have to be examined.  The Minister's proposals will deal with the ongoing health care of people who were affected, and the compensation available from the tribunal will go some way to soften the blow.  Let me deal with that aspect first.  The medical profession is unsure of the long-term effects on victims and what their life span and quality of life will be.  The Minister cannot, therefore, make a final settlement at this time.  Money is not the solution to the problem but it does help, and no matter what the package of health care proposals &mdash; and what is proposed is comprehensive &mdash; there will be ongoing costs and difficulties.  An interim settlement should, therefore, be part of the tribunal's brief, with the tribunal granting, say, £5,000 now and reviewing the person's health in a few years to see if there is a need for a further allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were innocent victims who went into hospital, in most cases for the birth of a baby which should be a joyful time.  The consequences turned out to be tragic.  Somebody was negligent and it is not good enough to say that there was a mistake, that we were not fully aware <i>vis-à-vis</i> the quality of blood, etc. I do not accept that.  The people involved were highly paid and had responsibilities.  When something goes wrong they cannot simply run away and say they were not aware, that they did not expect or did not understand.  The <Col N="540" /> people who were affected put their trust in those people when they accepted a blood transfusion or whatever caused this infection.  The people responsible will have to be held to account to ensure that this can never happen again because there is much concern among women about blood transfusions and about whether the quality of the blood they receive is of the highest standard and not contaminated.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to do is point the finger at officials who cannot come here to defend themselves.  However, I have read accounts about the manner in which blood was stored which, if true, should result in people being sacked.  I would like that matter addressed.  Was it simply a story in our national papers or is it true that blood collected from donors was stored in sheds at the back of Pelican House?  If it is not true, let us say so.  If it is true let us admit that there was carelessness and negligence.</P>
    <P>I want to speak on behalf of the women of rural Ireland because for them getting to a centre for treatment means travel costs and the disruption of a young family.  There may be good will and help offered but that can easily wear thin if a woman has to make regular trips to a centre or hospital.  Children cannot be left alone in the home.  It is not good enough to say that the father should be there &mdash; that may not be easy or possible.  Somebody will, therefore, have to look after the home while the woman travels to Dublin for treatment until she returns home.  Overnight accommodation will have to be made available to her, and I do not mean an iron bed in a cold hospital ward.  I want the best for these people who are the victims of a mistake on the part of the health services.  The women of rural Ireland will have to have access to the same treatment as women from our larger cities where the hospitals are located.  This should include overnight accommodation and a carer for the family while they are away.</P>
    <P>I note that in the list of primary <Col N="541" /> health care services the Minister mentions home help services which I welcome. That should be ongoing because the health of these women is weakened to the extent that they will need somebody to help them with their normal household duties until they build themselves up again.  The State should provide such help.</P>
    <P>A home nursing service should also be provided.  This should consist of something more than an occasional visit by district nurses who, although they provide an excellent service, are simply run off their feet.  A nurse should be designated to look after women infected with hepatitis C in a particular area. Their families need State support.</P>
    <P>The family of a woman infected with hepatitis C who has gone to her eternal reward is entitled to financial compensation, irrespective of whether she died from it or some other ailment.  If she was known to have received contaminated blood, that should be sufficient and the State should not try to discover the cause of death.</P>
    <P>Some problems remain to be resolved but I welcome the Minister's programme of health care services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his work in this area.  This is a serious problem and I hope life will be made easy for any woman who has been infected.  Women have been mistreated for far too long and their health was not seen as an issue.  My mother reared 13 children and she slaved for her family. The last person she thought about was herself.  Health is wealth.  People were infected through no fault of their own but as a result of bad management in the blood transfusion service.  Those who are to blame for this should be behind bars.  They got away with murder and walked away from this serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are few women doctors in County Mayo.  I tabled a question on the number of women doctors in Castlebar. Many women who come to my clinics tell me they have no choice but to attend a male doctor.  We are all aware <Col N="542" /> of the case where a male doctor videoed female patients in his surgery, that is disgraceful and I hope he is put behind bars.  For too long women were degraded and mistreated in this country. I stated on a radio programme that they must be twice as good as men to get on in any profession.  As far as their health is concerned they should be properly looked after.</P>
    <P>One of my relatives in County Mayo had to attend St. Luke's Hospital.  That is traumatic in itself because people know exactly why they are attending that hospital.  Her husband was on the dole and we tried to get money for her from the health board.  It was like extracting teeth from an ass.</P>
    <P>A person living in Belmullet who needs treatment must travel 70 miles to Ballina before going on a four hour bus journey to Dublin.  Such services should be available in Castlebar, Galway and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister should do everything possible for those infected with this serious illness.  Deputy Moffatt said this was not about money.  That is true; it is about women's health.  We must stop treating them as second class citizens.  I am glad that we have a number of women Deputies in the House, one as able as the other.  I hope the Minister will continue his good work and put the necessary funding in place.</P>
    <P>It is time women were respected for the work they do.  They are homemakers and look after children.  In some cases they are breadwinners.  They have not been treated properly.  What recognition is given to women who stay at home?  Those who serve on the Joint Committee on the Family realise how much they have been neglected.  The Minister must do what is right for those women who have been infected.</P>

      <P>What Deputy McDaid said is a welcome development. However, in rural areas the choice of a doctor under the GMS scheme is limited as far as the choice between male and female doctor is concerned.  In many rural practices doctors are generally male.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but in advance of women doctors coming on stream the Minister might consider giving GMS patients access to doctors who may not be in the GMS scheme but who practise in the area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister's efforts to tackle this difficult issue.  Like most speakers in this debate, I am not a medical person and am not familiar with the intricacies involved.  The Government is making an earnest effort to provide the necessary care for the women affected.  While providing a medical card to all those identified as suffering from the infection is welcome, there are a number of shortcomings which the Minister may wish to address.  These women put their faith in the health service and, like all of us who visit a GP's clinic or hospital, hoped the treatment they received would be beneficial to them.  They are helpless victims of the systematic failure of the Blood Transfusion Service Board to identify and respond to problems that were evident at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question needs to be raised as to why those responsible got off scot-free. They drew their lump sum payments, their fat &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; cheques, and were not held accountable.  That gives rise to considerable anxiety and anger among the victims.  It is important that public confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board be maintained so that blood reserves are not depleted &mdash; the event that gave rise to this Bill had the potential to eradicate public confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board <Col N="544" />&mdash; and I accept that the Government has made appropriate arrangements, but in a just society those responsible should pay the price.  If we compare this incident with a similar incident in France some years ago, the people responsible for causing people to be infected with contaminated products were brought before the courts and paid a price.</P>
    <P>When this controversy came to light it was essential to maintain public confidence, but that does not necessitate opening the escape routes for people who perpetrated injustice on a large section of the population.  Public confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board would be best served by pursuing those people vigorously.  In environmental law, the principle is that the polluter pays.  That is a coarse analogy, but a very high price is being paid by the large number of women who, through no fault of their own, are infected as a result of the ineptitude of those responsible. I do not know if the legal options are closed, but the Minister should give serious consideration to pursuing this principle and holding accountable those responsible.  If that means bringing them before the courts, so be it.  The Government is committed to accountability, and rightly so, but we have been remiss in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of support services for women living in rural areas.  The hospitals designated to provide a service for those infected are Cork University Hospital, Galway University Hospital and four hospitals in Dublin.  A large stretch of the country is uncovered in terms of providing the necessary care and attention for the women affected.  I accept that the provision of a medical card will be of benefit, but there are associated expenses, such as travelling to and from hospitals and overnight stay, which are not covered.  The Minister may suggest that people approach their local community welfare officer in that regard, but they are obliged to take into account people's means.  As I understand it, the intention is to remove <Col N="545" /> the necessity for a means test in providing services for affected people.  Given that a person living on a peninsula in west Kerry who has to travel to Cork University Hospital or a person living in Donegal who has to travel to University Hospital Galway incurs considerable expense, provision should be made for that.</P>
    <P>I do not bring medical expertise to this debate, but I have limited experience from my constituency, in terms of the number of people affected with whom I have had direct contact, and I am aware that the financial aspects are of concern to them.  While the proposals go some way towards meeting the needs, they fall short in some respects, particularly in regard to the points I raised.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for establishing the tribunal which, unlike a court, will respect the anonymity of these people.  As I understand it, the tribunal's decision will be final.  Medical opinion may suggest that it is not possible to predict with certainty the extent to which the problem will affect people's lives &mdash; for example, a person appearing before the tribunal with evidence of having been contaminated by infected blood product may not be in a state of critical ill-health and, on the evidence before it, the tribunal may decide that £X be given by way of compensation.</P>
    <P>Two to five years hence a victim's illness may have advanced to a stage which warrants a much greater compensation award than she originally received.  Is there a case to be made for interim compensation payments initially with a statutory provision for their review after five to ten years?  The Minister may argue that such a proposal would open the floodgates in terms of compensation claims, but there is a moral obligation on the State to adequately compensate the victims, given that a State service was found to be inadequate and negligent and that the women affected are before a tribunal through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> I compliment the Minister on the proposal before us which goes a long way towards meeting the concerns of those affected.  However, the Minister should bear in mind the reservations I made to which I invite him to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  I support the broad points made by the two previous speakers on two specific issues.  Deputy Creed raised the issue of responsibility for this appalling tragedy resulting from errors made in the Blood Transfusion Service Board and he contrasted it with the experience in other countries.  This issue is a matter of concern to Members and to the public.  In dealing with problems, it is part of the Irish psyche that we are willing to let the past be the past and that when matters are being sorted out to leave it at that.  That is good in some cases, but not in this one.  The consequences of the mistakes made here were major for many people.  They cannot be assessed at this point, perhaps that is an issue to which we should return.  The consequences have been enormous for the women directly affected and for their families.  When replying the Minister should comment on an issue of great concern to many Members, that such negligence could occur and that no element of responsibility has rested with anybody at any stage.  Is that a good marker for any person charged with responsibility for the provision of similar vital services in the future?</P>
      <P>A number of my colleagues, including Deputy Ring in his usual colourful fashion, made a case that has been put to us by Positive Action, that of the inadequacy of services in rural areas.  I acknowledge it is difficult to provide all the speciality services in a wide range of areas.  This is a practical issue and I am sure it is one the Minister will be able to resolve in future.  Travelling long distances to gain access to treatment adds greatly to the stress of those coping with difficult medical problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> We all welcome this Bill as it puts entitlement to long-term medical care for those infected with hepatitis C and their families on a statutory basis.  That was one of the possible responses discussed by the Minister when a delegation from Positive Action appeared before the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  While he considered it inappropriate to respond by way of a statutory tribunal, he considered he could respond by putting entitlements to many of the medical requirements on a statutory basis.  This Bill removes an element of uncertainty in regard to medical attention that was a cause of concern for the women affected, and their families, in terms of their overall fears about the handling of compensation claims by the tribunal.  This proposed package was welcomed and seen to respond in a transparent and reliable way to the needs of those women.  They are confident about this measure as this Bill writes their entitlement into law. We welcome the measure and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <P>We should also congratulate the Government on its commitment to pay compensation.  In the opening statement of its most recent correspondence outlining its remaining concerns, Positive Action acknowledges that the Government is prepared to pay compensation. That is an important commitment. There have been other injustices to which there have not been as good a response.  The Minister and his predecessor must be congratulated on their response.  Given that we have travelled almost 99 per cent of the way in the meeting of minds, it is unfortunate that although all the necessary structures are in place, a large number of the women affected are unwilling to use the avenues currently open to them.  The Minister has done his utmost to reach agreement on this.  He has generously met the groups involved in recent months and is anxious to resolve this problem in the best interests of the women concerned and in the most efficient manner.  Deputy Dukes <Col N="548" /> covered some of the arguments about statutory and non-statutory tribunals. While the Minister's objective has been to provide a speedy and efficient service by way of a tribunal, if the current stand-off remains in place, we will have the worst of all worlds.  A minority of those affected will use the tribunal and the majority will use the mechanism the Minister wished to avoid, a highly complex, expensive and slow-moving legal procedure.  Neither the Minister nor, I am sure, the women concerned want to take that route.</P>
    <P>Very few areas remain in respect of which there is a difference of opinion. The major issue is Positive Action's lack of confidence in a tribunal that does not give the women concerned the right to have oral medical evidence heard in their cases.  Another critical issue, to which Deputy Creed referred, is the right of the tribunal to refuse the women concerned provisional awards. Those two critical issues were identified around December.  If they were resolved, there could be a great meeting of minds.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's thinking on those remaining issues of conflict.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister indicated that he has established a compensation tribunal. It is not essentially the business of this Bill, but it is a related issue.  Three priority cases have been heard to date and cases are listed for March and April.  The Minister has every confidence that the tribunal will operate smoothly, efficiently and fairly.  I invite the Minister to expand on that.  Perhaps he would tie it in with the current impasse.  I gather that up to last week only 72 applications had been received. Has that position changed?  Does the Minister anticiapate it will change or is there anything further he can do to ensure the submission of at least another 1,000 applications to the tribunal? Those of us unaffected may find it difficult to understand the transformation wrought in the lives of in excess of 1,000 women and their families, who talk not only of their direct medical <Col N="549" /> problems but of the enormous personal and social problems.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is their deep hurt, tragedy and devastation that makes them so determined to fight their case, sometimes to the point at which many of us might be inclined to think they should be satisfied.  They have an interest in this matter beyond the immediate.  They are concerned about their future, about the next generation and who will look after them.  Therefore, they must carry out this task thoroughly and ensure they do not accept anything less than a settlement that will provide the best possible security for themselves and their children.</P>
    <P>While accepting the Minister has done everything possible and has bent over backwards to negotiate and renegotiate to devise the best possible proposals, there is perhaps one further step he could take which would lead to his desired result, which is that the majority of women will process their claims via the tribunal he has established.</P>
    <P>If progress was made on the two issues to which I referred and another two highlighted in other contributions &mdash; reservations about the privacy and confidentiality of the tribunal proceedings and the right to compel witnesses &mdash; it could well constitute the kiss of peace on this very tragic episode in our medical history.  Then at least we could be happy we had done our very best to address the huge damage done to these women.  It is worth this last effort to achieve the Minister's objective. When replying, I hope he will be able to report some progress in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity of speaking on this matter again.  I accept the very genuine efforts of the Minister, his predecessor and those of his departmental officials, all of whom are most anxious that this matter be thoroughly addressed.  The sincerity of contributions made here and within committees exemplifies our deep concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> I do not want to see a situation evolve where this matter would be relegated to the archives of this House, without any guarantees being given that everything will be dealt with as thoroughly as possible in the passage of this legislation. Unfortunately, this is a problem of our time and it is up to all of us to ensure that this legislation is the best that can be devised.  It is within our competence to ensure that everything possible is done, that we tease out every possible permutation, bearing in mind the nature of the problem and particularly the fact that many women have not yet come forward, despite the efforts of the Blood Transfusion Service and health boards. I hope those women affected by blood transfusions can be assured they will encounter no problems in coming forward, that they should make themselves available to the tribunal, when everything possible will be done to alleviate their fears and concerns.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill and the Minister's guarantees of access to proper primary and secondary health care services, in addition to the other equally if not more important programmes, in particular on research.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that a mistake had to surface before we were really aware of the problem.  Arising out of the special research programme to be undertaken guarantees should be given that anything necessary will be done to prevent this tragedy recurring.</P>
    <P>I am not comfortable regarding access to counselling services.  Within my general practitioner's area there are three or four women who have been affected. I must commend general practitioners nationwide who have done their utmost to ensure that everything possible is done to alleviate the damage, fears and concerns of those women.  While the Minister may have tired of listening to me talk of distances, about access to proper services and facilities, we are aware that all health boards are overstretched, particularly in the matter of trained professional counsellors.  I plead with him to ensure the availability of <Col N="551" /> adequate qualified counsellors, particularly in the context of a more regionalised policy on access, with particular reference to secondary health care services.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that Dublin hospitals are expert in addressing such problems, there is a need to provide such facilities in the north-west, ensuring proper access to the necessary secondary health care services for those living in Border regions.</P>
    <P>One or two of the Minister's comments leaped out at me, one being eligibility for private health care facilities. This decision, when left to a chief executive officer of a health board, does not inevitably result in equal access nationwide. For example, within the NorthWestern Health Board area, some service may be provided which may not be available within the Eastern Health Board area and so on.  I am very concerned at the general lack of uniformity. Since the Minister proposes tabling an amendment for Committee Stage, I must emphasise the need for uniformity and proper guidelines.  We are all aware that people interpret guidelines differently and so on.  I look forward to teasing out the Minister's amendment and the provision of such guarantees.</P>
    <P>I must ask also that the requisite resources be guaranteed for all of these services in order to deal with any problems arising, including those that may be encountered by the next generation.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is due to move the Second Stage of a Bill on Thursday next designed to tackle the menace of drug trafficking in our society.  What useful purpose will this Bill serve if, in the meantime, nothing is <Col N="552" /> done to restructure our creaking criminal prosecution service, to change our bail laws, to confront the issue of the so-called right to silence, to modernise and speed up criminal court proceedings, to bring our law on sentencing up to date and to tackle the revolving door chaos in our prisons?  These are issues the Minister can no longer ignore.  I do not pretend the chaos in our prosecution system in the courts and in prisons is the fault of this Minister, but it is her responsibility.  We will support the Minister's Bill on Thursday, but in return we request her to support action on the real problems in the criminal justice system</P>
    <P>This Bill is the real agenda on the prosecution and punishment of criminal offences.  It provides for major changes in our laws relating to the prosecution of offences, criminal procedures relating to accused persons, the extent of the right to silence, bail, control and management of the prison system, sentencing and the law relating to pardons, remissions and temporary releases.  Its philosophy is integration, speeding up trials, modernising criminal procedure and eliminating loopholes in the existing law which are well known to everyone and to this Government.  A great deal has been said about the revolving door policy in our prisons.  There has been a frustrating debate with repetitive dialogue by legislators who all agree that major changes are needed to come to grips with a defective criminal justice system.  The debate has been marked by an extraordinary degree of consensus, yet there is apparent paralysis and a frustrating inability to make the changes we all agree are needed.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that I have a particular interest in the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the prosecution of offences.  During the past two years I tabled dozens of questions to the Taoiseach on the functions and operation of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It was only after two years persistently questioning the Taoiseach that he eventually agreed to an internal inquiry into the operations <Col N="553" /> of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions as part of the Strategic Management Initiative.  I welcome this.</P>
    <P>It should not be so difficult for a Deputy to extract statistical information on the rates of prosecutions in the Director of Public Prosecutions office. A greater degree of accountability is required in the public interest.  It would not prejudice the necessary independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  For my efforts in the past two years I have been accused of politicising the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and of &ldquo;political sniping at the Director of Public Prosecutions under privilege.&rdquo;  I make no apology for my efforts in this matter because no arm of the criminal justice system, particularly the key area of decision-making as to whether to proceed to prosecution, can be permitted always to be independent, devoid of accountability and closed to scrutiny by any person at any time.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that the Taoiseach can make regulations under section 10 of the Prosecutions of Offences Act, 1974, to allow for the establishment of a unified prosecution service.  The Director of Public Prosecutions publicly called for the establishment of a unified prosecution service in the September 1995 issue of <i>Communiqué</i>, a Garda management magazine.  He referred to the &ldquo;absurd duplications and delays which were brought about by the current system whereby the decision-making function, which is his responsibility, and the actual running of the case is divided.&rdquo; The Chief State Solicitor's offices run the cases in the courts on the instructions of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>My Bill provides that these criminal prosecution functions of the Chief State Solicitor's office which is under the control of the Attorney General on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, will be carried out in future under the control and management of the Director of Public Prosecutions, either directly or indirectly.  This provision would increase the efficiency and speed <Col N="554" /> of prosecutions and eliminate the lengthy and protracted correspondence between the offices of the Chief State Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for an annual report by the Director of Public Prosecutions to be made to the Oireachtas. This would give a statutory basis to a recent suggestion by the Taoiseach that this might be possible.  Section 6 provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions will be a capable and compellable witness before Oireachtas committees on the functions, policies and procedures adopted by his office. This section would not impinge on the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in that he could not be questioned on a particular case.</P>
    <P>Recently I publicly criticised the Director of Public Prosecution's agreement to participate on a phone-in radio programme when he had not appeared before a Committee of this House and was reluctant to do so.  When he stated publicly on the airwaves that he had not been asked to attend a Dáil Committee, I arranged for the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to invite him to come before it with a view to discussing prosecution policy generally.  The invitation was issued in November and as far as I know, there has not been a reply from the director.</P>
    <P>When I read the article in <i>Communiqué</i> on the prosecution service I immediately sought to raise these publicly expressed views of the Director of Public Prosecutions with the Taoiseach, who has direct responsibility for him in the House.  Predictably, the question was transferred to the Minister for Justice and when she replied to it in due course I was flabbergasted to hear her say that she had not discussed these publicly expressed comments with the director nor did she intend to do so.  She said that she had met him socially, but that the independence of his office precluded her from discussing this matter with him.  Is it any wonder the criminal justice system is in the state that we find it when the Minister for Justice feels <Col N="555" /> precluded from discussing with a very senior independent office holder of 20 years standing proposals which he has made publicly on the prosecution service?</P>
    <P>On the question of the publication of an annual report by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the publication of such reports giving statistics relating to the category of complaints received by his office, the numbers of prosecutions initiated and the outcome would not compromise either the independence of the office or the good names of the people involved or alleged to be involved, since they would not be named.  The annual publication of such a report would be a very useful exercise. The only method of extracting statistical information of this kind is by the tortuous obstruction filled route of tabling parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>From my experience of talking to the victims of crime and from the experience in other jurisdictions, what victims want is basic information.  They do not necessarily want a greater degree of involvement in the trial, such as the right to address the court directly on sentencing, which happens in some US states and does not seem to work very well, they want information on the progress of the investigation, when the case will go to trial, the date to be set and some idea of what will happen on the day.</P>
    <P>The parents of a child who was due to give evidence against an adult in a sexual assault case contacted me recently about their concerns.  Because the child is under ten years, his parents wanted him to give his evidence by video link, which is available under present law, but there is no such facility in the court where the case was scheduled to be heard.  His parents were very concerned about him publicly confronting his alleged abuser and were considering withdrawing him from the case if he had to do so.</P>
    <P>From the allegation to the trial, our <Col N="556" /> system of justice should include the victim. This is not the case and the necessary independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is being used to needlessly cloak the office in secrecy and unaccountability.</P>
    <P>The question of bail forms a major part of this Bill and it is worth considering the background to the difficulties and complexities faced in amending our bail laws.  The Constitution does not mention the word &ldquo;bail&rdquo; but the constitutional dimension of the bail issue stems from judicial interpretation of Article 40.4.1º which states:</P>
    <P>No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>By a process of judicial interpretation over the years, this Article has come to be a guarantee that no person should be deprived of his or her liberty by &ldquo;stooping to methods which ignore the fundamental norms of the legal order postulated by the Constitution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Prior to the O'Callaghan case in 1966, the right to bail pending trial was flexible. In favour of granting bail was the overall policy against remanding an accused in custody pending trial where bail could be granted in safety.  Against bail, the courts looked to the seriousness of the crime, the likely penalty, the strength of the case, the prospects of a speedy trial, the criminal propensity of the accused, the attitude of the prosecution and the capacity of the accused to abuse bail to interfere with the evidence of witnesses.  In other words bail was largely discretionary depending very much on the attitude of the judge and the facts of each case but the O'Callaghan case changed all that.  The Supreme Court swept away the previous <i>ad hoc</i> judicial approach and excluded completely from consideration any suggestion that the accused might abuse his liberty to commit crimes.  This notion, said to be of preventative justice, was stated to be unknown to our system of criminal law.  This case forms the basis of the current difficulties and <Col N="557" /> complexities about a change in the bail laws.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court rejected out of hand the suggestion that bail was a privilege.  It was a right, they said, which would only be abridged for lawful reasons; in other words that the accused would abscond or interfere with witnesses. This has been described in Kelly's <i>Irish Constitution</i> as a spectacular liberal bridgehead on the territory of the State's claim to have accused persons remanded in custody pending trial. It is a very liberal approach and, perhaps, an experiment in liberalism which may have been appropriate to the low crime rate in the 1950s and 1960s.  Was it a bridgehead too far?  Many people feel it may well have been.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the Director of Public Prosecutions sought to persuade the Supreme Court to evacuate the O'Callaghan bridgehead.  That was not successful. Chief Justice Finlay said: &ldquo;the criminalising of mere intention has been usually a badge of an oppressive or unjust legal system&rdquo;.  Where do we go from here?  These issues cannot be brushed aside and the Progressive Democrats would not seek to imply that the matter is a simple one.  However, we should not be paralysed in the face of such difficulties.</P>
    <P>The traditional notion of innocent until proven guilty must be balanced against the fact that nowadays many criminals are persistent offenders.  Evidence of this high recidivism is that prisoners in Mountjoy have received, on average, ten separate sentences and that the number of convictions ranged from one to 93.  In 1994, the number of offences committed by persons while on bail was 4,416.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats strongly believe that the bail laws must be reasonably amended.  Bail should be hard to get in the case of an habitual offender who will abuse it to commit other crime.  Recently the High Court upheld the constitutionality of the law relating to &ldquo;binding over&rdquo; persons in respect of their future conduct.  The Bill proposes that bailsmen be required to <Col N="558" /> become sureties for the accused and stand to forfeit significant sums where the accused commits offences while on bail.  In this way, many habitual muggers, car thieves, drug addicts and house burglars would find that they simply cannot get bail to carry on their life of crime.  This amendment is possible without a referendum because it falls short of a reversal of the O'Callaghan case and, surely it provides a sufficient balance between the interests of the public and the rights of the individual.  There is no doubt that the present system of bail is too lax.  It is not followed in other jurisdictions with similar legal systems to our own.</P>
    <P>The extent of bail abuse is such that over 4,000 such crimes were committed in 1994.  Our proposals would not interfere with a potential referendum to be held on the matter.  The Law Reform Commission report, recently published, thoroughly examined the whole area of bail in this and other countries but it was significantly not asked to make recommendations for change.  This is a matter which needs political direction and it is a sore point within the Government parties.</P>

      <P>All the Government parties are in agreement so we can expect a change in the bail laws.  That is wonderful news.  Section 12 allows a judge of the District Court discretion to refuse an application to require the attendance of witnesses for the purpose of sworn depositions in the course of preliminary examination of indictable offences where a judge believes that the application is unjust for the reasons set out in the section.  The system of depositions is one with which neither the public nor non-practitioners would be <Col N="559" /> familiar.  At present the deposition procedure can be abused to delay a trial and the District Court judge has no discretion to refuse an application for depositions.  The section also provides that depositions, which at the moment have to be taken down in handwriting by the District Court clerk, can be recorded, transcribed and later signed by a witness.</P>
      <P>Section 13 amends the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, by inserting a new &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; process whereby the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General, as appropriate, can direct a person to be sent forward for trial without preliminary examination. The purpose of section 13 is to permit speedy trials in cases where the prosecutor is satisfied that a preliminary examination would be redundant on the basis that there will, as a matter of certainty, be sufficient evidence to have the case tried on indictment.</P>
      <P>Section 14 introduces a new investigatory provision in criminal law entitling members of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of superintendent, to apply to a judge of the District Court for formal interrogation before a judge of the District Court.  The record of any such interrogation is made admissible in subsequent proceedings. This section would be very useful for the investigation of organised criminals and drug traffickers where a formal interrogation could be held in a supervised setting before a District Court judge.</P>
      <P>Section 15 abolishes the existing rule to the effect that no guilty inference can be drawn from the silence of a suspect in circumstances where he fails to mention any fact relied on in his defence at the time he is charged or at a time when he might reasonably be expected to mention the fact.  An inference permitted under section 15 cannot, by itself, amount to sufficient evidence to convict an accused person.  It can only be used to corroborate other evidence; in other words, his failure to mention a fact, or his silence, is not conclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> Section 16 renders an accused person on a trial of indictment liable to be called upon to give evidence at the end of the prosecution case and allows a jury or the court hearing the case to draw an adverse inference from the failure of the accused person to give evidence when called to do so.  The adverse inference, cannot of itself, be sufficient grounds for conviction but it can be regarded as corroborative of other evidence against the accused.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the forensic examination of persons who have been remanded in custody for the purpose of taking bodily samples, blood samples, hair samples, saliva samples, or scrapings or fingerprints or photographs.  It is rather disgusting.</P>

      <P>Section 18 abolishes the archaic distinction between penal servitude and imprisonment and provides that, in future, courts will only hand down sentences of imprisonment. This archaic notion of penal servitude goes back to the time when people were deported to foreign lands where they had to endure hard labour and so on.  It is a distinction which has no value in a modern system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 19 requires the Director of Public Prosecutions to inquire about whether a person awaiting trial or sentence before the Circuit Criminal Court is a person to whom section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, applies and to inform the court before a sentence is imposed of the outcome of such inquiries. The purpose of this section is to make section 11 of the 1984 Act, which requires consecutive sentences in the case of offences committed while on bail, more effective.  The Law Reform Commission noted that section 11 was not being enforced by the courts to the extent that it was immediately after its enactment.  The section also requires the court, when informed by the prosecution of a belief that an offence was committed while on bail, to inquire and <Col N="561" /> to satisfy itself as to whether the provisions of section 11 of the 1984 Act have any implication.  This is one reasonable amendment which could easily be made to our existing law and would go a long way to giving effect to the legislative direction given in 1984 in regard to consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the imposition of partly suspended sentences and designed to increase the deterrent effect of partly suspended sentences.  It is envisaged that the courts might, say, in the case of a burglar, impose a four year sentence of which the last three years would be suspended for a period of five years after the conviction.  That sentence would be hanging over the accused and act as an incentive not to reoffend while the suspensory period is in place.</P>
    <P>Section 21 introduces into Irish law for the first time a power of recommendation on the part of a court imposing a mandatory life sentence in respect of a minimum period to be served by the accused.  This section would normally mean that the facts of any murder case would be outlined to the court even though the accused was pleading guilty and even though the sentence was mandatory.  For instance, in DPP <i>v.</i> McArthur, the facts of the murder of Bridie Gargan did not emerge at the time.  If section 21 had been in operation then, the people would have known the facts and the Minister would have had the benefit of a public recommendation as to the term of imprisonment to be served by the person convicted. The Bill seeks to make changes to the functioning of our prison service. No debate or Bill dealing with the system of justice would be complete without an analysis of the current prison system.</P>
    <P>There have been many reports on the prison system.  The Whitaker report in 1985 was an in-depth examination and it is noticeable that its recommendations have not yet been fully implemented. For the first time this Bill introduces central elements of that report, including a separate prison service office and <Col N="562" /> an inspector of prisons.  The patchwork of Victorian statutes governing the current prison shambles is replaced by a modern regulatory framework.</P>
    <P>New statutory duties are placed on the State to ensure adequate prison spaces and periodic qualitative and quantitative reviews of the prison service. It is well known that our prisons have become a costly shambles despite the best efforts of the dedicated people who work in them, from governors to prison officers and the probation service. The visiting committee of Mountjoy, the biggest prison, described it as a time bomb waiting to explode. Up to 600 men and women are housed in this jail in appalling conditions of overcrowding and limited sanitary facilities. Our biggest jail has become awash with drugs and despair.</P>
    <P>Exact numbers are unclear but it is recognised that up to 40 per cent of prisoners in Mountjoy are intravenous drug users, hopelessly addicted offenders in respect of whom no serious effort is made either to deal with their addiction or to attempt rehabilitation.  It costs approximately £44,000 a year per prisoner and that is just maintenance.  It does not relate to the capital cost.</P>
    <P>The cost of the prison service has increased by 50 per cent over the past five years although the prison population has increased by only 7 per cent. In other words, an extra £33 million has been spent on servicing an extra 160 prisoners.  Something is radically wrong with a system which lurches from crisis to crisis, which has long lost any aspiration of rehabilitation and which merely contains the wretched people who have been committed to Mountjoy to serve sentences which, due to shortage of space, they will not complete.  Much is said about the revolving door and I will deal with this aspect later in relation to temporary release and the abuse of that system.  There has been a revolving debate on the prison system for the past 20 years.  Nothing has changed; it has truly been paralysis by analysis.  For example, the annual reports of prisons are regularly out of date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> The Minister constantly says that more prisons are not the solution.  I strongly disagree.  Prison space is a key factor in any Government response to current crime levels.  Space is a vital part of the solution over which the Minister's Department has control.  This is the ingredient on which many of the other aspects of rehabilitation depend.  Without space, the other aspects of the multifaceted response cannot even begin.  It is like hoping to have a tourism industry without sufficient hotel rooms.  Our prison system is held in disrepute among the criminal class.  They treat it with contempt and they do not fear imprisonment; they count on premature release.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces new statutory duties on the State to ensure adequate prison spaces, in other words to know the extent of the problem and to devise strategies in that regard.  In 1985 the Whitaker report, the only comprehensive study of the penal system in Ireland, described Mountjoy as old and in very poor condition.  Its space for work, education and prisoners' welfare was totally inadequate.  The report suggested Mountjoy was out of line with the rest of the civilised world.  Millions of pounds have been spent in our name on the prison over the years.  However, there have been various misallocations and decisions made in terms of spending money because there was never enough.</P>
    <P>Mr. John Lonergan, the governor of Mountjoy, is on record as having said:</P>
    <P>If we had a say in how funds are utilised, this prison would be much improved.  We are consulted initially on what our requirements are but after that the Department takes over and we have no involvement whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Decisions are made by civil servants, but as they are out of touch with the reality of prison life, money is wasted by bad decision making.  For example, £1.5 million was spent on improvements to the prison's kitchens.  No serving facilities were included in the plans and this <Col N="564" /> expensive new kitchen stood idle for a year.  I wonder if it is yet in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Another obvious error was the £2.5 million spent on refurbishing the women's prison at Mountjoy.  When it was finished it was declared to be unsuitable for women and it now holds young offenders instead.  At any one time we have no more than 40 female prisoners in Mountjoy.  Three quarters of them are drug addicts, jailed for petty and persistent shoplifting to feed their habit.  We are spending £44,000 a year per woman and there is no rehabilitation of any meaning to these women.</P>
      <P>There was a costly installation of a time clock system which was designed to improve the productivity of the prison and reduce staff overtime bills. Basic conditions such as sanitary facilities are appalling.  At present, Mountjoy holds 619 prisoners and there are only 20 showers for them.  Inmates shower on a rota basis throughout the day.</P>
      <P>Wheatfield prison, the state of the art modern jail, is in marked contrast. However, due to overcrowding, its original purpose to house young offenders is now forgotten and it houses prisoners of all ages.  Electronic technology, which was meant to cut costs in this new prison, has not operated well and there are outrageous rumours that it costs £8 million in maintenance every year, by far the highest maintenance bill of any of our prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> We have one of the highest ratios of prison officers to inmates in the world. Why?  So many inmates abscond from our open prisons that they have become a source of fear in their localities.  Why? Why have we recently heard of criminal prosecutions against prison warders being dropped because of a threat of strike?  Who is in charge?</P>
    <P>There is no paroles and remissions board.  In 1985 the Whitaker report called for the establishment of an independent prison agency and this is proposed in the Bill.  Section 25 establishes a new executive office, to be called the prison service, to carry out the day-to-day running of the Department of Justice in respect of our prisons, as suggested by the Whitaker report.  Under this section the Minister retains the right to give directions to the prison service in relation to matters under its control and obliges the prison service to comply with the Minister's directions. Importantly, the Minister is still accountable to Dáil Éireann and Oireachtas committees in respect of the management and control of the prisons. However, the prison service will be under the day-to-day management, supervision and control of a director of prisons.  Section 27 provides for the appointment of an inspector of prisons, as also recommended in the Whitaker report.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill deals with pardons, remissions and temporary release of prisoners.  The executive power of commutation of the Minister for Justice, set out in section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, that is, the power to remit fines and sentences executively, has been controversial in recent years.  I was shocked when I realised such a facility existed.  I only realised this was the position when I was elected to the Dáil and many members of the public have no knowledge of such a system.  The power of remission is purely executive and in common with all executive powers, it has a capacity for abuse.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago a courageous District Court judge, Judge Brennan, <Col N="566" /> was so infuriated by what he saw as an abuse of the ministerial executive power in this regard that he took a successful constitutional action against the then Minister in exercising her powers under section 23 of the 1951 Act.  The court found on 23 April 1995 that the Minister's powers had not been exercised correctly in that there were no exceptional or unusual circumstances in any of the four test cases considered by the court.  The court further stated that this improper exercise of the Minister's powers had created a parallel system of justice.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the powers under section 23 of the 1951 Act to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional circumstances and they should not be used as a parallel system of justice.  The High Court found, as a matter of fact, that approximately 5,000 petitions were received each year in the Department. The court considered the year 1993, having been told the figures for any of the years from 1990 onwards were not significantly different.  In that year, the total number of petitions finalised was 4,050.  The number of petitions refused was 1,767 and extension of time for payment was granted in 604 cases.  Full remission was granted in 98 cases and partial mitigation of fines was proposed in over 1,500 cases.</P>
    <P>Prior to this judgment, the Minister for Justice and many Deputies, who are fond of the petition system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;fought hard to champion its use.  I do not agree with it and it is clear that petitions were being processed administratively by civil servants and had almost become routine. The court which handed down the sentence was aware of all the extenuating circumstances but was not consulted, and petitions were often initiated before the appeals system had been gone through.  There was no transparency about that; everything was done in secret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> This section requires the commutation to be notified to the court which imposed the penalty and the decision to be made public.  They are reasonable proposals.  The section is designed strictly to limit the use of remission in accordance with the recent court decision in relation to the powers of the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the prison service to fully account, by public register, for the use of this power of temporary release. When a prisoner is released on temporary release, that fact and the relevant details would have to be entered in a publicly available register within 28 days of the release.  Section 33, which deals with temporary releases, seeks to introduce a degree of transparency into our temporary release system.</P>
    <P>It is clear from replies to paraliamentary questions put by me to the Minister for Justice in September and November 1995 that she is presiding over a chaotic, unregulated temporary release régime which constitutes State indifference and recklessness as to public safety.  In a written reply to a parliamentary question on 20 September 1995 as to the number of offenders who had reoffended while on temporary release, the Minister stated: &ldquo;Such statistics could be compiled only through an examination of the individual records of several thousand offenders and this would involve the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would appear nobody bothers, or dares, to record whether offenders reoffend while on temporary release. Nobody knows how many of the 3,564 people released in 1993, for example, and the thousands more since then, have reoffended and thereby breached the conditions of their release.  Cases have been taken against the State by victims of offenders who committed the crime while on temporary release.  This presents the Minister and the State with a huge potential for State liability for offences committed while on temporary release.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> After much hounding by way of questions in the Dáil, the number of people unlawfully at large was eventually revealed to me on 9 November.  Eight persons escaped from a closed institution; 228 absconded from open institutions such as Loughan House; 784 offenders who had been granted temporary release had broken their conditions of release and were, technically, deemed unlawfully at large.  That is a total of 1,020.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, who took questions that day sought to minimise these scandalous figures by pleading that the vast majority of those offenders were only categorised as unlawfully at large because of technical breaches of their release conditions or as a result of absconding from open institutions.  He felt there was nothing to worry about and he stressed that open institutions accommodate less serious offenders, in other words, the public had nothing to fear from the 228 people who had escaped from open institutions.</P>
    <P>A scheme of temporary release, based originally on worthy notions such as compassion, rehabilitation and the integration of prisoners into society, has now become a routine vehicle for freeing up space.  No regard is had for public safety or public outrage at a particular crime.  A sentence delivered in public following a public trial is basically undermined in private.  We often do not even get to hear who has been released or the reason for that release.</P>
    <P>One of the most offensive aspects of the current system is what is known in the jargon used by the Department of Justice as &ldquo;unsupervised full temporary release&rdquo;.  That is little more than unconditional release.  Under this concept, a prisoner is released without having to serve any more of his sentence and without having to report to the Garda or to the probation service.  In theory, the offender is obliged to enter into a condition to keep the peace and be of good behaviour during the period of the release and he can be brought back to prison if he breaches this condition. <Col N="569" /> without the need for further court proceedings. The criteria applied in deciding whether to give a prisoner temporary release have never been publicised or debated in this House; they are simply departmental guidelines.</P>
    <P>Twelve years ago, the Supreme Court held that the wording of the current legislation does not allow a temporary release to be suspended in circumstances where a person has been charged with attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life while on temporary release.  The then Chief Justice warned that the legislation needed to be examined as a matter of urgency.  Nothing has been done in that regard.  There is a need to devise an effective and speedy way of getting prisoners who misbehave while on temporary release back into prison.  This could be done by stating a maximum period of release and by introducing measures relating to transparency which are included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A modern system of criminal justice must seek to achieve rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners into society. Time after time, those people who oppose radical measures brought forward on criminal justice reform by bleating about the fact that we must look to the causes of crime fail to see that the two objectives are not mutually exclusive.  One does not rule out the other.  We can look to the causes of crime &mdash; high unemployment, social alienation, juvenile delinquency and addiction &mdash; but our work on all these worthy measures need not postpone the delivery of effective criminal justice procedures to protect our citizens against crime.  There are other goals in this debate such as deterrents, punishment, public safety and a regard for public outrage at particularly dreadful crimes. Effective law and order need not await the Government's analysis of the root causes of crime.</P>
    <P>On Thursday next we will debate the first criminal legislation which this Minister has brought forward on law and order.  I know it well.  It was announced <Col N="570" /> with great fanfare last July and on several occasions since then by press release.  On the bail issue, we have had one step forward, two steps backwards, depending on the mood of the left wing component in the Government.</P>
    <P>No amount of &ldquo;get tough&rdquo; measures will improve the position if we do not get the basics right concerning the detection, prosecution, trial and punishment of crime.  This Bill addresses the real issues.  I ask the House to address those real issues by giving this Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I can be a superwoman on occasions.  The Bill is wide-ranging in its scope.  There are some ideas worth developing, while other parts seem to be fundamentally unsound.  Some of it inadequately pre-empts proposals the Government will bring forward and, for reasons I will explain, there must be grave doubts that it will achieve some of the benefits its proposer claims for it. One proposal seems to be glaringly unconstitutional while there must be doubts about the constitutionality of other parts of it.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains certain proposals for dealing with bail which I will address in some detail later, but it is important that I deal with various comments made, including a report in one of last Sunday's newspapers, to the effect that the Labour and Democratic Left partners in Government are at odds with me on the bail issue.  As the Taoiseach said today, those comments are fanciful nonsense. All the partners in Government are equally concerned about the problems with our bail laws and, I am sorry to have to disappoint the Deputies opposite, there will be no difficulty in our agreeing comprehensive and effective measures to deal with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is neither realistic nor effective to suggest that fundamental issues such as bail, the right to silence and sentencing <Col N="572" /> policy &mdash; to give just some examples &mdash; can be dealt with effectively in a piecemeal or patchwork way, but that is largely what is being done here.  For example, Part III dealing with bail, Part IV with criminal procedure and Part VII with pardons, remissions and temporary release are largely based on the provisions included in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1994, introduced by Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell, which was opposed by the then Government and Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>

      <P>In those circumstances while it might be accurate to describe some of the proposals in those sections as novel they are not new.  Much of what is new in the Bill relates to the prison service, but it is hard to regard the central proposal that the prison service be established as an independent agency and at the same time be subject to direction on every issue by the Minister for Justice as little more than a legislative optical illusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would represent a disservice to the community in general and victims of crime in particular to pretend that this Bill, through the use of some sort of legislative magic wand, could solve at a stroke the fundamental problems it purports to address.  Like the curate's egg, it may be good in spots, but the Government has concluded that to proceed with it and try to amend it subsequently would not be a practical approach.  To do so would needlessly delay and disrupt the comprehensive programme of criminal law reform the Government has under way.  In bringing forward its proposals the Government will have full regard to what is included in this Bill the debate on which will be useful in <Col N="573" /> informing its consideration of these matters.</P>
    <P>Before discussing some of the detail of what is proposed it might be useful to inform the House of some of the major criminal law reforms I will bring forward in coming months.</P>
    <P>Let me correct Deputy O'Donnell yet again.  The drug trafficking Bill was not the first criminal law Bill.  If the Courts and Court Officers Bill is not considered as effective legislation in improving the criminal law system, the Deputy will have to take some lessons from her colleagues who practice at the Bar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A new Criminal Law Bill will abolish outmoded distinctions in our criminal law and provide the Garda with a modern statutory code dealing with powers of arrest and entry into premises to effect an arrest and for changes including the abolition of penal servitude, hard labour and prison divisions. A Non-fatal Offences against the Person Bill will replace with modern provisions much of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  A Juvenile Justice Bill will represent the most comprehensive reform in this area since the foundation of the State.  A Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will free up gardaí from spending much time in the courts rather than on the prevention and detection of crime.  A Fraud Offences Bill will tackle in a modern, effective and comprehensive way what is often referred to as &ldquo;white-collar&rdquo; crime.</P>
      <P>These are all measures on which a substantial amount of work has been completed in my Department.  For example, the Government approved the general schemes of the Juvenile Justice Bill and the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Bill.

      <P>In the time available it would not be practical to comment in detail on every section of this Bill.  I am conscious that it deals with a number of issues which have been debated frequently in the House.  Large parts of it were included in a 1994 Bill which was debated in the House in June of that year.</P>
      <P>Part I deals with the prosecution of offences.  The Government is satisfied that developments in this area will adequately address the issues raised in the Bill.  Section 4 provides, in effect, for the establishment of a unified prosecution agency.  I understand that the work and functions of the Chief State Solicitor's Office are being examined as part of the Strategic Management Initiative process in the Office of the Attorney General.  In particular the work and functions of the Chief State Solicitor's Office in the criminal prosecution system and the question of a unified prosecution agency will be addressed by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the context of its Strategic Management Initiative.  In addition, the Department of Finance has commenced a review of the structure and organisation of the director's office.  Any decisions on a unified prosecution service will have to await the outcome of those initiatives.</P>
      <P>As to the other sections of Part I, the Taoiseach has informed the House of the position on making an annual report by the DPP while the question of compellability is being dealt with in the Houses of the Oireachtas (Privilege and Compellability) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II contains a number of proposals on our bail laws.  Examination of the Law Reform Commission report on the law of bail is nearing completion in my Department and I expect the Government will be in a position to make its decisions on bail in a matter of weeks.  What is contained in the Bill is a good illustration of why it is important that a detailed and comprehensive review be carried out by the Government before it reaches conclusions on <Col N="575" /> what is an extremely complex issue.  The Deputy accepts that this is the case.</P>
    <P>The main proposal in Part III is that when bail is being granted the bailsman should be required to become surety for the good behaviour of the accused while on bail and should be liable to forfeit the bail money where the accused commits any serious offence.  The explanatory memorandum states that the constitutionality of binding persons over to keep the peace and to be of good behaviour has recently been upheld by the High Court and that the proposed amendment of the bail law would not require a reversal of the decision in the O'Callaghan case.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that statement, it is by no means clear that there would not be constitutional problems with what is being proposed.  The explanatory memorandum may give the game away when it states that under this proposal bail would be much more difficult to obtain for habitual criminals and likely re-offenders. In the light of what the judgment in the O'Callaghan case said about bail not being preventive and that the question of whether a person was likely to turn up for trial was the determining issue, the imposition of conditions on bail that might make it more difficult to obtain, particularly where those conditions relate to the possibility of future offending, might give rise to constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>I presume the High Court case referred to in the explanatory memorandum is the case of Gregory and others <i>v.</i> District Judge Windle and others.  It is, at the very least, doubtful that what was decided in that case &mdash; which related to persons convicted of an offence &mdash; is authority for the proposition that it would be constitutional to require a bailsman to become surety for the good behaviour of an accused while on bail.</P>
    <P>In its report on the law of bail the Law Reform Commission considered the question of estreatment of bail if the accused commits further offence and concluded that it was difficult to see <Col N="576" /> how this would be effective in preventing the accussed from committing such further offences which was presumably, the object of the exercise.  It went on to say that such an approach diverted punishment from the accused and the fact that the courts were extremely reluctant to estreat bail in present circumstances would not encourage one to adopt this approach.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with two main areas: preliminary hearing and the right to silence. I have informed the House that I am considering the issue of preliminary examinations and in doing so I will take into account the proposals in this Bill which, incidentally, I note differ from those set out in Deputy O'Donoghue's Criminal Procedure Bill, which appear designed to abolish preliminary hearings. The explanatory memorandum indicates that the purpose of section 13 is to permit speedy trials in cases where the prosecutor is satisfied that preliminary examination would be redundant on the basis that there would be, as a matter of certainty, sufficient evidence to have the case tried on indictment. The section gives absolute discretion to the DPP and there is no reference to the criteria on which he might decide to exercise this power.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum does not refer to the fact that section 13 provides what to some extent might be regarded as the equivalent of a preliminary hearing in that it allows an accused to bring a pre-trial motion before the court of trial on the grounds that, had the charges been the subject of a preliminary examination, the accused would not have been sent forward for trial.  I would be interested to hear the views of Members on this subject, and specifically whether, if preliminary hearings were to be abolished, it would be better to do so absolutely, as Deputy O'Donoghue proposes, or adopt the hybrid approach contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The approach to the right to silence taken in this part of the Bill is also something of a hybrid in that it envisages a procedure whereby the Garda could seek to have a suspect questioned <Col N="577" /> by a judge of the District Court while at the same time allowing for the drawing of inferences from a failure to answer questions put by members of the Garda Síochána.  I have great difficulty in seeing why, if it is provided that inferences can be drawn from a failure to answer questions put during the course of Garda questioning, there is a need to provide a separate procedure to allow the courts to become involved in the questioning of suspects.  On the face of it, the proposals with regard to the courts, leaving aside objections of principle which may arise, would appear to be both radical and redundant, to coin a phrase, if Deputy Michael McDowell will allow me.  He will recall his comment at the foundation of his own party.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is possible to address properly such a fundamental issue as the right to silence through the inclusion in a Bill of the kind before the House this evening of a couple of sections of the type proposed without undertaking a full analysis and debate of the complex issues involved.  I have already informed the House that I am looking at this issue, especially in the context of recent developments of the jurisprudence in this area under the European Convention on Human Rights.  I do not believe that an answer lies in simply taking an off-the-shelf legislative provision from another jurisdiction. I note that at one point section 13 of the Bill refers to police officers rather than the Garda Síochána, which it refers to in almost every other section. This alerted me to the belief that it may have been taken from the legislation of some other jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains a number of measures with regard to sentencing.  I have already referred to the Criminal Law Bill which I will be introducing shortly and which will abolish the sentence of penal servitude and the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours. As to the other provisions in Part V relating to sentencing generally, this is not an area of law that lends itself to a piecemeal approach.  The House will be aware that, some time <Col N="578" /> ago, the Law Reform Commission published an extensive consultation paper on sentencing policy.  The sensible approach would be to await the commission's report on the matter before proceeding with the legislative change in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to section 19 obliging the DPP to make the court aware that a person might be subject to section 11 of the 1984 Act.  The act of making the court aware will not solve the problem that was highlighted in the Law Reform Commission's report.  As it stands, consecutive sentences are given, but some judges decide on the totality of sentences and themselves suspend the first sentence, leaving the consecutive sentence in place when they decide that the totality of two or three sentences is too much for the crimes at issue.  The problem lies in the way they are interpreting the legislation.  To have the DPP advise them to beware that somebody is subject to section 11 will not, of itself, change what is happening in practice.</P>

      <P>With regard to Part VI of the Bill dealing with prisons, I wish to extend an invitation I gave in the House some time ago to the two spokespersons for Justice on the other side.  I am aware that Deputy O'Donoghue has begun to discuss with my Department the means of taking up the invitation.  I am not aware that Deputy O'Donnell has done so and I warmly invite her to accept my invitation to visit Mountjoy Prison and any other prison.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have <Col N="579" /> done so, but not since I became Minister. I wish to invite her in my capacity as Minister.  It would help in highlighting some of the things that have changed since the comments I made in the House to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>The proposals contained in this part of the Bill cover three main areas: the provision of accommodation, the transfer of control of the management of prisons to an independent agency and the regulation of the powers of the Minister for Justice with regard to the management of prisons, disciplinary matters and legislation.  The thrust of this part appears to be towards a greatly enlarged prison system, nominally under the control of an independent agency made up almost entirely of the existing staff of the Prison Service, while retaining any real power for the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Part VI commences by proposing to impose on the Minister for Justice a duty to build, maintain and keep open sufficient prison space to accommodate those sentenced to imprisonment by the courts for, as the Bill states &ldquo;...the normal duration of the terms imposed on them...&rdquo; and to provide accommodation for persons remanded in custody, again as the Bill states...&rdquo; in so far as they are not accommodated in prisons&rdquo;.  Sections 23 and 24 provide that accommodation requirements be assessed on a three-yearly basis and that the accommodation needs of young offenders be met. There is very little new in this.</P>
      <P>It was unfortunate that Deputy O'Donnell should attack civil servants who are implementing prison policy in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> The comments the Deputy attributed to Mr. Lonergan are no longer relevant in the sense that there is now a system of close liaison between prison governors and staff and the planners in my Department regarding the provision of any new services in the prison.  This change has occurred recently.  The Deputy was right to highlight what Mr. Lonergan said but it is thankfully no longer relevant.  A governor's committee is also in place that decides on priorities for work in the prisons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>So there are no problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing legislation already imposes a duty on the Minister for Justice to provide custodial accommodation. What is new is the inclusion of the phrases &ldquo;... for the normal duration of the terms imposed...&rdquo; with regard to the accommodation of sentenced prisoners, and, &ldquo;...in so far as they are not accommodated in prisons&rdquo; with regard to remand prisoners.  If I interpret these directly I take it to mean that it is intended that sufficient accommodation should be provided to allow for all sentenced persons to serve the full term of their sentence to normal remission date and that remand prisoners should be accommodated in a separate institution from sentenced prisoners. While I share the obvious concerns regarding the growth of <i>ad hoc</i> releases in the prison system, which may have prompted these proposals, I have a number of problems with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal with regard to sentenced persons undermines the discretion of those charged with managing the prison system in providing planned and programmed early releases from custody.  Very often, and almost in every case, the papers regarding the release of prisoners contain a recommendation from prison governors and sometimes from the Garda.  I also receive a large volume of representations from Members of this House and the other House and from councillors and public <Col N="581" /> representative making a case for granting prisoners a period of temporary release or for a shortening of their sentences. It is wrong to imply that only officials in my Department deal with this issue.  Others are also concerned with a penal system that will allow some kind of structured early release programme. The development of a structured programme of release of suitable offenders, under the supervision of the probation and welfare service, is a cornerstone of prisons policy, as outlined in the policy document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan</i> and is an important element in eliminating unstructured temporary releases.  I am not denying that extra prison places are required.  The package of measures to combat crime, which I announced earlier this month, included the provision of 278 extra places in the next 18 months.</P>
    <P>Even if resources were unlimited &mdash; we all know they are not &mdash; early release arrangements, or parole, are viewed internationally as an essential element in progressive sentence management and, therefore, a certain level of early release would always be justified. The legislation allowing for that was introduced in 1960.  A temporary release system with supervision provides a flexible system of parole and offers scope for the management of offenders in the community with little risk to the public and enhanced prospects of leading offenders towards a more constructive lifestyle in the community. This is a proper and measured way forward for the prisons system. However, it would be naive to pretend that the system of early release because of pressure on space is as I or any other Member would wish.  It is not as effectively supervised as I would like, not because of the quality of the people carrying out the supervision, but because the number and nature of people coming out of our prisons does not allow for a proper supervision system. The measures I have put in place will address this problem, but I do not want to mislead the House.  It will take <Col N="582" /> some time to bring about improvements. I will do whatever I can while in office to make the necessary changes and I will consider suggestions from Deputy O'Donnell in that regard.  It would be native of her to believe that a proper supervision system would ensure that all habitual criminals would turn into angels and not commit further offences when released.  We must be realistic when dealing with this problem and not pretend that people are different from what they are.</P>
    <P>The proposal to house remand prisoners separately from sentenced prisoners has some merit.  Arrangements regarding the accommodation of all classes of prisoners are under constant review in my Department and will be given particular attention in the light of the extra prison spaces to be provided as part of the package of measures to combat crime which I have already mentioned.  The arrangements for remand prisoners will be included in this review.  They can best be handled on an administrative basis and placing them on a statutory basis would remove a significant element of flexibility in the use of prison resources.</P>
    <P>The remainder of this Part of the Bill deals with the Establishment of an independent agency to manage the prison system, to be called the prison service, and a definition of the role and powers of the Minister for Justice in relation to prisons.</P>
    <P>My first impression of these proposals is that they are potentially conflicting. On the one hand, sections 25, 26 and 27 outline the transfer of the maintenance, management and control of prisons from the Department of Justice to a separate executive office &mdash; namely, the prison service &mdash; under the control of a director and the appointment of an inspector of prisons.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, section 25 (2) and sections 28 and 29 grant the Minister for Justice powers to not only give directions to the proposed prison service, <Col N="583" /> with which it would be bound to comply, but also to make regulations covering all aspects of the ongoing management, control and supervision of prisons.  Therein lies the dilemma of conflict.</P>
    <P>Section 25 (3) prescribes that the Minister for Justice shall continue to be the authority answerable to the Oireachtas in respect of the prison system. These provisions do not represent a change in the powers currently vested in the Minister for Justice.  It is difficult to know what level of independence the proposed prison service could have in practice with these powers remaining with the Minister.</P>
    <P>In any event, the establishment of a prisons board is already under consideration in my Department.  As far back as June 1994 the policy document, The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan, contained a reference to possible structural changes, including consideration of the recommendation of the Whitaker report of 1985&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The case for a prisons board for the management of offenders was reviewed early last year in the light of the commitment in the document, A Government of Renewal, to an &ldquo;examination of the establishment of a prisons board to manage the day-to-day running of the prisons&rdquo; and a reassessment of the capacity of the prisons division, as at present structured and resourced, to absorb the workload and responsibilities which are involved in the implementation of the five year plan.</P>
      <P>The Department considered the whole position afresh and discussed proposals with the Department of Finance for the creation of a board which would run the prison service, possibly on an agency basis.  Discussions with the Department of Finance on these proposals are ongoing.  Issues which arise are very complex and will need very careful consideration.  A proper balance will need to be achieved in regard to the administrative advantages or disadvantages of such a structure, the degree to which it would exercise autonomy in decision making in relation to prisoner and staff issues and the staffing structure.</P>
      <P>The appointment of an inspector of prisons will also be considered in this context.  The five year plan recommended that such an inspector be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final section of this Part of the Bill, section 30, deals with the amendment of prison statutes.  It proposes to allow the Minister for Justice, by regulation to repeal, replace, amend or adapt any of the provisions of the various Acts governing the prison system. This is an unusual provision, to say the least, in that it purports to enable a Minister to amend primary legislation by ministerial regulation.  I know of no democratic administration that grants a Minister such powers and I would not wish to have such powers.  In any event, <Col N="585" /> the proposal is glaringly unconstitutional.</P>

They were included in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1994, and I support their rejection by the then Minister for Justice essentially on the grounds they were not in the public interest.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in commending Deputy O'Donnell on introducing this Bill.  It represents another attempt by Members to address the issues of crime and criminal law reform in the absence of any policy emanating from the Government.  That is unfortunate but true.  Until the publication of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996, there was no legislation emanating from the Minister's Department to tackle the crime problem.  It is ironic that in the final analysis there was no need for the Minister to introduce that legislation because the Fianna Fáil Bill, which preceded it, is far superior.</P>

      <P>It is apparent that there is cross-party consensus that certain steps, including a referendum on <Col N="586" /> the bail laws, are necessary to restore a fair balance to the criminal justice system. The will of the majority of Members to take measured steps to curtail the prevalence of crime is being thwarted by the exercise of a political veto by a small minority of Members.

      <P>One suggestion which has been made is that bail should be denied to people who might be likely to commit crimes while they are on bail.</P>
      <P>That is the kernel of the issue because, as the Minister and the Tánaiste well know, that would require a constitutional referendum.  He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind that everyone is innocent until proven guilty [everyone agrees with that sentiment] would it not be better to consider seriously an alternative approach to make absolutely sure that there will be <Col N="588" /> serious and major extra penalties for any crime committed while on bail. This could be done, for example, by changing the law to make any abuse of bail a crime in itself and to ensure that any sentences imposed in respect of such abuse would be served consecutively rather than concurrently.</P>

What she meant by that is that it would be made possible for a judge to refuse bail to a person if he was likely to commit a criminal offence which would also be an indictable offence, if admitted to bail.  The Tánaiste gave the Minister her answer in <i>The Kerryman</i> on 2 February last and the unattributable source in Mr. Kevin Moore's article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday confirmed that view very well.</P>

Nothing could be fairer than that.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to point out that there was a time when members of Fine Gael would not have stood for the Machiavellian ministerings of the Tánaiste.

That day is gone too.  Fine Gael is now no more than a pedestal for the Tánaiste to pose on and it appears content with the trappings rather than the substance of office.

      <P>Every Member of this House knows people who have suffered from crimes committed by persons on bail. The number of crimes committed by persons on bail has increased from 2,494 in 1990 to 4,416 last year.</P>
      <P>May I again remind the Minister for Justice that in or around the month of June 1995 she received the Garda Commissioner's report on crime for 1994? Those figures were made available to her as Minister for Justice; she was the first Minister for Justice; to receive them but she did not publish the commissioner's report until December 1995. Subsequent to making the aforementioned statement, the Minister received the report of the Law Reform Commission which she kept for a number of months and published on the eve of the debate last autumn on the Fianna Fáil-introduced Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 1995.</P>

      <P>I recognise the Minister's determination to hold a referendum.  I believe that when she told this House on 3 May last that &ldquo;All the advice available to me is that any substantial and effective changes require a constitutional amendment&rdquo;, she spoke the truth.

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity of raising this important issue and the Minister for being here to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a society where, on the one hand, there are those who insist on harking back to a mythical golden age and would want to return there, where the family was sacrosanct, the church the only custodian of moral standards, where children were happy and well cared for and men and women wholly content.  On the other hand we have what is becoming a reality roll call &mdash; the Fr. Brendan Smyth affair, the Madonna House inquiry, the Kelly Fitzgerald case, the west of Ireland farmer case, Trudder House, the Kilkenny incest investigation and now Goldenbridge and, perhaps, Rathdrum &mdash; a litany of abuse and scandalous cruelty visited upon children within their homes and in residential care centres in the Ireland of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and right up to recent times.  When we discuss the future of the family, let us never <Col N="599" /> forget the past.  The past, whatever it has to contribute to our thinking in a positive way, is littered with warnings of how values then were often rigid, excluding and frequently cruel.</P>
    <P>The public are outraged, upset and concerned about recent revelations and these scandals raise profound questions about the role of the church in institutional abuse of children, the legacy of child care services in this State and the general approach to the most disadvantaged children in our society.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of individual failure, however, although there has been individual failure and, undoubtedly, individual sadism.  It is also the failure of Irish society, and let us make no mistake about that.  There are questions for all of us, for the church authorities, the public and politicians.  We have to ask who were these children who required residential care.  They were the most vulnerable in Irish society.  In many cases they were there because of the shame and stigma associated with an unexpected or crisis pregnancy. In many cases the children were in residential care not because of the failure of individual parents but because of poverty.  This was especially a feature of the 1950s.  It is also about the way women, pregnant women in particular, were treated by society.</P>
    <P>The public are entitled to ask how could a political and social system, based on a Constitution which articulates a special concern, expressed in the most human terms to cherish all of its children equally, end up with such an insensitive and incomplete response to the welfare of children.  That is changing and the Government is taking action in a whole range of areas.</P>
    <P>We are now aware, however, because the awareness has been forced upon us, that the welfare of children in Ireland has been a hit and miss affair and that there is gross abuse of children within the sacrosanct shrine of the family and within the residential homes where children are placed for safety.</P>
    <P>The immediate questions that arise <Col N="600" /> are whether the Minister can find a way of initiating inquiries which can be published, and whether we can learn as much as possible from those inquiries and reports already completed.  Do we need legislation at this stage to ensure that these reports can be published and do not get caught up in the adversarial system?  Perhaps the Law Reform Commission should urgently examine the <i>cul-de-sac</i> we appear to be in regarding publication of these reports but, of course, as the Director of Public Prosecutions said last year the adversarial criminal system is singularly unsuitable for dealing with child sexual abuse, and it would now appear that the failure to publish these reports stems from this.</P>
    <P>The announcement of an independent inspectorate is a significant move forward and I would like to congratulate the Minister on announcing it yesterday. It is a step which I have advocated in this House and outside for the past three years.  It is essential that it is independent from both the health boards and the Department of Health.  The health boards cannot inspect themselves. Only when there is an independent inspectorate will the public feel there are proper systems in place which will be sensitive to what is happening to children in residential care.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to look at the recommendations from the Disability Federation of Ireland that institutions which look after physically and mentally handicapped children should come within the remit of the independent inspectorate.  The same safeguards should also be put in place for those who are involved in foster care, otherwise in ten years time we will be talking about scandals in this area.</P>
    <P>A range of other actions needs to be taken.  We must monitor the reference system put in place for workers in residential care and in all services that deal with children.  The qualifications, training, support and supervision of workers in residential homes must receive the highest priority.  We must not lose sight of how very difficult this work is and the <Col N="601" /> severity of the problems of children currently in care.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to outline the information available to date on the Goldenbridge case and the Wicklow residential centres and the action he intends to take, and to consider a public inquiry at this stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the more open response we have seen from the Sisters of Mercy and the way they are trying to help the victims. This is in contrast to the way many cases have been dealt with recently. There must be no cover-up.  Every mechanism must be put in place to ensure that these abuses never again happen in residential care.  Abuse will occur, but we must take every possible step to minimise this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with pathetic regularity that abuse of children is raised in the House usually, quite sadly, on the Adjournment when there occurs a fruitless dialogue between Opposition or Government Deputies and the Minister of the day in an effort to bring about changes in the system which are patently needed.</P>
      <P>The recent revelations about the Goldenbridge orphanage yet again challenge us to assess the adequacy of procedures which currently apply in such residential care centres to protect children from abuse.  The word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; as a term now trips off the political tongue, and it is very important never to lose sight of the depravity and horror which form the facts in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Such a litany of abuse which has been disclosed and exposed to public scrutiny by programmes such as the RTÉ production on the Goldenbridge orphanage is yet another reminder that we cannot yet claim to have minimal standards and procedures to protect children in care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years the Kilkenny incest case, the Kelly Fitzgerald case. Trudder House, Madonna House and a spate of clerical abuse cases have brought home to the public the degree of maladministration on the part of <Col N="602" /> statutory and voluntary agencies delegated with powers and responsibilities to care for vulnerable children.  What a double tragedy it is that children who have been removed from dysfunctional families, who have been orphaned or who for some other reason are placed in theoretically safe care should find that that supposed refuge is not safe at all.</P>
    <P>We have seen in the Kelly Fitzgerald and Madonna House cases a flight from accountability on the grounds of legal advice relating to concern as to the rights of third parties in such matters as the publication of those reports.  In reply to a question I tabled the Minister of State at the Department of Health stated in October that he was seeking &ldquo;urgent advice&rdquo; from the Attorney General on how much, if any, of the Madonna House report could be published. Despite the claimed urgency, it emerged at Question Time on 8 February that the <i>status quo</i> was maintained.</P>
    <P>As regards the Kelly Fitzgerald case, it would appear the chief executive officer of the health board in question is also taking legal advice on publication of the report.  Incredibly the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, said neither he nor the Minister for Health had seen the report in question.  Is a blind eye being turned?  Why is the report cloaked in secrecy?  The persons convicted of neglecting their daughter have completed their sentences yet we do not have the report on the health board's handling of the case.  Why does the Minister not demand to see the report?  Who is protecting whom?  I welcome the announcement yesterday that an independent inspectorate will deal with health boards and others who have responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>Many residential care institutions are run by voluntary and religious organisations. The church has a dismal record in reporting child abuse, not to mention the involvement of clerics in child abuse.  I hope in highlighting such matters the church has learned lessons but have the church and civil authorities engaged in providing joint formal mechanisms to ensure future cases do not go <Col N="603" /> unreported?  In the case of victims of past unprosecuted abuse with whom settlements were made, has the State attempted to follow up the whereabouts of the priests involved?  We do not have an abuse register despite it being a key recommendation of the Kilkenny incest report and the overwhelming evidence for such a register.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern is the adequacy of places in which to accommodate children who are the subject of emergency care orders.  On 23 January I tabled a question to the Minister for Health on this issue and in reply he stated that the information sought was not readily available but would be forwarded to me in due course.  However, one month later I have not received that information.  My motivation in tabling the question was prompted by a report that, on an evening in January, three children under the age of nine were driven in a squad car with a social worker in a vain search for a bed for the night.  They had been removed from their parents under an emergency care order and were held overnight in a hospital ward, having been refused access to another hospital.  There is also concern that children in care until the age of 16 years are left homeless.  A health board survey found that one-third of those who presented as homeless in the Dublin area had formerly been in residential care.</P>
    <P>I trust every measure will be taken by the State to inquire further into the Goldenbridge and Rathdrum orphanages. Apologies, while worthwhile, worthy and welcome, are not a substitute for a formal immediate response by the church authorities and the Government to ensure such depravity will never again be visited on vulnerable Irish children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank both Deputies for their contributions and welcome the opportunity to express my concern and deep regret at the very disturbing revelations concerning Goldenbridge <Col N="604" /> orphange about 40 years ago.  The events described in the documentary &ldquo;Dear Daughter&rdquo; shocked everybody. They raised many uncomfortable questions about attitudes and practices towards children 30 years ago and how such things could have gone on without any action been taken to stop them.</P>
      <P>The Mercy Order has accepted that the broad pattern of complaints are accurate.  The Order brought in an independent expert to investigate the allegations of abuse.  He concluded, based on the information available at the time, that the thrust of the complaints was valid and that the regime in the orphanage at that time was harsh and punitive. The Order accepts that staff members were caught up in this system, that a strong ethos of fear dominated all relationships and roles and that monitoring does not appear to have been adequate.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the Mercy Order has been very open in its response to this difficult situation.  It has expressed its deep regret and sorrow that children in its care experienced such hardship and has accepted that mistakes were made. An independent and confidential helpline has been put in place.  The Order has contracted the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre to run the helpline which will be kept open as long as necessary and has offered counselling to those who require it.  Finally the Order has made arrangements to direct people making specific complaints to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been calls for an inquiry into the allegations.  Given the time that has elapsed and the death and fading faculties of many of the staff involved in the running of Goldenbridge at the time, an inquiry would have great difficulty establishing the truth or otherwise of some of the specific allegations made. However, I intend to monitor the situation to see if an inquiry would be justified on the basis of new information emerging.  There have also been calls for the Minister for Health to accept responsibility for the conditions and practices in Goldenbridge at the time. <Col N="605" /> In fact, Goldenbridge was the responsibility of the Minister for Education at the time.  Responsibility for funding the home was transferred to the Department of Health in the early 1980s.</P>
    <P>The sister who was in charge of Goldenbridge during the period in which the allegations were made was subsequently transferred to another orphanage run by the Order.  The Eastern Health Board is organising a review of care practices in the home.  It proposes to interview five residents from each year over a ten year period during which she was in charge of the home.  I welcome this initiative by the Eastern Health Board.  We will have to wait to see what emerges from this process.</P>
    <P>There have been many developments in residential care for children since the fifties and sixties.  There has been a major shift from residential to fostering as the preferred mode of care.  Only 28 per cent of children in care were in foster care in 1970 whereas the current figure is over 75 per cent.  Many of the larger residential centres have been closed.  The trend has been towards smaller, more specialised units with services being provided by trained workers.  There has been a gradual shift in residential provision from voluntary to statutory management.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important lesson to be learned from the Goldenbridge case is the need to ensure that services for children in need of care from statutory bodies conform to the highest standards. We are tackling this problem in a number of ways.  This Government has given child care a high priority in the Programme for Government and, in particular, has appointed a Minister of State to co-ordinate policy on child care in the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.  The Child Care Act is being implemented.  In 1995 new regulations providing for improved standards of care in residential homes and foster care were commenced.  These regulations require health boards to visit, supervise and review children placed in residential care on a more systematic basis than before.  The view of <Col N="606" /> the child must also be taken into account at every stage of this process. Later this year the sections providing for the registration of voluntary homes every three years will be introduced. Later this week the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, will launch a discussion document on mandatory reporting and initiate a consultative process to ensure that the reporting arrangements for child abuse reflect the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>I compliment both Deputies who have continually raised this issue by way of question and debate.  Deputy Fitzgerald has called for an independent inspectorate to monitor residential homes for children on an ongoing basis. I have been concerned for some time about the problems in regard to publishing the findings of inquiries into alleged incidents of child abuse.  I know that this has given rise to concerns about lack of transparency.  Accordingly, I have decided to establish, on a statutory basis, an inspectorate of social services in the Department of Health. The inspectorate will be responsible for quality assurance and audit of child care practice and will undertake inquiries on behalf of the Minister.  I am confident that, together with the important new provisions concerning residential care under the Child Care Act, this will greatly improve the safeguards and procedures to protect children in residential care.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult issue.  Those of us in politics even six years ago could not have envisaged the frequency of debates on child abuse, even those of us in tune with the electorate did not know the high level of child abuse.  As a parliament we are playing &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; but we do not differ from other societies in North America and Western Europe.  I welcome the support of Deputies and compliment my colleague, Deputy Howlin, who, as Minister for Health, prioritised the issue of child care and child abuse.  He took the initial steps on which we are building.</P>
    <P>I am aware that people are concerned about accountability of this House. <Col N="607" /> particularly in respect of the three cases to which Deputy O'Donnell referred.  In the case of Madonna House criminal charges were taken against a person and a conviction was made.  In the Kelly Fitzgerald case criminal charges were taken against the parents and a conviction was made.  In the western farmer case criminal charges were taken against the father and a conviction was made. In all cases people have served jail sentences. The ultimate accountability for persons who perpetrate crimes is that they are investigated, charged, brought to court and convicted.  It is not true that accountability has not worked.</P>
    <P>However, there are other issues such as whether persons charged with responsibility for the care of children fulfil their statutory role.  That is a different issue from accountability for what happened.  In those circumstances, even though investigations are properly conducted, it is difficult to publish findings. There are three issues involved. First, if a person against whom a criminal charge may be carried by the Director of Public Prosecutions is identified if is not possible to publish the information without prejudicing the case.  I do not want to be accused that because I published information a criminal walked free.  The second issue relates to defamation.  Quite often the investigating process brings about a position where the facts may be presented but, where a very small number of care workers are involved, they are easily identified and identifiable by their colleagues and by the general public.  That gives rise to a legal problem in that if the case cannot be proved beyond reasonable doubt the investigating authority, the Department of Health or the health board may be sued for libel.  The third issue is that if a person believes they may be named or identified in a report and inferences adverse to their professional representation may be drawn, they will take an injunction in court to prevent publication.</P>
    <P>That, as well as the general issue of <Col N="608" /> an inspectorate, is what leads me to provide an inspection system which is statutorily based and organised centrally and which would have to be passed through this House.  That would meet the demands of many Deputies, and I think everybody here can recite reasons for such a system.  I will not go into the detail, but it is important to remember that what we are talking about is a statutorily based inspectorate which will take time to put in place.  I would ask Deputies, therefore, not to come back in six weeks asking where is the inspectorate. This is an all-party issue about which people on all sides of the House are equally concerned and I would welcome advice on it.  The Government has provided the necessary resources and we are proceeding with the matter.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to read the discussion document on mandatory reporting which will be published at the end of this week by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie.  There is a series of difficult issues to be dealt with and people, particularly in the professions, need to be informed before they make the final policy call on how best to proceed.  I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. I hope that another bad landmark in the treatment of young people, even though it was in the 1950s, will be an impetus for us to provide a better framework for the protection of children in this generation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater Ennis area has a population of about 16,000 people and is situated in the centre of a county with a population in excess of 90,000.  The existing swimming pool is about 30 years old and was obviously constructed to serve a smaller town, which it has served fairly well.  In the long term there <Col N="609" /> will be excessive maintenance costs and already there is a substantial drop-off in usage because the pool is substandard.</P>
    <P>There is a great lack of facilities in Ennis town.  Late in 1993 and for some time previously undertakings were given on the provision of pitches.  Even though I facilitated negotiations on the property element, no finance has been forthcoming.  There is no major indoor sports facility, except the existing swimming pool which no longer meets the required standard and is in urgent need of replacement.</P>
    <P>The projected cost of the new swimming pool is £2.6 million.  Ennis UDC and Clare County Council are aware that the Department receives a huge number of applications for funding for projects such as this.  In those circumstances they have decided to request 50 per cent of the funding and are prepared to provide the remaining 50 per cent.  That involves each council raising £500,000, with a local fund raising venture of £300,000.  The committee to organise that funding is in place and obviously its efforts would be boosted by a positive signal from the Minister.  I understand that an official announcement in this regard would be made by a member of the Minister's party and I have no difficulty with that.  The preliminary report has been submitted so recently that the Minister may say it is unreasonable of me to come before him at this stage.  I already raised the matter twice by way of parliamentary question as well as directly with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The councils initially made an application for a waterworld type project incorporating a swimming pool.  The matter was actively pursued, with a request for Structural Funds under the Operational Programme for Tourism. The councils incurred substantial expense as a result, they believe, of very bad advice.  Eventually the project was rejected.  That caused a delay in putting forward the current plans.  The councils <Col N="610" /> are now seeking approval for the preliminary proposal, which is with the Department, and permission to proceed to the next phase, which is to prepare contract documents.  I ask the Minister to consider the project favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Killeen for the opportunity to again set out the position of the proposed swimming pool complex in Ennis.  He and his colleagues, including my party colleague from the Clare constituency, have highlighted this issue in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Clare County Council submitted preliminary proposals to my Department last January for this project, the estimated cost of which is £2.6 million.  The complex will be at the existing swimming pool location and the proposed facilities include a 25 metre pool, a children's pool, sauna, steam room, crèche, gymnasium, spectator area and a multipurpose activity hall.  My Department requested further information from the county council on 5 February on the proposal, including the full financial plan.  When this information is received the proposal will be further considered. Obviously, the provision of funding by the Department does not arise at this preliminary stage of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All swimming pool proposals have to go through various stages of planning before a grant commitment is made by my Department.  Approval must be given initially to the preliminary proposals. At that stage, the local authority would be advised by my Department to proceed with the preparation of detailed drawings and specifications, generally known as contract documents.  When contract documents are approved, tenders are invited by the local authority and their proposals for the acceptance of tenders are submitted to the Department for approval.  It is only at this stage, when the acceptance of tenders is being sactioned, that a grant is formally <Col N="611" /> allocated to a project so that work may proceed.</P>
    <P>I am mindful of the Deputy's interest, and that of his constituency colleagues, in this matter.  The preliminary report is with the Department and it is a little soon to expect a commitment from me on the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the matter of the oversights and misplacements which took place in the marking of the 1995 leaving certification examination in art and design.  We are all aware of the sorry tale of blunders made by the Department of Education in regard to that examination.  As a result of revelations of those blunders public confidence in the examinations system has been seriously undermined.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education did not give a full and accurate account of the extent of the inaccuracies, oversights and misplacements which have taken place.  Why was there such a delay in investigating the blunders that were made known to the Minister by officials in her Department on 12 December last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now known that mistakes made in the case of students at the Ursuline Convent in Sligo only came to light because of the persistence of parents, students and teachers in pursuing their rights.  I am reliably informed that in the past mistakes in the marking procedures in the art and design examination were detected at the recheck stage.  A fail safe mechanism was put in place and it appeared to work until last year.  It seems extraordinary that, notwithstanding that the missing sections of the examination accounted for 25 per cent of the examination marks, their absence was not noticed during a subsequent recheck.  The suspicions of teachers who would have a reliable idea of the standard of their pupils were ignored for months.  Why did it take so long for <Col N="612" /> errors to be discovered and for an investigation to be carried out?</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Education said that an investigation of the 11,000 art and design candidates' work was carried out between 15 and 20 December last.  As late as last Friday the Minister confirmed that more cases of missing examination work have been identified. Why was the Minister kept in the dark by her Department or, if that was not the case, did she know the extent of the blunders made?  If she was kept unaware of such serious mismanagement within her Department, serious questions must be answered about the internal operations of the Department and the Minister's ability to maintain stewardship of that most important Department.  The Minister has shielded herself behind the Price Waterhouse inquiry, but the answers to many questions should not require an independent investigation.  Why was the Department so slow to react to the concerns of the Ursuline Convent in Sligo?  When was the investigation into the errors launched?  More importantly, is the Minister satisfied that all errors have been accounted for or will more new cases, such as those which came to light last Friday, be reported?</P>
    <P>It is now intended that a complete recheck of all 11,000 entries will be made.  Can we have a guarantee that such a recheck will be more thorough than that made last December?  Is the Minister confident that those with responsibility to recheck examination entries have the necessary experience and competence to do so?  What way will the Department compensate those students who have had to repeat their leaving certificate at great personal cost?  Will there be any recompense for those students who have had to change their future plans because of unsatisfactory results in their art and design examination? What does the need to resort to outside agents to determine the truth about what happened in her Department say about the competence of the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health, (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health, (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I will not be able to answer specifically all the interesting questions raised by Deputy Keogh.  I reply on behalf of the Minister for Education to the matter raised.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education replied fully to the questions which were put to her on 20 February.  As the Minister informed the House during the Adjournment Debate some weeks ago, the marking and the processing of the results of the 1995 art examination is the subject of a fully independent inquiry by Price Waterhouse.  The Minister has already confirmed that it is her intention to publish the full report of the Price Waterhouse inquiry and to make it available to Members of the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the revelations mentioned by the Deputy, I assume she is referring to the Minister's reply to a parliamentary question on 22 February that the number of upgrades notified to schools was 47, rather than 46, and that a further case has come to light of a candidate being entitled to an upgrade.</P>
      <P>The position is that, in the first case, even though an upgrade was awarded and notified to the school involved in early January, it was not added to the list because of administrative failure, error or oversight.  The Minister became aware of this error on Wednesday, 21 February.  This aspect will be pursued.</P>
      <P>The second case came to light as a direct result of the work initiated in connection with the Price Waterhouse inquiry.  It involved an error in the processing of an appeal.  All aspects of this further upgrade will be encompassed within the scope of the Price Waterhouse inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the candidate who received an upgrade because of failure to credit marks for design, the position is that the Minister has referred in previous statements to marks not being credited for parts or components of the art examination.  From an early stage in these inquiries, it was known that one <Col N="614" /> of the candidates had not been credited with marks for design.  The candidate's school was notified of the upgrade and informed that the upgrade had arisen because of a failure to credit the candidate with marks for design, on 8 January 1996.  As it happens, the failure in the case of all of the other candidates who were found to be missing components in the marking was in respect of craftwork.</P>
    <P>The Minister is greatly concerned at the failure to correctly credit marks in the case of some of this year's art students.  Not only does it cause distress and worry for students, their families and teachers, but any failure in this area has an impact on the overall integrity of the certificate examinations.  Given the Minister's responsibility for ensuring that the examinations retain the full confidence of parents, students and the many institutions that rely on them, the Minister considered it essential that this problem be the subject of a full independent inquiry.  The fact that this inquiry is external and independent will enhance both its public standing and the acceptability of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>In addition to the inquiry which will deal with all aspects of the running of this year's art examination, the Minister has also asked Price Waterhouse to review the entire appeals procedure in the case of all subjects.  The Minister thinks that such a review is essential to fully secure public confidence in this process.  It is the Minister's firm intention that any recommendations for improvements in the operation of the art examination or in the appeals process will be implemented for the 1996 examinations.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands and shares the anxiety and need of Deputies, students, teachers and parents for full information on the circumstances and events which gave rise to the incorrect results which were issued for the art examination.  It is for this reason that the Minister decided on an independent, external inquiry.  She has also <Col N="615" /> undertaken to publish the report and to make it available to Members of the House.  She also intends to implement the changes that will be necessary.</P>
    <P>To refer back to the words of this motion the Minister intends that the House will have a &ldquo;full and accurate account&rdquo; of what happened.  We must all avoid prejudicing the results of this inquiry, the Minister's response to it and, indeed, the response of the House and <Col N="616" /> the wider public, by reacting on the basis of incomplete information and drawing premature conclusions.</P>
    <P>The issue is a serious one.  The Minister is giving the House very important reassurances.  This worrying episode is being seriously investigated.  The report of the investigation will be made public. Effective action will be taken.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 February 1996.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 is the principal source of funding for the development of tourism in Ireland including the southern Border counties.  The programme, full details of which are available from the Dáil Library, provides for a total of £369 million in EU funds, comprising £286 million from the European Regional Development Fund and £82 million from the ESF.  It is envisaged that over the programme period, the EU contribution will be matched by some £84 million from the public sector and £199 million from the private sector. Every sub-region, including the Border region, has an equal opportunity to avail of these investment funds in order to attract visitors and create wealth in their areas.  The success or otherwise of individual sub-regions in obtaining programme funds depends a great deal on the quality of tourism proposals emerging for consideration in each area.  There were no additional funds allocated to this programme as a consequence of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for An Bord Tráchtála is for the promotion of Irish goods and services and is not confined to any one region.  Companies in the border counties have equal opportunity to avail of <Col N="279" /> supports.  Expenditure on certain marketing activities provided by ABT is eligible for European Regional Development Fund support under the Marketing Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development.  The Market Development Sub-Programme provides for a total spend of £446 million in the six year period, 1994-99 made up of £80 million from European Regional Development Fund receipts coupled with £82 million from the public sector and £284 million from the private sector. In addition under the Small Business OP it is expected that up to £900,000 of European Regional Development Fund funding will be drawn down by ABT to help small firms access public procurement markets.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that certain tourism and trade projects in the southern Border counties can benefit from funding under other initiatives, such as INTERREG Northern Ireland, the International Fund for Ireland and the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation which are primarily the responsibility of other Ministers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This campaign has proved to be most effective in contributing to an increase of 19 per cent in US visitors to Ireland <Col N="280" /> in 1994, and a further increase of 31 per cent in 1995.</P>
    <P>In 1994 expenditure on marketing by the USMI was £3 million.  An overall fund of £6.3 million was allocated to the marketing initiative in 1995, of which £2.2 million was earmarked for the US market.</P>

Some 80 per cent of overseas visitors rate our culture and history as an important reason for considering Ireland for a holiday.  These tourists are attracted here to discover our distinctiveness, including all those facets of the natural, human-made and cultural heritage which give us a unique identity.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-1993 was responsible for a major advance in the development of the Irish tourism product and involved an investment of £116 million in cultural and heritage projects funded by both the public and private sector, including over £56 million in EU grant aid.</P>
      <P>The current Operational Programme for Tourism which runs from 1994 to 1999 envisages investment of over £170 million in heritage tourism, of which more than £120 million will be in the form of EU grant aid.</P>

      <P>While tourism promotion is always likely to require some ongoing support in order to sustain growth in tourist numbers and revenue, a careful review of developments over the period of the current and previous operational programme; their impact on the level and quality of tourism facilities in this country; and on tourism operations, will be necessary before any considered views can be reached on future development needs and priorities.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 53, 56 and 227 together.  As indicated in reply to Dáil question on 24 January 1996, the report of the Marketing Sub-Committee of the Tourism Council has been under consideration by me.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the House on Thursday 22 January I announced that I had secured Government agreement to the allocation of up to £500,000 towards the cost of implementing a new initiative, with co-financing from the industry, to encourage greater marketing by the industry of home holidays, particularly in the off-peak and shoulder season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will chair a group of representatives from the tourism industry, the relevent agencies and the Department of Tourism and Trade to develop the initiative. The group will consider the recommendations of the Tourism Council report and will concentrate, in particular, on initiatives with a more long-term <Col N="285" /> perspective, capable of country wide application, rather than <i>ad hoc</i> smaller measures with more limited impact.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment, it has been the practice to regard papers produced for the Tourism Council as confidential to that body.  However, I wish to confirm that among the issues raised in their domestic tourism report and now to be considered by this group are: achieving greater co-ordination of current domestic advertising activity; maximising the use of TV and radio programming to highlight the constantly expanding range of interesting and exciting holiday opportunities coming on stream right across the country; a revitalisation of the &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; brand in conjunction with the recent outsourcing of publication from Bord Fáilte, and research to more accurately define market potential and consumer requirements for the product.</P>
    <P>I want this initiative to proceed in partnership with the tourism industry. The funds which will be available for suitable initiatives are additional to Bord Fáilte's normal allocation and I want to see the industry respond to this initiative and working with my group, to invest more in promoting home holidays.</P>

      <P>The Tourism and Travel Quarterly Statistical Release for the October to December quarter of 1995, published by the Central Statistics Office on 12 February 1996, bore out the forecast which I made at the end of 1995 that it was the best year ever for Irish tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The highlights of the CSO release were that in 1995: 4,256,000 overseas visitors came to Ireland, up over 15 per cent on 1994; visitors from Great Britain <Col N="286" /> were up 13 per cent, other European countries were up 12 per cent, North America (USA and Canada) were up 30 per cent, and other countries were up 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>The provisional Central Statistics Office figures for earnings (including carrier receipts) from overseas visitors for the first nine months of 1995 shows a 13 per cent increase on the same period in 1994.</P>
    <P>The published data released by the Central Statistics Office does not give an official breakdown of the number of overseas tourists who visit Dublin or the regions.  Bord Fáilte does however, as part of its research, undertake an annual survey of overseas travellers which measures the regional distribution of overseas tourist visits.  The compilation and publication of this material is the direct responsibility of Bord Fáilte and I have no function in the matter.  I can say, however, that growth rates generally in Irish tourism, achieved across all regions of Ireland, in recent years have been better than international and European averages.</P>
    <P>In relation to 1996, the initial target set by Bord Fáilte was for overall growth in visitor numbers of 10 per cent above the records achieved in 1995. Specific targets are not set for the regions.  Although it is still early days yet, I understand from Bord Fáilte that the level of inquiries received during January and early February were in line with this target, and notwithstanding the recent tragic events in London, there is confidence that the underlying strength and resilience of the tourism industry will maintain Irish tourism on a growth path for 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>I addressed the IHF annual conference in Cork last week where the federation itself discussed in detail future staffing and the related issue of the poor image of the industry.  The industry itself is conscious of the problems it faces in relation to staffing and image and I am pleased to note that it intends taking action to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>The Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland in conjunction with CERT have formed a recruitment committee to look at ways of encouraging operators to increase the promotion of careers in the hospitality industry and to market them as an attractive option for school-leavers.  In 1995 the committee launched a pilot promotional scheme aimed at second level students in the mid-west.  The scheme was well received by schools and industry alike, and it is planned to extend this promotional scheme nationwide during 1996.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the importance of providing high quality training for new entrants and the existing workforce in tourism has been fully recognised in the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99.  It is envisaged that a total of £110 million will be invested in tourism training over the life of the programme and that over 72,000 people will be trained.  This almost doubles the number trained under the last operational programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1995, the General Affairs Council adopted directives for the negotiation of a comprehensive long-term agreement between the European Union and South Africa.  With regard to the trade part of the agreement, the directives provided <i>inter alia,</i> for South Africa to be invited to initiate a process leading to progressive and reciprocal liberalisation of trade with a view to establishing a free trade area. If the South African Government was ready to negotiate such an agreement, the EU was to respond favourably on <Col N="289" /> the principle of a free trade area corresponding to the EU's economic and commercial interests.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council also decided as a general principle that before any steps are taken towards establishing a free trade area, the Commission should assess the compatibility of the planned agreement with WTO rules and the implications of such an agreement for the Union's common policies and for its relations with its main trading partners.</P>
      <P>In line with this request, the Commission indicated in a recent assessment of a free trade agreement with South Africa that it was confident that such an agreement would survive any challenge contesting its WTO compatibility, provided the range of excluded products was limited.  In reviewing the Union's common policies and particularly the CAP, the Commission recalled that the draft negotiating directives envisage that at the end of the general transitional period of about ten years, 55 per cent of EU agricultural imports from South Africa would be liberalised in the free trade agreement and that certain sensitive products, mainly fruit and vegetables, would be excluded entirely.  In relation to the impact of a free trade agreement on third countries, the assessment by the Commission states that the agreement is expected to generate increased demand both in the EU and South Africa and will thereby create net additional export opportunities for such countries.  The Commission has also confirmed that more detailed studies would be carried out, as necessary, during the course of negotiations with South Africa, and member states would be kept closely involved in the negotiating process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a small country dependent on trade, our strategic interest is in an open trading system where our companies can operate on an even playing field, on the basis of rules which have been agreed multilaterally, but which also caters for the special needs of sensitive sectors like agriculture.  Our approach in individual cases is determined following <Col N="290" /> an assessment of the balance of Ireland's trading interests.  In the case of South Africa, Ireland has enjoyed a healthy trade surplus for many years.  In value terms, few, if any, South African imported commodities into Ireland could be regarded as competing with domestic produce.  In agriculture for instance, the principal South African imports to the EU are grapes, oranges, pears, apples, plums and peaches, in which Ireland has negligible production. On the other hand, meat and meat preparations were the second most important export commodity for Ireland in the South African market in 1994.  As Ireland's exports to South Africa are generally subject to high access barriers, which inhibit our current export performance, a free trade agreement would see many of these reduced over a transitional period, thereby improving Ireland's future export prospects.</P>
    <P>Ireland is therefore supporting the efforts of the current Italian Presidency to achieve a satisfactory EU negotiating mandate which would enable formal negotiations on a liberal trade agreement with South Africa to get under way in the near future.  This is regarded as an important EU political priority in support of South Africa's renewal programme.</P>

      <P>Last year I appointed a steering committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael Colgan with the mandate to transform the St. Patrick's Day parade into a major festival of international standing.  This year is the start of a gradual process and phased development up to the year 2000.  A total of £220,000 has been made available through my Department's Vote for 1995 and 1996 as seed capital to generate a new, more modern format for the parade.  It is expected that a successful event in 1996 will open up new prospects and opportunities for commercial sponsorship in future years.</P>
      <P>I understand that the steering committee has devised a new route for the parade which will take in many of Dublin's most important and historic buildings and streets.  There are plans for increased participation by street theatre groups and performers and to replace the stop-start format of previous years with a non-stop exciting parade.</P>
      <P>I expect that, from this year on, St. Patrick's Day in Dublin will be seen as a major international festival attracting an increasing level of overseas visitors in the off peak season.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government is firmly committed to assisting people with a disability.  The Department of Health spent over £257 million in its Programme for the Handicapped in 1995 and 1996 expenditure in this regard is estimated to rise to over £266 million.  Recent years have seen substantial regular increases in resources devoted to the assistance of people with a disability, with particular emphasis on improving the level of day-care and home support services.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a special refund scheme also exists in relation to the VAT borne or paid on aids or appliances specially constructed or adapted for use by a person with a disability to assist in overcoming his or her disability in the performance of daily functions or in the exercise of a vocation.  The scheme applies to a wide range of goods and includes, for example, walk-in baths, lifting seats, hoists and stair lifts designed for people with a disability as well as medical <Col N="304" /> equipment such as dialysis machines and artificial respirators.  Items such as invalid carriages, walking frames and orthopaedic appliances are zero rated for VAT purposes.</P>
      <P>In addition, local authorities may pay a grant for the provision of additional accommodation or necessary works of adaptation of a house to meet the needs of a member of the household with a disability.  For private houses, the grant may amount to up to two thirds of the cost of the works approved by the local authority.  For houses let by the local authority, the grant may amount to the full cost of approved works.  The works must cost in excess of £200.  Normally, the grant will not exceed £8,000. However, the carrying out of routine household repairs and maintenance would not be covered by the above mentioned schemes.  This is because the rationale behind such schemes is to assist people with a disability in overcoming it.  Their extension to items of expenditure which are not related to overcoming disability could not be justified.</P>

      <P>The existing double taxation convention between Ireland and the United States, which is in existence for over forty years, does not contain any specific provisions relating to the taxation of social security payments.  Under the terms of United States domestic legislation, nonresident aliens are liable to withholding <Col N="309" /> tax on social security payments at a rate of 30 per cent of 85 per cent of the social security payments, i.e. 25.5 per cent overall.  The question of US withholding tax on social security payments is being reviewed in the context of the current renegotiation of the Ireland/US Double Taxation Convention.  In the meantime, under the provisions of the existing convention, credit for the tax deducted by the US tax authorities is allowed against Irish tax on the same income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together. The current drainage programme drawn up following the passing of the Arterial <Col N="310" /> Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995 comprises consideration of schemes for eight areas around the country which suffer periodical localised flooding.  The eight areas are Carlow, Cappamore/ Newport, Duleek, Dunmanway, Gort, Kilkenny, Sixmilebridge and Williamstown. The resources of the Office of Public Works are being concentrated on devising schemes for these areas which will alleviate the flooding problems.  The planning of the scheme at Sixmilebridge is at an advanced stage.  It is expected the scheme will be exhibited within the next few weeks.  The period for exhibition of the scheme and submission of observations is four weeks.  If there are no objections it would be expected that works would commence shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>Now that schemes for all the areas are at preparation stage it is proposed to prepare a priority list of other areas throughout Ireland which suffer flooding on a regular basis.  The Commissioners of Public Works have accorded a very high priority to the preparation of the priority list and while it is not possible at this stage to say when it will be prepared and published, this will be done as early as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the tax on cigarettes in the State is among the highest in the EU.  Government policy is to maintain the highest possible level of tax on cigarettes for revenue purposes and to reinforce health policy objectives, while taking account of cross-Border prices and other factors.  The tax increase of 10p imposed on the packet of 20 cigarettes with <i>pro-rata</i> increases on other tobacco products was determined in the light of these considerations.</P>

      <P>The basis of rateable valuation of commercial property is net annual value (NAV), i.e. the rental value of the property. The factors that determine rental value include the operations of the property market, changes in economic conditions, the profitability of business and changes or developments to property. The courts have decided that in arriving at the net annual value, the valuer is not required to use any particular method of assessment but may use the method most appropriate to the circumstances of the property.  Any ratepayer dissatisfied with a valuation or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and, subsequently, to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers are assessable to tax on farming profits on actual income on the same basis as other self-employed taxpayers. The normal self-employed allowances may be offset against farming profits and there are also special provisions in relation to stock relief and income averaging. As with all self-employed taxpayers farmers are obliged to make annual returns of income and pay the appropriate tax by the due dates. Returns by farmers are also subject to audit in the same manner as other self-employed taxpayers.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the evidence currently available from self-employed audits indicates that the compliance levels of farmers are comparable with those of other self-employed taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The 1996 post-budget estimate of income tax revenue from farming profits is £74 million and reflects the cost of £3.3 million for the impact of budget concessions in 1996.  The 1995 increase in farming profits is estimated at about 8 per cent over the 1994 level and the income tax estimate for 1996 is based upon a further projected increase in farm profits of about 6.8 per cent.  The downward trend takes account of an adjustment for the impact of exceptionally favourable weather conditions on the performance of certain farming sectors in 1995 as well as a possible negative impact on farm incomes in 1996 attributable to the ongoing impact of CAP reform on agricultural exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest year for which information on the income of farmers is available is the income tax year 1992-93.  The gross income of identified full-time farmers who were assessed to tax for 1992-93 was £590 million, excluding employment income of £203 million liable to tax under PAYE.  The corresponding income of identified farmers with another trade or profession who were assessed to tax for the same year was <Col N="316" /> £271 million.  This amount includes income both from these other trades and professions as well as from farming.</P>
    <P>The amounts of income tax paid on farming profits from 1993 to 1995 are estimated as follows: £55.0 million in 1993; £66.5 million in 1994; and £70.0 million in 1995.  These figures reflect the tax take in respect of farming profits. They do not include PAYE tax paid on employment income earned by farmers or their spouses.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.  An analysis of the returns for the income tax year 1992-93, the latest available, indicates that some £56 million in tax was paid by farmers, including farmers with another trade or profession, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year. The figures for income tax yields do not include any yields in 1993 and 1994 under the 1993 tax amnesty.  Also excluded from the calculations are tax recipts from deposit interest retention tax because it is not possible to apportion that tax between particular classes of taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Commissioners of Public Works of the following facts in relation to Killea Boys national school, <Col N="317" /> Dunmore East, County Waterford.  In 1992 the Department of Education sanctioned grant aid for a number of improvement works including connection of the existing septic tank into the public sewerage system.  While the other works proceeded, it was not possible to connect to the public sewer as originally planned as the level of the sewer outside the school site was too high.  More recently a solution to the problem has been agreed with the county council.  An application has been made for a road opening licence and work on the connection is due to commence later this week.</P>

    <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that to provide a breakdown of the figures between Deputies, Senators and staff as well as identify the tax separately deducted from Office holders salaries paid to Minister and Ministers of State would require a detailed examination of all the relevant P35 end-of-year returns submitted for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the various Government Departments. Such an examination could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.  The only relevant information available relating to directors is that pertaining to proprietary directors.  The estimated income tax liability of proprietary directors for the income tax year 1992-93, the latest year for which relevant statistics are available, was £294.1 million.</P>

      <Quest>the surveys, investigations or research that have been carried out to relieve the fears of the public in relation to the possible health risks of exposure to non-ionising radiation below the thermal/IRPA guidelines regarding GSM and MMDS masts in view of the fact that the current IRPA guidelines are only designed to prevent effects such as tissue heating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> All significant research into non-ionsing radiation is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, with whom my Department maintains liaison in relation to the human health aspects.  The general body of scientific evidence to date has not established a casual relationship between this form of radiation and ill health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> Telecommunications companies here are licensed by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. That Department has advised me that companies use low power transmitters and operate within safety limits recommended by the International Radiation Protection Association as being those within which it is safe to work and live on the basis of all presently available expert knowledge. These guidelines are subject to periodic revision and amendment with advances in knowledge and the identification of effects associated with particular frequencies and/or modes of generation. Non-ionising radiation emissions measured here have been well within the recommended limits.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has also advised me that it is not correct to state that the guidelines are only designed to prevent thermal effects.  The IRPA clearly state that, although the guidelines are based primarily on thermal considerations, the objective of protection against thermal effects was taken into account.  In this context, as there is no predictive theory based on non-thermal considerations, available empirical data served to establish exposure limits. A very prudent approach was taken in that it was recognised that safety factors must be incorporated into the exposure limits to allow not only for the lack of scientific data but for all possible conditions under which the exposure might occur.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Western Health Board is responsible for the management of services and deployment of staff at St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar, County Mayo.  Current personnel policy for the health service provides the health agencies which are managing resources within allocation may fill non-consultant replacement posts, including nursing vacancies, without recourse to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of temporary nurses employed in St. Mary's Hospital varies but would normally average ten.  The employment of many of the temporary nurses has been intermittent and their length of service is therefore difficult to quantify.  The majority of them have <Col N="325" /> been employed for between one and seven years in aggregate.</P>
    <P>As part of an agreement concluded between local management and staff in March 1995, a total of nine permanent staff nurse posts were filled by nurses who had previously been employed in a temporary capacity.  Having regard to service requirements and current staffing arrangements, the board has no proposals to make further permanent appointment in this context.  A relief panel comprising 23 temporary nurses has been established, and temporary and locum staff are drawn from this panel as required.  A rota giving equitable employment opportunity to all those on the panel is also in place.  Temporary staff who meet the necessary eligibility requirements may also compete for posts advertised in open competition.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> To my knowledge there are two recent Labour Court recommendations which concern the matter raised by the Deputy, namely, recommendation Nos. 15011 and 15074.  The first of these related to a dispute concerning the filling of permanent vacancies between the South-Eastern Health Board and the Services Industrial Professional Technical Union.  The recommendation of the court, issued on 1 December 1995, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Court, on the basis of the information given, has concluded that concession of the Union's claim is precluded by Ministerial Directive. <Col N="326" /> The Court, accordingly, does not recommend concession of the claim. The Court so recommends.</P>
    <P>A second case was referred to the court in which the Psychiatric Nurses Association and SIPTU were seeking the holding of a competition for permanent posts which would be confined to long-term temporary nurses, again, in the South-Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the Court, issued on 2 February 1996 was that the health board and the organisations representing long-term temporary nurses discuss the situation, and, if necessary, consult with the Department of Health with a view to putting in place arrangements which provide fair and equitable treatment for long-term temporary nurses applying for permanent vacancies in the health board.</P>
    <P>This second recommendation is currently under consideration by local management and my Department.  Discussions with the union side will follow in due course.  I might also remind the Deputy that the union side raised the position of long-term temporary nurses in the restructuring discussions under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  As part of the offer currently being balloted on by the nursing unions, the management side indicated a willingness to discuss and consider sympathetically any proposals made in relation to the position of temporary nurses.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Methadone maintenance is already being provided to drug misusers through Eastern Health Board community drug treatment centres at Baggot Street, Amiens Street and Ballyfermot and at the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street and through a number of general practitioners.  At present, approximately 1,450 people are being treated this way.  However, a number of other drug misusers have come forward for treatment and significant waiting lists have built up at all treatment facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> In order to address this, the Government decision of 20 February proposed that additional places be provided at community drug centres by the Eastern Health Board during 1996.  In addition, more general practitioners will be encouraged to become involved in the prescribing of methadone.  The success of this expansion of services depends very much on the support of local communities and on the number of general practitioners agreeing to become involved.  It is intended that the major portion of these additional places will be put in place during 1996.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision of services for persons smoking heroin, it is proposed that the Eastern Health Board regional co-ordinating committee should formulate proposals within two months to deal with this issue.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Eastern Health <Col N="331" /> Board and my Department are liaising on an ongoing basis with general practitioners on their role in the provision of methadone maintenance for drug misusers. In the Eastern Health Board area at present 25 general practitioners prescribe methadone to 683 misusers.</P>
      <P>There has been a reluctance on the part of some general practitioners in the past to become involved in prescribing methadone which is perhaps understandable. In order to address this, discussions are at an advanced stage for the implementation of a pilot programme with the full support of professional organisations representing both general practitioners and pharmacists. The pilot programme will put in place all of the recommendations of the Protocol for the prescribing of methadone by general practitioners.</P>
      <P>These recommendations include close co-operation between general practitioners and the community drug team for the area, and a treatment card for each patient who is admitted to detoxification maintenance programmes. Each card should be valid for a specific period.  A list of all patients on methadone therapy should be maintained and operated by a liaison group &mdash; this recommendation is already in place.  Community based pharmacists should only dispense methadone for individuals for whom they hold a treatment card.  The group should continue to monitor and evaluate the proposed arrangements and their operation for an initial phase-in period until the measures recommended are operating satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of the pilot programme, approximately 100 drug misusers who have been stabilised on methadone will be transferred to the care of general practitioners who will continue with methadone maintenance programmes.  If the pilot programme is successful it is expected that other general practitioners will be recruited to the programme, taking further stabilised people from the drug treatment centres <Col N="332" /> and freeing up space in these centres for the treatment of chaotic drug misusers.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 20 February 1996 that there should be further development of education and prevention programmes by the Departments of Health and Education in conjunction with other relevant agencies, including a programme aimed specifically at deprived areas.

      <P>I am very aware of the need to provide specific information for discrete audiences in relation to the dangers of drug misuse.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has a number of campaigns in place, in particular a convenience advertising campaign which targets at risk youth by alerting them to the dangers of drug misuse.</P>
      <P>The unit has also supported the development of parent education programmes.  These include &ldquo;Parent Education on Alcohol, Drugs and Family Communication&rdquo; developed in conjunction with the Cork social and health education project of the Southern Health Board.  This programme focuses not only on drugs but also on the development of skills and personal attributes which help parents and young people to deal with drug related issues. Similarly, a parenting programme entitled &ldquo;Working Together&rdquo; developed in co-operation with Community Awareness of Drugs &mdash; a voluntary organisation &mdash; aims to assist parents in exploring attitudes, beliefs and decisions about the issue of drug misuse.</P>

      <P>The data for A &amp; E attendances refers to 1995.  The personnel figures relate to 1994 which is the latest year for which finalised information is available. The reported patient ratio is therefore based on 1994 hospital activity.  It should be noted that there are many factors which affect personnel numbers. These include teaching obligations, casemix load, outpatient duties, demographic variations etc.  The differences between hospitals should be interpreted in this context and in the light of each hospital's particular circumstances and responsibilities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In the Government decision of 20 February one of a number of measures approved by Government was that there would be greater co-ordination of services among statutory, voluntary and community agencies at local level.  In order to accomplish this I have requested that each health board establish a regional co-ordinating committee which would be comprised of representatives from the health and education sectors, the Garda, voluntary agencies and community groups.  The committees will act as a forum for co-operation between the various agencies involved in demand reduction for drugs. Representatives from each of the regional committees will sit on the national demand reduction subcommittee of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Misuse ensuring that there is a flow of information from national level to regional and local levels and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>In addition, health boards will be requested to undertake research into the extent of drug misuse in each respective board, so that they can co-ordinate and plan prevention and treatment services more effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department already co-operates with the Department of Education, the health boards and voluntary agencies in the development and dissemination of a wide range of substance misuse prevention programmes targeted at selected groups.  These programmes not only highlight the dangers of drug misuse but <Col N="338" /> also give people the opportunity to develop and practise the skills necessary to resist pressures to use various substances of abuse.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The expert medical group on whooping cough vaccination was established in 1977 by the Minister for Health &ldquo;to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available in relation to them and to indicate whether, in its opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Of the 93 cases presented to the group, the group found that there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage in 16 of the cases.  Where there was a reasonable doubt in any case, the group gave the benefit of that doubt to that person.  It is, therefore, incorrect to imply that the group refused to award compensation where damage had in fact been caused by the vaccination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where parents were dissatisfied with the findings of the expert medical group arrangements were made for the parents to meet the chairman of the expert group to discuss on an individual basis individual reports and how the group <Col N="339" /> had reached its conclusions.  The parents who availed of this offer were told that if new evidence was available, which was not considered by the group, the group would re-examine their case.  In the period since the group completed its work no new evidence has been produced.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic Act, 1994 provides that the maximum penalty for the offence of dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm is ten years imprisonment or, at the discretion of the court, a fine not exceeding £10,000, or both.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable to be disqualified from holding a driving licence for a period of not less than two years in the case of a first offence, or four years in the case of a second or subsequent offence.  The maximum penalty for the lesser offence of careless driving is a fine of £350 or, at the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment of up to three months, or both.  I have no proposals to amend the penalties provided in the Road Traffic Acts in relation to these offences.</P>

      <P>Under the EU co-financed scheme of grants, local authorities may submit for funding proposals for specific projects on non-national roads, including projects of benefit to tourism.  Total grants under this scheme in 1996 amount to £33.317 million.</P>
      <P>Grant allocations totalling £7.5 million have been made under the INTERREG II programme in 1996 to eligible local authorities for projects on non-national roads, including projects of benefit to tourism.

      <P>Some alterations were made to parts of the southern boundary of the borough of Drogheda, following local agreement, to encompass housing which immediately adjoined it, for the purposes of the town elections in 1994.  The action to be taken on all matters affecting town local government, including structures, functions and boundaries will be determined in the context of the report of the commission on town local government which I expect to receive shortly.</P>

      <P>I understand that Galway corporation does not have an application for an <Col N="362" /> essential repairs grant on hand. However, I expect that only a small number of cases in built-up areas, such as Galway city, could meet the requirement of the scheme that there be no continuing demand for local authority housing at the location of the house in respect of which an essential repairs grant is sought.  The corporation has assured my Department that it will examine any application received for an essential repairs grant in the light of the requirements of the scheme.</P>

      <P>A major programme on substance abuse prevention education for second level schools has been developed by the Departments of Education and Health in conjunction with the Mater Dei Counselling Centre.  This programme was launched in October 1994.  Since then it is being disseminated to second level schools generally.  At present it is in approximately 600 second level schools.  There is associated in-service training for teachers using the programme funded by the in-career development unit of my Department. <Col N="364" /> Each training course lasts for 50 hours and, since the launch, 46 such courses have been held, including two running at present.  The process of dissemination will continue so that all of the approximately 800 second level schools have an opportunity to participate.</P>
      <P>At primary level a programme of substance abuse education has been planned and will commence during this year.  This programme will be implemented in consultation with the partners in education, and in consultation and co-operation with the Departments of Health and Justice.  It will consist of awareness raising seminars for teachers, parents and managements, the development of educational resources materials and the provision of in-service training for teachers.</P>
      <P>A pilot project called the Health Promoting School is already under way as a co-operative project between the Departments of Health and Education. This has an emphasis on substance abuse prevention as part of a wider initiative on health promotion generally. Major features are; an active involvement of parents and the wider community, the development of a supportive school climate as well as the promotion of healthy alternatives such as physical activities.  There are plans to begin the extension of this project to schools, other than the ten schools participating in the pilot project later this year.  My Department co-operates with regional health boards and voluntary groups on initiatives relating to substance abuse prevention.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting Our Education Future&rdquo; outlines policy relating to the promotion of the health and welfare of students in Chapter 13.  This includes the statement that programmes will be developed relating to tobacco, alcohol and substance misuse in general.  The initiatives I have mentioned above represent the steps being taken already to begin to implement this policy.</P>

Before additional PE halls can be included in the capital programme, the backlog of halls already planned in 1995 or under planning will have to be cleared.  Provision of PE facilities where these are not being planned at present will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for classroom accommodation has eased.</P>

      <P>Details of the amounts allocated to projects in each county in 1995 under the recreational facilities scheme is contained in the Official Report of 13 February 1996 in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 147.</P>

      <P>The deployment of Garda personnel is the responsibility of the Garda authorities. They have informed me that the Chapelizod area is policed by the gardaí attached to the Ballyfermot Garda station.  The strength at Ballyfermot station is 82 members as of 21 February 1996.  The population of the Ballyfermot district is approximately 103,000.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all members at the station are available for operational duties if required.  There is a drugs unit and crime prevention unit attached to Ballyfermot Garda station.  However, I do not propose to provide the strength of these units on the grounds of security and crime prevention generally.  I understand from the Garda authorities that a community Garda is assigned to the Chapelizod area.  He regularly carries out both foot and mobile patrols in the area.  The area is also frequently patrolled by marked and unmarked mobile units from Ballyfermot Garda station and this is augmented, when required, by the divisional task force unit based at Crumlin Garda station.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied that the present strength at Ballyfermot station is sufficient to meet the policing needs of the area.  They have assured me that the policing arrangements for the district are kept under continuous review and any adjustments considered necessary will be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, completely independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and accordingly, I am precluded from commenting on the outcome of any particular court hearing.  In relation to the imposition of sentences, <Col N="390" /> our legal system allows judges to exercise their discretion, within limits, by reference to the circumstances and evidence revealed in each case.  This is long-standing principle of our system of justice and I cannot direct the courts to rehear evidence or alter a sentence imposed.  Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1983, provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence which he considers to be unduly lenient.</P>
    <P>On 25 March 1993, the Law Reform Commission issued a consultation paper on &lsquo;Sentencing&rsquo; which sets out the commission's preliminary proposals on the topic.  The commission expects to publish its final report on &lsquo;sentencing&rsquo; in the coming months.  This report will be fully considered in my Department when it becomes available.  As to the Deputy's concerns that the convicted persons serve their full sentences, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 186.</P>

    <P>The exact times of departure and return are not shown as these details are not readily available in my Department.</P>
    <P>*It should be noted that Justice and Home Affairs are handled as two separate meetings at Council level and Ireland is one of only four EU countries that has one Minister covering both these areas.  The other eleven Member States have separate Ministers for each area.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas.  I am informed by them that the Grange-Frankfield area of Cork is policed by the gardaí at Douglas station which is approximately one mile away.  I understand that the question of allocating a community garda to the Grange-Frankfield area is currently being examined by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his Parliamentary Question No. 95 of 1 March 1995 which provides the details requested by the Deputy in respect of the years 1986 to 1995.  The following tables provide the information sought for the years 1980 to 1985 and on 31 December 1995.  I should point out that prior to 1989 Garda recruits were included in the overall strength figures. Since April 1989, with the introduction of the two year training programme for recruits, only those members who have been attested to the force, that is, completed Phase 3 of training, are included in the overall strength of the force.  At 31 December 1995 there was a total of 455 student gardaí in phases 1, 2 and 3 of training.</P>

      <P>I propose to provide the information sought as at 31 December for each year from 1979 as the figures for 1 January are not readily available.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that computerised records are not available for district strengths prior to 1992.  Accordingly, I propose to provide the information sought on a divisional basis which includes all districts in the Longford-Westmeath division for those years.  This is set out in Table A.  The information sought for the years 1992 to 1996 is set out by district in Table B.</P>

      <P>My ministerial responsibility in relation to the issue raised by the Deputy is in relation to the payment of compensation in respect of personal injuries sustained as a result of criminal actions. The Deputy will be aware of the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Justice in February 1974.  The effective date of the scheme was 1 October 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme allows for <i>ex gratia</i> compensation in respect of personal injury where the injury is directly attributable to a crime of violence, or in circumstances arising from the action of the victim in assisting or attempting to assist the prevention of crime or the saving of human life.  The scheme was revised by the then Government in January 1986 and the revised scheme was laid before <Col N="403" /> both Houses of the Oireachtas in March 1986.  Under the revised scheme, compensation is not paid in respect of pain and suffering attributable to injuries sustained on or after 1 April 1986. However, compensation continues to be paid to cover specific injuries with regard to medical costs, loss of earnings out of pocket expenses, etc.  In 1994-95 approximately £6.6 million was paid out.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Government's policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i> includes a commitment to review the criminal injuries compensation scheme, and to examine the possibility of setting up a restitution fund for victims.  The review of the scheme is under way in my Department and I expect to receive shortly a report, which will set out the options open to the Government.  Any proposals which I might have, following detailed examination of these matters, will have to be considered and approved by the Government before being announced in the normal way.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works has recently completed a detailed investigation of the existing buildings and site, to establish whether the station could be adapted or rebuilt to provide adequately for Garda needs in Clondalkin. Neither option is considered feasible and a site for a new station is, therefore, being sought.  In the meantime, further routine maintenance works to improve conditions in the present station are being considered.  Works currently in hand include replacement <Col N="404" /> of floor covering, some internal painting, replacement of some windows and upgrading heating and shower facilities.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 202 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as an integral part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force.  This scheme has proved to be a significant success with over 10,500 persons currently in receipt of the allowance.  An independent evaluation of the scheme has just been completed and the final report is expected to be with my Department shortly.  Preliminary conclusions show that the scheme is proving to be a success in encouraging the long-term unemployed to leave the live register and to return to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important aspect of the scheme is that participants are allowed to retain <Col N="418" /> their secondary benefits for the three years they are receiving the allowance provided that the combined weekly income from employment or self employment and the back to work allowance is less than £250.  No changes have been made to this aspect of the scheme.  However, my Department is aware that in a small number of cases, difficulties have arisen with regard to the retention of the medical card and discussions to try to resolve this matter are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Health.  I do not have any plans at present to allow people with income in excess of £250 weekly under the scheme to retain entitlement to secondary benefits.  The information available from the evaluation of the scheme shows that the vast majority of recipients had income below this weekly figure.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to employers' PRSI.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the higher rate of employers PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent is estimated to cost £15 million in a full year.  The reduction in the lower rate of employers' PRSI from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent is estimated to cost £16 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The increase in the employers' PRSI ceiling from £25,800 to £26,800 represents indexation and will not generate any additional yield to the social insurance fund.  The loss to the social insurance fund would have been over £7 million per annum had the ceiling not been indexed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following proposals I put forward to the Government, the Commission on the Family was established with the following terms of reference:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> to raise public awareness and improve understanding of issues affecting families;</P>
    <P>to examine the effects of legislation and policies on families and make recommendations to the Government on proposals which would strengthen the capacity of families to carry out their functions in a changing economic and social environment.  The commission would be expected to make proposals to the proposed all-party committee on the Constitution on any changes which it believes might be necessary in the constitutional provisions in relation to the family.  Proposals involving expenditure should be as far as practicable costed;</P>
    <P>to analyse recent economic and social changes affecting the position of families, taking account of relevant research already carried out, including reports of commissions for example, Social Welfare, Taxation, Status of Women &mdash; and relevant working groups &mdash; for example, expert working group on integration of taxation and social welfare, current anti-poverty strategy policy committee &mdash; and carry out limited research as necessary.</P>
    <P>The commission will also liaise with the Oireachtas Committee on the Family.</P>
    <P>The commission has been asked to make its final report to Government by June 1997 and in that report to make recommendations on how families can best be facilitated in the support and development of individual members. The commission has been asked to provide an interim report by October 1996.</P>
    <P>The provision made in the Social Welfare Vote for the Commission on the Family for 1996 is £130,000.  Of this amount, £40,000 is related to pay, and the balance of £90,000 will cover accommodation, research, printing and advertising costs.  It is too soon in the development of the commission's work to give a complete breakdown of the way in <Col N="428" /> which this allocation will be spent in 1996.  Costs arising this year mainly relate to the establishment of the commission, raising awareness about the commissions's task and inviting public participation in its work.</P>
    <P>A major programme is under way to encourage submissions to the commission. The programme involves advertising in national and provincial press, widespread distribution of information leaflets and a freefone advice desk providing guidance for those who want to make a submission.  The commission is also undertaking a special research project to assist with its work and has commissioned an expert report on the situation of families in Ireland today.  The allocation is intended to cover these and other costs arising for the commission in 1996 in pursuing its terms of reference, as well as providing for travel, subsistence and other expenses.</P>
    <P>The commission has held four meetings to date since it was appointed in October 1995.  In addition, there have been four meetings of working groups of commission members.  It is intended that much of the detailed work on different issues will initially be prepared for the commission by working groups comprising commission members with relevant expertise.  I understand that the commission intends to continue to meet regularly, at least once a month for the present, with more frequent meetings of working groups.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received representations from the Irish Hotels Federation expressing its concern and dissatisfaction at the anomalies which currently exist between approved and unapproved accommodation alleging that such anomalies not only facilitate unfair competition but lead to a deterioration in quality standards; whether he supports this contention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Irish Hotels Federation presented its views to me in relation to the unapproved accommodation sector and I have addressed the matter in detail most recently in my speech at the federation's recent annual seminar in Cork.</P>
      <P>Mandatory approval of all accommodation would not be practical nor would it necessarily improve standards to any great extent.  It could, in fact, reduce the accommodation bank available, particularly during the high season and at the cheaper end of the market, and it would certainly give rise to endless policing and prosecution problems.</P>
      <P>The best approach is to ensure that the unapproved sector does not have advantages over the approved.  At present unapproved operators do not have access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte and the Tourist Information Offices, nor do they have access to tax breaks or other subsidised finance schemes which are available to the approved sector.  The pilot tax relief scheme for the tourist resort areas and the subsidised tourism loan schemes were carefully designed so that only approved operators would be eligible.</P>
      <P>Unapproved operators, on the other hand, are obliged to comply in the same way as the approved sector with requirements, for example, in the areas of taxation, planning, fire safety and hygiene.  My Department has been impressing on the relevant enforcement agencies the need for constant vigilance to ensure that their policing or inspection practices do not discriminate between approved and unapproved sectors.</P>
      <P>The ideal solution would be to encourage the unapproved sector to become approved.  I am hopeful that following the restructuring of Bord Fáilte, the associations which have been recognised by the board for the purpose of approving the B &amp; B sector will be successful in increasing their membership.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy of maintaining low inflation, low interest rates and tight control of the public finances continues to make a significant contribution to the cost competitiveness of the tourism industry.  The industry will also benefit from further measures announced in this year's budget to reduce employment costs and the general burden of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the Government has implemented a number of schemes to assist with the cost of capital for tourism investment and development.  The operational programme for tourism, the access to finance scheme, the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas and the announcement in this year's budget to extend the business expansion <Col N="432" /> scheme for a further three years are initiatives already in place, which have a major impact in encouraging and assisting the cost of continued investment, in upgrading and expanding tourism amenities and facilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 218 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised are primarily operational matters for An Bord Tráchtála (ABT).  I am, however, aware of a number of new initiatives to identify opportunities in the Northern Ireland market that were undertaken by ABT in 1995. These were designed to assist companies identify specific opportunities and included workshops, conferences and numerous publications aimed at encouraging companies to explore and develop its potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ABT recently produced a guide to the Northern Ireland market, &ldquo;Opening the Door to New Profit&rdquo;, detailing the main areas of marketing opportunity within the North.  This publication complements the 15 &ldquo;Market Opportunity&rdquo; reports produced earlier in 1995 which act as a guide to various market sectors in Ireland, both North and South.  The reports were created in response to the <Col N="433" /> lack of basic market information, which was a serious impediment to trade development.  They provide comprehensive data, including detailed listings of purchasers in the major industrial, public sector, consumer and tourist markets.</P>
    <P>It is too early as of yet, to assess the actual impact the current breakdown of the ceasefire may have on North/South trade and it would be premature to make any predictions at this stage. Meanwhile ABT will continue to work with companies seeking out new business opportunities in the Northern Ireland market and many of the initiatives put in place during the ceasefire will continue to operate.  These include the EU Peace and Reconciliation Operational Programme for Northern Ireland and the Border counties now in place which will fully support projects both North and South.</P>
    <P>Finally, I know that ABT will be continuing in their efforts to assist southern companies to identify business opportunities in the North and will be building on the range of initiatives already in place.</P>

      <P>The Arthur D. Little appointment was a follow-up to the company's earlier detailed review of Bord Fáilte.  In November 1994 the then Minister, Deputy McCreevy, decided, and the Government agreed, to implement the recommendations of the review and to appoint a high level steering committee to oversee the implementation.  The company was engaged to advise and assist the steering committee in this implementation process.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated in response to similar Dáil questions in the past, the Minister for Justice has primary responsibility for tackling the problem of crime against tourists.  My colleague has outlined in recent weeks measures to address the problem of crime generally.  These measures will obviously impact on crime against tourists, which, it must be stressed, constitutes only a small proportion of overall crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I myself have, in the past, also referred to regular liaison which takes place between the Garda, Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests, the distribution of safety leaflets to tourists and the setting up in April 1994 of the Tourist Victim Support Service.  The service, which has my full support, has proved very successful, not only in providing practical and emotional support to tourist victims of crime, which is of course its primary objective, but also in helping to maintain a reputation as a safer and <Col N="435" /> friendly tourism destination and, indeed, in helping to counter some of the negative media coverage of the problem.  The service is also supported by the industry and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce this year substantially increased its level of financial support in recognition of the quality of this service and its value to the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I understand that a decision has been made to extend this service to other parts of the country already served by the victim support network with a view to serving the whole country within a few years.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is important that the problem of crime against tourists be kept in proportion.  The growth in crime is a worldwide phenomenon and Ireland is still, comparatively speaking, a very safe <Col N="436" /> tourist destination.  This view was borne out by the results of a consumer <i>Which</i> survey carried out last year.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a similar question by Deputy Andrews on 24 January last, in which I indicated that the Minister for the Environment was considering proposals in relation to new and improved water and sewerage services at a number of designated resort areas in the context of his Department's 1996 water and sewerage scheme programme. Questions regarding the context of this programme should be addressed to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>The regional tourism organisations were established by Bord Fáilte under section 5 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  They are structured as private companies registered under the Companies Acts, limited by guarantee with memorandum and articles of association.</P>
      <P>The memorandum for each organisation specifies that it shall operate in accordance with the policies and directions of Bord Fáilte.  The issue of all guidelines to the regional tourism organisations is therefore a day to day matter for Bord Fáilte in which I have no function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in the House last week, my Department has recently received a communication from the EU Commission in Brussels confirming that the Commission has approved grant aid, under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty, amounting to ECU 376,806 for 194 workers made redundant in 1994/95.  A number of aspects of the Commission's decision, and the conditions attached to the decision, have to be clarified by my Department before any payment can be made by the EU Commission.  My Department is in touch with the Commission and I hope that all matters will be clarified shortly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy refers to 210 workers being involved.  My Department initially applied for re-adaptation aid in respect of 205 workers in Irish Steel Ltd. as a result of the 1994 rationalisation plan. This figure was revised to 194 to take account of workers who did not actually receive redundancy payments such as apprentices, workers who terminated their employment but were not made redundant, workers scheduled for redundancy but subsequently retained and a small number of additional redundancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> As regards the employees of Irish Steel who were made redundant in 1985/86, the Deputy may wish to know that the 116 workers involved were approved for re-adaptation aid of ECU 678,000.  Thirty workers who were made redundant in 1988 and 90 workers who were made redundant in 1992 were not eligible for re-adaptation aid from the EU Commission under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty, because, I understand, the redundancies were the consequence of a rationalisation of the production range of Irish Steel Ltd. and were not the result of a permanent discontinuance, curtailment or change in activities, which at the time was necessary to qualify for re-adaptation aid from the EU under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty.</P>

      <P>The subject matter addressed in the study referred to by the Deputy is of interest to a number of Government Departments, primarily the Department of Education and also of course my own Department.  At present, the Youthreach programme which is the central focus of the evaluation is operated on the basis of a joint delivery of programmes by FÁS and the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>This study provides us with a broad ranging insight into the profiles of early school leavers, their aspirations and the benefits which the participants gained from their participation on the programme. While a range of recommendations at various levels of detail are made in relation to the programme, the overall thrust of the approach required is encapsulated in the following extract from the report:</P>
      <P>The statutory providers should adopt an unambivalent, client-centred philosophy that provides structured, integrated and clearly marked progression paths.  Fundamental to this is the necessity to:</P>
      <P>clearly define Youthreach, its purpose, boundaries etc.</P>
      <P>commit to the long-term existence of this, or an alternative, early school leavers programme</P>
      <P>ensure the integrated interaction of services at local level</P>
      <P>provide adequate counselling /guidance and literacy /numeracy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>clearly mark and define the place of Youthreach in the education/ training hierarchy <Col N="452" /> expedite the introduction of a national certification standard which will allow for broad recognition and compatibility of achievement as well as ease of mobility from one level of training to another and as between the various education and training agents</P>
    <P>clearly mark modes and paths to progression</P>
    <P>introduce a structured career path for staff so as to ensure the retention of the best possible personnel</P>
    <P>ensure the quality of provision through staff selection, induction and subsequent training.</P>
    <P>Progress has already been made in discussions between my Department and the Department of Education with a view to bringing about the necessary coherence of approach in the operation of the Youthreach programme, within a framework which continues to accommodate joint delivery between the education sector, community training workshops and FÁS, thereby enabling in particular the widest range of progression options to be available to participants.  This new approach is intended to allow for a strengthening, refocusing and reinvigoration of the programme, including more active and joint promotion of the programme among the targeted client group, measures to improve its quality at foundation and progression level and developing improved links with the State employment services, including the local employment service.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the findings of the evaluation will continue to inform the development of the programme at both the broad policy and strategic level as well as at operational level.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the establishment of three new industrial development agencies took place on 1 January 1994 in accordance with the Industrial Development Act, 1993 and as a consequence of the recommendations of the Industrial Policy Review Group (Culliton) being examined and endorsed by the Government-sponsored Moriarty Task Force.</P>
      <P>The Culliton recommendations included the proposal to set up an agency (Forbairt) with responsibility for the development of indigenous industry and a separate agency (IDA Ireland) with responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment projects to this country.  A central theme of the Culliton report was that industrial policy must go beyond a narrow focus on the interventions of the industrial development agencies and concern itself with the wider environment for enterprise.  This role is centrally assisted by Forfás.</P>
      <P>The previous Government approved the Moriarty recommendations on restructuring and introduced the necessary legislation to give effect to these recommendations.  This legislation brought about organisational change for the existing agencies and a consequential small and once-off increase in staff numbers to accommodate overhead functions in the three new agencies.  The Exchequer cost of this is estimated at £850,000 per annum.  Increased efficiencies will in time largely compensate for this additional cost.  Charges in office accommodation at both HQ and regional level gave rise to further once-off additional costs of about £500,000.</P>

      <P>There are thirty five (35) city and county enterprise boards.  All the boards were established in September/October 1993, with the exception of Galway county and city enterprise board which was established in 1992.  All of the CEBs have been incorporated as companies limited by guarantee and the status of the county enterprise initiative was confirmed by section 10 of the Industrial Development Act, 1995.  The date of incorporation of each CEB is set out in Table 1, which I am circulating in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Each board has a maximum of 14 members, with the exception of Donegal, which has been authorised to increase its membership to 15, Wicklow CEB, which has 15 and Galway CCEB, which has 17 at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of Exchequer funding provided to each county enterprise board in 1994 and 1995 for administration, indirect [non-financial] enterprise supports [1995 only] and grant payment purposes is set out in Table 2, which I am circulating in the Official Report.  The position as regards <Col N="456" /> 1996 will not become clear until the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The number of projects approved by each county enterprise board in 1993/94 and 1995 is set out in Table 3, which I am circulating in the Official Report. The position as regards 1996 will not become clear until the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Details of the value of projects approved by each county enterprise board in 1993/94 and 1995 is set out in Table 4, which I am circulating in the Official Report.  The position as regards 1996 will not become clear until the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Details of the grant payments made by each county enterprise board in 1993/94 and 1995 are set out in Table 5, which I am circulating in the Official Report.  The position as regards 1996 will not become clear until the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Total Exchequer expenditure on the county enterprise initiative for the years 1994 and 1995 amounted to £27,642,691 (which included former western development team expenses from 1 October 1993 to 31 December 1994). The Estimates provision for the CEBs for 1996 is £19.736 million to cover the running costs of the county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>In total £18,472,299 was provided in grants by the 35 CEBs in 1994 and 1995 resulting in the creation of 4,663 fulltime and 1,078 part-time jobs, according to figures supplied by the boards.  An additional sum of £1.389 million was provided to boards in 1995 to facilitate their indirect enterprise support activities.</P>
    <P>The CEBs will continue to play a key role in promoting small business growth at local level and will continue to expand their role as they deepen their co-operation with other local sectors and with State agencies in the delivery of a comprehensive range of support services in every area throughout the country.  This Government remains committed to the success of the initiative, the key to the success of which remains jobs and, in particular, the sustainability of the jobs created.  These factors will determine the success or failure of the county enterprise initiative <Col N="457" /> and will be carefully assessed and monitored.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to reinstate the pre-movement test in view of the fact that this compulsory pre-movement test is paid for by farmers themselves and is therefore of no cost to the Exchequer; if not, the alternative measures, if any, he has in mind in view of the widespread concern among farmers to retain the 60 day pre-movement test in order to prevent the spread of disease.</Quest>

      <P>The removal of the compulsory requirement that cattle must be pre-movement tested for TB <Col N="462" /> within two months of movement is included as part of an overall revamping of the disease eradication programme involving <i>inter alia</i> the develovement of additional responsibility to farmers in protecting their own herds.  Under the new arrangements, herdowners can continue to test cattle prior to movement while those buying cattle can insist on purchasing animals which have been pre-movement tested and/or can have cattle tested after purchase.  The new arrangements include measures which will encourage farmers to arrange pre and post movement tests of cattle on a voluntary basis.</P>

This supplementary measure is voluntary and in practice will not be available to all REPS participants.  The measure is designed to facilitate public access for tourist and leisure pursuits in areas which are suited to those pursuits. The measure will not apply where a right of way already exists.</P>
      <P>The measure is available to farmers participating in REPS who enter legally binding agreements with a local development organisation or comparable group and follow the conditions which are set out in my Department's agri-environmental specifications.

      <P>Where a REPS participant buys, rents, leases or inherits extra land then the REPS plan must be revised to take into account the additional land.  All lands, including the newly acquired lands, must be farmed in accordance with REPS.  There is, however, at present, no additional payment available on the additional lands.</P>
      <P>My Department recognised the desirability of facilitating payment on extra lands secured during the period of REPs participation subject to a maximum of 40 hectares.  To this end the matter has been raised with the European Commission and is among a number of issues currently being examined by the Commission's STAR Committee. I would be hopeful of a favourable outcome on this matter.  When the matter has been finalised any necessary announcement will be made.</P>

      <P>REPS payments are available on lands owned or leased for a minimum of five years up to a maximum of 40 hectares.  Under REPS, as originally devised, commonage lands held in fee simple subject to turbary rights were not regarded as eligible land.  As part of the ongoing review of REPS it has now been decided that commonages which include turbary rights can be included in the area on which payment is made.  However, REPS planning agencies are required to clearly identify the turbary area on the REPS plan, exclude this area for payment purposes and payment may be made on the applicant's share of the remaining area, subject to the other conditions to the scheme being met.</P>
      <P>An announcement to this effect will issue shortly.</P>

    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>a.  Unallocated quota:Quota in the national reserve.</P>
    <P>b.  Unused quota:&nbsp;Quota allocated less 1995 applications for premia.</P>
    <P>c.  Surplus quota: &nbsp;Unused and unallocated quota.</P>
    <P>d.  The special beef premium quota is not an individual producer quota and, accordingly, its allocation does not arise.</P>
    <P>I regret that it is not possible to give a breakdown of the national quotas for the suckler cow and ewe premia on a provincial basis within the time available. However, I will communicate with the Deputy as soon as these statistics are compiled.  As the special beef premium is not an individual producer's quota, there is no provincial breakdown of it.</P>
    <P>The under-utilisation of the suckler cow and special beef premium quotas arises from the fact that the quotas in question were based on applications for these premia in 1992 and, since the decision to introduce the quotas was <Col N="475" /> made in the middle of the year, producers availed of the opportunity to establish quotas which many did not choose to fill subsequently.</P>
    <P>Milk</P>
    <P>The national milk quota, including both deliveries and direct sales quota, is 5,245,764 tonnes.  Deliveries and direct sales exceeded this national quota in the 1994/95 milk quota year by 13,492 tonnes.  The amount of unallocated quota at 31 December 1995 amounted to 5,800 tonnes.  There is no provincial breakdown of this quota available in my Department.</P>
    <P>Sugar</P>
    <P>In the sugar sector the quota is in respect of manufactured sugar rather than sugar beet.  The annual sugar quota is&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&lsquo;A&rsquo; quota 182,000 tonnes</P>
    <P>&mdash;&lsquo;B&rsquo; quota 18,200 tonnes</P>
    <P>Total 200,200 tonnes.</P>
    <P>There was no unused or unallocated quota in the sugar sector in the 1995 crop year.  There is no information available in my Department on the provincial breakdown on the quota which is administered by Irish Sugar plc.</P>
    <P>Arable Crops</P>
    <P>Arable area payments in respect of cereals, oilseeds, protein crops and set-aside are limited to a national base area of 345,000 hectares.  The base area unused in the 1995 crop year was approximately 39,000 hectares.  There are no individual base areas and consequently there are no provincial base areas.  Within these figures for arable crops is a maximum guaranteed area of 5,000 hectares for oilseeds, of which 2,437 hectares were unused in 1995. Penalties apply if the overall base area for arable crops or the base area for oilseeds is exceeded.</P>
    <P>The area under arable crops in a given year is a reflection of the changes in land use as between arable crops, <Col N="476" /> other agricultural production and nonagricultural uses.  Such changes in land use are based mainly on commercial decisions by farmers.</P>
    <P>A maximum guaranteed quantity of 5,000 tonnes was allocated to Ireland for dried fodder under a new EU regime which commenced in the marketing year 1995/96.  There is only one processor of dried fodder in Ireland, located in County Meath.  No information is yet available on whether the maximum guaranteed quantity has been produced.  EU assistance does not apply to production in excess of that quantity.</P>

      <P>Atlantic 252 operates under the broadcasting licence currently held by RTÉ.  This was granted by the then Minister for Communications on 31 March, 1989, and will expire on 31 March, 1996.  RTÉ was subsequently informed that the current arrangement regarding Atlantic 252 would be continued until April 1999.</P>
      <P>Following the separation of functions between my own Department and that of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, my role in this matter is to issue a broadcasting transmission licence, and, in the case of RTÉ and Atlantic 252, this will be done shortly. As to the longer term use of the long wave band by Atlantic 252 following 1999, any decision by me would be made in the context of good frequency management, but would take account of the views of my colleague the Minister for Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 264 <Col N="481" /> together.  It is the Government's intention that legislation will provide that the categories of social insurance of Telecom Éireann and its employees shall be continued, as they currently stand, in any equity-based strategic alliance entered into in regard to the company.</P>
      <P>It is therefore premature to speculate on what might or might not be contained in respect of Government policy in regard to the issues raised until legislation is published.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to be exact about the numbers of such stations in operation, since they are transient by nature, tend to move about on the frequency bands and often change their names.  In the Dublin area I believe that there are about six such stations currently in operation.  Some others operate only at weekends.  There are, in addition, a number of other frequencies that are being misused, for example, with continuous music being broadcast or perhaps a carrier wave on the frequency.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated, my position regarding the operation of illegal pirate radio stations is that the full provisions of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Acts will be invoked against such stations in any situation where the circumstances allow, and those involved in illegal broadcasting, including businesses and people advertising on, or providing services to, illegal stations, should have no doubt that action may be taken against them at any time.  My Department will keep this matter under careful review and efforts will be intensified as the need is identified.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has responsibility for monitoring the levels of radioactivity in the environment, which includes the measurement and detection of radon gas.  In 1992, the Institute initiated a national radon survey which will be completed in 1998.  Radon measurements will be made in over 6,000 homes nationwide and a statistical evaluation of the results will allow the percentage of houses above the 200 bequerels per metre squared reference level to be predicted. Total expenditure by the Institute on the radon programme amounted to £127,000 in 1995 and £155,000 in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the national survey of radon in houses has been carried out in counties Dublin, Wicklow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Cavan, Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and Donegal.  In 1995 detectors were issued to counties Westmeath, Offaly, <Col N="483" /> Laois and Kildare and to counties Carlow and Wexford in 1996.</P>

      <P>The voluntary early retirement scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force will come into operation during 1996.  Applications for the scheme will be accepted later this year.  The terms of the scheme, which have yet to be decided by Government, will be commensurate with those offered in other areas of the public service when account is taken of the many unique features of the Defence Forces superannuation arrangements and in particular the entitlement to gratuity and pension at ages as young as 29 in the case of <Col N="486" /> officers and 38 years of age in the case of enlisted personnel.  The scheme is likely to be targeted at older members of the Permanent Defence Force.  Personnel who are graded as Medical Category &ldquo;C&rdquo; will also be given the option of availing of it.</P>
      <P>I do not forsee a great deal of difficulty with the scheme once the terms as decided by Government have been published. There will be further consultation with the representative associations in the coming weeks as the details of the terms are discussed again with them.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he will address the situation where urgently required funding for coastal protection for the seven priority projects is needed, particularly as Donegal, a leading tourist county, received no funding in 1995.</Quest>

      <P>To date no grant-aid has been provided to Donegal County Council under the coastal protection sub-programme of the environmental services operational programme 1994-99.  The funding available is limited to £5.1 million over the life of the programme.  Demand levels, <Col N="487" /> on the other hand, exceed £25 million. In these circumstances the coastal local authorities have been advised that it will not be possible to aid all of the priority proposals submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, Donegal County Council's proposals have not been grant-aided to date but the process of addressing priority works is ongoing.  All locations identified by the local authorities, including Donegal County Council, will be considered over the period of the operational programme.  The fact that no works have been aided so far in County Donegal does not mean that <Col N="488" /> works will not be aided between now and 1999.</P>
